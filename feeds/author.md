We present a methodology for modeling and removing light from cluster galaxies and intracluster light (ICL) from James\ Webb\ Space\ Telescope (JWST) images of gravitational lensing clusters. We apply our method to Webb's First Deep Field the SMACS 0723 Early Release Observations and use the ICL subtracted images to select a sample of globular clusters (GCs) and dwarf galaxies within the cluster. We compare the spatial distributions of these two samples with our models of the galaxy and ICL light, finding significant similarity. Specifically we find that GCs trace the diffuse ICL, while dwarf galaxies are centrally concentrated near the cluster center We quantify the relationship between the surface density of compact sources and total cluster light, demonstrating a significant, tight correlation. We repeat our methodology and compare distributions of GCs with dark matter surface density and find a comparable result. Our findings suggest a common origin for GCs and diffuse ICL, with stripping from massive galaxies as they merge with the cluster being a plausible scenario.

### 2) [2312.03065](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03065v1): Deciphering the JWST spectrum of a 'little red dot' at z ~ 4.53: An obscured AGN and its star-forming host

<p>
JWST has revealed a class of numerous, extremely compact sources, with rest-frame red optical/near-infrared (NIR) and blue ultraviolet (UV) colours, nicknamed "little red dots". We present one of the highest signal-to-noise ratio JWST NIRSpec/PRISM spectra of a little red dot, J0647_1045 at z = 4.5321 \pm 0.0001, and examine its NIRCam morphology, to differentiate the origin of the UV and optical/NIR emission, and elucidate the nature of the little red dot phenomenon. J0647_1045 is unresolved (r_e &lt; 0.17 kpc) in the three NIRCam long-wavelength filters, but significantly extended (r_e = 0.45 \pm 0.06 kpc) in the three short-wavelength filters, indicating a red compact source in a blue star-forming galaxy. The spectral continuum shows a clear change in slope, from blue in the optical/UV, to red in the restframe optical/NIR, consistent with two distinct components, fit by power-laws with different attenuation: A_V = 0.54 \pm 0.01 (UV) and A_V = 5.7 \pm 0.2 (optical/NIR). Fitting the H\alpha line requires both broad (full width at half-maximum ~ 4300 \pm 300 km s^{-1}) and narrow components, but none of the other emission lines, including H\beta, show evidence of broadness. We calculate A_V = 1.1 \pm 0.2 from the Balmer decrement using narrow H\alpha and H\beta, and A_V &gt; 4.1 \pm 0.2 from broad H\alpha and upper limit on broad H\beta, consistent with the blue and red continuum attenuation respectively. Based on single-epoch H\alpha linewidth, the mass of the central black hole is 8 \pm 1 \times 10^8 M_\odot. Our findings are consistent with a multi-component model, where the optical/NIR and broad lines arise from a highly obscured, spatially unresolved region, likely a relatively massive active galactic nucleus, while the less obscured UV continuum and narrow lines arise, at least partly, from a small but spatially resolved star-forming host galaxy.

### 3) [2312.01932](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01932v1): Early results from GLASS-JWST. XXVII. The mass-metallicity relation in lensed field galaxies at cosmic noon with NIRISS

<p>
We present a measurement of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) at cosmic noon, using the JWST near-infrared wide-field slitless spectroscopy obtained by the GLASS-JWST Early Release Science program. By combining the power of JWST and the lensing magnification by the foreground cluster A2744, we extend the measurements of the MZR to the dwarf mass regime at high redshifts. A sample of 50 galaxies with several emission lines is identified across two wide redshift ranges of z=1.8-2.3 and 2.6-3.4 in the stellar mass range of \log{(M_*/M_\odot)}\in [6.9, 10.0]. The observed slope of MZR is 0.223 \pm 0.017 and 0.294 \pm 0.010 at these two redshift ranges, respectively, consistent with the slopes measured in field galaxies with higher masses. In addition, we assess the impact of the morphological broadening on emission line measurement by comparing two methods of using 2D forward modeling and line profile fitting to 1D extracted spectra. We show that ignoring the morphological broadening effect when deriving line fluxes from grism spectra results in a systematic reduction of flux by ~30&percnt; on average. This discrepancy appears to affect all the lines and thus does not lead to significant changes in flux ratio and metallicity measurements. This assessment of the morphological broadening effect using JWST data presents, for the first time, an important guideline for future work deriving galaxy line fluxes from wide-field slitless spectroscopy, such as Euclid, Roman, and the Chinese Space Station Telescope.

With the remarkable sensitivity and resolution of JWST in the infrared, measuring rest-optical kinematics of galaxies at z&gt;5 has become possible for the first time. This study pilots a new method for measuring galaxy dynamics for highly multiplexed, unbiased samples by combining FRESCO NIRCam grism spectroscopy and JADES medium-band imaging. Here we present one of the first JWST kinematic measurements for a galaxy at z&gt;5. We find a significant velocity gradient, which, if interpreted as rotation yields V_{rot} = 240\pm50km/s and we hence refer to this galaxy as Twister-z5. With a rest-frame optical effective radius of r_e=2.25kpc, the high rotation velocity in this galaxy is not due to a compact size as may be expected in the early universe but rather a high total mass, {\rm log(M}_{dyn}/{\rm M}_\odot)=11.0\pm0.2. This is a factor of roughly 4x higher than the stellar mass within the effective radius. We also observe that the radial H\alpha equivalent width profile and the specific star formation rate map from resolved stellar population modeling is centrally depressed by a factor of ~1.5 from the center to r_e. Combined with the morphology of the line-emitting gas in comparison to the continuum, this centrally suppressed star formation is consistent with a star-forming disk surrounding a bulge growing inside-out. While large, rapidly rotating disks are common to z~2, the existence of one after only 1Gyr of cosmic time, shown for the first time in ionized gas, adds to the growing evidence that some galaxies matured earlier than expected in the history of the universe.

<p>
The era of the James Webb Space Telescope ushers stellar population models into uncharted territories, particularly at the high-redshift frontier. In a companion paper, we apply the \texttt{Prospector} Bayesian framework to jointly infer galaxy redshifts and stellar population properties from broad-band photometry as part of the UNCOVER survey. Here we present a comprehensive error budget in spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling. Using a sample selected to have photometric redshifts higher than 9, we quantify the systematic shifts stemming from various model choices in inferred stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and age. These choices encompass different timescales for changes in the star formation history (SFH), non-universal stellar initial mass functions (IMF), and the inclusion of variable nebular abundances, gas density and ionizing photon budget. We find that the IMF exerts the strongest influence on the inferred properties: the systematic uncertainties can be as much as 1 dex, 2--5 times larger than the formal reported uncertainties in mass and SFR; and importantly, exceed the scatter seen when using different SED fitting codes. Although the assumptions on the lower end of the IMF induce degeneracy, our findings suggest that a common practice in the literature of assessing uncertainties in SED-fitting processes by comparing multiple codes is substantively underestimating the true systematic uncertainty. Highly stochastic SFHs change the inferred SFH by much larger than the formal uncertainties, and introduce ~ 0.8 dex systematics in SFR averaged over short time scale and ~ 0.3 dex systematics in average age. Finally, employing a flexible nebular emission model causes ~ 0.2 dex systematic increase in mass and SFR, comparable to the formal uncertainty. This paper constitutes an initial step toward a complete uncertainty estimate in SED modeling.

<p>
With the wavelength coverage, sensitivity, and high spatial resolution of JWST, it is now possible to peer through the dust attenuation to probe the rest-frame near infrared (NIR) and stellar structures of extremely dusty galaxies at cosmic noon (z~1-3). In this paper we leverage the combined ALMA and JWST/HST coverage in Abell 2744 to study the multiwavelength (0.5-4.4um) structures of 11 sub-millimeter (sub-mm) detected galaxies at z~0.9-3.5 that are fainter than bright "classical" sub-mm galaxies (SMGs). While these objects reveal a diversity of structures and sizes, all exhibit decreasing sizes and increasing central concentration towards longer wavelengths. The smaller sizes of these objects at long wavelengths indicate that their stellar mass profiles are more compact than their optical light profiles, likely due to centrally-concentrated dust obscuration. Further, we find that galaxies with higher central concentration values tend to have more extreme size ratios (comparing the rest-frame NIR to rest-frame optical); this suggests that the galaxies with the most compact light distributions also have the most concentrated dust distributions. We also find the galaxies with the most extreme size ratios do not have elevated 1.2mm flux densities compared to the rest of our sample: we argue this means compact dust geometry, rather than e.g. high total dust quantity, drives the most extreme observed rest-frame NIR-to-optical size ratios. Upcoming higher resolution 1.2mm ALMA imaging will facilitate joint spatially-resolved analysis and will directly test the dust distributions within this representative sub-mm population.

<p>
We use CANUCS JWST/NIRCam imaging of galaxies behind the gravitationally-lensing cluster MACS J0417.5-1154 to investigate star formation burstiness in low-mass (M_\star~10^8\ M_\odot) galaxies at z~4.7-6.5. Our sample of 123 galaxies is selected using the Lyman break selection and photometric emission-line excess methods. Sixty per cent of the 123 galaxies in this sample have H\alpha-to-UV flux ratios that deviate significantly from the range of \eta_{1500} values consistent with smooth and steady star formation histories. This large fraction indicates that the majority of low-mass galaxies is experiencing bursty star formation histories at high redshift. We also searched for interacting galaxies in our sample and found that they are remarkably common (~40 per cent of the sample). Compared to non-interacting galaxies, interacting galaxies are more likely to have very low H\alpha-to-UV ratios, suggesting that galaxy-galaxy interactions enhance star formation burstiness and enable faster quenching (with timescales of \lesssim100 Myr) that follows the rapid rise of star formation activity. Given the high frequency of galaxy-galaxy interactions and the rapid SFR fluctuations they appear to cause, we conclude that galaxy-galaxy interactions could be a leading cause of bursty star formation in low-mass, high-z galaxies. They could thus play a significant role in the evolution of the galaxy population at early cosmological times.

<p>
We present a study of the mid-IR (MIR) emission of quiescent galaxies (QGs) beyond the local universe. Using deep JWST imaging in the SMACS-0723 cluster field we identify a mass limited (M_{*} &gt;10^{9}M_{\odot}) sample of intermediate redshift QGs (0.2&lt;z&lt;0.7) and perform modeling of their rest-frame UV to MIR photometry. We find that QGs exhibit a range of MIR spectra that are composed of a stellar continuum and a dust component that is 1-2 orders of magnitude fainter to that of star-forming galaxies. The observed scatter in the MIR spectra, especially at \lambda_{\rm rest} &gt; 5 &mu;m, can be attributed to different dust continuum levels and/or the presence of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) features. The latter would indicate enhanced 11.3- and 12.7 &mu;m PAHs strengths with respect to those at 6.2- and 7.7 &mu;m, consistent with the observed spectra of local ellipticals and indicative of soft radiation fields. Finally, we augment the average UV-to-MIR spectrum of the population with cold dust and gas emission in the far-IR/mm and construct a panchromatic UV-to-radio SED that can serve as a template for the future exploration of the interstellar medium of z&gt;0 QGs with ALMA and JWST.

### 9) [2309.07969](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07969v1): A massive compact quiescent galaxy at z=2 with a complete Einstein ring in JWST imaging

<p> Pieter van Dokkum, Gabriel Brammer, Bingjie Wang, Joel Leja, Charlie Conroy </p>
<p>
One of the surprising results from HST was the discovery that many of the most massive galaxies at z~2 are very compact, having half-light radii of only 1-2 kpc. The interpretation is that massive galaxies formed inside-out, with their cores largely in place by z~2 and approximately half of their present-day mass added later through minor mergers. Here we present a compact, massive, quiescent galaxy at z_{\rm phot}=1.94^{+0.13}_{-0.17} with a complete Einstein ring. The ring was found in the JWST COSMOS-Web survey and is produced by a background galaxy at z_{\rm phot}=2.98^{+0.42}_{-0.47}. Its 1.54" diameter provides a direct measurement of the mass of the "pristine" core of a massive galaxy, observed before mixing and dilution of its stellar population during the 10 Gyr of galaxy evolution between z=2 and z=0. We find a mass of M_{\rm lens}=6.5^{+3.7}_{-1.5} \times 10^{11} Msun within a radius of 6.6 kpc. The stellar mass within the same radius is M_{\rm stars}= 1.1^{+0.2}_{-0.3} \times 10^{11} Msun for a Chabrier initial mass function (IMF), and the fiducial dark matter mass is M_{\rm dm} = 2.6^{+1.6}_{-0.7} \times 10^{11} Msun. Additional mass is needed to explain the lensing results, either in the form of a higher-than-expected dark matter density or a bottom-heavy IMF.

<p>
We present the survey design and initial results of the ALMA Cycle 9 program of DUALZ, which aims to establish a joint ALMA and JWST public legacy field targeting the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744. DUALZ features a contiguous 4'\times6' ALMA 30-GHz-wide mosaic in Band 6, covering areas of &mu;&gt;2 down to a sensitivity of \sigma=32.7~&mu;Jy. Through a blind search, we identified 69 dust continuum sources at S/N \gtrsim5.0 with median redshift and intrinsic 1.2-mm flux of z=2.30 and S_{\rm 1.2mm}^{\rm int}=0.24~mJy. Of these, 27 have been spectroscopically confirmed, leveraged by the latest NIRSpec observations, while photometric redshift estimates are constrained by the comprehensive HST, NIRCam, and ALMA data for the remaining sources. With priors, we further identify a [CII]158 &mu;m line emitter at z=6.3254\pm0.0004, confirmed by the latest NIRSpec spectroscopy. The NIRCam counterparts of the 1.2-mm continuum exhibit undisturbed morphologies, denoted either by disk or spheroid, implying the triggers for the faint mm emission are less catastrophic than mergers. We have identified 8 HST-dark galaxies (F150W&gt;27mag, F150W-F444W&gt;2.3) and 2 JWST-dark (F444W&gt;30mag) galaxy candidates among the ALMA continuum sources. The former includes face-on disk galaxies, hinting that substantial dust obscuration does not always result from inclination. We also detect a marginal dust emission from an X-ray-detected galaxy at z_{\rm spec}=10.07, suggesting an active co-evolution of the central black hole and its host. We assess the infrared luminosity function up to z~10 and find it consistent with predictions from galaxy formation models. To foster diverse scientific outcomes from the community, we publicly release reduced ALMA mosaic maps, cubes, and the source catalog.

<p>
JWST is revealing a new population of dust-reddened broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) at redshifts z\gtrsim5. Here we present deep NIRSpec/Prism spectroscopy from the Cycle 1 Treasury program UNCOVER of 15 AGN candidates selected to be compact, with red continua in the rest-frame optical but with blue slopes in the UV. From NIRCam photometry alone, they could have been dominated by dusty star formation or AGN. Here we show that the majority of the compact red sources in UNCOVER are dust-reddened AGN: 60&percnt; show definitive evidence for broad-line H\alpha with FWHM\, &gt;2000 km/s, for 20&percnt; current data are inconclusive, and 20&percnt; are brown dwarf stars. We propose an updated photometric criterion to select red z&gt;5 AGN that excludes brown dwarfs and is expected to yield &gt;80&percnt; AGN. Remarkably, among all z_{\rm phot}&gt;5 galaxies with F277W-F444W&gt;1 in UNCOVER at least 33&percnt; are AGN regardless of compactness, climbing to at least 80&percnt; AGN for sources with F277W-F444W&gt;1.6. The confirmed AGN have black hole masses of 10^7-10^9 M_{\odot}. While their UV-luminosities (-16&gt;M_{\rm UV}&gt;-20 AB mag) are low compared to UV-selected AGN at these epochs, consistent with percent-level scattered AGN light or low levels of unobscured star formation, the inferred bolometric luminosities are typical of 10^7-10^9 M_{\odot} black holes radiating at ~ 10-40&percnt; of Eddington. The number densities are surprisingly high at ~10^{-5} Mpc^{-3} mag^{-1}, 100 times more common than the faintest UV-selected quasars, while accounting for ~1&percnt; of the UV-selected galaxies. While their UV-faintness suggest they may not contribute strongly to reionization, their ubiquity poses challenges to models of black hole growth.

We present measurements of stellar populations properties of a z = 9.1 gravitationally lensed galaxy MACS1149-JD1 using deep JWST NIRISS slitless spectroscopy as well as NIRISS and NIRCam imaging from the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). The galaxy is split into four components. Three magnified ({&mu;} ~ 17) star-forming components are unresolved, giving intrinsic sizes of &lt; 50pc. In addition, the underlying extended component contains the bulk of the stellar mass, formed the majority of its stars ~ 50Myr earlier than the other three components and is not the site of the most active star formation currently. The NIRISS and NIRCam resolved photometry does not confirm a strong Balmer break previously seen in Spitzer. The NIRISS grism spectrum has been extracted for the entire galaxy and shows a clear continuum and Lyman-break, with no Lyman-{\alpha} detected.

Deep observations with JWST have revealed an emerging population of red point-like sources that could provide a link between the postulated supermassive black hole seeds and observed quasars. In this work we present a JWST/NIRSpec spectrum from the JWST Cycle 1 UNCOVER Treasury survey, of a massive accreting black hole at z=8.50, displaying a clear broad-line component as inferred from the H\beta line with FWHM = 3439\pm413 km s^{-1}, typical of the broad line region of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The AGN nature of this object is further supported by high ionization, as inferred from emission lines, and a point-source morphology. We compute the black hole mass of log_{10}(M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot)=8.17\pm0.42, and a bolometric luminosity of L_{\rm bol}~6.6\times10^{45} erg s^{-1}. These values imply that our object is accreting at ~ 40&percnt; of the Eddington limit. Detailed modeling of the spectral energy distribution in the optical and near-infrared, together with constraints from ALMA, indicate an upper limit on the stellar mass of log_{10}(M_{\rm *}/M_\odot)&lt;8.7, which would lead to an unprecedented ratio of black hole to host mass of at least ~ 30 &percnt;. This is orders of magnitude higher compared to the local QSOs, but is consistent with recent AGN studies at high redshift with JWST. This finding suggests that a non-negligible fraction of supermassive black holes either started out from massive seeds and/or grew at a super-Eddington rate at high redshift. Given the predicted number densities of high-z faint AGN, future NIRSpec observations of larger samples will allow us to further investigate the galaxy-black hole co-evolution in the early Universe.

### 14) [2308.11392](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11392v1): Rest-Frame Near-Infrared Radial Light Profiles up to z=3 from JWST/NIRCam: Wavelength Dependence of the Sérsic Index

<p>
We examine the wavelength dependence of radial light profiles based on S\'ersic index n measurements of 1067 galaxies with M_*\geq 10^{9.5}M_\odot and in the redshift range 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 3. The sample and rest-frame optical light profiles are drawn from CANDELS+3D-HST; rest-frame near-infrared light profiles are inferred from CEERS JWST/NIRCam imaging. n shows only weak dependence on wavelength, regardless of redshift, galaxy mass and type: on average, star-forming galaxies have n = 1-1.5 and quiescent galaxies have n = 3-4 in the rest-frame optical and near-infrared. The strong correlation at all wavelengths between n and star-formation activity implies a physical connection between the radial stellar mass profile and star-formation activity. The main caveat is that the current sample is too small to discern trends for the most massive galaxies (M_* &gt; 10^{11}M_\odot).

### 15) [2308.03745](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03745v3): UNCOVER: Illuminating the Early Universe -- JWST/NIRSpec Confirmation of z &gt; 12 Galaxies

<p>
Observations of high-redshift galaxies provide a critical direct test to the theories of early galaxy formation, yet to date, only three have been spectroscopically confirmed at z&gt;12. Due to strong gravitational lensing over a wide area, the galaxy cluster field A2744 is ideal for searching for the earliest galaxies. Here we present JWST/NIRSpec observations of two galaxies: a robust detection at z_{\rm spec} = 12.393^{+0.004}_{-0.001}, and a plausible candidate at z_{\rm spec} = 13.079^{+0.013}_{-0.001}. The galaxies are discovered in JWST/NIRCam imaging and their distances are inferred with JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy, all from the JWST Cycle 1 UNCOVER Treasury survey. Detailed stellar population modeling using JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec data corroborates the primeval characteristics of these galaxies: low mass (~ 10^8~{\rm M_\odot}), young, rapidly-assembling, metal-poor, and star-forming. Interestingly, both galaxies are spatially resolved, having lensing-corrected rest-UV effective radii on the order of 300-400 pc, which are notably larger than other spectroscopically confirmed systems at similar redshifts. The observed dynamic range of z \gtrsim 10 sizes spans over 1 order of magnitude, implying a significant scatter in the size-mass relation at early times. Deep into the epoch of reionization, these discoveries elucidate the emergence of the first galaxies.

### 16) [2308.02750](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02750v3): UNCOVER: The growth of the first massive black holes from JWST/NIRSpec -- spectroscopic redshift confirmation of an X-ray luminous AGN at z=10.1

<p> Andy D. Goulding, Jenny E. Greene, David J. Setton, Ivo Labbe, Rachel Bezanson, Tim B. Miller, Hakim Atek, Akos Bogdan, Gabriel Brammer, Iryna Chemerynska, Sam E. Cutler, Pratika Dayal, Yoshinobu Fudamoto, Seiji Fujimoto, Lukas J. Furtak, Vasily Kokorev, Gourav Khullar, Joel Leja, Danilo Marchesini, Priyamvada Natarajan, Erica Nelson, Pascal A.

<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope is now detecting early black holes (BHs) as they transition from "seeds" to supermassive BHs. Recently Bogdan et al. (2023) reported the detection of an X-ray luminous supermassive BH, UHZ-1, with a photometric redshift at z &gt; 10. Such an extreme source at this very high redshift provides new insights on seeding and growth models for BHs given the short time available for formation and growth. Harnessing the exquisite sensitivity of JWST/NIRSpec, here we report the spectroscopic confirmation of UHZ-1 at z = 10.073 \pm 0.002. We find that the NIRSpec/Prism spectrum is typical of recently discovered z~10 galaxies, characterized primarily by star-formation features. We see no clear evidence of the powerful X-ray source in the rest-frame UV/optical spectrum, which may suggest heavy obscuration of the central BH, in line with the Compton-thick column density measured in the X-rays. We perform a stellar population fit simultaneously to the new NIRSpec spectroscopy and previously available photometry. The fit yields a stellar mass estimate for the host galaxy that is significantly better constrained than prior photometric estimates (M_*~ 1.4^{+0.3}_{-0.4} \times 10^8 M_\odot). Given the predicted BH mass (M_{\rm BH}~10^7-10^8 M_\odot), the resulting ratio of M_{\rm BH}/M_* remains two to three orders of magnitude higher than local values, thus lending support to the heavy seeding channel for the formation of supermassive BHs within the first billion years of cosmic evolution.

We present JWST/NIRSpec observations of a highly magnified star candidate at a photometric redshift of z_{\mathrm{phot}}~eq4.8, previously detected in JWST/NIRCam imaging of the strong lensing (SL) cluster MACS J0647+7015 (z=0.591). The spectroscopic observation allows us to precisely measure the redshift of the host arc at z_{\mathrm{spec}}=4.758\pm0.004, and the star's spectrum displays clear Lyman- and Balmer-breaks commensurate with this redshift. A fit to the spectrum suggests a B-type super-giant star of surface temperature T_{\mathrm{eff,B}}~eq15000 K with either a redder F-type companion (T_{\mathrm{eff,F}}~eq6250K) or significant dust attenuation (A_V~eq0.82) along the line of sight. We also investigate the possibility that this object is a magnified young globular cluster rather than a single star. We show that the spectrum is in principle consistent with a star cluster, which could also accommodate the lack of flux variability between the two epochs. However, the lack of a counter image and the strong upper limit on the size of the object from lensing symmetry, r\lesssim0.5 pc, could indicate that this scenario is somewhat less likely -- albeit not completely ruled out by the current data. The presented spectrum seen at a time when the Universe was only ~1.2 Gyr old showcases the ability of JWST to study early stars through extreme lensing.

### 18) [2307.06994](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06994v2): Size - Stellar Mass Relation and Morphology of Quiescent Galaxies at z\geq3 in Public JWST Fields

<p>
We present the results of a systematic study of the rest-frame optical morphology of quiescent galaxies at z \geq 3 using the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) onboard JWST. Based on a sample selected by UVJ color or NUVUVJ color, we focus on 26 quiescent galaxies with 9.8&lt;\log{(M_\star/M_\odot)}&lt;11.4 at 2.8&lt;z_{\rm phot}&lt;4.6 with publicly available JWST data. Their sizes are constrained by fitting the S\'ersic profile to all available NIRCam images. We see a negative correlation between the observed wavelength and the size in our sample and derive their size at the rest-frame 0.5\, {\rm &mu; m} taking into account this trend. Our quiescent galaxies show a significant correlation between the rest-frame 0.5\, {\rm &mu; m} size and the stellar mass at z\geq3. The analytical fit for them at \log{(M_\star/M_\odot)}&gt;10.3 implies that our size - stellar mass relations are below those at lower redshifts, with the amplitude of ~0.6\, {\rm kpc} at M_\star = 5\times 10^{10}\, M_\odot. This value agrees with the extrapolation from the size evolution of quiescent galaxies at z&lt;3 in the literature, implying that the size of quiescent galaxies increases monotonically from z~3-5. Our sample is mainly composed of galaxies with bulge-like structures according to their median S\'ersic index and axis ratio of n~3-4 and q~0.6-0.8, respectively. On the other hand, there is a trend of increasing fraction of galaxies with low S\'ersic index, suggesting 3&lt;z&lt;5 might be the epoch of onset of morphological transformation with a fraction of very notable disky quenched galaxies.

### 19) [2307.04234](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04234v2): Extreme N-emitters at high-redshift: signatures of supermassive stars and globular cluster or black hole formation in action?

<p>
[Abridged] Using the JWST/NIRSpec observations from CEERS we found an extreme N-emitter, CEERS-1019 at z=8.6782 showing intense NIV and NIII emission. From the observed rest-UV and optical lines we conclude that it is compatible with photoionization from stars and we determine accurate abundances for C, N, O, and Ne, relative to H, finding a highly supersolar ratio log(N/O) = -0.18+/-0.11, and normal log(C/O) = -0.75+/-0.11 and log(Ne/O) = -0.63+/-0.07, for its low metallicity, 12+log(O/H)= 7.70+/-0.18. We also analyze other N-emitters from the literature. All show strongly enhanced N/O ratios and two of them normal C/O. Massive star ejecta from WR stars are needed to explain the galaxies with enhanced C/O (Lynx arc and Mrk 996). On the other hand, supermassive stars (&gt;1000 Msun, SMS) in the ``conveyer-belt model'' put forward to explain globular clusters (GCs), predict a high N/O and small changes in C/O, compatible with CEERS-1019, the Sunburst cluster, SMACS2031, and GN-z11. Based on the chemical abundances, possible enrichment scenarios, compactness, and high ISM density, we suggest that CEERS-1019, SMACS2031, and the Sunburst cluster could contain proto-GCs. Finally, we propose that some N-emitters enriched by SMS could also have formed intermediate-mass black holes, and we suggest that this might be the case for GN-z11. Our observations and analysis reinforce the suggested link between some N-emitters and proto-GC formation, which is supported both by empirical evidence and quantitative models. Furthermore, the observations provide possible evidence for the presence of supermassive stars in the early Universe (z&gt;8) and at z~2-3. Our analysis also suggests that the origin and nature of the N-emitters is diverse, including also objects like GN-z11 which possibly host an AGN.

<p>
We use CEERS JWST/NIRCam imaging to measure rest-frame near-IR light profiles of &gt;500 M_\star&gt;10^{10}~M_\odot galaxies in the redshift range 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.3. We compare the resulting rest-frame 1.5-2&mu;m half-light radii (R_{\rm{NIR}}) with stellar half-mass radii (\rmass) derived with multi-color light profiles from CANDELS HST imaging. In general agreement with previous work, we find that R_{\rm{NIR}} and \rmass~are up to 40&percnt;~smaller than the rest-frame optical half-light radius R_{\rm{opt}}. The agreement between R_{\rm{NIR}} and \rmass~is excellent, with negligible systematic offset (&lt;0.03 dex) up to z=2 for quiescent galaxies and up to z=1.5 for star-forming galaxies. We also deproject the profiles to estimate \rmassd, the radius of a sphere containing 50&percnt; of the stellar mass. We present the R-M_\star distribution of galaxies at 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.5, comparing R_{\rm{opt}}, \rmass~and \rmassd. The slope is significantly flatter for \rmass~and \rmassd~ compared to R_{\rm{opt}}, mostly due to downward shifts in size for massive star-forming galaxies, while \rmass~and \rmassd~do not show markedly different trends. Finally, we show rapid size evolution (R\propto (1+z)^{-1.7\pm0.1}) for massive (M_\star&gt;10^{11}~M_\odot) quiescent galaxies between z=0.5 and z=2.3, again comparing R_{\rm{opt}}, \rmass~and \rmassd. We conclude that the main tenets of the size evolution narrative established over the past 20 years, based on rest-frame optical light profile analysis, still hold in the era of JWST/NIRCam observations in the rest-frame near-IR.

The mergers of binary compact objects such as neutron stars and black holes are of central interest to several areas of astrophysics, including as the progenitors of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), sources of high-frequency gravitational waves and likely production sites for heavy element nucleosynthesis via rapid neutron capture (the r-process). These heavy elements include some of great geophysical, biological and cultural importance, such as thorium, iodine and gold. Here we present observations of the exceptionally bright gamma-ray burst GRB 230307A. We show that GRB 230307A belongs to the class of long-duration gamma-ray bursts associated with compact object mergers, and contains a kilonova similar to AT2017gfo, associated with the gravitational-wave merger GW170817. We obtained James Webb Space Telescope mid-infrared (mid-IR) imaging and spectroscopy 29 and 61 days after the burst. The spectroscopy shows an emission line at 2.15 microns which we interpret as tellurium (atomic mass A=130), and a very red source, emitting most of its light in the mid-IR due to the production of lanthanides. These observations demonstrate that nucleosynthesis in GRBs can create r-process elements across a broad atomic mass range and play a central role in heavy element nucleosynthesis across the Universe.

We report ALMA detections of [CII] and dust continuum in Az9, a multiply-imaged galaxy behind the Frontier Field cluster MACSJ0717.5+3745. The bright [CII] emission line provides a spectroscopic redshift of z = 4.274. This strongly lensed (mu = 7 +/- 1) galaxy has an intrinsic stellar mass of only 2e9 Msun and a total star formation rate of 26 Msun/yr (~80% of which is dust obscured). Using public magnification maps, we reconstruct the [CII] emission in the source plane to reveal a stable, rotation-dominated disk with V/sigma = 5.3, which is &gt; 2x higher than predicted from simulations for similarly high-redshift, low-mass galaxies. In the source plane, the [CII] disk has a half-light radius of 1.8 kpc and, along with the dust, is spatially offset from the peak of the stellar light by 1.4 kpc. Az9 is not deficient in [CII]; L[CII]/LIR = 0.0027 consistent with local and high redshift normal star forming galaxies. While dust-obscured star formation is expected to dominate in higher mass galaxies, such a large reservoir of dust and gas in a lower mass disk galaxy 1.4 Gyr after the Big Bang challenges our picture of early galaxy evolution. Furthermore, the prevalence of such low-mass dusty galaxies has important implications for the selection of the highest redshift dropout galaxies with JWST. As one of the lowest stellar mass galaxies at z &gt; 4 to be detected in dust continuum and [CII], Az9 is an excellent laboratory in which to study early dust enrichment in the interstellar medium.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revolutionizing our knowledge of z&gt;5 galaxies and their actively accreting black holes. Using the JWST Cycle 1 Treasury program Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) in the lensing field Abell 2744, we report the identification of a sample of little red dots at 3 &lt; z_{\rm{phot}} &lt; 7 that likely contain highly-reddened accreting supermassive black holes. Using a NIRCam-only selection to F444W&lt;27.7 mag, we find 26 sources over the ~45 arcmin^{2} field that are blue in F115W-F200W~0 (or \beta_{\rm UV}~-2.0 for f_{\lambda} \propto \lambda^\beta), red in F200W-F444W = 1-4 (\beta_{\rm opt} ~ +2.0), and are dominated by a point-source like central component. Of the 20 sources with deep ALMA 1.2-mm coverage, none are detected individually or in a stack. For the majority of the sample, SED fits to the JWST+ALMA observations prefer models with hot dust rather than obscured star-formation to reproduce the red NIRCam colors and ALMA 1.2-mm non-detections. While compact dusty star formation can not be ruled out, the combination of extremely small sizes (\langle r_e \rangle\approx50 pc after correction for magnification), red rest-frame optical slopes, and hot dust can by explained by reddened broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our targets have faint M_{\rm 1450} \approx -14\ \, {\rm to} -18 mag but inferred bolometric luminosities of L_{\rm bol} = 10^{43}-10^{46} erg/s, reflecting their obscured nature. If the candidates are confirmed as AGNs with upcoming UNCOVER spectroscopy, then we have found an abundant population of reddened luminous AGN that are at least ten times more numerous than UV-luminous AGN at the same intrinsic bolometric luminosity.

Characterising the prevalence and properties of faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early Universe is key for understanding the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and determining their role in cosmic reionization. We perform a spectroscopic search for broad H\alpha emitters at z\approx4-6 using deep JWST/NIRCam imaging and wide field slitless spectroscopy from the EIGER and FRESCO surveys. We identify 20 H\alpha lines at z=4.2-5.5 that have broad components with line widths from ~1200-3700 km s^{-1}, contributing ~30-90 % of the total line flux. We interpret these broad components as being powered by accretion onto SMBHs with implied masses ~10^{7-8} M_{\odot}. In the UV luminosity range M_{\rm UV}=-21 to -18, we measure number densities of \approx10^{-5} cMpc^{-3}. This is an order of magnitude higher than expected from extrapolating quasar UV luminosity functions. Yet, such AGN are found in only &lt;1 % of star-forming galaxies at z~5. The SMBH mass function agrees with large cosmological simulations. In two objects we detect narrow red- and blue-shifted H\alpha absorption indicative, respectively, of dense gas fueling SMBH growth and outflows. We may be witnessing early AGN feedback that will clear dust-free pathways through which more massive blue quasars are seen. We uncover a strong correlation between reddening and the fraction of total galaxy luminosity arising from faint AGN. This implies that early SMBH growth is highly obscured and that faint AGN are only minor contributors to cosmic reionization.

<p>
The onset of galaxy formation is thought to be initiated by the infall of neutral, pristine gas onto the first protogalactic halos. However, direct constraints on the abundance of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) in galaxies have been difficult to obtain at early cosmic times. Here we present spectroscopic observations with JWST of three galaxies at redshifts z=8.8 - 11.4, about 400-600 Myr after the Big Bang, that show strong damped Lyman-\alpha absorption (N_{\rm HI} &gt; 10^{22} cm^{-2}) from HI in their local surroundings, an order of magnitude in excess of the Lyman-\alpha absorption caused by the neutral intergalactic medium at these redshifts. Consequently, these early galaxies cannot be contributing significantly to reionization, at least at their current evolutionary stages. Simulations of galaxy formation show that such massive gas reservoirs surrounding young galaxies so early in the history of the universe is a signature of galaxy formation in progress.

<p>
The first JWST data revealed an unexpected population of red galaxies that appear to have redshifts of z~ 7-9 and high masses of M_* ~ 10^{10} M_{\odot} (Labb\'e et al. 2023). Here we fit S\'ersic profiles to the F200W NIRCam images of the 13 massive galaxy candidates of Labb\'e et al., to determine their structural parameters. Satisfactory fits were obtained for nine galaxies. We find that their effective radii are extremely small, ranging from r_{\rm e}~ 80 pc to r_{\rm e} ~ 300 pc, with a mean of \langle r_{\rm e}\rangle \approx 150 pc. For their apparent stellar masses, the galaxies are smaller than any other galaxy population that has been observed at any other redshift. We use the fits to derive circularized three-dimensional stellar mass profiles of the galaxies, and compare these to the mass profiles of massive quiescent galaxies at z~2.3 and nearby elliptical galaxies. We find that, despite the high redshift galaxies having 10-20 times smaller half-light radii, the central stellar densities are comparable to those of their putative descendants at later times. The most straightforward interpretation is that the dense compact inner regions of the most massive ellipticals today were already in place ~ 600 Myr after the Big Bang. We caution that the redshifts and masses of the galaxies remain to be confirmed, and that the complex NIRCam point spread function is not yet fully characterized.

The ALMA lensing cluster survey (ALCS) is a 96-hr large program dedicated to uncovering and characterizing intrinsically faint continuum sources and line emitters with the assistance of gravitational lensing. All 33 cluster fields were selected from HST/Spitzer treasury programs including CLASH, Hubble Frontier Fields, and RELICS, which also have Herschel and Chandra coverages. The total sky area surveyed reaches ~133 arcmin^2 down to a depth of ~60 &mu;Jy beam^{-1} (1\sigma) at 1.2 mm, yielding 141 secure blind detections of continuum sources and additional 39 sources aided by priors. We present scientific motivation, survey design, the status of spectroscopy follow-up observations, and number counts down to ~7 &mu;Jy. Synergies with JWST are also discussed.

<p>
We present the results of a search for high-redshift (z&gt;9) galaxy candidates in the JWST UNCOVER survey, using deep NIRCam and NIRISS imaging in 7 bands over ~45 arcmin^2 and ancillary HST observations. The NIRCam observations reach a 5-\sigma limiting magnitude of ~ 29.2 AB. The identification of high-z candidates relies on a combination of a dropout selection and photometric redshifts. We find 16 candidates at 9&lt;z&lt;12 and 3 candidates at 12&lt;z&lt;13, eight candidates are deemed very robust. Their lensing amplification ranges from &mu;=1.2 to 11.5. Candidates have a wide range of (lensing-corrected) luminosities and young ages, with low stellar masses (6.8&lt; log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) &lt;9.5) and low star formation rates (SFR=0.2-7 M_{\odot} yr^{-1}), confirming previous findings in early JWST observations of z&gt;9. A few galaxies at z~9-10 appear to show a clear Balmer break between the F356W and F444W/F410M bands, which helps constrain their stellar mass. We estimate blue UV continuum slopes between \beta=-1.8 and -2.3, typical for early galaxies at z&gt;9 but not as extreme as the bluest recently discovered sources. We also find evidence for a rapid redshift-evolution of the mass-luminosity relation and a redshift-evolution of the UV continuum slope for a given range of intrinsic magnitude, in line with theoretical predictions. These findings suggest that deeper JWST observations are needed to reach the fainter galaxy population at those early epochs, and follow-up spectroscopy will help better constrain the physical properties and star formation histories of a larger sample of galaxies.

We use JWST/NIRCam medium band photometry in a single pointing of the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS) to identify 118 Extreme Emission Line Galaxies (EELGs) over 1.7 \lesssim z \lesssim 6.7, selected using a set of color cuts that target galaxies with extreme \text{[OIII] + H}\beta and H\alpha emission. We show that our medium band color selections are able to select galaxies based on emission line equivalent width (EW), which is advantageous to more commonly used selections since it does not require strong continuum emission, and can select galaxies with faint or red continuum fluxes. The median EWs of our sample is EW(\text{H}\alpha) = 893 &#8491;\ and EW(\text{[OIII] + H}\beta) = 1255 &#8491;, and includes some objects with EW(\text{[OIII] + H}\beta) ~ 3000 &#8491;. These systems are mostly compact with low stellar mass (median \log(M_\star/M_\odot) = 8.03), low metallicity (median Z = 0.14 Z_\odot), little dust (median A_V = 0.18 mag) and high SSFR (median SSFR = 1.18 \times 10^{-8}/yr). Additionally, galaxies in our sample show increasing EW(\Ha) and EW(\OIIIHb) with redshift, an anti-correlation of EW(\Ha) with stellar mass, and no correlation between EW(\OIIIHb) and stellar mass. Finally, we present NIRSpec spectroscopy of 15 of the EELGs in our sample. These spectra confirm the redshifts and EWs of the EELGs calculated from the medium bands, which demonstrates the accuracy and efficiency of our color selections. Overall, we show that there are significant advantages to using medium band photometry to identify and study EELGs at a wide range of redshifts.

We present the JWST Cycle 1 53.8hr medium program FRESCO, short for "First Reionization Epoch Spectroscopically Complete Observations". FRESCO covers 62 arcmin^2 in each of the two GOODS/CANDELS fields for a total area of 124 arcmin^2 exploiting JWST's powerful new grism spectroscopic capabilities at near-infrared wavelengths. By obtaining ~2 hr deep NIRCam/grism observations with the F444W filter, FRESCO yields unprecedented spectra at R~1600 covering 3.8 to 5.0 &mu;m for most galaxies in the NIRCam field-of-view. This setup enables emission line measurements over most of cosmic history, from strong PAH lines at z~0.2-0.5, to Pa\alpha and Pa\beta at z~1-3, HeI and [SIII] at z~2.5-4.5, H\alpha and [NII] at z~5-6.5, up to [OIII] and H\beta for z~7-9 galaxies, and possibly even [OII] at z~10-12. FRESCO's grism observations provide total line fluxes for accurately estimating galaxy stellar masses and calibrating slit-loss corrections of NIRSpec/MSA spectra in the same field. Additionally, FRESCO results in a mosaic of F182M, F210M, and F444W imaging in the same fields to a depth of ~28.2 mag (5 \sigma in 0.32" diameter apertures). Together with this publication, the v1 imaging mosaics are released as high-level science products via MAST. Here, we describe the overall survey design and the key science goals that can be addressed with FRESCO. We also highlight several, early science results, including: spectroscopic redshifts of Lyman break galaxies that were identified almost 20 years ago, the discovery of broad-line active galactic nuclei at z&gt;4, and resolved Pa\alpha maps of galaxies at z~1.4. These results demonstrate the enormous power for serendipitous discovery of NIRCam/grism observations.

We present the first results on the spatial distribution of dust attenuation at 1.0&lt;z&lt;2.4 traced by the Balmer Decrement, H\alpha/H\beta, in emission-line galaxies using deep JWST NIRISS slitless spectroscopy from the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). H\alpha and H\beta emission line maps of emission-line galaxies are extracted and stacked in bins of stellar mass for two grism redshift bins, 1.0&lt;z_{grism}&lt;1.7 and 1.7&lt;z_{grism}&lt;2.4. Surface brightness profiles for the Balmer Decrement are measured and radial profiles of the dust attenuation towards H\alpha, A_{\mathrm{H}\alpha}, are derived. In both redshift bins, the integrated Balmer Decrement increases with stellar mass. Lower mass (7.6\leqslantLog(M_{*}/M_{\odot})&lt;10.0) galaxies have centrally concentrated, negative dust attenuation profiles whereas higher mass galaxies (10.0\leqslantLog(M_{*}/M_{\odot})&lt;11.1) have flat dust attenuation profiles. The total dust obscuration is mild, with on average 0.07\pm0.07 and 0.14\pm0.07 mag in the low and high redshift bins respectively. We model the typical light profiles of star-forming galaxies at these redshifts and stellar masses with GALFIT and apply both uniform and radially varying dust attenuation corrections based on our integrated Balmer Decrements and radial dust attenuation profiles. If these galaxies were observed with typical JWST NIRSpec slit spectroscopy (0.2\times0.5^{\prime\prime} shutters), on average, H\alpha star formation rates (SFRs) measured after slit-loss corrections assuming uniform dust attenuation will overestimate the total SFR by 6\pm21 &percnt; and 26\pm9 &percnt; at 1.0\leqslant z &lt; 1.7 and 1.7\leqslant z &lt; 2.4 respectively.

We utilise the unprecedented depth and resolution of recent early-release science (ERS) JWST observations to define the near-infrared counterparts of sub-millimetre selected galaxies (SMGs). We identify 45 SCUBA-2 SMG positions within The Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) JWST/NIRCam fields. Through an analysis of multi-wavelength p-values, NIRCam colours and predicted SCUBA-2 fluxes, we define 43 JWST/NIRCam counterparts to the SCUBA-2 SMGs, finding a 63 per cent agreement with those identified in prior HST studies. Using EaZy-py we fit the available HST and JWST observations to quantify the photometric redshifts of the NIRCam-SMGs, establishing a broad range of redshift from z\approx0.2-5.4 with a median of z\approx2.29, in agreement with other studies of SMGs. We analyse their rest-frame optical and near-infrared morphological properties (e.g. effective radius (R_{\rm e}), S\'ersic index (n), CAS, Gini and M_{20}), finding, on average, late-type disc-like morphologies with large scatter into the intermediate and merger regions of the non-parametric parameter space. For the non-merging galaxies, we find a median rest-frame optical size and S\'ersic index (and 1\sigma scatter) of R_{\rm e}=3.10\pm1.67kpc and n=0.96\pm0.66. Whilst in the rest-frame near-infrared we establish more compact, higher S\'ersic index morphologies (R_{\rm e}=1.64\pm0.97, n=1.85\pm0.63). We further establish that both the rest-frame optical and near-infrared effective radii correlate negatively (at a 2\sigma level) with redshift whilst the S\'ersic index remains constant with cosmic time. Our results are consistent with the picture of inside-out galaxy evolution, with more centrally concentrated older stellar populations, and more extended, younger star-forming regions whose stellar emission is heavily attenuated in the central regions.

### 33) [2303.11397](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11397v1): A JWST/NIRSpec Exploration of the Connection between Ionization Parameter, Electron Density, and Star-Formation-Rate Surface Density in z=2.7-6.3 Galaxies

<p>
We conduct a statistical analysis of the factors responsible for the variation in the ionization parameter (U) of high-redshift star-forming galaxies based on medium resolution JWST/NIRSpec observations obtained by the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey. The sample consists of 48 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts z=2.7-6.3 which are largely representative of typical star-forming galaxies at these redshifts. The [SII] 6718, 6733 doublet is used to estimate electron densities (n_e), and dust-corrected Ha luminosities are used to compute total ionizing photon rates (Q). Using composite spectra of galaxies in bins of [OIII]/[OII] (i.e., O32) as a proxy for U, we determine that galaxies with higher O32 have &lt;n_e&gt; ~ 500 cm^-3 that are at least a factor of ~5 larger than that of lower-O32 galaxies. We do not find a significant difference in &lt;Q&gt; between low- and high-O32 galaxies. Photoionization modeling of all available strong rest-frame optical emission lines is used to simultaneously constrain U and oxygen abundance (Z_neb). We find a large spread in log U of ~1.5 dex at a fixed Z_neb. On the other hand, the data indicate a highly significant correlation between U and star-formation-rate surface density (Sigma_SFR) which appears to be redshift invariant at z~1.6-6.3, and possibly up to z~9.5. We consider several avenues through which metallicity and Sigma_SFR (or gas density) may influence U, including variations in n_e and Q that are tied to metallicity and gas density, internal dust extinction of ionizing photons, and the effects of gas density on the volume filling fraction of dense clumps in HII regions and the escape fraction of ionizing photons. Based on these considerations, we conclude that gas density may play a more central role than metallicity in modulating U at these redshifts.

### 34) [2303.11349](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11349v1): An extremely compact, low-mass post-starburst galaxy at z=5.2

<p>
We report the discovery of a low-mass z=5.200\pm 0.002 galaxy that is in the process of ceasing its star formation. The galaxy, MACS0417-z5PSB, is multiply imaged with magnification factors ~40 by the galaxy cluster MACS J0417.5-1154, observed as part of the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). Using observations of MACS0417-z5PSB with a JWST/NIRSpec Prism spectrum and NIRCam imaging, we investigate the mechanism responsible for the cessation of star formation of the galaxy, and speculate about possibilities for its future. Using spectrophotometric fitting, we find a remarkably low stellar mass of \rm{M_*}=4.3\pm^{0.9}_{0.8} \times 10^{7} \rm{M_{\odot}}, less than 1% of the characteristic stellar mass at z~5. We measure a de-lensed rest-UV half-light radius in the source plane of 30\pm^{7}_{5} pc, and measure a star formation rate from H\alpha of 0.14\pm^{0.17}_{0.12} \rm{M_{\odot}/yr}. We find that under the assumption of a double power law star formation history, MACS0417-z5PSB has seen a recent rise in star formation, peaking ~10-30 Myr ago and declining precipitously since then. Together, these measurements reveal a low-mass, extremely compact galaxy which is in the process of ceasing star formation. We investigate the possibilities of mechanisms that have led to the cessation of star formation in MACS0417-z5PSB, considering stellar and AGN feedback, and environmental processes. We can likely rule out an AGN and most environmental processes, but leave open the possibility that MACS0417-z5PSB could be a star forming galaxy in the lull of a bursty star formation history.

<p>
We present a new high-precision, JWST-based, strong lensing model for the galaxy cluster Abell 2744 at z=0.3072. By combining the deep, high-resolution JWST imaging from the GLASS-JWST and UNCOVER programs and a Director's Discretionary Time program, with newly obtained VLT/MUSE data, we identify 32 multiple images from 11 background sources lensed by two external sub-clusters at distances of ~160" from the main cluster. The new MUSE observations enable the first spectroscopic confirmation of a multiple image system in the external clumps. Moreover, the re-analysis of the spectro-photometric archival and JWST data yields 27 additional multiple images in the main cluster. The new lens model is constrained by 149 multiple images (~66&percnt; more than in our previous Bergamini et al. 2023 model) covering an extended redshift range between 1.03 and 9.76. The subhalo mass component of the cluster includes 177 member galaxies down to m_{\rm F160W}=21, 163 of which are spectroscopically confirmed. Internal velocity dispersions are measured for 85 members. The new lens model is characterized by a remarkably low scatter between predicted and observed positions of the multiple images (0.43"). This precision is unprecedented given the large multiple image sample, the complexity of the cluster mass distribution, and the large modeled area. The improved accuracy and resolution of the cluster total mass distribution provides a robust magnification map over a ~\!45 arcmin^2 area, which is critical for inferring the intrinsic physical properties of the highly magnified, high-z sources. The lens model and the new MUSE redshift catalog are released with this publication.

### 36) [2303.08149](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08149v1): Direct T_e-based Metallicities of z=2-9 Galaxies with JWST/NIRSpec: Empirical Metallicity Calibrations Applicable from Reionization to Cosmic Noon

<p> Ryan L. Sanders, Alice E. Shapley, Michael W. Topping, Naveen A. Reddy, Gabriel B. Brammer </p>
<p>
We report detections of the [OIII]\lambda4364 auroral emission line for 16 galaxies at z=2.1-8.7, measured from JWST/NIRSpec observations obtained as part of the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey program. We combine this CEERS sample with 9 objects from the literature at z=4-9 with auroral-line detections from JWST/NIRSpec and 21 galaxies at z=1.4-3.7 with auroral-line detections from ground-based spectroscopy. We derive electron temperature T_e and direct-method oxygen abundances for the combined sample of 46 star-forming galaxies at z=1.4-8.7. We use these measurements to construct the first high-redshift empirical T_e-based metallicity calibrations for the strong-line ratios [OIII]/H\beta, [OII]/H\beta, R23=([OIII]+[OII])/H\beta, [OIII]/[OII], and [NeIII]/[OII]. These new calibrations are valid over 12+log(O/H)=7.0-8.4 and can be applied to samples of star-forming galaxies at z=2-9, leading to an improvement in the accuracy of metallicity determinations at Cosmic Noon and in the Epoch of Reionization. The high-redshift strong-line relations are offset from calibrations based on typical z~0 galaxies or HII regions, reflecting the known evolution of ionization conditions between z~0 and z~2. Deep spectroscopic programs with JWST/NIRSpec promise to improve statistics at the low and high ends of the metallicity range covered by the current sample, as well as improve the detection rate of [NII]\lambda6585 to allow the future assessment of N-based indicators. These new high-redshift calibrations will enable accurate characterizations of metallicity scaling relations at high redshift, improving our understanding of feedback and baryon cycling in the early universe.

### 37) [2303.00410](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00410v2): JWST/NIRSpec Measurements of the Relationships Between Nebular Emission-line Ratios and Stellar Mass at z~3-6

<p> Alice E. Shapley, Naveen A. Reddy, Ryan L. Sanders, Michael W. Topping, Gabriel B. Brammer </p>
<p>
We analyze the rest-optical emission-line ratios of star-forming galaxies at 2.7&lt;=z&lt;6.5 drawn from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey, and their relationships with stellar mass (M_*). Our analysis includes both line ratios based on the [NII]6583 feature -- [NII]6583/Ha, ([OIII]5007/Hb)/([NII]6583/Ha) (O3N2), and [NII]6583/[OII]3727 -- and those those featuring alpha elements -- [OIII]5007/Hb, [OIII]5007/[OII]3727 (O_32), ([OIII]4959,5007+[OII]3727)/Hb (R_23), and [NeIII]3869/[OII]3727. Given the typical flux levels of [NII]6583 and [NeIII]3869, which are undetected in the majority of individual CEERS galaxies at 2.7&lt;=z&lt;6.5, we construct composite spectra in bins of M_* and redshift. Using these composite spectra, we compare the relationships between emission-line ratios and M_* at 2.7&lt;=z&lt;6.5 with those observed at lower redshift. While there is significant evolution towards higher excitation (e.g., higher [OIII]5007/Hb, O_32, O3N2), and weaker nitrogen emission (e.g., lower [NII]6583/Ha and [NII]6583/[OII]3727) between z~0 and z~3, we find in most cases that there is no significant evolution in the relationship between line ratio and M_* beyond z~3. The [NeIII]3869/[OII]3727 ratio is anomalous in showing evidence for significant elevation at 4.0&lt;=z&lt;6.5 at fixed mass, relative to z~3.3. Collectively, however, our empirical results suggest that there is no significant evolution in the mass-metallicity relationship at 2.7&lt;=z&lt;6.5. Representative galaxy samples and metallicity calibrations based on existing and upcoming JWST/NIRSpec observations will be required to translate these empirical scaling relations into ones tracing chemical enrichment and gas cycling, and distinguish among the descriptions of star-formation feedback in simulations of galaxy formation at z&gt;3.

<p>
We present the results of a systematic search for candidate quiescent galaxies in the distant Universe in eleven JWST fields with publicly available observations collected during the first three months of operations and covering an effective sky area of ~145 arcmin^2. We homogeneously reduce the new JWST data and combine them with existing observations from the Hubble\,Space\,Telescope. We select a robust sample of ~80 candidate quiescent and quenching galaxies at 3 &lt; z &lt; 5 using two methods: (1) based on their rest-frame UVJ colors, and (2) a novel quantitative approach based on Gaussian Mixture Modeling of the NUV-U, U-V, and V-J rest-frame color space, which is more sensitive to recently quenched objects. We measure comoving number densities of massive (M_\star\geq 10^{10.6} M_\odot) quiescent galaxies consistent with previous estimates relying on ground-based observations, after homogenizing the results in the literature with our mass and redshift intervals. However, we find significant field-to-field variations of the number densities up to a factor of 2-3, highlighting the effect of cosmic variance and suggesting the presence of overdensities of red quiescent galaxies at z&gt;3, as it could be expected for highly clustered massive systems. Importantly, JWST enables the robust identification of quenching/quiescent galaxy candidates at lower masses and higher redshifts than before, challenging standard formation scenarios. All data products, including the literature compilation, are made publicly available.

<p>
The abundance of carbon relative to oxygen (C/O) is a promising probe of star formation history in the early universe, as the ratio changes with time due to production of these elements by different nucleosynthesis pathways. We present a measurement of \log{\mathrm{(C/O)}} = -1.01\pm0.12 (stat) \pm0.15 (sys) in a z=6.23 galaxy observed as part of the GLASS-JWST Early Release Science Program. Notably, we achieve good precision thanks to the detection of the rest-frame ultraviolet O III], C III], and C IV emission lines delivered by JWST/NIRSpec. The C/O abundance is ~0.8 dex lower than the solar value and is consistent with the expected yield from core-collapse supernovae, indicating that longer-lived intermediate mass stars have not fully contributed to carbon enrichment. This in turn implies rapid buildup of a young stellar population with age \lesssim100 Myr in a galaxy seen ~900 million years after the Big Bang. Our chemical abundance analysis is consistent with spectral energy distribution modeling of JWST/NIRCam photometric data, which indicates a current stellar mass \log\,\mathrm{M}_* / \mathrm{M_{sun}} = 8.4^{+0.4}_{-0.2} and specific star formation rate sSFR ~eq 20 Gyr^{-1}. These results showcase the value of chemical abundances and C/O in particular to study the earliest stages of galaxy assembly.

<p>
Using the novel JWST/NIRCam observations in the Abell 2744 field, we present a first spatially resolved overview of an HST-dark galaxy, spectroscopically confirmed at z=2.58 with magnification &mu;\approx1.9. While being largely invisible at ~1 &mu;m with NIRCam, except for sparse clumpy sub-structures, the object is well-detected and resolved in the long-wavelength bands with a spiral shape clearly visible in F277W. By combining ancillary ALMA and Herschel data, we infer that this object is an edge-on dusty spiral with an intrinsic stellar mass log(M_*/M_\odot)~11.3 and a dust-obscured SFR~ 300~M_\odot~yr^{-1}. A massive quiescent galaxy (log(M_*/M_\odot)~10.8) with tidal features lies 2\farcs{0} away (r~9 kpc), at a consistent redshift as inferred by JWST photometry, indicating a potential major merger. The dusty spiral lies on the main-sequence of star formation, and shows high dust attenuation in the optical (3&lt;A_{\rm V}&lt;4.5). In the far-infrared, its integrated dust SED is optically thick up to \lambda_0 ~ 500 &mu;m, further supporting the extremely dusty nature. Spatially resolved analysis of the HST-dark galaxy reveals a largely uniform A_{\rm V}~ 4 area spanning ~57 kpc^2, which spatially matches to the ALMA 1 mm continuum emission. Accounting for the surface brightness dimming and the depths of current JWST surveys, unlensed analogs of the HST-dark galaxy at z&gt;4 would be only detectable in F356W and F444W in UNCOVER-like survey, and become totally JWST-dark at z~6. This suggests that detecting highly attenuated galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization might be a challenging task for JWST.

Windhorst </p>
<p>
The escape fraction of Lyman-continuum (LyC) photons (f_{esc}) is a key parameter for determining the sources of cosmic reionization at z\geq 6. At these redshifts, owing to the opacity of the intergalactic medium, the LyC emission cannot be measured directly. However, LyC leakers during the epoch of reionization could be identified using indirect indicators that have been extensively tested at low and intermediate redshifts. These include a high [OIII]/[OII] flux ratio, high star-formation surface density, and compact sizes. In this work, we present observations of 29 4.5 \leq z \leq 8 gravitationally lensed galaxies in the Abell 2744 cluster field. From a combined analysis of JWST-NIRSpec and NIRCam data, we accurately derived their physical and spectroscopic properties: our galaxies have low masses (\log(M_\star)~ 8.5), blue UV spectral slopes (\beta ~ -2.1), compact sizes (r_e ~ 0.3-0.5 kpc), and high [OIII]/[OII] flux ratios. We confirm that these properties are similar to those characterizing low-redshift LyC leakers. Indirectly inferring the fraction of escaping ionizing photons, we find that more than 80% of our galaxies have predicted f_{esc} values larger than 0.05, indicating that they would be considered leakers. The average predicted f_{esc} value of our sample is 0.12, suggesting that similar galaxies at z\geq 6 have provided a substantial contribution to cosmic reionization.

In November 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) returned deep near-infrared images of Abell 2744 -- a powerful lensing cluster capable of magnifying distant, incipient galaxies beyond it. Together with the existing Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, this publicly available dataset opens a fundamentally new discovery space to understand the remaining mysteries of the formation and evolution of galaxies across cosmic time. In this work, we detect and measure some 60,000 objects across the 49 arcmin^2 JWST footprint down to a 5\,\sigma limiting magnitude of ~30 mag in 0.32" apertures. Photometry is performed using circular apertures on images matched to the point spread function of the reddest NIRCam broad band, F444W, and cleaned of bright cluster galaxies and the related intra-cluster light. To give an impression of the photometric performance, we measure photometric redshifts and achieve a \sigma_{\rm NMAD}\approx0.03 based on known, but relatively small, spectroscopic samples. With this paper, we publicly release our HST and JWST PSF-matched photometric catalog with optimally assigned aperture sizes for easy use, along with single aperture catalogs, photometric redshifts, rest-frame colors, and individual magnification estimates. These catalogs will set the stage for efficient and deep spectroscopic follow-up of some of the first JWST-selected samples in Summer 2023.

### 43) [2301.02209](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02209v2): Spatially Resolved Stellar Populations of 0.3&lt;z&lt;6.0 Galaxies in WHL0137-08 and MACS0647+70 Clusters as Revealed by JWST: How do Galaxies Grow and Quench Over Cosmic Time?

<p>
We study the spatially resolved stellar populations of 444 galaxies at 0.3&lt;z&lt;6.0 in two clusters (WHL0137-08 and MACS0647+70) and a blank field, combining imaging data from HST and JWST to perform spatially resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling using pixedfit. The high spatial resolution of the imaging data combined with magnification from gravitational lensing in the cluster fields allows us to resolve some galaxies to sub-kpc scales (for 109 of our galaxies). At redshifts around cosmic noon and higher (2.5\lesssim z\lesssim 6.0), we find mass doubling times to be independent of radius, inferred from flat specific star formation rate (sSFR) radial profiles and similarities between the half-mass and half-SFR radii. At lower redshifts (1.5\lesssim z\lesssim 2.5), a significant fraction of our star-forming galaxies show evidence for nuclear starbursts, inferred from centrally elevated sSFR, and a much smaller half-SFR radius compared to the half-mass radius. At later epochs, we find more galaxies suppress star formation in their center but are still actively forming stars in the disk. Overall, these trends point toward a picture of inside-out galaxy growth consistent with theoretical models and simulations. We also observe a tight relationship between the central mass surface density and global stellar mass with ~ 0.38 dex scatter. Our analysis demonstrates the potential of spatially resolved SED analysis with JWST data. Future analysis with larger samples will be able to further explore the assembly of galaxy mass and the growth of their structures

<p>
We present images and a multi-wavelength photometric catalog based on all of the JWST NIRCam observations obtained to date in the region of the Abell 2744 galaxy cluster. These data come from three different programs, namely the GLASS-JWST Early Release Science Program, UNCOVER, and Director's Discretionary Time program 2756. The observed area in the NIRCam wide-band filters - covering the central and extended regions of the cluster, as well as new parallel fields - is 46.5 arcmin^2 in total. All images in eight bands (F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M, F444W) have been reduced adopting the latest calibration and reference files available. Data reduction has been performed using an augmented version of the official JWST pipeline, with improvements aimed at removing or mitigating defects in the raw images and improving the background subtraction and photometric accuracy. We obtain a F444W-detected multi-band catalog, including all NIRCam and available HST data, adopting forced aperture photometry on PSF-matched images. The catalog is intended to enable early scientific investigations and is optimized for the study of faint galaxies; it contains 24389 sources, with a 5\sigma limiting magnitude in the F444W band ranging from 28.5 AB to 30.5 AB, as a result of the varying exposure times of the surveys that observed the field. We publicly release the reduced NIRCam images, associated multi-wavelength catalog and code adopted for 1/f noise removal with the aim of aiding users to familiarize themselves with JWST NIRCam data and identify suitable targets for follow-up observations.

<p>
Recent JWST/NIRCam imaging taken for the ultra-deep UNCOVER program reveals a very red dropout object at z_{\mathrm{phot}}~eq7.6, triply imaged by the galaxy cluster Abell 2744 (z_{\mathrm{d}}=0.308). All three images are very compact, i.e. unresolved, with a de-lensed size upper-limit of r_{e}\lesssim35 pc. The images have apparent magnitudes of m_{\mathrm{F444W}}~25-26 AB, and the magnification-corrected absolute UV magnitude of the source is M_{\mathrm{UV},1450}=-16.81\pm0.09. From the sum of observed fluxes and from a spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis, we obtain estimates of the bolometric luminosities of the source of L_{\mathrm{bol}}\gtrsim10^{43} \frac{\mathrm{erg}}{\mathrm{s}} and L_{\mathrm{bol}}~10^{44}-10^{46} \frac{\mathrm{erg}}{\mathrm{s}}, respectively. Based on its compact, point-like appearance, its position in color-color space and the SED analysis, we tentatively conclude that this object is a UV-faint dust-obscured quasar-like object, i.e. an active galactic nucleus (AGN) at high redshift. We also discuss other alternative origins for the object's emission features, including a massive star cluster, Population III, supermassive, or dark stars, or a direct-collapse black hole. Although populations of red galaxies at similar photometric redshifts have been detected with JWST, this object is unique in that its high-redshift nature is corroborated geometrically by lensing, that it is unresolved despite being magnified -- and thus intrinsically even more compact -- and that it occupies notably distinct regions in both size-luminosity and color-color space. Planned UNCOVER JWST/NIRSpec observations, scheduled in Cycle 1, will enable a more detailed analysis of this object.

<p>
We report the discovery of a compact group of galaxies, CGG-z5, at z~5.2 in the EGS field covered by the JWST/CEERS survey. CGG-z5 was selected as the highest overdensity of galaxies at z&gt;2 in recent JWST public surveys and it consists of six candidate members lying within a projected area of 1.5"\times3" (10\times20~kpc^2). All group members are HST/F435W and HST/F606W dropouts while securely detected in the JWST/NIRCam bands, yielding a narrow range of robust photometric redshifts 5.0&lt;z&lt;5.3. The most massive galaxy in the group has a stellar mass log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})\approx9.8, while the rest are low-mass satellites (log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})\approx8.4-9.2). While several group members were already detected in the HST and IRAC bands, the low stellar masses and the compactness of the structure required the sensitivity and resolution of JWST for its identification. To assess the nature and evolutionary path of CGG-z5, we searched for similar compact structures in the \textsc{Eagle} simulations and followed their evolution with time. We find that all the identified structures merge into a single galaxy by z=3 and form a massive galaxy (log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})&gt;11) at z~1. This implies that CGG-z5 could be a "proto-massive galaxy" captured during a short-lived phase of massive galaxy formation.

<p>
We present a spectroscopic redshift catalogue of the SMACS J0723.3-7327 field ("Webb's First Deep Field") obtained from JWST/NIRISS grism spectroscopy and supplemented with JWST/NIRSpec and VLT/MUSE redshifts. The catalogue contains a total of 190 sources with secure spectroscopic redshifts, including 156 NIRISS grism redshifts, 123 of which are for sources whose redshifts were previously unknown. These new grism redshifts are secured with two or more spectroscopic features (64 sources), or with a single spectral feature whose identity is secured from the object's nine-band photometric redshift (59 sources). These are complemented with 17 NIRSpec and 48 MUSE redshifts, including six new NIRSpec redshifts identified in this work. In addition to the z_{\rm cl}=0.39 cluster galaxy redshifts (for which we provide ~40 new NIRISS absorption-line redshifts), we also find three prominent galaxy overdensities at higher redshifts - at z=1.1, z=1.4, and z=2.0 - that were until now not seen in the JWST/NIRSpec and VLT/MUSE data. The paper describes the characteristics of our spectroscopic redshift sample and the methodology we have employed to obtain it. Our redshift catalogue is made available to the community at https://niriss.github.io/smacs0723.

Christiansen, S. N. Wilson </p>
<p>
We present a joint analysis of the galaxy S04590 at z=8.496 based on NIRSpec, NIRCam, and NIRISS observations obtained through as part of Early Release Observations programme of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the far-infrared [CII]-158&mu;m emission line detected by dedicated Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations. We determine the physical properties of S04590 from modelling of the spectral energy distribution (SED) and through the redshifted optical nebular emission lines detected with JWST/NIRSpec. The best-fit SED model reveals a low-mass (M_\star = 10^{7.2}-10^{8}\,M_{\odot}) galaxy with a low oxygen abundance of 12+\log{\rm (O/H)} = 7.16^{+0.10}_{-0.12} derived from the strong nebular and auroral emission lines. Assuming that [CII] effectively traces the interstellar medium (ISM), we estimate the total gas mass of the galaxy to be M_{\rm gas} = (8.0\pm 4.0)\times 10^{8}\,M_\odot based on the luminosity and spatial extent of [CII]. This yields an exceptionally high gas fraction, f_{\rm gas} = M_{\rm gas}/(M_{\rm gas} + M_\star) \gtrsim 90&percnt;, though still consistent within the range expected for its low metallicity. We further derive the metal mass of the galaxy based on the gas mass and gas-phase metallicity, which we find to be consistent with the expected metal production from Type II supernovae. Finally, we make the first constraints on the dust-to-gas (DTG) and dust-to-metals (DTM) ratios of galaxies in the epoch of reionization at z\gtrsim 6, showing overall low mass ratios of logDGT &lt;-3.8 and logDTM &lt;-0.5, though consistent with local scaling relations and in particular the local metal-poor galaxy I Zwicky 18. Our analysis highlights the synergy between ALMA and JWST in characterizing the gas, metal, and stellar content of the first generation of galaxies.

We present ALMA deep spectroscopy for a lensed galaxy at z_{\rm spec}=8.496 with \log(M_{\rm star}/M_{\odot})~7.8 whose optical nebular lines and stellar continuum are detected by JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam Early Release Observations in SMACS0723. Our ALMA spectrum shows [OIII]88&mu;m and [CII]158&mu;m line detections at 4.0\sigma and 4.5\sigma, respectively. The redshift and position of the [OIII] line coincide with those of the JWST source, while the [CII] line is blue-shifted by 90 km s^{-1} with a spatial offset of 0.''5 (\approx0.5 kpc in source plane) from the JWST source. The NIRCam F444W image, including [OIII]\lambda5007 and H\beta line emission, spatially extends beyond the stellar components by a factor of &gt;8. This indicates that the z=8.5 galaxy has already experienced strong outflows whose oxygen and carbon produce the extended [OIII]\lambda5007 and the offset [CII] emission, which would promote ionizing photon escape and facilitate reionization. With careful slit-loss corrections and removals of emission spatially outside the galaxy, we evaluate the [OIII]88&mu;m/\lambda5007 line ratio, and derive the electron density n_{\rm e} by photoionization modeling to be 220^{+170}_{-100} cm^{-3}, which is comparable with those of z~2-3 galaxies. We estimate an [OIII]88&mu;m/[CII]158&mu;m line ratio in the galaxy of &gt;4, as high as those of known z~6-9 galaxies. This high [OIII]88&mu;m/[CII]158&mu;m line ratio is generally explained by the high n_{\rm e} as well as the low metallicity (Z_{\rm gas}/Z_{\odot}=0.04^{+0.02}_{-0.02}), high ionization parameter (\log U &gt; -2.27), and low carbon-to-oxygen abundance ratio (\log(C/O) =[-0.52:-0.24]) obtained from the JWST/NIRSpec data; further [CII] follow-up observations will constrain the covering fraction of photodissociation regions.

<p>
We report the detection of a high density of redshift z\approx 10 galaxies behind the foreground cluster Abell 2744, selected from imaging data obtained recently with NIRCam onboard {\it JWST} by three programs -- GLASS-JWST, UNCOVER, and DDT\#2756. To ensure robust estimates of the lensing magnification &mu;, we use an improved version of our model that exploits the first epoch of NIRCam images and newly obtained MUSE spectra, and avoids regions with &mu;&gt;5 where the uncertainty may be higher. We detect seven bright z\approx 10 galaxies with demagnified rest-frame -22 \lesssim M_{\rm UV}\lesssim -19 mag, over an area of ~37 sq. arcmin. Taking into account photometric incompleteness and the effects of lensing on luminosity and cosmological volume, we find that the density of z\approx 10 galaxies in the field is about 10\times (3\times) larger than the average at M_{UV}\approx -21~ (-20) mag reported so far. The density is even higher when considering only the GLASS-JWST data, which are the deepest and the least affected by magnification and incompleteness. The GLASS-JWST field contains 5 out of 7 galaxies, distributed along an apparent filamentary structure of 2 Mpc in projected length, and includes a close pair of candidates with M_{\rm UV}&lt; -20 mag having a projected separation of only 16 kpc. These findings suggest the presence of a z\approx 10 overdensity in the field. In addition to providing excellent targets for efficient spectroscopic follow-up observations, our study confirms the high density of bright galaxies observed in early {\it JWST} observations, but calls for multiple surveys along independent lines of sight to achieve an unbiased estimate of their average density and a first estimate of their clustering.

### 51) [2212.04381](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04381v3): UNCOVERing the extended strong lensing structures of Abell 2744 with the deepest JWST imaging

<p>
We present a new parametric lens model for the massive galaxy cluster Abell~2744 based on the new ultra-deep JWST imaging taken in the framework of the UNCOVER program. These observations constitute the deepest JWST images of a lensing cluster to date, adding to the existing deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images and the recent JWST ERS and DDT data taken for this field. The wide field-of-view of UNCOVER (~45 arcmin^2) extends beyond the cluster's well-studied central core and reveals a spectacular wealth of prominent lensed features around two massive cluster sub-structures in the north and north-west, where no multiple images were previously known. The 75 newly uncovered multiple images and candidates of 16 sources allow us, for the first time, to constrain the lensing properties and total mass distribution around these extended cluster structures using strong lensing (SL). Our model yields an effective Einstein radius of \theta_{E,\mathrm{main}}~eq23'' for the main cluster core (for z_{\mathrm{s}}=2), enclosing a mass of M(\theta&lt;\theta_{E,\mathrm{main}})~eq7.7\times10^{13} M_{\odot}, and \theta_{E,\mathrm{NW}}~eq13'' for the newly discovered north-western SL structure enclosing M(\theta&lt;\theta_{E,\mathrm{NW}})~eq2.2\times10^{13} M_{\odot}. The northern clump is somewhat less massive with \theta_{E,\mathrm{N}}~eq7'' enclosing M(\theta&lt;\theta_{E,\mathrm{N}})~eq8\times10^{12} M_{\odot}. We find the northern sub-structures of Abell~2744 to broadly agree with the findings from weak lensing (WL) and align with the filamentary structure found by these previous studies. Our model in particular reveals a large area of high magnifications between the various cluster structures, which will be paramount for lensed galaxy studies in the UNCOVER field. The model is made publicly available to accompany the first UNCOVER data release.

### 52) [2212.02890](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02890v2): Dilution of chemical enrichment in galaxies 600 Myr after the Big Bang

<p>
Galaxies throughout the last 12 Gyr of cosmic time follow a single, universal relation that connects their star-formation rates (SFRs), stellar masses (M_\star) and chemical abundances. Deviation from these fundamental scaling relations would imply a drastic change in the processes that regulate galaxy evolution. Observations have hinted at the possibility that this relation may be broken in the very early universe. However, until recently, chemical abundances of galaxies could be only measured reliably as far back as redshift z=3.3. With JWST, we can now characterize the SFR, M_\star, and chemical abundance of galaxies during the first few hundred million years after the Big Bang, at redshifts z=7-10. Here we show that galaxies at this epoch follow unique SFR-M_\star--main-sequence and mass-metallicity scaling relations, but their chemical abundance is a factor of three lower than expected from the fundamental-metallicity relation of later galaxies. These findings suggest that galaxies at this time are still intimately connected with the intergalactic medium and subject to continuous infall of pristine gas which effectively dilutes their metal abundances.

The demographics of the production and escape of ionizing photons from UV-faint early galaxies is a key unknown in discovering the primary drivers of reionization. With the advent of JWST it is finally possible to observe the rest-frame optical nebular emission from individual sub-L^* z&gt;3 galaxies to measure the production of ionizing photons, \xi_\mathrm{ion}. Here we study a sample of 370 z~3-7 galaxies spanning -23 &lt;M_\mathrm{UV} &lt; -15.5 (median M_\mathrm{UV}\approx -18) with deep multi-band HST and JWST/NIRCam photometry covering the rest-UV to optical from the GLASS and UNCOVER JWST surveys. Our sample includes 102 galaxies with Lyman-alpha emission detected in MUSE spectroscopy. We use H-alpha fluxes inferred from NIRCam photometry to estimate the production rate of ionizing photons which do not escape these galaxies \xi_\mathrm{ion}(1-f_\mathrm{esc}). We find median \log_{10}\xi_\mathrm{ion}(1-f_\mathrm{esc})=25.33\pm 0.47, with a broad intrinsic scatter 0.42 dex, implying a broad range of galaxy properties and ages in our UV-faint sample. Galaxies detected with Lyman-alpha have ~0.1 dex higher \xi_\mathrm{ion}(1-f_\mathrm{esc}), which is explained by their higher H-alpha EW distribution, implying younger ages, higher sSFR and thus more O/B stars. We find significant trends of increasing \xi_\mathrm{ion}(1-f_\mathrm{esc}) with increasing H-alpha EW, decreasing UV luminosity, and decreasing UV slope, implying the production of ionizing photons is enhanced in young, low metallicity galaxies. We find no significant evidence for sources with very high ionizing escape fraction (f_\mathrm{esc}&gt;0.5) in our sample, based on their photometric properties, even amongst the Lyman-alpha selected galaxies. This work demonstrates that considering the full distribution of \xi_\mathrm{ion} across galaxy properties is important for assessing the primary drivers of reionization.

<p>
Star cluster formation in the early universe and their contribution to reionization remains to date largely unconstrained. Here we present JWST/NIRCam imaging of the most highly magnified galaxy known at z ~ 6, the Sunrise arc. We identify six young massive star clusters (YMCs) with measured radii spanning ~ 20 pc down to ~ 1 pc (corrected for lensing magnification), estimated stellar masses of ~ 10^{(6-7)} Msun, and with ages 1-30 Myr based on SED fitting to photometry measured in 8 filters extending to rest-frame 7000A. The resulting stellar mass surface densities are higher than 1000 Msun pc^{-2} (up to a few 10^5 Msun pc^{-2}) and their inferred dynamical ages qualify the majority of these systems as gravitationally-bound stellar clusters. The star cluster ages map the progression of star formation along the arc, with to evolved systems (&gt;~ 10 Myr old) followed by very young clusters. The youngest stellar clusters (&lt; 5 Myr) show evidence of prominent Hbeta + [OIII]4959,5007 emission, based on photometry, with equivalent widths larger than 1000 A rest-frame, and are hosted in a 200 pc sized star-forming complex. Such a region dominates the ionizing photon production, with a high efficiency log(\xi_{ion} [Hz erg^{-1}]) ~ 25.7. A significant fraction of the recently formed stellar mass of the galaxy (&gt; 10-30 %) occurred in these YMCs. We speculate that such sources of ionizing radiation boost the ionizing photon production efficiency which eventually carve ionized channels that might favor the escape of Lyman continuum radiation. The survival of some of the clusters would make them the progenitors of massive and relatively metal-poor globular clusters in the local Universe.

We present the spectroscopic confirmation of a protocluster at z=7.88 behind the galaxy cluster Abell2744 (hereafter A2744-z7p9OD). Using JWST NIRSpec, we find seven galaxies within a projected radius of 60kpc. Although the galaxies reside in an overdensity around &gt;20\times greater than a random volume, they do not show strong Lyman-alpha emission. We place 2-\sigma upper limits on the rest-frame equivalent width &lt;16-28AA. Based on the tight upper limits to the Lyman-alpha emission, we constrain the volume-averaged neutral fraction of hydrogen in the intergalactic medium to be x_{\rm HI} &gt; 0.45 (68% CI). Using an empirical M_{\rm UV}-M_{\rm halo} relation for individual galaxies, we estimate that the total halo mass of the system is \gtrsim 4\times10^{11}\,M_\odot. Likewise, the line of sight velocity dispersion is estimated to be 1100 \pm 200km/s. Using an empirical relation, we estimate the present-day halo mass of A2744-z7p9OD to be ~2\times10^{15}\,M_\odot, comparable to the Coma cluster. A2744-z7p9OD is the highest redshift spectroscopically confirmed protocluster to date, demonstrating the power of JWST to investigate the connection between dark-matter halo assembly and galaxy formation at very early times with medium-deep observations at &lt;20hrs total exposure time. Follow-up spectroscopy of the remaining photometric candidates of the overdensity will further refine the features of this system and help characterize the role of such overdensities in cosmic reionization.

We present ALMA Band~7 observations of a remarkably bright galaxy candidate at z_{\rm phot}=16.7^{+1.9}_{-0.3} (M_{\rm UV}=-21.6), S5-z17-1, identified in JWST Early Release Observation data of Stephen's Quintet. We do not detect the dust continuum at 866~&mu;m, ruling out the possibility that \targb\ is a low-z dusty starburst with a star-formation rate of \gtrsim 30~M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}. We detect a 5.1\sigma line feature at 338.726\pm0.007~GHz exactly coinciding with the JWST source position, with a 2&percnt; likelihood of the signal being spurious. The most likely line identification would be [OIII]52&mu;m at z=16.01 or [CII]158&mu;m at z=4.61, whose line luminosities do not violate the non-detection of the dust continuum in both cases. Together with three other z\gtrsim 11--13 candidate galaxies recently observed with ALMA, we conduct a joint ALMA and JWST spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis and find that the high-z solution at z~11--17 is favored in every candidate as a very blue (UV continuum slope of ~eq-2.3) and luminous (M_{\rm UV}~eq[-24:-21]) system. Still, we find in several candidates that reasonable SED fits (\Delta \chi^{2}\lesssim4) are reproduced by type-II quasar and/or quiescent galaxy templates with strong emission lines at z~3--5, where such populations predicted from their luminosity functions and EW([OIII]+H\beta) distributions are abundant in survey volumes used for the identification of the z~11--17 candidates. While these recent ALMA observation results have strengthened the likelihood of the high-z solutions, lower-z possibilities are not completely ruled out in several of the z~11--17 candidates, indicating the need to consider the relative surface densities of the lower-z contaminants in the ultra high-z galaxy search.

### 57) [2211.02607](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02607v3): Evolution of the UV LF from z~15 to z~8 Using New JWST NIRCam Medium-Band Observations over the HUDF/XDF

We present the first constraints on the prevalence of z&gt;10 galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) leveraging new NIRCam observations from JEMS (JWST Extragalactic Medium-band Survey). These NIRCam observations probe redward of 1.6&mu;m, beyond the wavelength limit of HST, allowing us to search for galaxies to z&gt;10. These observations indicate that the highest redshift candidate identified in the HUDF09 data with HST, UDFj-39546284, has a redshift of z&gt;11.5, as had been suggested in analyses of the HUDF12/XDF data. This has now been confirmed with JWST NIRSpec. This source is thus the most distant galaxy discovered by HST in its &gt;30 years of operation. Additionally, we identify nine other z~8-13 candidate galaxies over the HUDF, two of which are new discoveries that appear to lie at z~11-12. We use these results to characterize the evolution of the UV luminosity function (LF) from z~15 to z~8.7. While our LF results at z~8.7 and z~10.5 are consistent with previous findings over the HUDF, our new LF estimates at z~12.6 are higher than other results in the literature, potentially pointing to a milder evolution in the UV luminosity density from z~12.6. We emphasize that our LF results are uncertain given the small number of z~12.6 sources and limited volume probed. The new NIRCam data also indicate that the faint z~8-13 galaxies in the HUDF/XDF show blue UV-continuum slopes beta~-2.7, high specific star formation rates ~24.5 Gyr**-1, and high EW (~1300A) [OIII]+H\beta emission, with two z~8.5 sources showing [OIII]+H\beta EWs of ~2300 A.

<p>
Ultraviolet light from early galaxies is thought to have ionized gas in the intergalactic medium. However, there are few observational constraints on this epoch because of the faintness of those galaxies and the redshift of their optical light into the infrared. We report the observation, in JWST imaging, of a distant galaxy that is magnified by gravitational lensing. JWST spectroscopy of the galaxy, at rest-frame optical wavelengths, detects strong nebular emission lines that are attributable to oxygen and hydrogen. The measured redshift is z = 9.51 +- 0.01, corresponding to 510 million years after the Big Bang. The galaxy has a radius of 16.2+4.6-7.2 parsecs, which is substantially more compact than galaxies with equivalent luminosity at z = 6 to 8, leading to a high star formation rate surface density.

<p>
In the first billion years after the Big Bang, sources of ultraviolet (UV) photons are believed to have ionized intergalactic hydrogen, rendering the Universe transparent to UV radiation. Galaxies brighter than the characteristic luminosity L^{*} do not provide enough ionizing photons to drive this cosmic reionization. Fainter galaxies are thought to dominate the photon budget; however they are surrounded by neutral gas that prevents the escape of the Lyman-\alpha photons, which has been the dominant way to identify them so far. JD1 was previously identified as a triply-imaged galaxy with a magnification factor of 13 provided by the foreground cluster Abell 2744, and a photometric redshift of z~10. Here we report the spectroscopic confirmation of this very low luminosity (~0.05 L^{*}) galaxy at z=9.79, observed 480 Myr after the Big Bang, by means of the identification of the Lyman break and redward continuum, as well as multiple \gtrsim4\sigma emission lines, with the Near-InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec) and Near-InfraRed Camera (NIRCam) instruments. The combination of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and gravitational lensing shows that this ultra-faint galaxy (M_{\rm UV}=-17.35) -- with a luminosity typical of the sources responsible for cosmic reionization -- has a compact (~150 pc) and complex morphology, low stellar mass (10^{7.19} M_\odot), and subsolar (~0.6 Z_{\odot}) gas-phase metallicity.

MACS0647-JD is a triply-lensed z~11 galaxy originally discovered with the Hubble Space Telescope. Here we report new JWST imaging, which clearly resolves MACS0647-JD as having two components that are either merging galaxies or stellar complexes within a single galaxy. Both are very small, with stellar masses ~10^8\,M_\odot and radii r&lt;100\,\rm pc. The brighter larger component "A" is intrinsically very blue (\beta~-2.6), likely due to very recent star formation and no dust, and is spatially extended with an effective radius ~70\,\rm pc. The smaller component "B" appears redder (\beta~-2), likely because it is older (100-200\,\rm Myr) with mild dust extinction (A_V~0.1\,\rm mag), and a smaller radius ~20\,\rm pc. We identify galaxies with similar colors in a high-redshift simulation, finding their star formation histories to be out of phase. With an estimated stellar mass ratio of roughly 2:1 and physical projected separation ~400\,\rm pc, we may be witnessing a galaxy merger 400 million years after the Big Bang. We also identify a candidate companion galaxy C ~3\,{\rm kpc} away, likely destined to merge with galaxies A and B. The combined light from galaxies A+B is magnified by factors of ~8, 5, and 2 in three lensed images JD1, 2, and 3 with F356W fluxes ~322, 203, 86\,\rm nJy (AB mag 25.1, 25.6, 26.6). MACS0647-JD is significantly brighter than other galaxies recently discovered at similar redshifts with JWST. Without magnification, it would have AB mag 27.3 (M_{UV}=-20.4). With a high confidence level, we obtain a photometric redshift of z=10.6\pm0.3 based on photometry measured in 6 NIRCam filters spanning 1-5\rm&mu; m, out to 4300\,\r{A} rest-frame. JWST NIRSpec observations planned for January 2023 will deliver a spectroscopic redshift and a more detailed study of the physical properties of MACS0647-JD.

We report the discovery of four galaxy candidates observed 450 - 600 Myr after the Big Bang with photometric redshifts between z ~ 8.3 - 10.2 measured using the JWST NIRCam imaging of the galaxy cluster WHL0137-08 observed in 8 filters spanning 0.8-5.0 micron, plus 9 Hubble filters spanning 0.4-1.7 micron. One candidate is gravitationally lensed with a magnification of ~8, while the other three are located in a nearby NIRCam module with expected magnifications of &lt;~ 1.1. Using SED fitting, we estimate the stellar masses of these galaxies are typically in the range log M*/Msun = 8.3 - 8.7. All appear young with mass-weighted ages &lt; 240 Myr, low dust content A_V &lt; 0.15 mag, and specific star formation rates sSFR ~0.25 - 10 /Gyr for most. One z ~ 9 candidate is consistent with an age &lt; 5 Myr and a sSFR ~10 /Gyr, as inferred from a strong F444W excess, implying [OIII]+H-beta rest-frame equivalent width ~2000 Angstrom, although an older z ~ 10 object is also allowed. Another z ~ 9 candidate is lensed into an arc 2.4 arcsec long with a magnification of ~8. This arc is the most spatially-resolved galaxy at z ~ 9 known to date, revealing structures ~30 pc across. Follow-up spectroscopy of WHL0137-08 with JWST/NIRSpec will be useful to spectroscopically confirm these high-redshift galaxy candidates and to study their physical properties in more detail.

<p>
We present a first look at the reddest 2-5&mu;\rm m sources found in deep images from the GLASS Early Release Science program. We undertake a general search, i.e. not looking for any particular spectral signatures, for sources detected only in bands redder than reachable with the Hubble Space Telescope, and which would likely not have been identified in pre-JWST surveys. We search for sources down to AB ~ 27 (corresponding to &gt;10\sigma detection threshold) in any of the F200W to F444W filters,with a &gt;1 magnitude excess relative to F090W to F150W bands. Fainter than F444W&gt;25 we find 56 such sources of which 37 have reasonably constrained spectral energy distributions to which we can fit photometric redshifts. We find the majority of this population (~ 65%) as 2&lt;z&lt;6 star forming low-attenuation galaxies that are faint at rest-frame ultraviolet-optical wavelengths, have stellar masses 10^{8.5}-10^{9.5} M_\odot, and have observed fluxes at &gt;2&mu; \rm m boosted by a combination of the Balmer break and emission lines. The typical implied rest equivalent widths are ~200\unicode{0x212B} with some extreme objects up to ~ 1000\unicode{0x212B}. This is in contrast with brighter magnitudes where the red sources tend to be z&lt;3 quiescent galaxies and dusty star forming objects. Our general selection criteria for red sources allow us to independently identify other phenomena as diverse as extremely low mass (~ 10^8 M_\odot) quiescent galaxies at z&lt;1, recover recently identified z&gt;11 galaxies and a very cool brown dwarf.

Over the last few years, both ALMA and Spitzer/IRAC observations have revealed a population of likely massive galaxies at z&gt;3 that was too faint to be detected in HST rest-frame ultraviolet imaging. However, due to the very limited photometry for individual galaxies, the true nature of these so-called HST-dark galaxies has remained elusive. Here, we present the first sample of such galaxies observed with very deep, high-resolution NIRCam imaging from the Early Release Science Program CEERS. 30 HST-dark sources are selected based on their red colours across 1.6 &mu;m to 4.4 &mu;m. Their physical properties are derived from 12-band multi-wavelength photometry, including ancillary HST imaging. We find that these galaxies are generally heavily dust-obscured (A_{V}~2 mag), massive (\log (M/M_{\odot}) ~10), star-forming sources at z~2-8 with an observed surface density of ~0.8 arcmin^{-2}. This suggests that an important fraction of massive galaxies may have been missing from our cosmic census at z&gt;3 all the way into the Reionization epoch. The HST-dark sources lie on the main sequence of galaxies and add an obscured star formation rate density (SFRD) of \mathrm{3.2^{+1.8}_{-1.3} \times 10^{-3} M_{\odot}/yr/Mpc^{3}} at z~7 showing likely presence of dust in the Epoch of Reionization. Our analysis shows the unique power of JWST to reveal this previously missing galaxy population and to provide a more complete census of galaxies at z=2-8 based on rest-frame optical imaging.
