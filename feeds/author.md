### 1) [2501.02956](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02956v1): Evolution of the Sérsic Index up to z=2.5 from JWST and HST

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is unveiling the rest-frame near-IR structure of galaxies. We measure the evolution with redshift of the rest-frame optical and near-IR S\'ersic index (n), and examine the dependence on stellar mass and star-formation activity across the redshift range 0.5\leq z\leq2.5. We infer rest-frame near-IR S\'ersic profiles for \approx 15.000 galaxies in publicly available NIRCam imaging mosaics from the COSMOS-Web and PRIMER surveys. We augment these with rest-frame optical S\'ersic indices, previously measured from HST imaging mosaics. The median S\'ersic index evolves slowly or not at all with redshift, except for very high-mass galaxies (M_\star &gt; 10^{11}~{\text{M}}_\odot), which show an increase from n\approx 2.5 to n\approx 4 at z&lt;1. High-mass galaxies have higher n than lower-mass galaxies (M_\star=10^{9.5}~{\text{M}}_\odot) at all redshifts, with a stronger dependence in the rest-frame near-IR than in the rest-frame optical at z&gt;1. This wavelength dependence is caused by star-forming galaxies that have lower optical than near-IR n at z&gt;1 (but not at z&lt;1). Both at optical and near-IR wavelengths, star-forming galaxies have lower n than quiescent galaxies, fortifying the connection between star-formation activity and radial stellar mass distribution. At z&gt;1 the median near-IR n varies strongly with star formation activity, but not with stellar mass. The scatter in near-IR n is higher in the green valley (0.25 dex) than on the star-forming sequence and among quiescent galaxies (0.18 dex) -- this trend is not seen in the optical because dust and young stars contribute to the variety in optical light profiles. Our newly measured rest-frame near-IR radial light profiles motivate future comparisons with radial stellar mass profiles of simulated galaxies as a stringent constraint on processes that govern galaxy formation.

<p>
We report the discovery of an ultra-massive grand-design red spiral galaxy, named Zh\'ul\'ong (Torch Dragon), at z_{\rm phot} = 5.2^{+0.3}_{-0.2} in the JWST PANORAMIC survey, identified as the most distant bulge+disk galaxy with spiral arms known to date. Zh\'ul\'ong displays an extraordinary combination of properties: 1) a classical bulge centered in a large, face-on exponential stellar disk (half-light radius of R_{\rm e} = 3.7 \pm 0.1 \, \mathrm{kpc}), with spiral arms extending across 19 kpc; 2) a clear transition from the red, quiescent core (F150W-F444W=3.1 mag) with high stellar mass surface density (\log(\Sigma M_{\star}/M_{\odot} \, \mathrm{kpc}^{-2}) = 9.91_{-0.09}^{+0.11}) to the star-forming outer regions, as revealed by spatially resolved SED analysis, which indicates significant inside-out galaxy growth; 3) an extremely high stellar mass at its redshift, with \log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot})=11.03_{-0.08}^{+0.10} comparable to the Milky Way, and an implied baryon-to-star conversion efficiency (\epsilon ~ 0.3) that is 1.5 times higher than even the most efficient galaxies at later epochs; 4) despite an active disk, a relatively modest overall star formation rate (\mathrm{SFR} =66_{-46}^{+89} ~M_{\odot} \, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}), which is &gt;0.5 dex below the star formation main sequence at z ~ 5.2 and &gt;10 times lower than ultra-massive dusty galaxies at z=5-6. Altogether, Zh\'ul\'ong shows that mature galaxies emerged much earlier than expected in the first billion years after the Big Bang through rapid galaxy formation and morphological evolution. Our finding offers key constraints for models of massive galaxy formation and the origin of spiral structures in the early universe.

<p>
We study the rest-frame optical and ultraviolet morphology of galaxies in the first billion years of the Universe. Using JWST data from the UNCOVER and MegaScience surveys targeting the lensing cluster Abell 2744 we present multi-band morphological measurements for a sample of 995 galaxies selected using 20-band NIRCam photometry and 35 using NIRSpec Prism spectroscopy over the redshift range of 4&lt;z&lt;8. The wavelength-dependent morphology is measured using pysersic by simultaneously modeling the images in 6 NIRCam wide filters covering the rest-frame UV to optical. The joint modeling technique increases the precision of measured radii by 50&percnt;. Galaxies in our sample show a wide range of Sersic indices, with no systematic difference between optical and UV morphology. We model the size-mass relation in a Bayesian manner using a continuity model to directly fit the redshift evolution while accounting for observational uncertainties. We find the average size of galaxies at \log M_*/M_\odot=8.5 grows rapidly, from 400 pc at z=8 to 830 pc at z=4. This is faster evolution than expected from power law scalings of the Hubble parameter or scale factor that describe well previous results at z&lt;2. This suggests that different and/or much stronger processes affect low mass systems during the epoch of reionization. The measured logarithmic slope (0.25) and scatter (0.23 dex) are non-evolving. We discuss the remarkable consistency of the slope and scatter over cosmic time in the context of the galaxy-halo connection.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently discovered a new population of objects at high redshift referred to as `Little Red Dots' (LRDs). Their nature currently remains elusive, despite their surprisingly high inferred number densities. This emerging population of red point-like sources is reshaping our view of the early Universe and may shed light on the formation of high-redshift supermassive black holes. Here we present a spectroscopically confirmed LRD CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 at z_{\rm spec}=8.6319\pm 0.0005 hosting an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), using JWST data. This source shows the typical spectral shape of an LRD (blue UV and red optical continuum, unresolved in JWST imaging), along with broad H\beta line emission, detection of high-ionization emission lines (CIV, NIV]) and very high electron temperature indicative of the presence of AGN. This is also combined with a very low metallicity (Z&lt;0.1 Z_\odot). The presence of all these diverse features in one source makes CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 unique. We show that the inferred black hole mass of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 (M_{\rm BH}=1.0^{+0.6}_{-0.4}\times 10^{8}\rm ~M_\odot) strongly challenges current standard theoretical models and simulations of black hole formation, and forces us to adopt `ad hoc' prescriptions. Indeed if massive seeds, or light seeds with super-Eddington accretion, are considered, the observed BH mass of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 at z=8.6 can be reproduced. Moreover, the black hole is over-massive compared to its host, relative to the local M_{\rm BH}-M_* relations, pointing towards an earlier and faster evolution of the black hole compared to its host galaxy.

### 5) [2410.21543](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21543v1): Improving photometric redshifts of Epoch of Reionization galaxies: a new transmission curve with the neutral hydrogen damped Lyα absorption

<p>
We present a new analytical model for the attenuation to Epoch of Reionization (EoR) galaxies by proximate neutral hydrogen gas. Many galaxy spectra in the EoR taken by JWST have shown a flux deficit at wavelengths just redward of the Lyman break, and this has been regarded as resulting from Ly\alpha damping wing absorption by the increasing amount of neutral hydrogen in the line-of-sight. However, previous attenuation models for the intergalactic medium (IGM) commonly used in photometric redshift template-fitting codes assume that the Lyman break is rather sharp, which leads to systematic overestimation of photometric redshifts at z&gt;7. In this letter, we build and empirically calibrate a new attenuation model that takes the increased Ly\alpha damping wing absorption into account. Our model consists of the canonical IGM absorption and an additional absorption component due to dense neutral hydrogen gas clouds proximate to the galaxy, and we derive the redshift evolution of HI column density of the proximate clouds by calibrating the model using CANUCS JWST observations. The resulting total transmission curve resolves the photometric redshift bias at z&gt;7, an improvement that is robust to choice of template-fitting code, template set, and photometric catalog used. The new attenuation model can be easily implemented in existing template-fitting codes, and significantly improves the photometric redshift performance in the EoR.

### 6) [2410.16354](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16354v1): Galaxy Size and Mass Build-up in the First 2 Gyrs of Cosmic History from Multi-Wavelength JWST NIRCam Imaging

<p>
The evolution of galaxy sizes in different wavelengths provides unique insights on galaxy build-up across cosmic epochs. Such measurements can now finally be done at z&gt;3 thanks to the exquisite spatial resolution and multi-wavelength capability of the JWST. With the public data from the CEERS, PRIMER-UDS, and PRIMER-COSMOS surveys, we measure the sizes of ~ 3500 star-forming galaxies at 3 \leqslant z&lt;9, in 7 NIRCam bands using the multi-wavelength model fitting code GalfitM. The size-mass relation is measured in four redshift bins, across all NIRCam bands. We find that, the slope and intrinsic scatter of the rest-optical size-mass relation are constant across this redshift range and consistent with previous HST-based studies at low-z. When comparing the relations across different wavelengths, the average rest-optical and rest-UV relations are consistent with each other up to z=6, but the intrinsic scatter is largest in rest-UV wavelengths compared to rest-optical and redder bands. This behaviour is independent of redshift and we speculate that it is driven by bursty star-formation in z&gt;4 galaxies. Additionally, for 3\leqslant z&lt;4 star-forming galaxies at \rm M_* &gt; 10^{10} M_{\odot}, we find smaller rest-\rm 1\rm\,&mu; m sizes in comparison to rest-optical (and rest-UV) sizes, suggestive of colour gradients. When comparing to simulations, we find agreement over \rm M_* \approx 10^{9} - 10^{10} M_{\odot} but beyond this mass, the observed size-mass relation is significantly steeper. Our results show the power of JWST/NIRCam to provide new constraints on galaxy formation models.

<p>
The dearth of high quality spectroscopy of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) -- the main drivers of the assembly of dust and stellar mass at the peak of activity in the Universe -- greatly hinders our ability to interpret their physical processes and evolutionary pathways. We present JWST/NIRSpec observations from RUBIES of four submillimeter-selected, ALMA-detected DSFGs at cosmic noon, z~2.3-2.7. While photometry uniformly suggests vigorous ongoing star formation for the entire sample in line with canonical DSFGs, the spectra differ: one source has spectroscopic evidence of an evolved stellar population, indicating a recent transition to a post-starburst phase, while the remainder show strong spectroscopic signatures of ongoing starbursts. All four galaxies are infrared-luminous (log_{10}L_{\rm{IR}}/L_{\rm \odot} &gt;12.4), massive (log_{10}\,M_\star/M_{\rm \odot} &gt;11), and very dust-obscured (A_V~3-4 ABmag). Leveraging detections of multiple Balmer and Paschen lines, we derive an optical attenuation curve consistent with Calzetti overall, yet an optical extinction ratio R_V~2.5, potentially indicating smaller dust grains or differences in star-dust geometry. This case study provides some of the first detailed spectroscopic evidence that the DSFGs encompass a heterogeneous sample spanning a range of star formation properties and evolutionary stages, and illustrates the advantages of synergistic JWST and ALMA analysis of DSFGs.

<p>
JWST has revealed an abundance of compact, red objects at z\approx5-8 dubbed "little red dots" (LRDs), whose SEDs display a faint blue UV continuum followed by a steep rise in the optical. Despite extensive study of their characteristic V-shaped SEDs, the nature of LRDs remains unknown. We present a new analysis of the NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum of A2744-QSO1, a triply imaged LRD at z=7.04 from the UNCOVER survey. The spectrum shows a strong Balmer break and broad Balmer emission lines, both of which are difficult to explain with models invoking exclusively AGN or stellar contributions. Our fiducial model decomposes the spectrum into a post-starburst galaxy dominating the UV-optical continuum and a reddened AGN being sub-dominant at all wavelength and contributing at ~20&percnt; level. However, our most credible model infers a stellar mass of M_\star\approx 4\times10^9\,\mathrm{M_\odot} within a radius of r_\mathrm{e}&lt;30\,pc, driving its central density to the highest among observations to date. This high central density could be explained if A2744-QSO-1 is the early-forming core of a modern-day massive elliptical galaxy that later puffed up via the inside-out growth channel. The models also necessitate an unusually steep dust law to preserve the strong break strength, though this steepness may be explained by a deficit of large dust grains. It is also probable that these challenges reflect our ignorance of A2744-QSO1's true nature. Future variability and reverberation mapping studies could help disentangle the galaxy and AGN contribution to the continuum, and deeper redder observations could also unveil the dust properties in LRDs.

<p>
We present the formation histories of 19 massive (\gtrsim3\times10^{10}\text{M}_\odot) quiescent galaxy candidates at z~3.0-4.5 observed using JWST/NIRSpec. This completes the spectroscopic confirmation of the 24 K-selected quiescent galaxy sample from the ZFOURGE and 3DHST surveys \citep{Schreiber2018}. Utilizing Prism 1-5&mu;m spectroscopy, we confirm that all 12 sources that eluded confirmation by ground-based spectroscopy lie at z&gt;3, resulting in a spectroscopically confirmed number density of ~1.4\times10^{-5}\text{Mpc}^{-3} between z~3-4. Rest-frame U-V vs V-J color selections show high effectiveness in identifying quiescent galaxies, with a purity of ~90&percnt;. Our analysis shows that parametric star-formation histories (SFHs) from FAST++ and binned SFHs from Prospector on average yield consistent results, revealing diverse formation and quenching times. The oldest galaxy formed ~6\times10^{10}\text{M}_\odot by z~10 and has been quiescent for over 1 Gyr at z~3.2. We detect two galaxies with ongoing star formation and six with active galactic nuclei (AGN). We demonstrate that the choice of stellar population models, stellar libraries, wavelength range, and nebular or AGN contributions does not significantly affect the derived average SFHs of the galaxies. The assumed SFH prior, however, influences the star formation rate at early times, where spectral diagnostic power is limited. Simulated z~3 quiescent galaxies from IllustrisTNG, SHARK, and Magneticum broadly match the average SFHs of the observed sample but struggle to capture the full diversity, particularly at early stages. Our results emphasize the need for mechanisms that rapidly build stellar mass and quench star formation within the first billion years of the Universe.

Dwarf galaxies hold the key to crucial frontiers of astrophysics, however, their faintness renders spectroscopy challenging. Here we present the JWST Cycle 2 survey, All the Little Things (ALT, PID 3516), which is designed to seek late-forming Pop III stars and the drivers of reionization at z~6-7. ALT has acquired the deepest NIRCam grism spectroscopy yet (7-27 hr), at JWST's most sensitive wavelengths (3-4 &mu;m), covering the powerful lensing cluster Abell 2744. Over the same 30 arcmin^2, ALT's ultra-deep F070W+F090W imaging (~30 mag) enables selection of very faint sources at z&gt;6. We demonstrate the success of ALT's novel ``butterfly" mosaic to solve spectral confusion and contamination, and introduce the ``Allegro" method for emission line identification. By collecting spectra for every source in the field of view, ALT has measured precise (R~1600) redshifts for 1630 sources at z=0.2-8.5. This includes one of the largest samples of distant dwarf galaxies: [1015, 475, 50] sources less massive than the SMC, Fornax, and Sculptor with \log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})&lt;[8.5, 7.5, 6.5]. We showcase ALT's discovery space with: (i) spatially resolved spectra of lensed clumps in galaxies as faint as M_{\rm{UV}}~-15; (ii) large-scale clustering -- overdensities at z=[2.50, 2.58, 3.97, 4.30, 5.66, 5.77, 6.33] hosting massive galaxies with striking Balmer breaks; (iii) small-scale clustering -- a system of satellites around a Milky Way analog at z~6; (iv) spectroscopically confirmed multiple images that help constrain the lensing model underlying all science in this legacy field; (v) sensitive star-formation maps based on dust-insensitive tracers such as Pa\alpha; (vi) direct spectroscopic discovery of rare sources such as AGN with ionized outflows. These results provide a powerful proof of concept for how grism surveys maximize the potential of strong lensing fields.

This represents the largest on-sky time investment of any Cycle 1 GO extragalactic NIRCam imaging program by nearly a factor of 2. The survey includes ~432 sq arcmin of novel sky area not yet observed with JWST using at least 6 NIRCam broad-band filters, increasing the existing area covered by similar Cycle 1 data by ~60%. 70 square arcmin was also covered by a 7th filter (F410M). A fraction of PANORAMIC data (~200 sq arcmin) was obtained in or around extragalactic deep-fields, enhancing their legacy value. Pure parallel observing naturally creates a wedding cake survey with both wide and ultra-deep tiers, with 5\sigma point source depths at F444W ranging from 27.8-29.4 (ABmag), and with minimized cosmic variance. The 6+ filter observing setup yields remarkably good photometric redshift performance, achieving similar median scatter and outlier fraction as CANDELS (\sigma_{\rm NMAD}~0.07; \eta~0.2), which enables a wealth of science across redshift without the need for followup or ancillary data. We overview the proposed survey, the data obtained as part of this program, and document the science-ready data products in the first data release. PANORAMIC has delivered wide-area and deep imaging with excellent photometric performance, demonstrating that pure parallel observations with JWST are a highly efficient observing mode that is key to acquiring a complete picture of galaxy evolution from rare bright galaxies to fainter, more abundant sources at all redshifts.

We present the properties of a massive, large, dusty, metal-rich, star-forming galaxy at z_spec=6.73. GOODSN-100182 was observed with JWST/NIRSpec as part of the AURORA survey, and is also covered by public multi-wavelength HST and JWST imaging. While the large mass of GOODSN-100182 (~10^10 M_sun) was indicated prior to JWST, NIRCam rest-optical imaging now reveals the presence of an extended disk (r_eff~1.5 kpc). In addition, the NIRSpec R~1000 spectrum of GOODSN-100182 includes the detection of a large suite of rest-optical nebular emission lines ranging in wavelength from [OII]3727 up to [NII]6583. The ratios of Balmer lines suggest significant dust attenuation (E(B-V)_gas=0.40+0.10/-0.09), consistent with the red rest-UV slope inferred for GOODSN-100182 (beta=-0.50+/-0.09). The star-formation rate based on dust-corrected H-alpha emission is log(SFR(H-alpha)/ M_sun/yr)=2.02+0.13/-0.14, well above the z~7 star-forming main sequence in terms of specific SFR. Strikingly, the ratio of [NII]6583/H-alpha emission suggests almost solar metallicity, as does the ratio ([OIII]5007/H-beta)/([NII]6583/H-alpha) and the detection of the faint [FeII]4360 emission feature, whereas the [OIII]5007/[OII]3727 ratio suggests roughly 50% solar metallicity. Overall, the excitation and ionization properties of GOODSN-100182 more closely resemble those of typical star-forming galaxies at z~2-3 rather than z~7. Based on public spectroscopy of the GOODS-N field, we find that GOODSN-100182 resides within a significant galaxy overdensity, and is accompanied by a spectroscopically-confirmed neighbor galaxy. GOODSN-100182 demonstrates the existence of mature, chemically-enriched galaxies within the first billion years of cosmic time, whose properties must be explained by galaxy formation models.

The H{\alpha} nebular emission line is an optimal tracer for recent star formation in galaxies. With the advent of JWST, this line has recently become observable at z&gt;3 for the first time. We present a catalog of 1013 H{\alpha} emitters at 3.7&lt;z&lt;6.7 in the GOODS fields obtained from a blind search in JWST NIRCam/grism data. We make use of the FRESCO survey's 124 arcmin^2 of observations in GOODS-North and GOODS-South with the F444W filter, probing H{\alpha} at 4.9&lt;z&lt;6.7; and the CONGRESS survey's 62 arcmin^2 in GOODS-North with F356W, probing H{\alpha} at 3.8&lt;z&lt;5.1. We find an overdensity with 97 sources at z~4.4 in GOODS-N and confirm previously reported overdensities at z~5.2 in GOODS-N and at z~5.4 and z~5.9 in GOODS-S. We compute the observed H{\alpha} luminosity functions (LFs) in three bins centered at z~4.45, 5.30, and 6.15, which are the first such measurements at z&gt;3 obtained based purely on spectroscopic data, robustly tracing galaxy star formation rates (SFRs) beyond the peak of the cosmic star formation history. We compare our results with theoretical predictions from three different simulations and find good agreement at z~4-6. The UV LFs of this spectroscopically-confirmed sample are in good agreement with pre-JWST measurements obtained with photometrically-selected objects. Finally, we derive SFR functions and integrate these to compute the evolution of the cosmic star-formation rate densities across z~4-6, finding values in good agreement with recent UV estimates from Lyman-break galaxies, which imply a continuous decrease in SFR density by a factor of 3x over z~4 to z~6. Our work shows the power of NIRCam grism observations to efficiently provide new tests for early galaxy formation models based on emission line statistics.

JWST has revealed diverse new populations of high-redshift (z~4-11) AGN and extreme star-forming galaxies that challenge current models. In this paper, we use rest-frame UV emission-line diagnostics to identify AGN candidates and other exceptional ionizing sources, complementing previous studies predominantly focused on broad-line AGN. In this paper, we use rest-frame UV emission-line diagnostics to identify AGN candidates and other exceptional ionizing sources, complementing previous studies predominantly focused on broad-line AGN. From a parent sample of 205 \mathrm{z_{spec}}&gt;3 UNCOVER galaxies with NIRSpec/PRISM follow-up, we identify 12 C IV, He II, and C III] emitters. Leveraging the combined rest-optical and UV coverage of PRISM, we limit the emission-line model space using the sample's [O III]/H\beta distribution, significantly decreasing the overlap between AGN and star-formation models in the UV diagnostics. We then find that the five He II emitters are the strongest AGN candidates, with further support from two [Ne V] detections and one X-ray detection from Chandra. We cannot robustly quantify the AGN fraction in this sample, but we note that close to 20% of \mathrm{M_{*}&gt;2\times10^{9}\,M_{\odot}} parent sample galaxies are AGN candidates. The lower-mass line emitters, which are consistent with both AGN and star-forming photoionization models, have more compact sizes and higher specific star formation rates than the parent sample. Higher-resolution and deeper data on these UV line emitters should provide much stronger constraints on the obscured AGN fraction at z &gt; 3.

<p>
We present the Red Unknowns: Bright Infrared Extragalactic Survey (RUBIES), providing JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of red sources selected across ~150 arcmin^2 from public JWST/NIRCam imaging in the UDS and EGS fields. RUBIES novel observing strategy offers a well-quantified selection function: the survey is optimised to reach high (&gt;70%) completeness for bright and red (F150W-F444W&gt;2) sources that are very rare. To place these rare sources in context, we simultaneously observe a reference sample of the 2&lt;z&lt;7 galaxy population, sampling sources at a rate that is inversely proportional to their number density in the 3D space of F444W magnitude, F150W-F444W colour, and photometric redshift. In total, RUBIES observes ~3000 targets across 1&lt;z_{phot}&lt;10 with both the PRISM and G395M dispersers, and ~1500 targets at z_{phot}&gt;3 using only the G395M disperser. The RUBIES data reveal a highly diverse population of red sources that span a broad redshift range (z_{spec}~1-9), with photometric redshift scatter and outlier fraction that are 3 times higher than for similarly bright sources that are less red. This diversity is not apparent from the photometric SEDs. Only spectroscopy reveals that the SEDs encompass a mixture of galaxies with dust-obscured star formation, extreme line emission, a lack of star formation indicating early quenching, and luminous active galactic nuclei. As a first demonstration of our broader selection function we compare the stellar masses and rest-frame U-V colours of the red sources and our reference sample: red sources are typically more massive (M_*~10^{10-11.5} M_\odot) across all redshifts. However, we find that the most massive systems span a wide range in U-V colour. We describe our data reduction procedure and data quality, and publicly release the reduced RUBIES data and vetted spectroscopic redshifts of the first half of the survey through the DJA.

### 16) [2409.03829](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03829v1): RUBIES Reveals a Massive Quiescent Galaxy at z=7.3

<p>
We report the spectroscopic discovery of a massive quiescent galaxy at z_{\rm spec}=7.29\pm0.01, just ~700\,Myr after the Big Bang. RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 was selected from public JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging from the PRIMER survey and observed with JWST/NIRSpec as part of RUBIES. The NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum reveals one of the strongest Balmer breaks observed thus far at z&gt;6, no emission lines, but tentative Balmer and Ca absorption features, as well as a Lyman break. Simultaneous modeling of the NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum and NIRCam and MIRI photometry (spanning 0.9-18\,&mu;m) shows that the galaxy formed a stellar mass of log(M_*/M_\odot)=10.23^{+0.04}_{-0.04} in a rapid ~ 100-200\,Myr burst of star formation at z~8-9, and ceased forming stars by z~8 resulting in \log \rm{sSFR/yr}^{-1}&lt;-10. We measure a small physical size of 209_{-24}^{+33}\,{\rm pc}, which implies a high stellar mass surface density within the effective radius of \log(\Sigma_{*,\rm e}/{\rm M_\odot\,kpc}^{-2})=10.85_{-0.12}^{+0.11} comparable to the densities measured in quiescent galaxies at z~2-5. The 3D stellar mass density profile of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 is remarkably similar to the central densities of local massive ellipticals, suggesting that at least some of their cores may have already been in place at z&gt;7. The discovery of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 has strong implications for galaxy formation models: the estimated number density of quiescent galaxies at z~7 is &gt;100\times larger than predicted from any model to date, indicating that quiescent galaxies have formed earlier than previously expected.

We release fully reduced spectra obtained with NIRSpec onboard JWST as part of the GLASS-JWST Early Release Science Program and a follow-up Director's Discretionary Time program 2756. From these 263 spectra of 245 unique sources, acquired with low (R =30-300) and high dispersion (R~2700) gratings, we derive redshifts for 200 unique sources in the redshift range z=0-10. We describe the sample selection and characterize its high completeness as a function of redshift and apparent magnitude. Comparison with independent estimates based on different methods and instruments shows that the redshifts are accurate, with 80&percnt; differing less than 0.005. We stack the GLASS-JWST spectra to produce the first high-resolution (R ~ 2700) JWST spectral template extending in the rest frame wavelength from 2000~&#8491;\ to 20, 000~&#8491;. Catalogs, reduced spectra, and template are made publicly available to the community.

### 18) [2408.07745](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07745v2): The Small Sizes and High Implied Densities of `Little Red Dots' with Balmer Breaks Could Explain Their Broad Emission Lines Without an AGN

<p>
Early JWST studies found an apparent population of massive, compact galaxies at redshifts z\gtrsim7. Recently three of these galaxies were shown to have prominent Balmer breaks, demonstrating that their light at \lambda_{\rm rest} ~ 3500 \r{A} is dominated by a stellar population that is relatively old (~200 Myr). All three also have broad H\beta emission with \sigma &gt; 1000 \,\rm km s^{-1}, a common feature of such `little red dots'. From S\'ersic profile fits to the NIRCam images in F200W we find that the stellar light of galaxies is extremely compact: the galaxies have half-light radii of r_{\rm e}~ 100 pc, in the regime of ultra compact dwarfs in the nearby Universe. Their masses are uncertain, as they depend on the contribution of possible light from an AGN to the flux at \lambda_{\rm rest}&gt;5000 \r{A}. If the AGN contribution is low beyond the Balmer break region, the masses are M_* ~ 10^{10}-10^{11}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}, and the central densities are higher than those of any other known galaxy population by an order of magnitude. Interestingly, the implied velocity dispersions of ~1500 kms^{-1} are in very good agreement with the measured H\beta line widths. We suggest that some of the broad lines in `little red dots' are not due to AGNs but simply reflect the kinematics of the galaxies, and speculate that the galaxies are observed in a short-lived phase where the central densities are much higher than at later times. We stress, however, that the canonical interpretation of AGNs causing the broad H\beta lines also remains viable.

We use JWST/NIRSpec observations from the Assembly of Ultradeep Rest-optical Observations Revealing Astrophysics (AURORA) survey to constrain the shape of the nebular attenuation curve of a star-forming galaxy at z=4.41, GOODSN-17940. We utilize 11 unblended HI recombination lines to derive the attenuation curve spanning optical to near-infrared wavelengths (3751-9550 \r{A}). We then leverage a high-S/N spectroscopic detection of the rest-frame ultraviolet continuum in combination with rest-UV photometric measurements to constrain the shape of the curve at ultraviolet wavelengths. While this UV constraint is predominantly based on stellar emission, the large measured equivalent widths of H\alpha and H\beta indicate that GOODSN-17940 is dominated by an extremely young stellar population &lt;10 Myr in age such that the UV stellar continuum experiences the same attenuation as the nebular emission. The resulting combined nebular attenuation curve spans 1400-9550 \r{A} and has a shape that deviates significantly from commonly assumed dust curves in high-redshift studies. Relative to the Milky Way, SMC, and Calzetti curves, the new curve has a steeper slope at long wavelengths (\lambda&gt;5000 \r{A}) while displaying a similar slope across blue-optical wavelengths (\lambda=3750-5000 \r{A}). In the ultraviolet, the new curve is shallower than the SMC and Calzetti curves and displays no significant 2175 \r{A} bump. This work demonstrates that the most commonly assumed dust curves are not appropriate for all high-redshift galaxies. These results highlight the ability to derive nebular attenuation curves for individual high-redshift sources with deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy, thereby improving the accuracy of physical properties inferred from nebular emission lines.

We present the design and observations of low resolution JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy from the Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) Cycle 1 JWST Treasury program. Targets are selected using JWST/NIRCam photometry from UNCOVER and other programs, and cover a wide range of categories and redshifts to ensure the legacy value of the survey. These categories include the first galaxies at z\gtrsim10, faint galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization (z~6-8), high redshift AGN (z\gtrsim6), Population III star candidates, distant quiescent and dusty galaxies (1\lesssim z \lesssim 6), and filler galaxies sampling redshift--color--magnitude space from z~ 0.1-13. Seven NIRSpec MSA masks across the extended Abell 2744 cluster were observed, along with NIRCam parallel imaging in 8 filters (F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M, F444W, F480M) over a total area of ~26 arcmin^2, overlapping existing HST coverage from programs including the Hubble Frontier Fields and BUFFALO. We successfully observed 553 objects down to m_{\mathrm{F444W}}~30\mathrm{AB}, and by leveraging mask overlaps, we reach total on-target exposure times ranging from 2.4-16.7h. We demonstrate the success rate and distribution of confirmed redshifts, and also highlight the rich information revealed by these ultradeep spectra for a subset of our targets. An updated lens model of Abell 2744 is also presented, including 14 additional spectroscopic redshifts and finding a total cluster mass of M_{\mathrm{SL}}=(2.1\pm0.3)\times10^{15}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}. We publicly release reduced 1D and 2D spectra for all objects observed in Summer 2023 along with a spectroscopic redshift catalog and the updated lens model of the cluster (https://jwst-uncover.github.io/DR4.html).

<p>
The mass-metallicity relation (MZR) provides crucial insights into the baryon cycle in galaxies and provides strong constraints on galaxy formation models. We use \jwst\ NIRSpec observations from the UNCOVER program to measure the gas-phase metallicity in a sample of eight galaxies during the epoch of reionization at z=6-8. Thanks to the strong lensing of the galaxy cluster Abell 2744, we are able to probe extremely low stellar masses between 10^{6} and 10^{8}\msol. Using strong lines diagnostics and the most recent \jwst\ calibrations, we derive extremely-low oxygen abundances ranging from 12+log(O/H) = 6.7 to 7.8. By combining this sample with more massive galaxies at similar redshifts, we derive a best-fit relation of 12+{\rm log(O/H)} = -0.076_{-0.03}^{+0.03} \times ({\rm log}(M_{\star}))^2+ 1.61_{-0.52}^{+0.52}\times {\rm log}(M_{\star})-0.26_{-0.10}^{+0.10}, which becomes steeper than determinations at z ~ 3-6 towards low-mass galaxies. Our results show a clear redshift evolution in the overall normalization of the relation, galaxies at higher redshift having significantly lower metallicities at a given mass. A comparison with theoretical models provides important constraints on which physical processes, such as metal mixing, star formation or feedback recipes, are important in reproducing the observations. Additionally, these galaxies exhibit star formation rates that are higher by a factor of a few to tens compared to extrapolated relations at similar redshifts or theoretical predictions of main-sequence galaxies, pointing to a recent burst of star formation. All these observations are indicative of highly stochastic star formation and ISM enrichment, expected in these low-mass systems, suggesting that feedback mechanisms in high-z dwarf galaxies might be different from those in place at higher masses.

### 22) [2407.06287](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06287v1): A massive, neutral gas reservoir permeating a galaxy proto-cluster after the reionization era

<p>
Galaxy clusters are the most massive, gravitationally-bound structures in the Universe, emerging through hierarchical structure formation of large-scale dark matter and baryon overdensities. Early galaxy ``proto-clusters'' are believed to be important physical drivers of the overall cosmic star-formation rate density and serve as ``hotspots'' for the reionization of the intergalactic medium. Our understanding of the formation of these structures at the earliest cosmic epochs is, however, limited to sparse observations of their galaxy members, or based on phenomenological models and cosmological simulations. Here we report the detection of a massive neutral, atomic hydrogen (HI) gas reservoir permeating a galaxy proto-cluster at redshift z=5.4, observed one billion years after the Big Bang. The presence of this cold gas is revealed by strong damped Lyman-\alpha absorption features observed in several background galaxy spectra taken with JWST/NIRSpec in close on-sky projection. While overall the sightlines probe a large range in HI column densities, N_{\rm HI} = 10^{21.7}-10^{23.5} cm^{-2}, they are similar across nearby sightlines, demonstrating that they probe the same dense, neutral gas. This observation of a massive, large-scale overdensity of cold neutral gas challenges current large-scale cosmological simulations and has strong implications for the reionization topology of the Universe.

### 23) [2407.03399](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03399v1): A spectroscopic analysis of the ionizing photon production efficiency in JADES and CEERS: implications for the ionizing photon budget

<p> Anthony J. Pahl, Michael W. Topping, Alice Shapley, Ryan Sanders, Naveen A. Reddy, Leonardo Clarke, Emily Kehoe, Trinity Bento, Gabe Brammer </p>
<p>
We have used a combined sample of JADES and CEERS objects in order to constrain ionizing photon production efficiency (\xi_{\rm ion}) from JWST/NIRSpec and JWST/NIRCam data. We examine 163 objects at 1.06 &lt; z &lt; 6.71 with significant (3\sigma) spectroscopic detections of H\alpha and H\beta in order to constrain intrinsic H\alpha luminosities corrected from nebular dust attenuation via Balmer decrements. We constrain dust-corrected UV luminosities from best-fit spectral-energy distribution modeling. We find a sample median log_{10}(\xi{\rm ion,0}/erg Hz^{-1}) = 25.29^{+0.29}_{-0.37}, assuming f_{\rm esc}=0 for the escape fraction of Lyman continuum emission. We find significant correlation between \xi_{\rm ion,0} and z, with 17 objects at z &gt; 4.64 having median log_{10}(\xi_{\rm ion,0}/erg Hz^{-1}) = 25.38^{+0.38}){-0.38}, with those below having log_{10}(\xi_{\rm ion,0}/erg Hz^{-1}) = 25.24^{+0.30}_{-0.33}. We also find significant, positive correlations between \xi_{\rm ion,0} and LUV; W{\lambda}([O iii]); [O iii]{\lambda}5007/[O ii]{\lambda}{\lambda}3726, 3729; and inverse correlations with metallicity. In contrast with some previous results, we find no trends between \xi_{\rm ion,0} and stellar mass, stellar dust attenuation, or UV slope. Applying a multivariate fit to \xi_{\rm ion,0}, z, and MUV to an empirically-motivated model of reionization, and folding in f_{\rm esc} estimates from direct observations of the Lyman continuum at z ~ 3 from the Keck Lyman Continuum Spectroscopic survey, we find that the number of ionizing photons entering the IGM causes reionization to end at z ~ 5 - 7.

<p>
We present the stellar metallicities and multi-element abundances (C, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Fe) of 15 massive (log M/M_\odot=10.2-11.2) quiescent galaxies at z=1-3, derived from ultradeep JWST-SUSPENSE spectra. Compared to quiescent galaxies at z~0, these galaxies exhibit a deficiency of 0.26\pm0.04 dex in [C/H], 0.16\pm0.03 dex in [Fe/H], and 0.07\pm0.04 dex in [Mg/H], implying rapid formation and quenching before significant enrichment from asymptotic giant branch stars and Type Ia supernovae. Additionally, we find that galaxies forming at higher redshift consistently show higher [Mg/Fe] and lower [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], regardless of their observed redshift. The evolution in [Fe/H] and [C/H] is therefore primarily driven by lower-redshift samples naturally including galaxies with longer star-formation timescales. In contrast, the lower [Mg/H] likely reflects earlier-forming galaxies expelling larger gas reservoirs during their quenching phase. Consequently, the mass-metallicity relation, primarily reflecting [Mg/H], is somewhat lower at z=1-3 compared to the lower redshift relation. Finally, we compare our results to standard stellar population modeling approaches employing solar abundance patterns and non-parametric star-formation histories (using Prospector). Our SSP-equivalent ages agree with the mass-weighted ages from Prospector, while the metallicities disagree significantly. Nonetheless, the metallicities better reflect [Fe/H] than total [Z/H]. We also find that star-formation timescales inferred from elemental abundances are significantly shorter than those from Prospector, and we discuss the resulting implications for the early formation of massive galaxies.

<p>
We present results on the emission-line properties of z=1.4-7.5 star-forming galaxies in the Assembly of Ultradeep Rest-optical Observations Revealing Astrophysics (AURORA) Cycle 1 JWST/NIRSpec program. Based on its depth, continuous wavelength coverage from 1--5 microns, and medium spectral resolution (R~1000), AURORA includes detections of a large suite of nebular emission lines spanning a broad range in rest wavelength. We investigate the locations of AURORA galaxies in multiple different emission-line diagrams, including traditional "BPT" diagrams of [OIII]/Hbeta vs. [NII]/Halpha, [SII]/Halpha, and [OI]/Halpha, and the "ionization-metallicity" diagram of [OIII]/[OII] (O32) vs. ([OIII]+[OII])/Hbeta (R23). We also consider a bluer rest-frame "ionization-metallicity" diagram introduced recently to characterize z&gt;10 galaxies: [NeIII]/[OII] vs. ([NeIII]+[OII])/Hdelta; as well as longer-wavelength diagnostic diagrams extending into the rest-frame near-IR: [OIII]/Hbeta vs. [SIII]/[SII] (S32); and HeI/Pagamma and [SIII]/Pagamma vs. [FeII]/Pabeta. With a significant boost in signal-to-noise and large, representative samples of individual galaxy detections, the AURORA emission-line diagrams presented here definitively confirm a physical picture in which chemically-young, alpha-enhanced, massive stars photoionize the ISM in distant galaxies with a harder ionizing spectrum at fixed nebular metallicity than in their z~0 counterparts. We also uncover previously unseen evolution prior to z~2 in the [OIII]/Hbeta vs. [NII]/Halpha diagram, which motivates deep NIRSpec observations at even higher redshift. Finally, we present the first statistical sample of rest-frame near-IR emission-line diagnostics in star-forming galaxies at high redshift. In order to truly interpret rest-frame near-IR line ratios including [FeII], we must obtain better constraints on dust depletion in the high-redshift ISM.

### 26) [2406.17756](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17756v2): The Size-Mass relation at Rest-Frame 1.5μm from JWST/NIRCam in the COSMOS-WEB and PRIMER-COSMOS fields

<p>
We present the galaxy stellar mass - size relation in the rest-frame near-IR (1.5~&mu;{\text{m}}) and its evolution with redshift up to z=2.5. S\'ersic profiles are measured for ~ 26\,000 galaxies with stellar masses M_\star &gt; 10^9~{\text{M}}_\odot from JWST/NIRCam F277W and F444W imaging provided by the COSMOS-WEB and PRIMER surveys, using coordinates, redshifts, colors and stellar mass estimates from the COSMOS2020 catalog. The new rest-frame near-IR effective radii are generally smaller than previously measured rest-frame optical sizes, on average by 0.14~dex, with no significant dependence on redshift. For quiescent galaxies this size offset does not depend on stellar mass, but for star-forming galaxies the offset increases from -0.1~dex at M_\star = 10^{9.5}~{\text{M}}_\odot to -0.25~dex at M_\star &gt; 10^{11}~{\text{M}}_\odot. That is, we find that the near-IR stellar mass - size relation for star-forming galaxies is flatter in the rest-frame near-IR than in the rest-frame optical at all redshifts 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5. The general pace of size evolution is the same in the near-IR as previously demonstrated in the optical, with slower evolution (R_{\text{e}} \propto (1+z)^{-0.7}) for L^*~star-forming galaxies and faster evolution (R_{\text{e}} \propto (1+z)^{-1.3}) for L^*~quiescent galaxies. Massive (M_\star&gt;10^{11}~{\text{M}}_\odot) star-forming galaxies evolve in size almost as fast as quiescent galaxies. Low-mass (M_\star&lt;10^{10}~{\text{M}}_\odot)~quiescent galaxies evolve as slow as star-forming galaxies. Our main conclusion is that the size evolution narrative as it has emerged over the past two decades does not radically change when accessing with JWST the rest-frame near-IR, a better proxy of the underlying stellar mass distribution.

Spatially resolved studies are key to understanding when, where, and how stars form within galaxies. Using slitless grism spectra and broadband imaging from the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS) we study the spatially resolved properties of a strongly lensed (&mu; = 5.4\pm1.8) z = 0.8718 galaxy pair consisting of a blue face-on galaxy (10.2 \pm 0.2 log(M/M_\odot)) with multiple star-forming clumps and a dusty red edge-on galaxy (9.9 \pm 0.3 log(M/M_\odot)). We produce accurate H\alpha maps from JWST/NIRISS grism data using a new methodology that accurately models spatially varying continuum and emission line strengths. With spatially resolved indicators, we probe star formation on timescales of ~ 10 Myr (NIRISS H\alpha emission line maps) and ~ 100 Myr (UV imaging and broadband SED fits). Taking the ratio of the H\alpha to UV flux (\eta), we measure spatially resolved star formation burstiness. We find that in the face-on galaxy both H\alpha and broadband star formation rates (SFRs) drop at large galactocentric radii by a factor of ~ 4.7 and 3.8 respectively, while SFR over the last ~ 100 Myrs has increased by a factor of 1.6. Additionally, of the 20 clumps identified in the galaxy pair we find that 7 are experiencing bursty star formation, while 10 clumps are quenching and 3 are in equilibrium (either being in a state of steady star formation or post-burst). Our analysis reveals that the blue face-on galaxy disk is predominantly in a quenching or equilibrium phase. However, the most intense quenching within the galaxy is seen in the quenching clumps. This pilot study demonstrates what JWST/NIRISS data can reveal about spatially varying star formation in galaxies at Cosmic Noon.

Strong gravitational lensing in galaxy clusters has become an essential tool in astrophysics, allowing us to directly probe the dark matter distribution and study magnified background sources. The precision and reliability of strong lensing models rely heavily on the number and quality of multiple images of background sources with spectroscopic redshifts. We present an updated strong lensing model of the galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1-2403 with the largest sample of multiple images with spectroscopic redshifts in a galaxy cluster field to date. Furthermore, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of JWST particularly its NIRISS camera, for strong lensing studies. We use the JWST 's NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec and NIRISS spectroscopy from the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). The cluster mass model is constrained using Lenstool software. Our new dataset, used for constraining the lens model, comprises 303 secure multiple images from 111 background sources and includes systems with previously known MUSE redshift and systems for which we obtained spectroscopic redshift for the first time using NIRISS and NIRSpec spectroscopy. The total number of secure spectroscopic systems is &gt;20% higher than in the previous strong lensing studies of this cluster. The derived strong lensing model can reproduce multiple images with the root-mean-square distance of 0.53''. We also provide a full catalogue with 415 multiple images, including less reliable candidates. We furthermore demonstrate the effectiveness of JWST particularly NIRISS, for strong lensing studies. As NIRISS F115W, F150W, and F200W grism spectroscopy captures at least two of the [OII] {\lambda}3727, [OIII] {\lambda}{\lambda}4959, 5007, and H{\alpha} lines at 1&lt;z&lt;3 (a redshift range particularly relevant for strong lensing studies) without target pre-selection, it complements MUSE and NIRSpec observations extremely well.

<p> Leonardo Clarke, Alice E. Shapley, Ryan L. Sanders, Michael W. Topping, Gabriel B. Brammer, Trinity Bento, Naveen A. Reddy, Emily Kehoe </p>
<p>
We have used public JWST/NIRSpec and JWST/NIRCam observations from the CEERS and JADES surveys in order to analyze the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) over the redshift range 1.4 \leq z &lt; 7. We calculate the star-formation rates (SFRs) of the galaxy sample using three approaches: Balmer line luminosity, spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, and UV luminosity. We find a larger degree of scatter about the SFMS using the Balmer-based SFRs compared to the UV-based SFRs. Because these SFR indicators are sensitive to star formation on different time scales, the difference in scatter may be evidence of bursty star-formation histories in the early universe. We additionally compare the H\alpha-to-UV luminosity ratio (L(H\alpha)/\nuL_{\nu,1600}) for individual galaxies in the sample and find that 29&percnt;-52&percnt; of the ratios across the sample are poorly described by predictions from a smooth star-formation history. Measuring the burstiness of star formation in the early universe has multiple significant implications, such as deriving accurate physical parameters from SED fitting, explaining the evolution of the UV luminosity function, and providing constraints for sub-grid models of feedback in simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.

<p>
We present an analysis of the JWST NIRCam and MIRI morphological properties of 80 massive (\log_{10}(M_\ast[M_{\odot}])=11.2\pm0.1) dusty star-forming galaxies at z=2.7^{+1.2}_{-0.7}, identified as sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs) by ALMA, that have been observed as part of the JWST PRIMER project. To compare the structure of these massive, active galaxies to more typical less actively star-forming galaxies, we define two comparison samples. The first of 850 field galaxies matched in specific star-formation rate and redshift and the second of 80 field galaxies matched in stellar mass. We identify 20\pm5% of the SMGs as candidate late-stage major mergers, a further 40\pm10% as potential minor mergers and 40\pm10% which have comparatively undisturbed disk-like morphologies, with no obvious massive neighbours. These rates are comparable to those for the field samples and indicate that the majority of the sub-millimetre-detected galaxies are not late-stage major mergers, but have interaction rates similar to the less-active population at z~2-3. We establish that SMGs have comparable near-infrared sizes to the less active populations, but exhibit lower S\'ersic indices, consistent with bulge-less disks and have more structured morphologies at 2&mu;m relative to 4&mu;m. We find evidence for dust reddening as the origin of the morphological differences between the populations, identifying a strong correlation between the F200W-F444W pixel colour and the 870&mu;m surface brightness. We conclude that SMGs and less active galaxies at the same epochs share a common disk-like structure, but the weaker bulge components of the SMGs results in a lower dynamical stability. Consequently, instabilities triggered either secularly or by minor external perturbations result in higher levels of activity (and dust content) in SMGs compared to typical star-forming galaxies.

With stunning clarity, JWST has revealed the Universe's first billion years. The scientific community is analyzing a wealth of JWST imaging and spectroscopic data from that era, and is in the process of rewriting the astronomy textbooks. Here, 1.5 years into the JWST science mission, we provide a snapshot of the great progress made towards understanding the initial chapters of our cosmic history. We highlight discoveries and breakthroughs, topics and issues that are not yet understood, and questions that will be addressed in the coming years, as JWST continues its revolutionary observations of the Early Universe.

### 32) [2405.05111](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05111v3): JWST FRESCO: a comprehensive census of Hβ+[OIII] emitters at 6.8&lt;z&lt;9.0 in the GOODS fields

<p>
We present the census of H\beta+[OIII] 4960,5008 &#8491; emitters at 6.8&lt;z&lt;9.0 from the JWST FRESCO survey over 124 arcmin^2 in the GOODS-North and GOODS-South fields. Our unbiased spectroscopic search results in 137 spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at 6.8&lt;z&lt;9.0 with observed [OIII] fluxes f_{[OIII]}\gtrsim 1\times 10^{-18}\ \rm{ergs}\ \rm{s}^{-1} \ \rm{cm}^{-2}. The rest-frame optical line ratios of the median stacked spectrum (median M_{\rm{UV}}=-19.65^{+0.59}_{-1.05}) indicate negligible dust attenuation, low metallicity (12+\log(\rm{O/H})= 7.2-7.7) and a high ionisation parameter \log_{10}U ~eq -2.5. We find a factor \times 1.3 difference in the number density of 6.8&lt;z&lt;9.0 galaxies between GOODS-South and GOODS-North, which is caused by a single overdensity at 7.0&lt;z&lt;7.2 in GOODS-North. The bright end of the UV luminosity function of spectroscopically-confirmed [OIII] emitters is in good agreement with HST dropout-selected samples. Discrepancies between the observed [OIII] LF, [OIII]/UV ratio and [OIII] equivalent widths, and that predicted by theoretical models, suggest burstier star-formation histories and/or more heterogeneous metallicity and ionising conditions in z&gt;7 galaxies. We report a rapid decline of the [OIII] luminosity density at z\gtrsim 6-7 which cannot be explained by the evolution of the cosmic star-formation rate density. Finally we find that FRESCO detects in only 2h galaxies likely accounting for ~ 10-20&percnt; of the ionising budget at z=7-8 (assuming an escape fraction of 10%), raising the prospect of directly detecting a significant fraction of the sources of reionisation with JWST.

### 33) [2405.01473](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01473v2): RUBIES: Evolved Stellar Populations with Extended Formation Histories at z ~ 7-8 in Candidate Massive Galaxies Identified with JWST/NIRSpec

<p>
The identification of red, apparently massive galaxies at z&gt;7 in early JWST photometry suggests a strongly accelerated timeline compared to standard models of galaxy growth. A major uncertainty in the interpretation is whether the red colors are caused by evolved stellar populations, dust, or other effects such as emission lines or AGN. Here we show that three of the massive galaxy candidates at z=6.7-8.4 have prominent Balmer breaks in JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy from the RUBIES program. The Balmer breaks demonstrate unambiguously that stellar emission dominates at \lambda_{\rm rest} = 0.4\,&mu;m, and require formation histories extending hundreds of Myr into the past in galaxies only 600--800 Myr after the Big Bang. Two of the three galaxies also show broad Balmer lines, with H\beta FWHM &gt;2500~{\rm km\,s^{-1}}, suggesting that dust-reddened AGN contribute to, or even dominate, the SEDs of these galaxies at \lambda_{\rm rest}\gtrsim 0.6\,&mu;m. All three galaxies have relatively narrow [O III] lines, seemingly ruling out a high-mass interpretation if the lines arise in dynamically-relaxed, inclined disks. Yet, the inferred masses also remain highly uncertain. We model the high-quality spectra using Prospector to decompose the continuum into stellar and AGN components, and explore limiting cases in stellar/AGN contribution. This produces a wide range of possible stellar masses, spanning M_\star ~ 10^9 - 10^{11}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}. Nevertheless, all fits suggest a very early and rapid formation, most of which follow with a truncation in star formation. Potential origins and evolutionary tracks for these objects are discussed, from the cores of massive galaxies to low-mass galaxies with over-massive black holes. Intriguingly, we find all of these explanations to be incomplete; deeper and redder data are needed to understand the physics of these systems.

<p>
We present the first results on the spatial distribution of star formation in 454 star-forming galaxies at 4.8&lt;z&lt;6.5 using H-Alpha emission-line maps and F444W imaging tracing the stellar continuum from JWST FRESCO NIRCam Slitless Spectroscopy. Star-forming galaxies with stellar masses 6.8\leqlog(M_{*}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})&lt;11.1 have positive H-Alpha equivalent width profiles, providing direct evidence for the inside-out growth of galaxies just after the epoch of reionisation. GALFIT is used to calculate half-light radii, R_{\mathrm{eff}} and central surface densities within 1 kiloparsec, \Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc}}. At a fixed stellar mass of log(M_{*}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})=9.5, \Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc, H}\alpha} is 1.04\pm0.05 times higher than \Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc, C}}, R_{\mathrm{eff, H}\alpha} is 1.18\pm0.03 times larger than R_{\mathrm{eff, C}} and both R_{\mathrm{eff}} measurements are less than 1 kiloparsec. These measurements suggest the rapid build-up of compact bulges just after the epoch of reionisation. By comparing to work done at lower redshifts with HST WFC3 Slitless Spectroscopy as part of the 3D-HST (z=1) and CLEAR (z=0.5) surveys, we find that R_{\mathrm{eff}}(z) evolves at the same pace for H\alpha and the continuum, but \Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc}}(z) evolves faster for H\alpha. As a function of the Hubble parameter, \frac{R_{\mathrm{eff, H}\alpha}}{R_{\mathrm{eff, C}}}=1.1h(z) and \frac{\Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc,H}\alpha}}{\Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc,C}}}=h(z)^{1.3}. These functions suggest that the inside-out growth of the disk dominates the inside-out growth of the bulge towards lower redshifts. This is supported by the redshift evolution in EW(H\alpha) profiles, where there is rapid increase in EW(H\alpha) with radius within the half-light radius at z=5.3 but only significantly increasing EW(H\alpha) with radius in the outer disk at z=0.5.

<p>
In this paper, we describe the "Medium Bands, Mega Science" JWST Cycle 2 survey (JWST-GO-4111) and demonstrate the power of these data to reveal both the spatially-integrated and spatially-resolved properties of galaxies from the local universe to the era of cosmic dawn. Executed in November 2023, MegaScience obtained ~30 arcmin^2 of deep multiband NIRCam imaging centered on the z~0.3 Abell 2744 cluster, including eleven medium-band filters and the two shortest-wavelength broad-band filters, F070W and F090W. Together, MegaScience and the UNCOVER Cycle 1 treasury program provide a complete set of deep (~28-30 mag) images in all NIRCam medium- and broad-band filters. This unique dataset allows us to precisely constrain photometric redshifts, map stellar populations and dust attenuation for large samples of distant galaxies, and examine the connection between galaxy structures and formation histories. MegaScience also includes ~17 arcmin^2 of NIRISS parallel imaging in two broad-band and four medium-band filters from 0.9-4.8um, expanding the footprint where robust spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting is possible. We provide example SEDs and multi-band cutouts at a variety of redshifts, and use a catalog of JWST spectroscopic redshifts to show that MegaScience improves both the scatter and catastrophic outlier rate of photometric redshifts by factors of 2-3. Additionally, we demonstrate the spatially-resolved science enabled by MegaScience by presenting maps of the [OIII] line emission and continuum emission in three spectroscopically-confirmed z&gt;6 galaxies. We show that line emission in reionization-era galaxies can be clumpy, extended, and spatially offset from continuum emission, implying that galaxy assembly histories are complex even at these early epochs. We publicly release fully reduced mosaics and photometric catalogs for both the NIRCam primary and NIRISS parallel fields.

### 36) [2404.12432](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12432v2): The JWST-SUSPENSE Ultradeep Spectroscopic Program: Survey Overview and Star-Formation Histories of Quiescent Galaxies at 1 &lt; z &lt; 3

Weisz </p>
<p>
We present an overview and first results from the Spectroscopic Ultradeep Survey Probing Extragalactic Near-infrared Stellar Emission (SUSPENSE), executed with NIRSpec on JWST. The primary goal of the SUSPENSE program is to characterize the stellar, chemical, and kinematic properties of massive quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon. In a single deep NIRSpec/MSA configuration, we target 20 distant quiescent galaxy candidates (z=1-3, H_{AB}\le23), as well as 53 star-forming galaxies at z=1-4. With 16~hr of integration and the G140M-F100LP dispersion-filter combination, we observe numerous Balmer and metal absorption lines for all quiescent candidates. We derive stellar masses (logM_*/M_{\odot}~10.2-11.5) and detailed star-formation histories (SFHs) and show that all 20 candidate quiescent galaxies indeed have quenched stellar populations. These galaxies show a variety of mass-weighted ages (0.8-3.3~Gyr) and star formation timescales (~0.5-4~Gyr), and four out of 20 galaxies were already quiescent by z=3. On average, the z&gt;1.75 [z&lt;1.75] galaxies formed 50&percnt; of their stellar mass before z=4 [z=3]. Furthermore, the typical SFHs of galaxies in these two redshift bins (z_{\text{mean}}=2.2~[1.3]) indicate that galaxies at higher redshift formed earlier and over shorter star-formation timescales compared to lower redshifts. Although this evolution is naturally explained by the growth of the quiescent galaxy population over cosmic time, number density calculations imply that mergers and/or late-time star formation also contribute to the evolution. In future work, we will further unravel the early formation, quenching, and late-time evolution of these galaxies by extending this work with studies on their chemical abundances, resolved stellar populations and kinematics.

### 37) [2404.10816](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10816v2): FRESCO: The Paschen-α Star Forming Sequence at Cosmic Noon

Whitaker, Stijn Wuyts, Gabriel Brammer, Danilo Marchesini, Michael V. Maseda, Rohan P. Naidu, Erica J. Nelson, Anna Velichko, Andrea Weibel, Mengyuan Xiao </p>
<p>
We present results from the JWST First Reionization Epoch Spectroscopically Complete Observations survey (FRESCO) on the star forming sequence of galaxies at 1.0&lt;z&lt;1.7, around the peak of the cosmic star formation history. Star formation rates (SFRs) are measured from the redshifted, nearly dust-insensitive Paschen-\alpha emission line, and stellar mass measurements include the F444W (4.4 &mu;m; rest-frame H) band. We find SFRs of galaxies with M*&gt;9.5 M_\odot that are lower than found in many earlier studies by up to 0.6 dex, but in good agreement with recent results obtained with the Prospector fitting framework. The difference log(SFR(Pa\alpha)-SFR(Prospector)) is -0.09 \pm 0.04 dex at 10^{10-11} M_\odot. We also measure the empirical relation between Paschen-\alpha luminosity and rest-frame H band magnitude and find that the scatter is only 0.04 dex lower than that of the SFR-M* relation and is much lower than the systematic differences among relations in the literature due to various methods of converting observed measurements to physical properties. We additionally identify examples of sources -- that, with standard cutoffs via the UVJ diagram, would be deemed quiescent -- with significant, typically extended, Paschen-\alpha emission. Our results may be indicative of the potential unification of methods used to derive the star forming sequence with careful selection of star forming galaxies and independent star formation rate and stellar mass indicators.

### 38) [2404.10770](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10770v1): Unveiling the Cosmic Gems Arc at z~10.2 with JWST

<p>
We present recent JWST NIRCam imaging observations of SPT0615-JD (also known as the Cosmic Gems Arc), lensed by the galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0615-5746. The 5-arcsec-long arc is the most highly magnified z&gt;10 galaxy known, straddling the lensing critical curve and revealing five star clusters with radii ~ 1 pc or less. We measure the full arc to have F200W 24.5 AB mag, consisting of two mirror images, each 25.3 AB mag with a magnification &mu; ~ 60 (delensed 29.7 AB mag, M_{UV} = -17.8). The galaxy has an extremely strong Lyman break F115W-F200W &gt;3.2 mag (2\sigma lower limit), is undetected in all bluer filters (&lt; 2\sigma), and has a very blue continuum slope redward of the break (\beta = -2.7 \pm 0.1), resulting in a photometric redshift z_{phot} = 10.2 \pm 0.2 (95% confidence) with no significant likelihood below z &lt; 9.8. Based on SED fitting to the total photometry, we estimate an intrinsic stellar mass of M_{*} ~ 2.4 - 5.6 \times 10^{7} M_{\odot}, young mass-weighted age of ~ 21 - 79 Myr, low dust content (A_V &lt; 0.15), and a low metallicity of \lesssim 1&percnt;~Z_{\odot}. We identify a fainter third counterimage candidate within 2.2 arcsec of the predicted position, lensed to AB mag 28.4 and magnified by &mu; ~ 2, suggesting the fold arc may only show ~60% of the galaxy. SPT0615-JD is a unique laboratory to study star clusters observed within a galaxy just 460 Myr after the Big Bang.

### 39) [2404.06543](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06543v1): Uncovering the physical origin of the prominent Lyman-α emission and absorption in GS9422 at z = 5.943

<p> Chamilla Terp, Kasper E. Heintz, Darach Watson, Gabriel Brammer, Adam Carnall, Joris Witstok, Renske Smit, Simone Vejlgaard </p>
<p>
We present a comprehensive spectro-photometric analysis of the galaxy GS9422 from the JADES GTO survey located at z=5.943, anomalously showing a simultaneous strong Ly\alpha emission feature and damped Ly\alpha absorption (DLA), based on JWST NIRSpec and NIRCam observations. The best-fit modelling of the spectral energy distribution (SED) reveals a young, low-mass ({\rm log}(M_\star/M_{\odot}) = 7.8 \pm 0.01) galaxy, with a mass-weighted mean age of the stellar population of (10.9^{+0.07}_{-0.12})\,Myr. The identified strong nebular emission lines suggest a highly ionized (O_{32} = 59), low-metallicity (12+\log({\rm O/H}) = 7.78\pm 0.10) star-forming galaxy with a star-formation rate SFR = (8.2 \pm 2.8) \rm M_{\odot}\;yr^{-1} over a compact surface area A_e = 1.85 kpc^{2}, typical for galaxies at this epoch. We carefully model the rest-frame UV NIRSpec Prism spectrum around the Ly\alpha edge, finding that the Ly\alpha emission-line redshift is consistent with the longer-wavelength recombination lines and an escape fraction of f_{\rm esc,Ly\alpha} = 30&percnt; but that the broad DLA feature is not able to converge on the same redshift. Instead, our modelling suggests z_{\rm abs}= 5.40 \pm 0.10, the exact redshift of a newly identified proto-cluster in nearby projection to the target galaxy. We argue that most of the HI gas producing the strong Ly\alpha damping wing indeed has to be unassociated with the galaxy itself, and thus may indicate that we are probing the cold, dense circumcluster medium of this massive galaxy overdensity. These results provide an alternative solution to the recent claims of continuum nebular emission or an obscured active galactic nucleus dominating the rest-frame UV parts of the spectrum and provide further indications that strong DLAs might preferentially be associated with galaxy overdensities.

Price, Hans-Walter Rix, Francesco Valentino, Bingjie Wang, Christina C. Williams </p>
<p>
Within the established framework of structure formation, galaxies start as systems of low stellar mass and gradually grow into far more massive galaxies. The existence of massive galaxies in the first billion years of the Universe, suggested by recent observations, appears to challenge this model, as such galaxies would require highly efficient conversion of baryons into stars. An even greater challenge in this epoch is the existence of massive galaxies that have already ceased forming stars. However, robust detections of early massive quiescent galaxies have been challenging due to the coarse wavelength sampling of photometric surveys. Here we report the spectroscopic confirmation with the James Webb Space Telescope of the quiescent galaxy RUBIES-EGS-QG-1 at redshift z=4.90, 1.2 billion years after the Big Bang. Deep stellar absorption features in the spectrum reveal that the galaxy's stellar mass of 10^{11}\,M_\odot, corroborated by the mass implied by its gas kinematics, formed in a short 200\,Myr burst of star formation, after which star formation activity dropped rapidly and persistently. According to current galaxy formation models, systems with such rapid stellar mass growth and early quenching are too rare to plausibly occur in the small area probed spectroscopically with JWST. Instead, the discovery of RUBIES-EGS-QG-1 implies that early massive quiescent galaxies can be quenched earlier or exhaust gas available for star formation more efficiently than currently assumed.

Theoretical models predict that z~6 quasars are hosted in the most massive halos of the underlying dark matter distribution and thus would be immersed in protoclusters of galaxies. However, observations report inconclusive results. We investigate the 1.1 pMpc2 environment of the z = 7.54 luminous quasar ULAS J1342+0928. We search for Lyman-break galaxy candidates (LBG) using deep imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the ACS/F814W, WFC3/F105W/F125W bands, and Spitzer/IRAC at 3.6 &mu;m and 4.5 &mu;m. We report a zphot = 7.69^{+0.33}_{-0.23} LBG with magF125W = 26.41 at 223 projected-pkpc from the quasar. We find no HST counterpart to one [CII]-emitter previously found with ALMA at 27 projected-pkpc and z[CII]=7.5341\pm0.0009 (Venemans et al. 2020). We estimate the completeness of our LBG candidates using results from CANDELS/GOODS deep blank field searches sharing a similar filter setup. We find that &gt;50% of the z~7.5 LBGs with magF125W &gt;25.5 are missed due to the absence of a filter redward of the Lyman-break in F105W, hindering the UV color accuracy of the candidates. We conduct a QSO-LBG clustering analysis revealing a low LBG excess of 0.46^{+1.52}_{-0.08} in this quasar field, consistent with an average or low-density field. Consequently, this result does not present strong evidence of an LBG overdensity around ULAS J1342+0928. Furthermore, we identify two LBG candidates with a zphot matching a confirmed z=6.84 absorber along the line-of-sight to the quasar. All these galaxy candidates are excellent targets for follow-up observations with JWST and/or ALMA to confirm their redshift and physical properties.

One of the surprising early findings with JWST has been the discovery of a strong "roll-over" or a softening of the absorption edge of Ly\alpha in a large number of galaxies at (z\gtrsim 6), in addition to systematic offsets from photometric redshift estimates and fundamental galaxy scaling relations. This has been interpreted as damped Ly\alpha absorption (DLA) wings from high column densities of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI), signifying major gas accretion events in the formation of these galaxies. To explore this new phenomenon systematically, we assemble the JWST/NIRSpec PRImordial gas Mass AssembLy (PRIMAL) legacy survey of 494 galaxies at z=5.5-13.4. We characterize this benchmark sample in full and spectroscopically derive the galaxy redshifts, metallicities, star-formation rates, and ultraviolet slopes. We define a new diagnostic, the Ly\alpha damping parameter D_{\rm Ly\alpha} to measure and quantify the Ly\alpha emission strength, HI fraction in the IGM, or local HI column density for each source. The JWST-PRIMAL survey is based on the spectroscopic DAWN JWST Archive (DJA-Spec). All the software, reduced spectra, and spectroscopically derived quantities and catalogs are made publicly available in dedicated repositories. The fraction of strong galaxy DLAs are found to be in the range 65-95&percnt; at z&gt;5.5. The fraction of strong Ly\alpha emitters (LAEs) is found to increase with decreasing redshift, in qualitative agreement with previous observational results, and are predominantly associated with low-metallicity and UV faint galaxies. By contrast, strong DLAs are observed in galaxies with a variety of intrinsic physical properties. Our results indicate that strong DLAs likely reflect a particular early assembly phase of reionization-era galaxies, at which point they are largely dominated by pristine HI gas accretion. [abridged]

<p>
Combining the public JWST/NIRCam imaging programs CEERS, PRIMER and JADES, spanning a total area of ~500\,{\rm arcmin}^2, we obtain a sample of &gt;30,000 galaxies at z_{\rm phot}~4-9 that allows us to perform a complete, rest-optical selected census of the galaxy population at z&gt;3. Comparing the stellar mass M_* and the UV-slope \beta distributions between JWST- and HST-selected samples, we generally find very good agreement and no significant biases. Nevertheless, JWST enables us to probe a new population of UV-red galaxies that was missing from previous HST-based Lyman Break Galaxy (LBG) samples. We measure galaxy stellar mass functions (SMFs) at z~4-9 down to limiting masses of 10^{7.5}-10^{8.5}\,{\rm M_\odot}, finding steep low mass slopes over the entire redshift range, reaching values of \alpha\approx-2 at z\gtrsim6. At the high-mass end, UV-red galaxies dominate at least out to z~6. The implied redshift evolution of the SMF suggests a rapid build-up of massive dust-obscured or quiescent galaxies from z~6 to z~4 as well as an enhanced efficiency of star formation towards earlier times (z\gtrsim6). Finally, we show that the galaxy mass density grows by a factor ~20\times from z~9 to z~4. Our results emphasize the importance of rest-frame optically-selected samples in inferring accurate distributions of physical properties and studying the mass build-up of galaxies in the first 1.5 Gyr of cosmic history.

<p>
We report an updated mass and magnification model of galaxy cluster Abell 370 using new NIRCam and NIRISS data from the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). Using Lenstool and a combination of archival HST and MUSE data with new JWST data as constraints, we derive an improved gravitational lensing model and extract magnifications of background galaxies with uncertainties. Using our best fit model, we perform a search for new multiply imaged systems via predicted positions. We report no new multiply imaged systems with identifiable redshifts, likely due to already very deep HST and Spitzer data, but confirm a z~8 multiply imaged system by measuring its redshift with NIRISS and NIRSpec spectra. We find that the overall shape of the critical curve for a source at z = 9.0 is similar to previous models of Abell 370, with small changes. We investigate the z~8 galaxy with two images observable with an apparent magnitude in the F125W band of 26.0\pm0.2 and 25.6\pm0.1. After correcting for the magnifications of the images, 7.2^{+0.2}_{-1.2} and 8.7^{+0.4}_{-0.4}, we use SED fitting to find an intrinsic stellar mass of log(M^*/M_{\odot}) = 7.35^{+0.04}_{-0.05}, intrinsic SFR of 3.5^{+2.2}_{-1.4} M_{\odot}/yr, and M_{UV} of -21.3^{+0.2}_{-0.2}, which is close to the knee of the luminosity function at that redshift. Our model, and corresponding magnification, shear, and convergence maps are available on request and will be made publicly available on MAST in a CANUCS data release (DOI: 10.17909/ph4n-6n76).

<p>
The JWST discovery of ``little red dots'' (LRDs) is reshaping our picture of the early Universe, yet the physical mechanisms driving their compact size and UV-optical colors remain elusive. Here we report an unusually bright LRD (z=3.1) observed as part of the RUBIES program. This LRD exhibits broad emission lines (FWHM ~4000km/s), a blue UV continuum, a clear Balmer break and a red continuum sampled out to rest 4 &mu;m with MIRI. We develop a new joint galaxy and AGN model within the Prospector Bayesian inference framework and perform spectrophotometric modeling using NIRCam, MIRI, and NIRSpec/Prism observations. Our fiducial model reveals a M_*~ 10^9M_\odot galaxy alongside a dust-reddened AGN driving the optical emission. Explaining the rest-frame optical color as a reddened AGN requires A_{\rm v}\gtrsim3, suggesting that a great majority of the accretion disk energy is re-radiated as dust emission. Yet despite clear AGN signatures, we find a surprising lack of hot torus emission, which implies that either the dust emission in this object must be cold, or the red continuum must instead be driven by a massive, evolved stellar population of the host galaxy -- seemingly inconsistent with the high EW broad lines (H\alpha EW ~800&#8491;). The widths and luminosities of Pa\beta, Pa\delta, Pa\gamma, and H\alpha imply a modest black hole mass of M_{\rm BH}~10^8M_\odot. Additionally, we identify a narrow blue-shifted HeI absorption in G395M spectra, signaling an ionized outflow with kinetic energy up to ~1&percnt; the luminosity of the AGN. The low redshift of RUBIES-BLAGN-1 combined with the depth and richness of the JWST imaging and spectroscopic observations provide a unique opportunity to build a physical model for these so-far mysterious LRDs, which may prove to be a crucial phase in the early formation of massive galaxies and their supermassive black holes.

<p>
We present JWST/NIRCam observations of a strongly-lensed, multiply-imaged galaxy at z=6.072, with magnification factors &gt;~20 across the galaxy. We perform a spatially-resolved analysis of the physical properties at scales of ~200 pc, inferred from SED modelling of 5 NIRCam imaging bands on a pixel-by-pixel basis. We find young stars surrounded by extended older stellar populations. By comparing H\alpha+[NII] and [OIII]+H\beta maps inferred from the image analysis with our additional NIRSpec IFU data, we find that the spatial distribution and strength of the line maps are in agreement with the IFU measurements. We explore different parametric SFH forms with Bagpipes on the spatially-integrated photometry, finding that a double power-law star formation history retrieves the closest value to the spatially-resolved stellar mass estimate, and other SFH forms suffer from the dominant outshining emission from the youngest stars, thus underestimating the stellar mass - up to ~0.5 dex-. On the other hand, the DPL cannot match the IFU measured emission lines. Additionally, the ionizing photon production efficiency may be overestimated in a spatially-integrated approach by ~0.15 dex, when compared to a spatially-resolved analysis. The agreement with the IFU measurements points towards the pixel-by-pixel approach as a way to mitigate the general degeneracy between the flux excess from emission lines and underlying continuum, especially when lacking photometric medium-band coverage and/or IFU observations. This study stresses the importance of studying galaxies as the complex systems that they are, resolving their stellar populations when possible, or using more flexible SFH parameterisations. This can aid our understanding of the early stages of galaxy evolution by addressing the challenge of inferring robust stellar masses and ionizing photon production efficiencies of high redshift galaxies.

<p>
We present the results of a ~60-hr observational campaign with ALMA targeting a spectroscopically confirmed and lensed sub-L^\star galaxy at z=6.07, identified during the ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey (ALCS). We sample the dust continuum emission from rest frame 90 to 370 &mu;m at six different frequencies and set constraining upper limits on the molecular gas line emission and content via CO(7-6) and [CI](2-1) for two lensed images with &mu;\gtrsim20. Complementing these sub-mm observations with deep optical and near-IR photometry and spectroscopy with JWST, we find this galaxy to form stars at a rate of SFR~7 Msun/yr, ~50-70% of which is obscured by dust. This is consistent with what is expected for a M_\star~7.5\times10^{8} Msun object by extrapolating the M_\star-obscured SFR fraction relation at z&lt;2.5 and with observations at 5&lt;z&lt;7. The dust temperature of ~50K is similar to that of more massive galaxies at similar redshifts, although with large uncertainties and with possible negative gradients. We measure a dust mass of M_{\rm dust}~1.5\times10^6 Msun and, by combining [CI], [CII], and a dynamical estimate, a gas mass of ~2\times10^9 Msun. Their ratio is in good agreement with the predictions from models in the literature. The M_{\rm dust}/M_\star fraction of ~0.002 and the young stellar age are consistent with dust production via supernovae. Also, models predict a number density of galaxies with M_{\rm dust}~10^{6} Msun at z=6 in agreement with our estimate from the parent ALCS survey. The combination of lensing and multiwavelength observations allow us to probe luminosity regimes up to two orders of magnitude lower than what has been explored so far for field galaxies at similar redshifts. Our results serve as a benchmark for future observations of faint sub-L^\star galaxy population that might have driven the reionization of the Universe. [Abridged]

<p>
The most distant galaxies detected by JWST are assembling in a Universe that is less than 5&percnt; of its present age. At these times, the progenitors of galaxies like the Milky Way are expected to be about 10,000 times less massive than they are now, with masses quite comparable to that of massive globular clusters seen in the local Universe. Composed today primarily of old stars and correlating with the properties of their parent dark matter halos, the first globular clusters are thought to have formed during the earliest stages of galaxy assembly. In this article we explore the connection between star clusters and galaxy assembly by showing JWST observations of a strongly lensed galaxy at zspec = 8.304, exhibiting a network of massive star clusters (the 'Firefly Sparkle') cocooned in a diffuse arc. The Firefly Sparkle exhibits the hallmarks expected of a future Milky Way-type galaxy captured during its earliest and most gas-rich stage of formation. The mass distribution of the galaxy seems to be concentrated in ten distinct clusters, with individual cluster masses that straddle the boundary between low-mass galaxies and high-mass globular clusters. The cluster ages suggest that they are gravitationally bound with star formation histories showing a recent starburst possibly triggered by the interaction with a companion galaxy at the same redshift at a projected distance of ~2 kpc away from the Firefly Sparkle. The central star cluster shows nebular-dominated spectra consistent with high temperatures and a top-heavy initial mass function, the product of formation in a very metal poor environment. Combined with abundance matching that suggests that this is likely to be a progenitor of galaxies like our own, the Firefly Sparkle provides an unprecedented case study of a Milky Way-like galaxy in the earliest stages of its assembly in only a 600 million year old Universe.

<p>
The Cosmic Gems arc is among the brightest and highly magnified galaxies observed at redshift z~10.2. However, it is an intrinsically UV faint galaxy, in the range of those now thought to drive the reionization of the Universe. Hitherto the smallest features resolved in a galaxy at a comparable redshift are between a few hundreds and a few tens of parsecs. Here we report JWST observations of the Cosmic Gems. The light of the galaxy is resolved into five star clusters located in a region smaller than 70 parsec. They exhibit minimal dust attenuation and low metallicity, ages younger than 50 Myr and intrinsic masses of ~10^6 M_{\odot}. Their lensing-corrected sizes are approximately 1 pc, resulting in stellar surface densities near 10^5~M_{\odot}/pc^2, three orders of magnitude higher than typical young star clusters in the local universe. Despite the uncertainties inherent to the lensing model, they are consistent with being gravitationally bound stellar systems, i.e., proto-globular clusters. We conclude that star cluster formation and feedback likely contributed to shape the properties of galaxies during the epoch of reionization. [Abridged]

We present a methodology for modeling and removing light from cluster galaxies and intracluster light (ICL) from James\ Webb\ Space\ Telescope (JWST) images of gravitational lensing clusters. We apply our method to Webb's First Deep Field the SMACS 0723 Early Release Observations and use the ICL subtracted images to select a sample of globular clusters (GCs) and dwarf galaxies within the cluster. We compare the spatial distributions of these two samples with our models of the galaxy and ICL light, finding significant similarity. Specifically we find that GCs trace the diffuse ICL, while dwarf galaxies are centrally concentrated near the cluster center We quantify the relationship between the surface density of compact sources and total cluster light, demonstrating a significant, tight correlation. We repeat our methodology and compare distributions of GCs with dark matter surface density and find a comparable result. Our findings suggest a common origin for GCs and diffuse ICL, with stripping from massive galaxies as they merge with the cluster being a plausible scenario.

Whitaker </p>
<p>
Over the past year, JWST has uncovered galaxies at record-breaking distances up to z ~ 13. The JWST UNCOVER (ultra-deep NIRSpec and NIRcam observations before the epoch of reionization) program has obtained ultra-deep multiwavelength NIRCam imaging of the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744 over ~ 45 arcmin^{2} down to ~ 29.5 AB mag. Here, we present a robust ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function derived through lensing clusters at 9&lt;z&lt;12. Using comprehensive end-to-end simulations, we account for all lensing effects and systematic uncertainties in deriving both the amplification factors and the effective survey volume. Our results confirm the intriguing excess of UV-bright galaxies (M_{UV} &lt; -20 AB mag) previously reported at z&gt;9 in recent JWST studies. In particular, a double power-law (DPL) describes better the bright-end of the luminosity function compared to the classical Schechter form. The number density of these bright galaxies is 10-100 times larger than theoretical predictions and previous findings based on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations. Additionally, we measure a star formation rate density of \rho_{\rm SFR} = 10^{-2.64} M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}~Mpc^{-3} at these redshifts, which is 4 to 10 times higher than galaxy formation models that assume a constant star formation efficiency. Future wide-area surveys and accurate modeling of lensing-assisted observations will reliably constrain both the bright and the dim end of the UV luminosity function at z&gt;9, which will provide key benchmarks for galaxy formation models.

### 52) [2312.03065](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03065v1): Deciphering the JWST spectrum of a 'little red dot' at z ~ 4.53: An obscured AGN and its star-forming host

JWST has revealed a class of numerous, extremely compact sources, with rest-frame red optical/near-infrared (NIR) and blue ultraviolet (UV) colours, nicknamed "little red dots". We present one of the highest signal-to-noise ratio JWST NIRSpec/PRISM spectra of a little red dot, J0647_1045 at z = 4.5321 \pm 0.0001, and examine its NIRCam morphology, to differentiate the origin of the UV and optical/NIR emission, and elucidate the nature of the little red dot phenomenon. J0647_1045 is unresolved (r_e &lt; 0.17 kpc) in the three NIRCam long-wavelength filters, but significantly extended (r_e = 0.45 \pm 0.06 kpc) in the three short-wavelength filters, indicating a red compact source in a blue star-forming galaxy. The spectral continuum shows a clear change in slope, from blue in the optical/UV, to red in the restframe optical/NIR, consistent with two distinct components, fit by power-laws with different attenuation: A_V = 0.54 \pm 0.01 (UV) and A_V = 5.7 \pm 0.2 (optical/NIR). Fitting the H\alpha line requires both broad (full width at half-maximum ~ 4300 \pm 300 km s^{-1}) and narrow components, but none of the other emission lines, including H\beta, show evidence of broadness. We calculate A_V = 1.1 \pm 0.2 from the Balmer decrement using narrow H\alpha and H\beta, and A_V &gt; 4.1 \pm 0.2 from broad H\alpha and upper limit on broad H\beta, consistent with the blue and red continuum attenuation respectively. Based on single-epoch H\alpha linewidth, the mass of the central black hole is 8 \pm 1 \times 10^8 M_\odot. Our findings are consistent with a multi-component model, where the optical/NIR and broad lines arise from a highly obscured, spatially unresolved region, likely a relatively massive active galactic nucleus, while the less obscured UV continuum and narrow lines arise, at least partly, from a small but spatially resolved star-forming host galaxy.

### 53) [2312.01932](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01932v1): Early results from GLASS-JWST. XXVII. The mass-metallicity relation in lensed field galaxies at cosmic noon with NIRISS

<p>
We present a measurement of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) at cosmic noon, using the JWST near-infrared wide-field slitless spectroscopy obtained by the GLASS-JWST Early Release Science program. By combining the power of JWST and the lensing magnification by the foreground cluster A2744, we extend the measurements of the MZR to the dwarf mass regime at high redshifts. A sample of 50 galaxies with several emission lines is identified across two wide redshift ranges of z=1.8-2.3 and 2.6-3.4 in the stellar mass range of \log{(M_*/M_\odot)}\in [6.9, 10.0]. The observed slope of MZR is 0.223 \pm 0.017 and 0.294 \pm 0.010 at these two redshift ranges, respectively, consistent with the slopes measured in field galaxies with higher masses. In addition, we assess the impact of the morphological broadening on emission line measurement by comparing two methods of using 2D forward modeling and line profile fitting to 1D extracted spectra. We show that ignoring the morphological broadening effect when deriving line fluxes from grism spectra results in a systematic reduction of flux by ~30&percnt; on average. This discrepancy appears to affect all the lines and thus does not lead to significant changes in flux ratio and metallicity measurements. This assessment of the morphological broadening effect using JWST data presents, for the first time, an important guideline for future work deriving galaxy line fluxes from wide-field slitless spectroscopy, such as Euclid, Roman, and the Chinese Space Station Telescope.

### 54) [2311.12234](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12234v2): A Steep Decline in the Galaxy Space Density Beyond Redshift 9 in the CANUCS UV Luminosity Function

<p>
We present a new sample of 158 galaxies at redshift z&gt;7.5 selected from deep \jwst\ NIRCam imaging of five widely-separated sightlines in the CANUCS survey. Two-thirds of the pointings and 80&percnt; of the galaxies are covered by 12 to 14 NIRCam filters, including seven to nine medium bands, providing accurate photometric redshifts and robustness against low redshift interlopers. A sample of 28 galaxies at z&gt;7.5 with spectroscopic redshifts shows a low systematic offset and scatter in the difference between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts. We derive the galaxy UV luminosity function at redshifts 8 to 12, finding a slightly higher normalization than previously seen with \hst\ at redshifts 8 to 10. We observe a steeper decline in the galaxy space density from z=8 to 12 than found by most \jwst\ Cycle 1 studies. In particular, we find only eight galaxies at z&gt;10 and none at z&gt;12.5, with no z&gt;10 galaxies brighter than F277W AB=28 or M_{\rm UV}=-20 in our unmasked, delensed survey area of 53.4 square arcminutes. We attribute the lack of bright z&gt;10 galaxies in CANUCS compared to GLASS and CEERS to intrinsic variance in the galaxy density along different sightlines. The evolution in the CANUCS luminosity function between z=8 and 12 is comparable to that predicted by simulations that assume a standard star formation efficiency, without invoking any special adjustments.

### 55) [2311.04867](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04867v3): Cosmic Vine: A z=3.44 large-scale structure hosting massive quiescent galaxies

Vijayan, Steven Gillman, Vasily Kokorev, Aurélien Le Bail, Thomas R. Greve, Bitten Gullberg, Katriona M. L. Gould, Sune Toft </p>
<p>
We report the discovery of a large-scale structure at z=3.44 revealed by JWST data in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) field. This structure, called the Cosmic Vine, consists of 20 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts at 3.43&lt;z&lt;3.45 and six galaxy overdensities (4-7\sigma) with consistent photometric redshifts, making up a vine-like structure extending over a ~4x0.2 pMpc^2 area. The two most massive galaxies (M_*\approx10^{10.9}~M_\odot) of the Cosmic Vine are found to be quiescent with bulge-dominated morphologies (B/T&gt;70&percnt;). Comparisons with simulations suggest that the Cosmic Vine would form a cluster with halo mass M_{\rm halo}&gt;10^{14}M_\odot at z=0, and the two massive galaxies are likely forming the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). The results unambiguously reveal that massive quiescent galaxies can form in growing large-scale structures at z&gt;3, thus disfavoring the environmental quenching mechanisms that require a virialized cluster core. Instead, as suggested by the interacting and bulge-dominated morphologies, the two galaxies are likely quenched by merger-triggered starburst or active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback before falling into a cluster core. Moreover, we found that the observed specific star formation rates of massive quiescent galaxies in z&gt;3 dense environments are one to two orders of magnitude lower than that of the BCGs in the TNG300 simulation. This discrepancy potentially poses a challenge to the models of massive cluster galaxy formation. Future studies comparing a large sample with dedicated cluster simulations are required to solve the problem.

With the remarkable sensitivity and resolution of JWST in the infrared, measuring rest-optical kinematics of galaxies at z&gt;5 has become possible for the first time. This study pilots a new method for measuring galaxy dynamics for highly multiplexed, unbiased samples by combining FRESCO NIRCam grism spectroscopy and JADES medium-band imaging. Here we present one of the first JWST kinematic measurements for a galaxy at z&gt;5. We find a significant velocity gradient, which, if interpreted as rotation yields V_{rot} = 240\pm50km/s and we hence refer to this galaxy as Twister-z5. With a rest-frame optical effective radius of r_e=2.25kpc, the high rotation velocity in this galaxy is not due to a compact size as may be expected in the early universe but rather a high total mass, {\rm log(M}_{dyn}/{\rm M}_\odot)=11.0\pm0.2. This is a factor of roughly 4x higher than the stellar mass within the effective radius. We also observe that the radial H\alpha equivalent width profile and the specific star formation rate map from resolved stellar population modeling is centrally depressed by a factor of ~1.5 from the center to r_e. Combined with the morphology of the line-emitting gas in comparison to the continuum, this centrally suppressed star formation is consistent with a star-forming disk surrounding a bulge growing inside-out. While large, rapidly rotating disks are common to z~2, the existence of one after only 1Gyr of cosmic time, shown for the first time in ionized gas, adds to the growing evidence that some galaxies matured earlier than expected in the history of the universe.

### 57) [2310.06781](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06781v2): Quantifying the Effects of Known Unknowns on Inferred High-redshift Galaxy Properties: Burstiness, the IMF, and Nebular Physics

<p>
The era of the James Webb Space Telescope ushers stellar population models into uncharted territories, particularly at the high-redshift frontier. In a companion paper, we apply the \texttt{Prospector} Bayesian framework to jointly infer galaxy redshifts and stellar population properties from broad-band photometry as part of the UNCOVER survey. Here we present a comprehensive error budget in spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling. Using a sample selected to have photometric redshifts higher than 9, we quantify the systematic shifts stemming from various model choices in inferred stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and age. These choices encompass different timescales for changes in the star formation history (SFH), non-universal stellar initial mass functions (IMF), and the inclusion of variable nebular abundances, gas density and ionizing photon budget. We find that the IMF exerts the strongest influence on the inferred properties: the systematic uncertainties can be as much as 1 dex, 2--5 times larger than the formal reported uncertainties in mass and SFR; and importantly, exceed the scatter seen when using different SED fitting codes. Although the assumptions on the lower end of the IMF induce degeneracy, our findings suggest that a common practice in the literature of assessing uncertainties in SED-fitting processes by comparing multiple codes is substantively underestimating the true systematic uncertainty. Highly stochastic SFHs change the inferred SFH by much larger than the formal uncertainties, and introduce ~ 0.8 dex systematics in SFR averaged over short time scale and ~ 0.3 dex systematics in average age. Finally, employing a flexible nebular emission model causes ~ 0.2 dex systematic increase in mass and SFR, comparable to the formal uncertainty. This paper constitutes an initial step toward a complete uncertainty estimate in SED modeling.

With the advent of JWST, we can probe the rest-frame optical emission of galaxies at z&gt;3 with high sensitivity and spatial resolution, making it possible to accurately characterise red, optically-faint galaxies and thus move towards a more complete census of the galaxy population at high redshifts. To this end, we present a sample of 148 massive, dusty galaxies from the JWST/CEERS survey, colour-selected using solely JWST bands. With deep JWST/NIRCam data from 1.15&mu;m to 4.44&mu;m and ancillary HST/ACS and WFC3 data, we determine the physical properties of our sample using spectral energy distribution fitting with BAGPIPES. We demonstrate that our selection method efficiently identifies massive (\mathrm{\langle \log M_\star/M_\odot \rangle ~ 10}) and dusty (\mathrm{\langle A_V\rangle ~ 2.7\ mag}) sources, with a majority at z&gt;3 and predominantly lying on the galaxy main-sequence. The main results of this work are the stellar mass functions (SMF) of red, optically-faint galaxies from redshifts between 3&lt;z&lt;8: these galaxies make up a significant relative fraction of the pre-JWST total SMF at 3&lt;z&lt;4 and 4&lt;z&lt;6, and dominate the high-mass end of the pre-JWST SMF at 6&lt;z&lt;8, suggesting that our census of the galaxy population needs amendment at these epochs. While larger areas need to be surveyed in the future, our results suggest already that the integrated stellar mass density at \mathrm{\log M_\star/M_\odot\geq9.25} may have been underestimated in pre-JWST studies by up to ~15-20&percnt; at z~3-6, and up to ~45&percnt; at z~6-8, indicating the rapid onset of obscured stellar mass assembly in the early universe.

<p>
Early JWST observations that targeted so-called double-break sources (attributed to Lyman and Balmer breaks at z&gt;7), reported a previously unknown population of very massive, evolved high-redshift galaxies. This surprising discovery led to a flurry of attempts to explain these objects' unexpected existence including invoking alternatives to the standard \LambdaCDM cosmological paradigm. To test these early results, we adopted the same double-break candidate galaxy selection criteria to search for such objects in the JWST images of the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS), and found a sample of 19 sources over five independent CANUCS fields that cover a total effective area of ~60\,arcmin^2 at z~8. However, (1) our SED fits do not yield exceptionally high stellar masses for our candidates, while (2) spectroscopy of five of the candidates shows that while all five are at high redshifts, their red colours are due to high-EW emission lines in star-forming galaxies rather than Balmer breaks in massive, evolved systems. Additionally, (3) field-to-field variance leads to differences of ~ 1.5 dex in the maximum stellar masses measured in the different fields, suggesting that the early single-field JWST observations may have suffered from cosmic variance and/or sample bias. Finally, (4) we show that the presence of even a single massive outlier can dominate conclusions from small samples such as those in early JWST observations. In conclusion, we find that the double-break sources in CANUCS are not sufficiently massive or numerous to warrant questioning the standard \LambdaCDM paradigm.

<p>
With the wavelength coverage, sensitivity, and high spatial resolution of JWST, it is now possible to peer through the dust attenuation to probe the rest-frame near infrared (NIR) and stellar structures of extremely dusty galaxies at cosmic noon (z~1-3). In this paper we leverage the combined ALMA and JWST/HST coverage in Abell 2744 to study the multiwavelength (0.5-4.4um) structures of 11 sub-millimeter (sub-mm) detected galaxies at z~0.9-3.5 that are fainter than bright "classical" sub-mm galaxies (SMGs). While these objects reveal a diversity of structures and sizes, all exhibit decreasing sizes and increasing central concentration towards longer wavelengths. The smaller sizes of these objects at long wavelengths indicate that their stellar mass profiles are more compact than their optical light profiles, likely due to centrally-concentrated dust obscuration. Further, we find that galaxies with higher central concentration values tend to have more extreme size ratios (comparing the rest-frame NIR to rest-frame optical); this suggests that the galaxies with the most compact light distributions also have the most concentrated dust distributions. We also find the galaxies with the most extreme size ratios do not have elevated 1.2mm flux densities compared to the rest of our sample: we argue this means compact dust geometry, rather than e.g. high total dust quantity, drives the most extreme observed rest-frame NIR-to-optical size ratios. Upcoming higher resolution 1.2mm ALMA imaging will facilitate joint spatially-resolved analysis and will directly test the dust distributions within this representative sub-mm population.

<p>
We use CANUCS JWST/NIRCam imaging of galaxies behind the gravitationally-lensing cluster MACS J0417.5-1154 to investigate star formation burstiness in low-mass (M_\star~10^8\ M_\odot) galaxies at z~4.7-6.5. Our sample of 123 galaxies is selected using the Lyman break selection and photometric emission-line excess methods. Sixty per cent of the 123 galaxies in this sample have H\alpha-to-UV flux ratios that deviate significantly from the range of \eta_{1500} values consistent with smooth and steady star formation histories. This large fraction indicates that the majority of low-mass galaxies is experiencing bursty star formation histories at high redshift. We also searched for interacting galaxies in our sample and found that they are remarkably common (~40 per cent of the sample). Compared to non-interacting galaxies, interacting galaxies are more likely to have very low H\alpha-to-UV ratios, suggesting that galaxy-galaxy interactions enhance star formation burstiness and enable faster quenching (with timescales of \lesssim100 Myr) that follows the rapid rise of star formation activity. Given the high frequency of galaxy-galaxy interactions and the rapid SFR fluctuations they appear to cause, we conclude that galaxy-galaxy interactions could be a leading cause of bursty star formation in low-mass, high-z galaxies. They could thus play a significant role in the evolution of the galaxy population at early cosmological times.

<p>
We present a study of the mid-IR (MIR) emission of quiescent galaxies (QGs) beyond the local universe. Using deep JWST imaging in the SMACS-0723 cluster field we identify a mass limited (M_{*} &gt;10^{9}M_{\odot}) sample of intermediate redshift QGs (0.2&lt;z&lt;0.7) and perform modeling of their rest-frame UV to MIR photometry. We find that QGs exhibit a range of MIR spectra that are composed of a stellar continuum and a dust component that is 1-2 orders of magnitude fainter to that of star-forming galaxies. The observed scatter in the MIR spectra, especially at \lambda_{\rm rest} &gt; 5 &mu;m, can be attributed to different dust continuum levels and/or the presence of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) features. The latter would indicate enhanced 11.3- and 12.7 &mu;m PAHs strengths with respect to those at 6.2- and 7.7 &mu;m, consistent with the observed spectra of local ellipticals and indicative of soft radiation fields. Finally, we augment the average UV-to-MIR spectrum of the population with cold dust and gas emission in the far-IR/mm and construct a panchromatic UV-to-radio SED that can serve as a template for the future exploration of the interstellar medium of z&gt;0 QGs with ALMA and JWST.

The recent UNCOVER survey with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) exploits the nearby cluster Abell 2744 to create the deepest view of our universe to date by leveraging strong gravitational lensing. In this work, we perform photometric fitting of more than 50,000 robustly detected sources out to z ~ 15. We show the redshift evolution of stellar ages, star formation rates, and rest-frame colors across the full range of 0.2 \lesssim z \lesssim 15. The galaxy properties are inferred using the Prospector Bayesian inference framework using informative Prospector-\beta priors on masses and star formation histories to produce joint redshift and stellar population posteriors, and additionally lensing magnification is performed on-the-fly to ensure consistency with the scale-dependent priors. We show that this approach produces excellent photometric redshifts with \sigma_{\rm NMAD} ~ 0.03, of a similar quality to the established photometric redshift code EAzY. In line with the open-source scientific objective of the Treasury survey, we publicly release the stellar population catalog with this paper, derived from the photometric catalog adapting aperture sizes based on source profiles. This release includes posterior moments, maximum-likelihood spectra, star-formation histories, and full posterior distributions, offering a rich data set to explore the processes governing galaxy formation and evolution over a parameter space now accessible by JWST.

### 64) [2309.07969](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07969v1): A massive compact quiescent galaxy at z=2 with a complete Einstein ring in JWST imaging

<p> Pieter van Dokkum, Gabriel Brammer, Bingjie Wang, Joel Leja, Charlie Conroy </p>
<p>
One of the surprising results from HST was the discovery that many of the most massive galaxies at z~2 are very compact, having half-light radii of only 1-2 kpc. The interpretation is that massive galaxies formed inside-out, with their cores largely in place by z~2 and approximately half of their present-day mass added later through minor mergers. Here we present a compact, massive, quiescent galaxy at z_{\rm phot}=1.94^{+0.13}_{-0.17} with a complete Einstein ring. The ring was found in the JWST COSMOS-Web survey and is produced by a background galaxy at z_{\rm phot}=2.98^{+0.42}_{-0.47}. Its 1.54" diameter provides a direct measurement of the mass of the "pristine" core of a massive galaxy, observed before mixing and dilution of its stellar population during the 10 Gyr of galaxy evolution between z=2 and z=0. We find a mass of M_{\rm lens}=6.5^{+3.7}_{-1.5} \times 10^{11} Msun within a radius of 6.6 kpc. The stellar mass within the same radius is M_{\rm stars}= 1.1^{+0.2}_{-0.3} \times 10^{11} Msun for a Chabrier initial mass function (IMF), and the fiducial dark matter mass is M_{\rm dm} = 2.6^{+1.6}_{-0.7} \times 10^{11} Msun. Additional mass is needed to explain the lensing results, either in the form of a higher-than-expected dark matter density or a bottom-heavy IMF.

<p>
We present the survey design and initial results of the ALMA Cycle 9 program of DUALZ, which aims to establish a joint ALMA and JWST public legacy field targeting the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744. DUALZ features a contiguous 4'\times6' ALMA 30-GHz-wide mosaic in Band 6, covering areas of &mu;&gt;2 down to a sensitivity of \sigma=32.7~&mu;Jy. Through a blind search, we identified 69 dust continuum sources at S/N \gtrsim5.0 with median redshift and intrinsic 1.2-mm flux of z=2.30 and S_{\rm 1.2mm}^{\rm int}=0.24~mJy. Of these, 27 have been spectroscopically confirmed, leveraged by the latest NIRSpec observations, while photometric redshift estimates are constrained by the comprehensive HST, NIRCam, and ALMA data for the remaining sources. With priors, we further identify a [CII]158 &mu;m line emitter at z=6.3254\pm0.0004, confirmed by the latest NIRSpec spectroscopy. The NIRCam counterparts of the 1.2-mm continuum exhibit undisturbed morphologies, denoted either by disk or spheroid, implying the triggers for the faint mm emission are less catastrophic than mergers. We have identified 8 HST-dark galaxies (F150W&gt;27mag, F150W-F444W&gt;2.3) and 2 JWST-dark (F444W&gt;30mag) galaxy candidates among the ALMA continuum sources. The former includes face-on disk galaxies, hinting that substantial dust obscuration does not always result from inclination. We also detect a marginal dust emission from an X-ray-detected galaxy at z_{\rm spec}=10.07, suggesting an active co-evolution of the central black hole and its host. We assess the infrared luminosity function up to z~10 and find it consistent with predictions from galaxy formation models. To foster diverse scientific outcomes from the community, we publicly release reduced ALMA mosaic maps, cubes, and the source catalog.

<p>
JWST is revealing a new population of dust-reddened broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) at redshifts z\gtrsim5. Here we present deep NIRSpec/Prism spectroscopy from the Cycle 1 Treasury program UNCOVER of 15 AGN candidates selected to be compact, with red continua in the rest-frame optical but with blue slopes in the UV. From NIRCam photometry alone, they could have been dominated by dusty star formation or AGN. Here we show that the majority of the compact red sources in UNCOVER are dust-reddened AGN: 60&percnt; show definitive evidence for broad-line H\alpha with FWHM\, &gt;2000 km/s, for 20&percnt; current data are inconclusive, and 20&percnt; are brown dwarf stars. We propose an updated photometric criterion to select red z&gt;5 AGN that excludes brown dwarfs and is expected to yield &gt;80&percnt; AGN. Remarkably, among all z_{\rm phot}&gt;5 galaxies with F277W-F444W&gt;1 in UNCOVER at least 33&percnt; are AGN regardless of compactness, climbing to at least 80&percnt; AGN for sources with F277W-F444W&gt;1.6. The confirmed AGN have black hole masses of 10^7-10^9 M_{\odot}. While their UV-luminosities (-16&gt;M_{\rm UV}&gt;-20 AB mag) are low compared to UV-selected AGN at these epochs, consistent with percent-level scattered AGN light or low levels of unobscured star formation, the inferred bolometric luminosities are typical of 10^7-10^9 M_{\odot} black holes radiating at ~ 10-40&percnt; of Eddington. The number densities are surprisingly high at ~10^{-5} Mpc^{-3} mag^{-1}, 100 times more common than the faintest UV-selected quasars, while accounting for ~1&percnt; of the UV-selected galaxies. While their UV-faintness suggest they may not contribute strongly to reionization, their ubiquity poses challenges to models of black hole growth.

<p>
Recent JWST observations have revealed an unexpected abundance of massive galaxy candidates in the early Universe, extending further in redshift and to lower luminosity than what had previously been found by sub-millimeter surveys. These JWST candidates have been interpreted as challenging the \LambdaCDM cosmology, but, so far, they have mostly relied only on rest-frame ultraviolet data and lacked spectroscopic confirmation of their redshifts. Here we report a systematic study of 36 massive dust-obscured galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts between z_{\rm spec}=5-9 from the JWST FRESCO survey. We find no tension with the \LambdaCDM model in our sample. However, three ultra-massive galaxies (logM_{\star}/M_{\odot} \gtrsim11.0) require an exceptional fraction of 50% of baryons converted into stars -- two to three times higher than even the most efficient galaxies at later epochs. The contribution from an active nucleus is unlikely because of their extended emission. Ultra-massive galaxies account for as much as 17% of the total cosmic star formation rate density at z~5-6.

<p>
We present the first results from CECILIA, a Cycle 1 JWST NIRSpec/MSA program that uses ultra-deep ~30 hour G235M/F170LP observations to target multiple electron temperature-sensitive auroral lines in the spectra of 33 galaxies at z~1-3. Using a subset of 23 galaxies, we construct two ~600 object-hour composite spectra, both with and without the stellar continuum, and use these to investigate the characteristic rest-optical (5700-8500 Angstrom) spectrum of star-forming galaxies at the peak epoch of cosmic star formation. Emission lines of eight different elements (H, He, N, O, Si, S, Ar, and Ni) are detected, with most of these features observed to be &lt;3% the strength of H-alpha. We report the characteristic strength of three auroral lines ([NII]5756, [SIII]6313, and [OII]7322,7332), as well as other semi-strong and faint emission lines, including forbidden [NiII]7380,7414 and the OI 8449 recombination line, some of which have never before been observed outside of the local universe. Using these measurements, we find T_e[NII]=13630+/-2540 K, representing the first measurement of electron temperature using [NII] in the high-redshift universe. We also see evidence for broad line emission with a FWHM of ~536 km/s; the broad component of H-alpha is 6.01-28.31% the strength of the narrow component and likely arises from star-formation driven outflows. Finally, we briefly comment on the feasibility of obtaining large samples of faint emission lines using JWST in the future.

We present measurements of stellar populations properties of a z = 9.1 gravitationally lensed galaxy MACS1149-JD1 using deep JWST NIRISS slitless spectroscopy as well as NIRISS and NIRCam imaging from the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). The galaxy is split into four components. Three magnified ({&mu;} ~ 17) star-forming components are unresolved, giving intrinsic sizes of &lt; 50pc. In addition, the underlying extended component contains the bulk of the stellar mass, formed the majority of its stars ~ 50Myr earlier than the other three components and is not the site of the most active star formation currently. The NIRISS and NIRCam resolved photometry does not confirm a strong Balmer break previously seen in Spitzer. The NIRISS grism spectrum has been extracted for the entire galaxy and shows a clear continuum and Lyman-break, with no Lyman-{\alpha} detected.

Deep observations with JWST have revealed an emerging population of red point-like sources that could provide a link between the postulated supermassive black hole seeds and observed quasars. In this work we present a JWST/NIRSpec spectrum from the JWST Cycle 1 UNCOVER Treasury survey, of a massive accreting black hole at z=8.50, displaying a clear broad-line component as inferred from the H\beta line with FWHM = 3439\pm413 km s^{-1}, typical of the broad line region of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The AGN nature of this object is further supported by high ionization, as inferred from emission lines, and a point-source morphology. We compute the black hole mass of log_{10}(M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot)=8.17\pm0.42, and a bolometric luminosity of L_{\rm bol}~6.6\times10^{45} erg s^{-1}. These values imply that our object is accreting at ~ 40&percnt; of the Eddington limit. Detailed modeling of the spectral energy distribution in the optical and near-infrared, together with constraints from ALMA, indicate an upper limit on the stellar mass of log_{10}(M_{\rm *}/M_\odot)&lt;8.7, which would lead to an unprecedented ratio of black hole to host mass of at least ~ 30 &percnt;. This is orders of magnitude higher compared to the local QSOs, but is consistent with recent AGN studies at high redshift with JWST. This finding suggests that a non-negligible fraction of supermassive black holes either started out from massive seeds and/or grew at a super-Eddington rate at high redshift. Given the predicted number densities of high-z faint AGN, future NIRSpec observations of larger samples will allow us to further investigate the galaxy-black hole co-evolution in the early Universe.

We present JWST NIRSpec prism spectroscopy of gravitationally lensed galaxies at z\gtrsim9 found behind the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744 in the UNCOVER Cycle 1 Treasury Program. We confirm the source redshift via emission lines and/or the Ly\alpha break feature for ten galaxies at z=8.50-13.08 down to M_{\rm UV}=-17.3. We achieve a high confirmation rate of 100&percnt; for z&gt;9 candidates reported in Atek et al. (2023). Using six sources with multiple emission line detections, we find that the offset of the redshift estimates between the lines and the Ly\alpha break alone with prism can be as large as \pm0.2, raising caution in designing future follow-up spectroscopy for the break-only sources with ALMA. With spec-z confirmed sources in UNCOVER and the literature, we derive lower limits on the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function (LF) at z~eq9-12 and find these lower limits to be consistent with recent photometric measurements. We identify at least two unambiguous and several possible active galactic nucleus (AGN) systems based on X-ray emission, broad line (BL) H\beta, high ionization line (e.g., NIV]1487, CIV1549) detections, and excess in UVLF. This requires the AGN LFs at z~eq 9-10 to be comparable or even higher than the X-ray AGN LF estimated at z~6 and indicates a plausible cause of the high abundance of z&gt;9 galaxies claimed in recent photometric studies may be AGNs. One UV-luminous source is confirmed at the same redshift as a dusty BL AGN at z=8.50 with a physical separation of 380 kpc in the source plane. These two sources show blueward Ly\alpha line or continuum emission, suggesting that they reside in the same ionized bubble with a radius of 7.69\pm0.18 pMpc. Our results imply that AGNs have a non-negligible contribution to cosmic reionization.

We report JWST/NIRSpec spectra of three distant T-type brown dwarfs identified in the Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) survey of the Abell 2744 lensing field. One source was previously reported as a candidate T dwarf on the basis of NIRCam photometry, while two sources were initially identified as candidate active galactic nuclei. Low-resolution 1--5 &mu;m spectra confirm the presence of molecular features consistent with T dwarf atmospheres, and comparison to spectral standards infers classifications of sdT1, T6, and T8--T9. The warmest source, UNCOVER-BD-1, shows evidence of subsolar metallicity, and atmosphere model fits indicates T_{eff} = 1300 K and [M/H] ~ -1.0, making this one of the few spectroscopically-confirmed T subdwarfs known. The coldest source, UNCOVER-BD-3, is near the T/Y dwarf boundary with T_{eff} = 550 K, and our analysis indicates the presence of PH_3 in the 3--5~&mu;m region, favored over CO_2 and a possible indicator of subsolar metallicity. We estimate distances of 0.9--4.5 kpc from the Galactic midplane, making these the most distant brown dwarfs with spectroscopic confirmation. Population simulations indicate high probabilities of membership in the Galactic thick disk for two of these brown dwarfs, and potential halo membership for UNCOVER-BD-1. Our simulations indicate that there are approximately 5 T dwarfs and 1--2 L dwarfs in the Abell 2744 field down to F444W = 30 AB mag, roughly one-third of which are thick disk members. These results highlight the utility of deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy for identifying and characterizing the oldest metal-poor brown dwarfs in the Milky Way.

<p>
We examine the wavelength dependence of radial light profiles based on S\'ersic index n measurements of 1067 galaxies with M_*\geq 10^{9.5}M_\odot and in the redshift range 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 3. The sample and rest-frame optical light profiles are drawn from CANDELS+3D-HST; rest-frame near-infrared light profiles are inferred from CEERS JWST/NIRCam imaging. n shows only weak dependence on wavelength, regardless of redshift, galaxy mass and type: on average, star-forming galaxies have n = 1-1.5 and quiescent galaxies have n = 3-4 in the rest-frame optical and near-infrared. The strong correlation at all wavelengths between n and star-formation activity implies a physical connection between the radial stellar mass profile and star-formation activity. The main caveat is that the current sample is too small to discern trends for the most massive galaxies (M_* &gt; 10^{11}M_\odot).

Early JWST observations have uncovered a new population of red sources that might represent a previously overlooked phase of supermassive black hole growth (Kocevski et al. 2023; Matthee et al. 2023, Labb\'e et al. 2023). One of the most intriguing examples is an extremely red, point-like object that was found to be triply-imaged by the strong lensing (SL) cluster Abell 2744 (Furtak et al. 2023). Here we present deep JWST/NIRSpec observations of this object, Abell2744-QSO1. The spectroscopy confirms that the three images are of the same object, and that it is a highly reddened (A_V~eq3) broad emission-line Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) at a redshift of z_{\mathrm{spec}}=7.0451\pm0.0005. From the width of H\beta (\mathrm{FWHM}=2800\pm250\,\frac{\mathrm{km}}{\mathrm{s}}) we derive a black hole mass of M_{\mathrm{BH}}=4_{-1}^{+2}\times10^7\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}. We infer a very high ratio of black hole to galaxy mass of at least 3%, an order of magnitude more than is seen in local galaxies (Bennert et al. 2011), and possibly as high as 100%. The lack of strong metal lines in the spectrum together with the high bolometric luminosity (L_{\mathrm{bol}}=(1.1\pm0.3)\times10^{45}\,\frac{\mathrm{erg}}{\mathrm{s}}) indicate that we are seeing the black hole in a phase of rapid growth, accreting at 30% of the Eddington limit. The rapid growth and high black hole to galaxy mass ratio of A2744-QSO1 suggest that it may represent the missing link between black hole seeds (Volonteri et al. 2021) and the first luminous quasars (Fan et al. 2022).

<p>
The formation of galaxies by gradual hierarchical co-assembly of baryons and cold dark matter halos is a fundamental paradigm underpinning modern astrophysics and predicts a strong decline in the number of massive galaxies at early cosmic times. Extremely massive quiescent galaxies (stellar masses &gt;10^{11} M_\odot) have now been observed as early as 1-2 billions years after the Big Bang; these are extremely constraining on theoretical models as they form 300-500 Myr earlier and only some models can form massive galaxies this early. Here we report on the spectroscopic observations with the James Webb Space Telescope of a massive quiescent galaxy ZF-UDS-7329 at redshift 3.205 \pm 0.005 that eluded deep ground-based spectrscopy, is significantly redder than typical and whose spectrum reveals features typical of much older stellar populations. Detailed modelling shows the stellar population formed around 1.5 billion years earlier in time (z ~ 11) at an epoch when dark matter halos of sufficient hosting mass have not yet assembled in the standard scenario. This observation may point to the presence of undetected populations of early galaxies and the possibility of significant gaps in our understanding of early stellar populations, galaxy formation and/or the nature of dark matter.

<p>
Observations of high-redshift galaxies provide a critical direct test to the theories of early galaxy formation, yet to date, only three have been spectroscopically confirmed at z&gt;12. Due to strong gravitational lensing over a wide area, the galaxy cluster field A2744 is ideal for searching for the earliest galaxies. Here we present JWST/NIRSpec observations of two galaxies: a robust detection at z_{\rm spec} = 12.393^{+0.004}_{-0.001}, and a plausible candidate at z_{\rm spec} = 13.079^{+0.013}_{-0.001}. The galaxies are discovered in JWST/NIRCam imaging and their distances are inferred with JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy, all from the JWST Cycle 1 UNCOVER Treasury survey. Detailed stellar population modeling using JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec data corroborates the primeval characteristics of these galaxies: low mass (~ 10^8~{\rm M_\odot}), young, rapidly-assembling, metal-poor, and star-forming. Interestingly, both galaxies are spatially resolved, having lensing-corrected rest-UV effective radii on the order of 300-400 pc, which are notably larger than other spectroscopically confirmed systems at similar redshifts. The observed dynamic range of z \gtrsim 10 sizes spans over 1 order of magnitude, implying a significant scatter in the size-mass relation at early times. Deep into the epoch of reionization, these discoveries elucidate the emergence of the first galaxies.

<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope is now detecting early black holes (BHs) as they transition from "seeds" to supermassive BHs. Recently Bogdan et al. (2023) reported the detection of an X-ray luminous supermassive BH, UHZ-1, with a photometric redshift at z &gt; 10. Such an extreme source at this very high redshift provides new insights on seeding and growth models for BHs given the short time available for formation and growth. Harnessing the exquisite sensitivity of JWST/NIRSpec, here we report the spectroscopic confirmation of UHZ-1 at z = 10.073 \pm 0.002. We find that the NIRSpec/Prism spectrum is typical of recently discovered z~10 galaxies, characterized primarily by star-formation features. We see no clear evidence of the powerful X-ray source in the rest-frame UV/optical spectrum, which may suggest heavy obscuration of the central BH, in line with the Compton-thick column density measured in the X-rays. We perform a stellar population fit simultaneously to the new NIRSpec spectroscopy and previously available photometry. The fit yields a stellar mass estimate for the host galaxy that is significantly better constrained than prior photometric estimates (M_*~ 1.4^{+0.3}_{-0.4} \times 10^8 M_\odot). Given the predicted BH mass (M_{\rm BH}~10^7-10^8 M_\odot), the resulting ratio of M_{\rm BH}/M_* remains two to three orders of magnitude higher than local values, thus lending support to the heavy seeding channel for the formation of supermassive BHs within the first billion years of cosmic evolution.

We present JWST/NIRSpec observations of a highly magnified star candidate at a photometric redshift of z_{\mathrm{phot}}~eq4.8, previously detected in JWST/NIRCam imaging of the strong lensing (SL) cluster MACS J0647+7015 (z=0.591). The spectroscopic observation allows us to precisely measure the redshift of the host arc at z_{\mathrm{spec}}=4.758\pm0.004, and the star's spectrum displays clear Lyman- and Balmer-breaks commensurate with this redshift. A fit to the spectrum suggests a B-type super-giant star of surface temperature T_{\mathrm{eff,B}}~eq15000 K with either a redder F-type companion (T_{\mathrm{eff,F}}~eq6250K) or significant dust attenuation (A_V~eq0.82) along the line of sight. We also investigate the possibility that this object is a magnified young globular cluster rather than a single star. We show that the spectrum is in principle consistent with a star cluster, which could also accommodate the lack of flux variability between the two epochs. However, the lack of a counter image and the strong upper limit on the size of the object from lensing symmetry, r\lesssim0.5 pc, could indicate that this scenario is somewhat less likely -- albeit not completely ruled out by the current data. The presented spectrum seen at a time when the Universe was only ~1.2 Gyr old showcases the ability of JWST to study early stars through extreme lensing.

### 79) [2307.06994](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06994v2): Size - Stellar Mass Relation and Morphology of Quiescent Galaxies at z\geq3 in Public JWST Fields

<p>
We present the results of a systematic study of the rest-frame optical morphology of quiescent galaxies at z \geq 3 using the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) onboard JWST. Based on a sample selected by UVJ color or NUVUVJ color, we focus on 26 quiescent galaxies with 9.8&lt;\log{(M_\star/M_\odot)}&lt;11.4 at 2.8&lt;z_{\rm phot}&lt;4.6 with publicly available JWST data. Their sizes are constrained by fitting the S\'ersic profile to all available NIRCam images. We see a negative correlation between the observed wavelength and the size in our sample and derive their size at the rest-frame 0.5\, {\rm &mu; m} taking into account this trend. Our quiescent galaxies show a significant correlation between the rest-frame 0.5\, {\rm &mu; m} size and the stellar mass at z\geq3. The analytical fit for them at \log{(M_\star/M_\odot)}&gt;10.3 implies that our size - stellar mass relations are below those at lower redshifts, with the amplitude of ~0.6\, {\rm kpc} at M_\star = 5\times 10^{10}\, M_\odot. This value agrees with the extrapolation from the size evolution of quiescent galaxies at z&lt;3 in the literature, implying that the size of quiescent galaxies increases monotonically from z~3-5. Our sample is mainly composed of galaxies with bulge-like structures according to their median S\'ersic index and axis ratio of n~3-4 and q~0.6-0.8, respectively. On the other hand, there is a trend of increasing fraction of galaxies with low S\'ersic index, suggesting 3&lt;z&lt;5 might be the epoch of onset of morphological transformation with a fraction of very notable disky quenched galaxies.

### 80) [2307.04234](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04234v2): Extreme N-emitters at high-redshift: signatures of supermassive stars and globular cluster or black hole formation in action?

<p>
[Abridged] Using the JWST/NIRSpec observations from CEERS we found an extreme N-emitter, CEERS-1019 at z=8.6782 showing intense NIV and NIII emission. From the observed rest-UV and optical lines we conclude that it is compatible with photoionization from stars and we determine accurate abundances for C, N, O, and Ne, relative to H, finding a highly supersolar ratio log(N/O) = -0.18+/-0.11, and normal log(C/O) = -0.75+/-0.11 and log(Ne/O) = -0.63+/-0.07, for its low metallicity, 12+log(O/H)= 7.70+/-0.18. We also analyze other N-emitters from the literature. All show strongly enhanced N/O ratios and two of them normal C/O. Massive star ejecta from WR stars are needed to explain the galaxies with enhanced C/O (Lynx arc and Mrk 996). On the other hand, supermassive stars (&gt;1000 Msun, SMS) in the ``conveyer-belt model'' put forward to explain globular clusters (GCs), predict a high N/O and small changes in C/O, compatible with CEERS-1019, the Sunburst cluster, SMACS2031, and GN-z11. Based on the chemical abundances, possible enrichment scenarios, compactness, and high ISM density, we suggest that CEERS-1019, SMACS2031, and the Sunburst cluster could contain proto-GCs. Finally, we propose that some N-emitters enriched by SMS could also have formed intermediate-mass black holes, and we suggest that this might be the case for GN-z11. Our observations and analysis reinforce the suggested link between some N-emitters and proto-GC formation, which is supported both by empirical evidence and quantitative models. Furthermore, the observations provide possible evidence for the presence of supermassive stars in the early Universe (z&gt;8) and at z~2-3. Our analysis also suggests that the origin and nature of the N-emitters is diverse, including also objects like GN-z11 which possibly host an AGN.

<p>
We use CEERS JWST/NIRCam imaging to measure rest-frame near-IR light profiles of &gt;500 M_\star&gt;10^{10}~M_\odot galaxies in the redshift range 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.3. We compare the resulting rest-frame 1.5-2&mu;m half-light radii (R_{\rm{NIR}}) with stellar half-mass radii (\rmass) derived with multi-color light profiles from CANDELS HST imaging. In general agreement with previous work, we find that R_{\rm{NIR}} and \rmass~are up to 40&percnt;~smaller than the rest-frame optical half-light radius R_{\rm{opt}}. The agreement between R_{\rm{NIR}} and \rmass~is excellent, with negligible systematic offset (&lt;0.03 dex) up to z=2 for quiescent galaxies and up to z=1.5 for star-forming galaxies. We also deproject the profiles to estimate \rmassd, the radius of a sphere containing 50&percnt; of the stellar mass. We present the R-M_\star distribution of galaxies at 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.5, comparing R_{\rm{opt}}, \rmass~and \rmassd. The slope is significantly flatter for \rmass~and \rmassd~ compared to R_{\rm{opt}}, mostly due to downward shifts in size for massive star-forming galaxies, while \rmass~and \rmassd~do not show markedly different trends. Finally, we show rapid size evolution (R\propto (1+z)^{-1.7\pm0.1}) for massive (M_\star&gt;10^{11}~M_\odot) quiescent galaxies between z=0.5 and z=2.3, again comparing R_{\rm{opt}}, \rmass~and \rmassd. We conclude that the main tenets of the size evolution narrative established over the past 20 years, based on rest-frame optical light profile analysis, still hold in the era of JWST/NIRCam observations in the rest-frame near-IR.

The mergers of binary compact objects such as neutron stars and black holes are of central interest to several areas of astrophysics, including as the progenitors of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), sources of high-frequency gravitational waves and likely production sites for heavy element nucleosynthesis via rapid neutron capture (the r-process). These heavy elements include some of great geophysical, biological and cultural importance, such as thorium, iodine and gold. Here we present observations of the exceptionally bright gamma-ray burst GRB 230307A. We show that GRB 230307A belongs to the class of long-duration gamma-ray bursts associated with compact object mergers, and contains a kilonova similar to AT2017gfo, associated with the gravitational-wave merger GW170817. We obtained James Webb Space Telescope mid-infrared (mid-IR) imaging and spectroscopy 29 and 61 days after the burst. The spectroscopy shows an emission line at 2.15 microns which we interpret as tellurium (atomic mass A=130), and a very red source, emitting most of its light in the mid-IR due to the production of lanthanides. These observations demonstrate that nucleosynthesis in GRBs can create r-process elements across a broad atomic mass range and play a central role in heavy element nucleosynthesis across the Universe.

### 83) [2306.10450](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10450v1): ALMA reveals a stable rotating gas disk in a paradoxical low-mass, ultra-dusty galaxy at z = 4.274

We report ALMA detections of [CII] and dust continuum in Az9, a multiply-imaged galaxy behind the Frontier Field cluster MACSJ0717.5+3745. The bright [CII] emission line provides a spectroscopic redshift of z = 4.274. This strongly lensed (mu = 7 +/- 1) galaxy has an intrinsic stellar mass of only 2e9 Msun and a total star formation rate of 26 Msun/yr (~80% of which is dust obscured). Using public magnification maps, we reconstruct the [CII] emission in the source plane to reveal a stable, rotation-dominated disk with V/sigma = 5.3, which is &gt; 2x higher than predicted from simulations for similarly high-redshift, low-mass galaxies. In the source plane, the [CII] disk has a half-light radius of 1.8 kpc and, along with the dust, is spatially offset from the peak of the stellar light by 1.4 kpc. Az9 is not deficient in [CII]; L[CII]/LIR = 0.0027 consistent with local and high redshift normal star forming galaxies. While dust-obscured star formation is expected to dominate in higher mass galaxies, such a large reservoir of dust and gas in a lower mass disk galaxy 1.4 Gyr after the Big Bang challenges our picture of early galaxy evolution. Furthermore, the prevalence of such low-mass dusty galaxies has important implications for the selection of the highest redshift dropout galaxies with JWST. As one of the lowest stellar mass galaxies at z &gt; 4 to be detected in dust continuum and [CII], Az9 is an excellent laboratory in which to study early dust enrichment in the interstellar medium.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revolutionizing our knowledge of z&gt;5 galaxies and their actively accreting black holes. Using the JWST Cycle 1 Treasury program Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) in the lensing field Abell 2744, we report the identification of a sample of little red dots at 3 &lt; z_{\rm{phot}} &lt; 7 that likely contain highly-reddened accreting supermassive black holes. Using a NIRCam-only selection to F444W&lt;27.7 mag, we find 26 sources over the ~45 arcmin^{2} field that are blue in F115W-F200W~0 (or \beta_{\rm UV}~-2.0 for f_{\lambda} \propto \lambda^\beta), red in F200W-F444W = 1-4 (\beta_{\rm opt} ~ +2.0), and are dominated by a point-source like central component. Of the 20 sources with deep ALMA 1.2-mm coverage, none are detected individually or in a stack. For the majority of the sample, SED fits to the JWST+ALMA observations prefer models with hot dust rather than obscured star-formation to reproduce the red NIRCam colors and ALMA 1.2-mm non-detections. While compact dusty star formation can not be ruled out, the combination of extremely small sizes (\langle r_e \rangle\approx50 pc after correction for magnification), red rest-frame optical slopes, and hot dust can by explained by reddened broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our targets have faint M_{\rm 1450} \approx -14\ \, {\rm to} -18 mag but inferred bolometric luminosities of L_{\rm bol} = 10^{43}-10^{46} erg/s, reflecting their obscured nature. If the candidates are confirmed as AGNs with upcoming UNCOVER spectroscopy, then we have found an abundant population of reddened luminous AGN that are at least ten times more numerous than UV-luminous AGN at the same intrinsic bolometric luminosity.

Characterising the prevalence and properties of faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early Universe is key for understanding the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and determining their role in cosmic reionization. We perform a spectroscopic search for broad H\alpha emitters at z\approx4-6 using deep JWST/NIRCam imaging and wide field slitless spectroscopy from the EIGER and FRESCO surveys. We identify 20 H\alpha lines at z=4.2-5.5 that have broad components with line widths from ~1200-3700 km s^{-1}, contributing ~30-90 % of the total line flux. We interpret these broad components as being powered by accretion onto SMBHs with implied masses ~10^{7-8} M_{\odot}. In the UV luminosity range M_{\rm UV}=-21 to -18, we measure number densities of \approx10^{-5} cMpc^{-3}. This is an order of magnitude higher than expected from extrapolating quasar UV luminosity functions. Yet, such AGN are found in only &lt;1 % of star-forming galaxies at z~5. The SMBH mass function agrees with large cosmological simulations. In two objects we detect narrow red- and blue-shifted H\alpha absorption indicative, respectively, of dense gas fueling SMBH growth and outflows. We may be witnessing early AGN feedback that will clear dust-free pathways through which more massive blue quasars are seen. We uncover a strong correlation between reddening and the fraction of total galaxy luminosity arising from faint AGN. This implies that early SMBH growth is highly obscured and that faint AGN are only minor contributors to cosmic reionization.

<p>
The onset of galaxy formation is thought to be initiated by the infall of neutral, pristine gas onto the first protogalactic halos. However, direct constraints on the abundance of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) in galaxies have been difficult to obtain at early cosmic times. Here we present spectroscopic observations with JWST of three galaxies at redshifts z=8.8 - 11.4, about 400-600 Myr after the Big Bang, that show strong damped Lyman-\alpha absorption (N_{\rm HI} &gt; 10^{22} cm^{-2}) from HI in their local surroundings, an order of magnitude in excess of the Lyman-\alpha absorption caused by the neutral intergalactic medium at these redshifts. Consequently, these early galaxies cannot be contributing significantly to reionization, at least at their current evolutionary stages. Simulations of galaxy formation show that such massive gas reservoirs surrounding young galaxies so early in the history of the universe is a signature of galaxy formation in progress.

The first JWST data revealed an unexpected population of red galaxies that appear to have redshifts of z~ 7-9 and high masses of M_* ~ 10^{10} M_{\odot} (Labb\'e et al. 2023). Here we fit S\'ersic profiles to the F200W NIRCam images of the 13 massive galaxy candidates of Labb\'e et al., to determine their structural parameters. Satisfactory fits were obtained for nine galaxies. We find that their effective radii are extremely small, ranging from r_{\rm e}~ 80 pc to r_{\rm e} ~ 300 pc, with a mean of \langle r_{\rm e}\rangle \approx 150 pc. For their apparent stellar masses, the galaxies are smaller than any other galaxy population that has been observed at any other redshift. We use the fits to derive circularized three-dimensional stellar mass profiles of the galaxies, and compare these to the mass profiles of massive quiescent galaxies at z~2.3 and nearby elliptical galaxies. We find that, despite the high redshift galaxies having 10-20 times smaller half-light radii, the central stellar densities are comparable to those of their putative descendants at later times. The most straightforward interpretation is that the dense compact inner regions of the most massive ellipticals today were already in place ~ 600 Myr after the Big Bang. We caution that the redshifts and masses of the galaxies remain to be confirmed, and that the complex NIRCam point spread function is not yet fully characterized.

The ALMA lensing cluster survey (ALCS) is a 96-hr large program dedicated to uncovering and characterizing intrinsically faint continuum sources and line emitters with the assistance of gravitational lensing. All 33 cluster fields were selected from HST/Spitzer treasury programs including CLASH, Hubble Frontier Fields, and RELICS, which also have Herschel and Chandra coverages. The total sky area surveyed reaches ~133 arcmin^2 down to a depth of ~60 &mu;Jy beam^{-1} (1\sigma) at 1.2 mm, yielding 141 secure blind detections of continuum sources and additional 39 sources aided by priors. We present scientific motivation, survey design, the status of spectroscopy follow-up observations, and number counts down to ~7 &mu;Jy. Synergies with JWST are also discussed.

<p>
We present JWST/NIRSpec prism spectroscopy of MACS0647-JD, the triply-lensed z ~ 11 candidate discovered in HST imaging and spatially resolved by JWST imaging into two components A and B. Spectroscopy of component A yields a spectroscopic redshift z=10.17 based on 7 detected emission lines: CIII] \lambda\lambda1907,1909, [OII] \lambda3727, [NeIII] \lambda3869, [NeIII] \lambda3968, H\delta \lambda4101, H\gamma \lambda4340, and [OIII] \lambda4363. These are the second-most distant detections of these emission lines to date, in a galaxy observed just 460 million years after the Big Bang. Based on observed and extrapolated line flux ratios we derive a gas-phase metallicity Z = log(O/H) = 7.5 - 8.0, or (0.06 - 0.2) Z_\odot, ionization parameter log(U) ~ -1.9\pm0.2, and an ionizing photon production efficiency {\rm log}(\xi_{\rm ion})=25.2\pm0.2\,erg^{-1} Hz. The spectrum has a softened Lyman-\alpha break, evidence for a strong Ly\alpha damping wing, suggesting that MACS0647-JD was unable to ionize its surroundings beyond its immediate vicinity (R_{\text{HII}} \ll 1 pMpc). The Ly\alpha damping wing also suppresses the F150W photometry, explaining the slightly overestimated photometric redshift z = 10.6 \pm 0.3. MACS0647-JD has a stellar mass log(M/M_\odot) = 8.1 \pm 0.3, including ~ 6\times 10^7 M_\odot in component A, most of which formed recently (within ~ 20 Myr) with a star formation rate 2\pm1 M_\odot / yr, all within an effective radius 70\pm24\,pc. The smaller component B (r ~ 20) pc is likely older (~100 Myr) with more dust (A_V ~ 0.1 mag), as found previously. Spectroscopy of a fainter companion galaxy C separated by a distance of \about\ 3\,kpc reveals a Lyman break consistent with z = 10.17. MACS0647-JD is likely the most distant galaxy merger known.

<p>
We present the results of a search for high-redshift (z&gt;9) galaxy candidates in the JWST UNCOVER survey, using deep NIRCam and NIRISS imaging in 7 bands over ~45 arcmin^2 and ancillary HST observations. The NIRCam observations reach a 5-\sigma limiting magnitude of ~ 29.2 AB. The identification of high-z candidates relies on a combination of a dropout selection and photometric redshifts. We find 16 candidates at 9&lt;z&lt;12 and 3 candidates at 12&lt;z&lt;13, eight candidates are deemed very robust. Their lensing amplification ranges from &mu;=1.2 to 11.5. Candidates have a wide range of (lensing-corrected) luminosities and young ages, with low stellar masses (6.8&lt; log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) &lt;9.5) and low star formation rates (SFR=0.2-7 M_{\odot} yr^{-1}), confirming previous findings in early JWST observations of z&gt;9. A few galaxies at z~9-10 appear to show a clear Balmer break between the F356W and F444W/F410M bands, which helps constrain their stellar mass. We estimate blue UV continuum slopes between \beta=-1.8 and -2.3, typical for early galaxies at z&gt;9 but not as extreme as the bluest recently discovered sources. We also find evidence for a rapid redshift-evolution of the mass-luminosity relation and a redshift-evolution of the UV continuum slope for a given range of intrinsic magnitude, in line with theoretical predictions. These findings suggest that deeper JWST observations are needed to reach the fainter galaxy population at those early epochs, and follow-up spectroscopy will help better constrain the physical properties and star formation histories of a larger sample of galaxies.

We use JWST/NIRCam medium band photometry in a single pointing of the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS) to identify 118 Extreme Emission Line Galaxies (EELGs) over 1.7 \lesssim z \lesssim 6.7, selected using a set of color cuts that target galaxies with extreme \text{[OIII] + H}\beta and H\alpha emission. We show that our medium band color selections are able to select galaxies based on emission line equivalent width (EW), which is advantageous to more commonly used selections since it does not require strong continuum emission, and can select galaxies with faint or red continuum fluxes. The median EWs of our sample is EW(\text{H}\alpha) = 893 &#8491;\ and EW(\text{[OIII] + H}\beta) = 1255 &#8491;, and includes some objects with EW(\text{[OIII] + H}\beta) ~ 3000 &#8491;. These systems are mostly compact with low stellar mass (median \log(M_\star/M_\odot) = 8.03), low metallicity (median Z = 0.14 Z_\odot), little dust (median A_V = 0.18 mag) and high SSFR (median SSFR = 1.18 \times 10^{-8}/yr). Additionally, galaxies in our sample show increasing EW(\Ha) and EW(\OIIIHb) with redshift, an anti-correlation of EW(\Ha) with stellar mass, and no correlation between EW(\OIIIHb) and stellar mass. Finally, we present NIRSpec spectroscopy of 15 of the EELGs in our sample. These spectra confirm the redshifts and EWs of the EELGs calculated from the medium bands, which demonstrates the accuracy and efficiency of our color selections. Overall, we show that there are significant advantages to using medium band photometry to identify and study EELGs at a wide range of redshifts.

<p>
We present the JWST Cycle 1 53.8hr medium program FRESCO, short for "First Reionization Epoch Spectroscopically Complete Observations". FRESCO covers 62 arcmin^2 in each of the two GOODS/CANDELS fields for a total area of 124 arcmin^2 exploiting JWST's powerful new grism spectroscopic capabilities at near-infrared wavelengths. By obtaining ~2 hr deep NIRCam/grism observations with the F444W filter, FRESCO yields unprecedented spectra at R~1600 covering 3.8 to 5.0 &mu;m for most galaxies in the NIRCam field-of-view. This setup enables emission line measurements over most of cosmic history, from strong PAH lines at z~0.2-0.5, to Pa\alpha and Pa\beta at z~1-3, HeI and [SIII] at z~2.5-4.5, H\alpha and [NII] at z~5-6.5, up to [OIII] and H\beta for z~7-9 galaxies, and possibly even [OII] at z~10-12. FRESCO's grism observations provide total line fluxes for accurately estimating galaxy stellar masses and calibrating slit-loss corrections of NIRSpec/MSA spectra in the same field. Additionally, FRESCO results in a mosaic of F182M, F210M, and F444W imaging in the same fields to a depth of ~28.2 mag (5 \sigma in 0.32" diameter apertures). Together with this publication, the v1 imaging mosaics are released as high-level science products via MAST. Here, we describe the overall survey design and the key science goals that can be addressed with FRESCO. We also highlight several, early science results, including: spectroscopic redshifts of Lyman break galaxies that were identified almost 20 years ago, the discovery of broad-line active galactic nuclei at z&gt;4, and resolved Pa\alpha maps of galaxies at z~1.4. These results demonstrate the enormous power for serendipitous discovery of NIRCam/grism observations.

We present the first results on the spatial distribution of dust attenuation at 1.0&lt;z&lt;2.4 traced by the Balmer Decrement, H\alpha/H\beta, in emission-line galaxies using deep JWST NIRISS slitless spectroscopy from the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). H\alpha and H\beta emission line maps of emission-line galaxies are extracted and stacked in bins of stellar mass for two grism redshift bins, 1.0&lt;z_{grism}&lt;1.7 and 1.7&lt;z_{grism}&lt;2.4. Surface brightness profiles for the Balmer Decrement are measured and radial profiles of the dust attenuation towards H\alpha, A_{\mathrm{H}\alpha}, are derived. In both redshift bins, the integrated Balmer Decrement increases with stellar mass. Lower mass (7.6\leqslantLog(M_{*}/M_{\odot})&lt;10.0) galaxies have centrally concentrated, negative dust attenuation profiles whereas higher mass galaxies (10.0\leqslantLog(M_{*}/M_{\odot})&lt;11.1) have flat dust attenuation profiles. The total dust obscuration is mild, with on average 0.07\pm0.07 and 0.14\pm0.07 mag in the low and high redshift bins respectively. We model the typical light profiles of star-forming galaxies at these redshifts and stellar masses with GALFIT and apply both uniform and radially varying dust attenuation corrections based on our integrated Balmer Decrements and radial dust attenuation profiles. If these galaxies were observed with typical JWST NIRSpec slit spectroscopy (0.2\times0.5^{\prime\prime} shutters), on average, H\alpha star formation rates (SFRs) measured after slit-loss corrections assuming uniform dust attenuation will overestimate the total SFR by 6\pm21 &percnt; and 26\pm9 &percnt; at 1.0\leqslant z &lt; 1.7 and 1.7\leqslant z &lt; 2.4 respectively.

### 94) [2303.17246](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17246v1): Sub-Millimetre Galaxies with Webb: Near-Infrared Counterparts and Multi-wavelength Morphology

We utilise the unprecedented depth and resolution of recent early-release science (ERS) JWST observations to define the near-infrared counterparts of sub-millimetre selected galaxies (SMGs). We identify 45 SCUBA-2 SMG positions within The Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) JWST/NIRCam fields. Through an analysis of multi-wavelength p-values, NIRCam colours and predicted SCUBA-2 fluxes, we define 43 JWST/NIRCam counterparts to the SCUBA-2 SMGs, finding a 63 per cent agreement with those identified in prior HST studies. Using EaZy-py we fit the available HST and JWST observations to quantify the photometric redshifts of the NIRCam-SMGs, establishing a broad range of redshift from z\approx0.2-5.4 with a median of z\approx2.29, in agreement with other studies of SMGs. We analyse their rest-frame optical and near-infrared morphological properties (e.g. effective radius (R_{\rm e}), S\'ersic index (n), CAS, Gini and M_{20}), finding, on average, late-type disc-like morphologies with large scatter into the intermediate and merger regions of the non-parametric parameter space. For the non-merging galaxies, we find a median rest-frame optical size and S\'ersic index (and 1\sigma scatter) of R_{\rm e}=3.10\pm1.67kpc and n=0.96\pm0.66. Whilst in the rest-frame near-infrared we establish more compact, higher S\'ersic index morphologies (R_{\rm e}=1.64\pm0.97, n=1.85\pm0.63). We further establish that both the rest-frame optical and near-infrared effective radii correlate negatively (at a 2\sigma level) with redshift whilst the S\'ersic index remains constant with cosmic time. Our results are consistent with the picture of inside-out galaxy evolution, with more centrally concentrated older stellar populations, and more extended, younger star-forming regions whose stellar emission is heavily attenuated in the central regions.

### 95) [2303.11397](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11397v1): A JWST/NIRSpec Exploration of the Connection between Ionization Parameter, Electron Density, and Star-Formation-Rate Surface Density in z=2.7-6.3 Galaxies

<p> Naveen A. Reddy, Michael W. Topping, Ryan L. Sanders, Alice E. Shapley, Gabriel Brammer </p>
<p>
We conduct a statistical analysis of the factors responsible for the variation in the ionization parameter (U) of high-redshift star-forming galaxies based on medium resolution JWST/NIRSpec observations obtained by the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey. The sample consists of 48 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts z=2.7-6.3 which are largely representative of typical star-forming galaxies at these redshifts. The [SII] 6718, 6733 doublet is used to estimate electron densities (n_e), and dust-corrected Ha luminosities are used to compute total ionizing photon rates (Q). Using composite spectra of galaxies in bins of [OIII]/[OII] (i.e., O32) as a proxy for U, we determine that galaxies with higher O32 have &lt;n_e&gt; ~ 500 cm^-3 that are at least a factor of ~5 larger than that of lower-O32 galaxies. We do not find a significant difference in &lt;Q&gt; between low- and high-O32 galaxies. Photoionization modeling of all available strong rest-frame optical emission lines is used to simultaneously constrain U and oxygen abundance (Z_neb). We find a large spread in log U of ~1.5 dex at a fixed Z_neb. On the other hand, the data indicate a highly significant correlation between U and star-formation-rate surface density (Sigma_SFR) which appears to be redshift invariant at z~1.6-6.3, and possibly up to z~9.5. We consider several avenues through which metallicity and Sigma_SFR (or gas density) may influence U, including variations in n_e and Q that are tied to metallicity and gas density, internal dust extinction of ionizing photons, and the effects of gas density on the volume filling fraction of dense clumps in HII regions and the escape fraction of ionizing photons. Based on these considerations, we conclude that gas density may play a more central role than metallicity in modulating U at these redshifts.

<p>
We report the discovery of a low-mass z=5.200\pm 0.002 galaxy that is in the process of ceasing its star formation. The galaxy, MACS0417-z5PSB, is multiply imaged with magnification factors ~40 by the galaxy cluster MACS J0417.5-1154, observed as part of the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). Using observations of MACS0417-z5PSB with a JWST/NIRSpec Prism spectrum and NIRCam imaging, we investigate the mechanism responsible for the cessation of star formation of the galaxy, and speculate about possibilities for its future. Using spectrophotometric fitting, we find a remarkably low stellar mass of \rm{M_*}=4.3\pm^{0.9}_{0.8} \times 10^{7} \rm{M_{\odot}}, less than 1% of the characteristic stellar mass at z~5. We measure a de-lensed rest-UV half-light radius in the source plane of 30\pm^{7}_{5} pc, and measure a star formation rate from H\alpha of 0.14\pm^{0.17}_{0.12} \rm{M_{\odot}/yr}. We find that under the assumption of a double power law star formation history, MACS0417-z5PSB has seen a recent rise in star formation, peaking ~10-30 Myr ago and declining precipitously since then. Together, these measurements reveal a low-mass, extremely compact galaxy which is in the process of ceasing star formation. We investigate the possibilities of mechanisms that have led to the cessation of star formation in MACS0417-z5PSB, considering stellar and AGN feedback, and environmental processes. We can likely rule out an AGN and most environmental processes, but leave open the possibility that MACS0417-z5PSB could be a star forming galaxy in the lull of a bursty star formation history.

<p>
We present a new high-precision, JWST-based, strong lensing model for the galaxy cluster Abell 2744 at z=0.3072. By combining the deep, high-resolution JWST imaging from the GLASS-JWST and UNCOVER programs and a Director's Discretionary Time program, with newly obtained VLT/MUSE data, we identify 32 multiple images from 11 background sources lensed by two external sub-clusters at distances of ~160" from the main cluster. The new MUSE observations enable the first spectroscopic confirmation of a multiple image system in the external clumps. Moreover, the re-analysis of the spectro-photometric archival and JWST data yields 27 additional multiple images in the main cluster. The new lens model is constrained by 149 multiple images (~66&percnt; more than in our previous Bergamini et al. 2023 model) covering an extended redshift range between 1.03 and 9.76. The subhalo mass component of the cluster includes 177 member galaxies down to m_{\rm F160W}=21, 163 of which are spectroscopically confirmed. Internal velocity dispersions are measured for 85 members. The new lens model is characterized by a remarkably low scatter between predicted and observed positions of the multiple images (0.43"). This precision is unprecedented given the large multiple image sample, the complexity of the cluster mass distribution, and the large modeled area. The improved accuracy and resolution of the cluster total mass distribution provides a robust magnification map over a ~\!45 arcmin^2 area, which is critical for inferring the intrinsic physical properties of the highly magnified, high-z sources. The lens model and the new MUSE redshift catalog are released with this publication.

### 98) [2303.08149](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08149v1): Direct T_e-based Metallicities of z=2-9 Galaxies with JWST/NIRSpec: Empirical Metallicity Calibrations Applicable from Reionization to Cosmic Noon

<p> Ryan L. Sanders, Alice E. Shapley, Michael W. Topping, Naveen A. Reddy, Gabriel B. Brammer </p>
<p>
We report detections of the [OIII]\lambda4364 auroral emission line for 16 galaxies at z=2.1-8.7, measured from JWST/NIRSpec observations obtained as part of the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey program. We combine this CEERS sample with 9 objects from the literature at z=4-9 with auroral-line detections from JWST/NIRSpec and 21 galaxies at z=1.4-3.7 with auroral-line detections from ground-based spectroscopy. We derive electron temperature T_e and direct-method oxygen abundances for the combined sample of 46 star-forming galaxies at z=1.4-8.7. We use these measurements to construct the first high-redshift empirical T_e-based metallicity calibrations for the strong-line ratios [OIII]/H\beta, [OII]/H\beta, R23=([OIII]+[OII])/H\beta, [OIII]/[OII], and [NeIII]/[OII]. These new calibrations are valid over 12+log(O/H)=7.0-8.4 and can be applied to samples of star-forming galaxies at z=2-9, leading to an improvement in the accuracy of metallicity determinations at Cosmic Noon and in the Epoch of Reionization. The high-redshift strong-line relations are offset from calibrations based on typical z~0 galaxies or HII regions, reflecting the known evolution of ionization conditions between z~0 and z~2. Deep spectroscopic programs with JWST/NIRSpec promise to improve statistics at the low and high ends of the metallicity range covered by the current sample, as well as improve the detection rate of [NII]\lambda6585 to allow the future assessment of N-based indicators. These new high-redshift calibrations will enable accurate characterizations of metallicity scaling relations at high redshift, improving our understanding of feedback and baryon cycling in the early universe.

### 99) [2303.00410](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00410v2): JWST/NIRSpec Measurements of the Relationships Between Nebular Emission-line Ratios and Stellar Mass at z~3-6

<p> Alice E. Shapley, Naveen A. Reddy, Ryan L. Sanders, Michael W. Topping, Gabriel B. Brammer </p>
<p>
We analyze the rest-optical emission-line ratios of star-forming galaxies at 2.7&lt;=z&lt;6.5 drawn from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey, and their relationships with stellar mass (M_*). Our analysis includes both line ratios based on the [NII]6583 feature -- [NII]6583/Ha, ([OIII]5007/Hb)/([NII]6583/Ha) (O3N2), and [NII]6583/[OII]3727 -- and those those featuring alpha elements -- [OIII]5007/Hb, [OIII]5007/[OII]3727 (O_32), ([OIII]4959,5007+[OII]3727)/Hb (R_23), and [NeIII]3869/[OII]3727. Given the typical flux levels of [NII]6583 and [NeIII]3869, which are undetected in the majority of individual CEERS galaxies at 2.7&lt;=z&lt;6.5, we construct composite spectra in bins of M_* and redshift. Using these composite spectra, we compare the relationships between emission-line ratios and M_* at 2.7&lt;=z&lt;6.5 with those observed at lower redshift. While there is significant evolution towards higher excitation (e.g., higher [OIII]5007/Hb, O_32, O3N2), and weaker nitrogen emission (e.g., lower [NII]6583/Ha and [NII]6583/[OII]3727) between z~0 and z~3, we find in most cases that there is no significant evolution in the relationship between line ratio and M_* beyond z~3. The [NeIII]3869/[OII]3727 ratio is anomalous in showing evidence for significant elevation at 4.0&lt;=z&lt;6.5 at fixed mass, relative to z~3.3. Collectively, however, our empirical results suggest that there is no significant evolution in the mass-metallicity relationship at 2.7&lt;=z&lt;6.5. Representative galaxy samples and metallicity calibrations based on existing and upcoming JWST/NIRSpec observations will be required to translate these empirical scaling relations into ones tracing chemical enrichment and gas cycling, and distinguish among the descriptions of star-formation feedback in simulations of galaxy formation at z&gt;3.

<p>
We present the results of a systematic search for candidate quiescent galaxies in the distant Universe in eleven JWST fields with publicly available observations collected during the first three months of operations and covering an effective sky area of ~145 arcmin^2. We homogeneously reduce the new JWST data and combine them with existing observations from the Hubble\,Space\,Telescope. We select a robust sample of ~80 candidate quiescent and quenching galaxies at 3 &lt; z &lt; 5 using two methods: (1) based on their rest-frame UVJ colors, and (2) a novel quantitative approach based on Gaussian Mixture Modeling of the NUV-U, U-V, and V-J rest-frame color space, which is more sensitive to recently quenched objects. We measure comoving number densities of massive (M_\star\geq 10^{10.6} M_\odot) quiescent galaxies consistent with previous estimates relying on ground-based observations, after homogenizing the results in the literature with our mass and redshift intervals. However, we find significant field-to-field variations of the number densities up to a factor of 2-3, highlighting the effect of cosmic variance and suggesting the presence of overdensities of red quiescent galaxies at z&gt;3, as it could be expected for highly clustered massive systems. Importantly, JWST enables the robust identification of quenching/quiescent galaxy candidates at lower masses and higher redshifts than before, challenging standard formation scenarios. All data products, including the literature compilation, are made publicly available.

<p>
The abundance of carbon relative to oxygen (C/O) is a promising probe of star formation history in the early universe, as the ratio changes with time due to production of these elements by different nucleosynthesis pathways. We present a measurement of \log{\mathrm{(C/O)}} = -1.01\pm0.12 (stat) \pm0.15 (sys) in a z=6.23 galaxy observed as part of the GLASS-JWST Early Release Science Program. Notably, we achieve good precision thanks to the detection of the rest-frame ultraviolet O III], C III], and C IV emission lines delivered by JWST/NIRSpec. The C/O abundance is ~0.8 dex lower than the solar value and is consistent with the expected yield from core-collapse supernovae, indicating that longer-lived intermediate mass stars have not fully contributed to carbon enrichment. This in turn implies rapid buildup of a young stellar population with age \lesssim100 Myr in a galaxy seen ~900 million years after the Big Bang. Our chemical abundance analysis is consistent with spectral energy distribution modeling of JWST/NIRCam photometric data, which indicates a current stellar mass \log\,\mathrm{M}_* / \mathrm{M_{sun}} = 8.4^{+0.4}_{-0.2} and specific star formation rate sSFR ~eq 20 Gyr^{-1}. These results showcase the value of chemical abundances and C/O in particular to study the earliest stages of galaxy assembly.

<p>
Using the novel JWST/NIRCam observations in the Abell 2744 field, we present a first spatially resolved overview of an HST-dark galaxy, spectroscopically confirmed at z=2.58 with magnification &mu;\approx1.9. While being largely invisible at ~1 &mu;m with NIRCam, except for sparse clumpy sub-structures, the object is well-detected and resolved in the long-wavelength bands with a spiral shape clearly visible in F277W. By combining ancillary ALMA and Herschel data, we infer that this object is an edge-on dusty spiral with an intrinsic stellar mass log(M_*/M_\odot)~11.3 and a dust-obscured SFR~ 300~M_\odot~yr^{-1}. A massive quiescent galaxy (log(M_*/M_\odot)~10.8) with tidal features lies 2\farcs{0} away (r~9 kpc), at a consistent redshift as inferred by JWST photometry, indicating a potential major merger. The dusty spiral lies on the main-sequence of star formation, and shows high dust attenuation in the optical (3&lt;A_{\rm V}&lt;4.5). In the far-infrared, its integrated dust SED is optically thick up to \lambda_0 ~ 500 &mu;m, further supporting the extremely dusty nature. Spatially resolved analysis of the HST-dark galaxy reveals a largely uniform A_{\rm V}~ 4 area spanning ~57 kpc^2, which spatially matches to the ALMA 1 mm continuum emission. Accounting for the surface brightness dimming and the depths of current JWST surveys, unlensed analogs of the HST-dark galaxy at z&gt;4 would be only detectable in F356W and F444W in UNCOVER-like survey, and become totally JWST-dark at z~6. This suggests that detecting highly attenuated galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization might be a challenging task for JWST.

Windhorst </p>
<p>
The escape fraction of Lyman-continuum (LyC) photons (f_{esc}) is a key parameter for determining the sources of cosmic reionization at z\geq 6. At these redshifts, owing to the opacity of the intergalactic medium, the LyC emission cannot be measured directly. However, LyC leakers during the epoch of reionization could be identified using indirect indicators that have been extensively tested at low and intermediate redshifts. These include a high [OIII]/[OII] flux ratio, high star-formation surface density, and compact sizes. In this work, we present observations of 29 4.5 \leq z \leq 8 gravitationally lensed galaxies in the Abell 2744 cluster field. From a combined analysis of JWST-NIRSpec and NIRCam data, we accurately derived their physical and spectroscopic properties: our galaxies have low masses (\log(M_\star)~ 8.5), blue UV spectral slopes (\beta ~ -2.1), compact sizes (r_e ~ 0.3-0.5 kpc), and high [OIII]/[OII] flux ratios. We confirm that these properties are similar to those characterizing low-redshift LyC leakers. Indirectly inferring the fraction of escaping ionizing photons, we find that more than 80% of our galaxies have predicted f_{esc} values larger than 0.05, indicating that they would be considered leakers. The average predicted f_{esc} value of our sample is 0.12, suggesting that similar galaxies at z\geq 6 have provided a substantial contribution to cosmic reionization.

In November 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) returned deep near-infrared images of Abell 2744 -- a powerful lensing cluster capable of magnifying distant, incipient galaxies beyond it. Together with the existing Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, this publicly available dataset opens a fundamentally new discovery space to understand the remaining mysteries of the formation and evolution of galaxies across cosmic time. In this work, we detect and measure some 60,000 objects across the 49 arcmin^2 JWST footprint down to a 5\,\sigma limiting magnitude of ~30 mag in 0.32" apertures. Photometry is performed using circular apertures on images matched to the point spread function of the reddest NIRCam broad band, F444W, and cleaned of bright cluster galaxies and the related intra-cluster light. To give an impression of the photometric performance, we measure photometric redshifts and achieve a \sigma_{\rm NMAD}\approx0.03 based on known, but relatively small, spectroscopic samples. With this paper, we publicly release our HST and JWST PSF-matched photometric catalog with optimally assigned aperture sizes for easy use, along with single aperture catalogs, photometric redshifts, rest-frame colors, and individual magnification estimates. These catalogs will set the stage for efficient and deep spectroscopic follow-up of some of the first JWST-selected samples in Summer 2023.

<p>
We study the spatially resolved stellar populations of 444 galaxies at 0.3&lt;z&lt;6.0 in two clusters (WHL0137-08 and MACS0647+70) and a blank field, combining imaging data from HST and JWST to perform spatially resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling using pixedfit. The high spatial resolution of the imaging data combined with magnification from gravitational lensing in the cluster fields allows us to resolve some galaxies to sub-kpc scales (for 109 of our galaxies). At redshifts around cosmic noon and higher (2.5\lesssim z\lesssim 6.0), we find mass doubling times to be independent of radius, inferred from flat specific star formation rate (sSFR) radial profiles and similarities between the half-mass and half-SFR radii. At lower redshifts (1.5\lesssim z\lesssim 2.5), a significant fraction of our star-forming galaxies show evidence for nuclear starbursts, inferred from centrally elevated sSFR, and a much smaller half-SFR radius compared to the half-mass radius. At later epochs, we find more galaxies suppress star formation in their center but are still actively forming stars in the disk. Overall, these trends point toward a picture of inside-out galaxy growth consistent with theoretical models and simulations. We also observe a tight relationship between the central mass surface density and global stellar mass with ~ 0.38 dex scatter. Our analysis demonstrates the potential of spatially resolved SED analysis with JWST data. Future analysis with larger samples will be able to further explore the assembly of galaxy mass and the growth of their structures

<p>
We present images and a multi-wavelength photometric catalog based on all of the JWST NIRCam observations obtained to date in the region of the Abell 2744 galaxy cluster. These data come from three different programs, namely the GLASS-JWST Early Release Science Program, UNCOVER, and Director's Discretionary Time program 2756. The observed area in the NIRCam wide-band filters - covering the central and extended regions of the cluster, as well as new parallel fields - is 46.5 arcmin^2 in total. All images in eight bands (F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M, F444W) have been reduced adopting the latest calibration and reference files available. Data reduction has been performed using an augmented version of the official JWST pipeline, with improvements aimed at removing or mitigating defects in the raw images and improving the background subtraction and photometric accuracy. We obtain a F444W-detected multi-band catalog, including all NIRCam and available HST data, adopting forced aperture photometry on PSF-matched images. The catalog is intended to enable early scientific investigations and is optimized for the study of faint galaxies; it contains 24389 sources, with a 5\sigma limiting magnitude in the F444W band ranging from 28.5 AB to 30.5 AB, as a result of the varying exposure times of the surveys that observed the field. We publicly release the reduced NIRCam images, associated multi-wavelength catalog and code adopted for 1/f noise removal with the aim of aiding users to familiarize themselves with JWST NIRCam data and identify suitable targets for follow-up observations.

### 107) [2212.11638](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11638v3): A population of faint, old, and massive quiescent galaxies at 3 &lt; z &lt; 4 revealed by JWST NIRSpec Spectroscopy

<p>
Here we present a sample of 12 massive quiescent galaxy candidates at z~3-4 observed with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec). These galaxies were pre-selected from the Hubble Space Telescope imaging and 10 of our sources were unable to be spectroscopically confirmed by ground based spectroscopy. By combining spectroscopic data from NIRSpec with multi-wavelength imaging data from the JWST Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam), we analyse their stellar populations and their formation histories. We find that all of our galaxies classify as quiescent based on the reconstruction of their star formation histories but show a variety of quenching timescales and ages. All our galaxies are massive (~0.1-1.2 \times 10^{11} M\odot), with masses comparable to massive galaxies in the local Universe. We find that the oldest galaxy in our sample formed ~1.0\times10^{11} M\odot of mass within the first few hundred million years of the Universe and has been quenched for more than a billion years by the time of observation at z~3.2 (~2 billion years after the Big Bang). Our results point to very early formation of massive galaxies requiring a high conversion rate of baryons to stars in the early Universe.

<p>
Recent JWST/NIRCam imaging taken for the ultra-deep UNCOVER program reveals a very red dropout object at z_{\mathrm{phot}}~eq7.6, triply imaged by the galaxy cluster Abell 2744 (z_{\mathrm{d}}=0.308). All three images are very compact, i.e. unresolved, with a de-lensed size upper-limit of r_{e}\lesssim35 pc. The images have apparent magnitudes of m_{\mathrm{F444W}}~25-26 AB, and the magnification-corrected absolute UV magnitude of the source is M_{\mathrm{UV},1450}=-16.81\pm0.09. From the sum of observed fluxes and from a spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis, we obtain estimates of the bolometric luminosities of the source of L_{\mathrm{bol}}\gtrsim10^{43} \frac{\mathrm{erg}}{\mathrm{s}} and L_{\mathrm{bol}}~10^{44}-10^{46} \frac{\mathrm{erg}}{\mathrm{s}}, respectively. Based on its compact, point-like appearance, its position in color-color space and the SED analysis, we tentatively conclude that this object is a UV-faint dust-obscured quasar-like object, i.e. an active galactic nucleus (AGN) at high redshift. We also discuss other alternative origins for the object's emission features, including a massive star cluster, Population III, supermassive, or dark stars, or a direct-collapse black hole. Although populations of red galaxies at similar photometric redshifts have been detected with JWST, this object is unique in that its high-redshift nature is corroborated geometrically by lensing, that it is unresolved despite being magnified -- and thus intrinsically even more compact -- and that it occupies notably distinct regions in both size-luminosity and color-color space. Planned UNCOVER JWST/NIRSpec observations, scheduled in Cycle 1, will enable a more detailed analysis of this object.

<p>
We report the discovery of a compact group of galaxies, CGG-z5, at z~5.2 in the EGS field covered by the JWST/CEERS survey. CGG-z5 was selected as the highest overdensity of galaxies at z&gt;2 in recent JWST public surveys and it consists of six candidate members lying within a projected area of 1.5"\times3" (10\times20~kpc^2). All group members are HST/F435W and HST/F606W dropouts while securely detected in the JWST/NIRCam bands, yielding a narrow range of robust photometric redshifts 5.0&lt;z&lt;5.3. The most massive galaxy in the group has a stellar mass log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})\approx9.8, while the rest are low-mass satellites (log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})\approx8.4-9.2). While several group members were already detected in the HST and IRAC bands, the low stellar masses and the compactness of the structure required the sensitivity and resolution of JWST for its identification. To assess the nature and evolutionary path of CGG-z5, we searched for similar compact structures in the \textsc{Eagle} simulations and followed their evolution with time. We find that all the identified structures merge into a single galaxy by z=3 and form a massive galaxy (log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})&gt;11) at z~1. This implies that CGG-z5 could be a "proto-massive galaxy" captured during a short-lived phase of massive galaxy formation.

<p>
We present a spectroscopic redshift catalogue of the SMACS J0723.3-7327 field ("Webb's First Deep Field") obtained from JWST/NIRISS grism spectroscopy and supplemented with JWST/NIRSpec and VLT/MUSE redshifts. The catalogue contains a total of 190 sources with secure spectroscopic redshifts, including 156 NIRISS grism redshifts, 123 of which are for sources whose redshifts were previously unknown. These new grism redshifts are secured with two or more spectroscopic features (64 sources), or with a single spectral feature whose identity is secured from the object's nine-band photometric redshift (59 sources). These are complemented with 17 NIRSpec and 48 MUSE redshifts, including six new NIRSpec redshifts identified in this work. In addition to the z_{\rm cl}=0.39 cluster galaxy redshifts (for which we provide ~40 new NIRISS absorption-line redshifts), we also find three prominent galaxy overdensities at higher redshifts - at z=1.1, z=1.4, and z=2.0 - that were until now not seen in the JWST/NIRSpec and VLT/MUSE data. The paper describes the characteristics of our spectroscopic redshift sample and the methodology we have employed to obtain it. Our redshift catalogue is made available to the community at https://niriss.github.io/smacs0723.

<p>
We present a joint analysis of the galaxy S04590 at z=8.496 based on NIRSpec, NIRCam, and NIRISS observations obtained through as part of Early Release Observations programme of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the far-infrared [CII]-158&mu;m emission line detected by dedicated Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations. We determine the physical properties of S04590 from modelling of the spectral energy distribution (SED) and through the redshifted optical nebular emission lines detected with JWST/NIRSpec. The best-fit SED model reveals a low-mass (M_\star = 10^{7.2}-10^{8}\,M_{\odot}) galaxy with a low oxygen abundance of 12+\log{\rm (O/H)} = 7.16^{+0.10}_{-0.12} derived from the strong nebular and auroral emission lines. Assuming that [CII] effectively traces the interstellar medium (ISM), we estimate the total gas mass of the galaxy to be M_{\rm gas} = (8.0\pm 4.0)\times 10^{8}\,M_\odot based on the luminosity and spatial extent of [CII]. This yields an exceptionally high gas fraction, f_{\rm gas} = M_{\rm gas}/(M_{\rm gas} + M_\star) \gtrsim 90&percnt;, though still consistent within the range expected for its low metallicity. We further derive the metal mass of the galaxy based on the gas mass and gas-phase metallicity, which we find to be consistent with the expected metal production from Type II supernovae. Finally, we make the first constraints on the dust-to-gas (DTG) and dust-to-metals (DTM) ratios of galaxies in the epoch of reionization at z\gtrsim 6, showing overall low mass ratios of logDGT &lt;-3.8 and logDTM &lt;-0.5, though consistent with local scaling relations and in particular the local metal-poor galaxy I Zwicky 18. Our analysis highlights the synergy between ALMA and JWST in characterizing the gas, metal, and stellar content of the first generation of galaxies.

We present ALMA deep spectroscopy for a lensed galaxy at z_{\rm spec}=8.496 with \log(M_{\rm star}/M_{\odot})~7.8 whose optical nebular lines and stellar continuum are detected by JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam Early Release Observations in SMACS0723. Our ALMA spectrum shows [OIII]88&mu;m and [CII]158&mu;m line detections at 4.0\sigma and 4.5\sigma, respectively. The redshift and position of the [OIII] line coincide with those of the JWST source, while the [CII] line is blue-shifted by 90 km s^{-1} with a spatial offset of 0.''5 (\approx0.5 kpc in source plane) from the JWST source. The NIRCam F444W image, including [OIII]\lambda5007 and H\beta line emission, spatially extends beyond the stellar components by a factor of &gt;8. This indicates that the z=8.5 galaxy has already experienced strong outflows whose oxygen and carbon produce the extended [OIII]\lambda5007 and the offset [CII] emission, which would promote ionizing photon escape and facilitate reionization. With careful slit-loss corrections and removals of emission spatially outside the galaxy, we evaluate the [OIII]88&mu;m/\lambda5007 line ratio, and derive the electron density n_{\rm e} by photoionization modeling to be 220^{+170}_{-100} cm^{-3}, which is comparable with those of z~2-3 galaxies. We estimate an [OIII]88&mu;m/[CII]158&mu;m line ratio in the galaxy of &gt;4, as high as those of known z~6-9 galaxies. This high [OIII]88&mu;m/[CII]158&mu;m line ratio is generally explained by the high n_{\rm e} as well as the low metallicity (Z_{\rm gas}/Z_{\odot}=0.04^{+0.02}_{-0.02}), high ionization parameter (\log U &gt; -2.27), and low carbon-to-oxygen abundance ratio (\log(C/O) =[-0.52:-0.24]) obtained from the JWST/NIRSpec data; further [CII] follow-up observations will constrain the covering fraction of photodissociation regions.

<p>
We report the detection of a high density of redshift z\approx 10 galaxies behind the foreground cluster Abell 2744, selected from imaging data obtained recently with NIRCam onboard {\it JWST} by three programs -- GLASS-JWST, UNCOVER, and DDT\#2756. To ensure robust estimates of the lensing magnification &mu;, we use an improved version of our model that exploits the first epoch of NIRCam images and newly obtained MUSE spectra, and avoids regions with &mu;&gt;5 where the uncertainty may be higher. We detect seven bright z\approx 10 galaxies with demagnified rest-frame -22 \lesssim M_{\rm UV}\lesssim -19 mag, over an area of ~37 sq. arcmin. Taking into account photometric incompleteness and the effects of lensing on luminosity and cosmological volume, we find that the density of z\approx 10 galaxies in the field is about 10\times (3\times) larger than the average at M_{UV}\approx -21~ (-20) mag reported so far. The density is even higher when considering only the GLASS-JWST data, which are the deepest and the least affected by magnification and incompleteness. The GLASS-JWST field contains 5 out of 7 galaxies, distributed along an apparent filamentary structure of 2 Mpc in projected length, and includes a close pair of candidates with M_{\rm UV}&lt; -20 mag having a projected separation of only 16 kpc. These findings suggest the presence of a z\approx 10 overdensity in the field. In addition to providing excellent targets for efficient spectroscopic follow-up observations, our study confirms the high density of bright galaxies observed in early {\it JWST} observations, but calls for multiple surveys along independent lines of sight to achieve an unbiased estimate of their average density and a first estimate of their clustering.

Cosmic hydrogen reionization and cosmic production of first metals are major phase transitions of the universe occurring during the first billion years after the Big Bang, however these are still underexplored observationally. Using the JWST NIRSpec prism spectroscopy, we report the discovery of a sub-L_\ast galaxy at z_{\rm spec}=8.1623\pm0.0007, dubbed RXJ2129-z8HeII, via the detection of a series of strong rest-frame UV/optical nebular emission lines and the clear Lyman break. RXJ2129-z8HeII shows a pronounced UV continuum with an extremely steep (i.e. blue) spectral slope of \beta=-2.53_{-0.07}^{+0.06}, the steepest amongst all spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at z_{\rm spec}\gtrsim7, in support of its very hard ionizing spectrum that could lead to a significant leakage of its ionizing flux. Therefore, RXJ2129-z8HeII is representative of the key galaxy population driving the cosmic reionization. More importantly, we detect a strong He II \lambda1640 emission line in its spectrum, one of the highest redshifts at which such a line is robustly detected. Its high rest-frame equivalent width ({\rm EW}=21\pm4 Angstrom) and extreme flux ratios with respect to UV metal and Balmer lines raise the possibility that part of RXJ2129-z8HeII's stellar populations could be Pop III-like. Through careful photoionization modeling, we show that the physically calibrated phenomenological models of the ionizing spectra of Pop III stars with strong mass loss can successfully reproduce the emission line flux ratios observed in RXJ2129-z8HeII. Assuming the Eddington limit, the total mass of the Pop III stars within this system is estimated to be 7.8\pm1.4\times10^5 M_\odot. To date, this galaxy presents the most compelling case in the early universe where trace Pop III stars might coexist with metal-enriched populations.

### 115) [2212.04381](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04381v3): UNCOVERing the extended strong lensing structures of Abell 2744 with the deepest JWST imaging

<p>
We present a new parametric lens model for the massive galaxy cluster Abell~2744 based on the new ultra-deep JWST imaging taken in the framework of the UNCOVER program. These observations constitute the deepest JWST images of a lensing cluster to date, adding to the existing deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images and the recent JWST ERS and DDT data taken for this field. The wide field-of-view of UNCOVER (~45 arcmin^2) extends beyond the cluster's well-studied central core and reveals a spectacular wealth of prominent lensed features around two massive cluster sub-structures in the north and north-west, where no multiple images were previously known. The 75 newly uncovered multiple images and candidates of 16 sources allow us, for the first time, to constrain the lensing properties and total mass distribution around these extended cluster structures using strong lensing (SL). Our model yields an effective Einstein radius of \theta_{E,\mathrm{main}}~eq23'' for the main cluster core (for z_{\mathrm{s}}=2), enclosing a mass of M(\theta&lt;\theta_{E,\mathrm{main}})~eq7.7\times10^{13} M_{\odot}, and \theta_{E,\mathrm{NW}}~eq13'' for the newly discovered north-western SL structure enclosing M(\theta&lt;\theta_{E,\mathrm{NW}})~eq2.2\times10^{13} M_{\odot}. The northern clump is somewhat less massive with \theta_{E,\mathrm{N}}~eq7'' enclosing M(\theta&lt;\theta_{E,\mathrm{N}})~eq8\times10^{12} M_{\odot}. We find the northern sub-structures of Abell~2744 to broadly agree with the findings from weak lensing (WL) and align with the filamentary structure found by these previous studies. Our model in particular reveals a large area of high magnifications between the various cluster structures, which will be paramount for lensed galaxy studies in the UNCOVER field. The model is made publicly available to accompany the first UNCOVER data release.

In this paper we describe the survey design for the Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) Cycle 1 \JWST Treasury program, which executed its early imaging component in November 2022. The UNCOVER survey includes ultradeep (~29-30\mathrm{AB}) imaging of ~45 arcmin^2 on and around the well-studied Abell 2744 galaxy cluster at z=0.308 and will follow-up {~}500 galaxies with extremely deep low-resolution spectroscopy with the NIRSpec/PRISM during the summer of 2023, with repeat visits in summer 2024. We describe the science goals, survey design, target selection, and planned data releases. We also present and characterize the depths of the first NIRCam imaging mosaic, highlighting previously unparalleled resolved and ultradeep 2-4 micron imaging of known objects in the field. The UNCOVER primary NIRCam mosaic spans 28.8 arcmin^2 in seven filters (F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M, F444W) and 16.8 arcmin^2 in our NIRISS parallel (F115W, F150W, F200W, F356W, and F444W). To maximize early community use of the Treasury data set, we publicly release full reduced mosaics of public JWST imaging including 45 arcmin^2 NIRCam and 17 arcmin^2 NIRISS mosaics on and around the Abell 2744 cluster, including the Hubble Frontier Field primary and parallel footprints.

<p>
Galaxies throughout the last 12 Gyr of cosmic time follow a single, universal relation that connects their star-formation rates (SFRs), stellar masses (M_\star) and chemical abundances. Deviation from these fundamental scaling relations would imply a drastic change in the processes that regulate galaxy evolution. Observations have hinted at the possibility that this relation may be broken in the very early universe. However, until recently, chemical abundances of galaxies could be only measured reliably as far back as redshift z=3.3. With JWST, we can now characterize the SFR, M_\star, and chemical abundance of galaxies during the first few hundred million years after the Big Bang, at redshifts z=7-10. Here we show that galaxies at this epoch follow unique SFR-M_\star--main-sequence and mass-metallicity scaling relations, but their chemical abundance is a factor of three lower than expected from the fundamental-metallicity relation of later galaxies. These findings suggest that galaxies at this time are still intimately connected with the intergalactic medium and subject to continuous infall of pristine gas which effectively dilutes their metal abundances.

### 118) [2211.12548](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12548v2): The production of ionizing photons in UV-faint z~3-7 galaxies

<p>
The demographics of the production and escape of ionizing photons from UV-faint early galaxies is a key unknown in discovering the primary drivers of reionization. With the advent of JWST it is finally possible to observe the rest-frame optical nebular emission from individual sub-L^* z&gt;3 galaxies to measure the production of ionizing photons, \xi_\mathrm{ion}. Here we study a sample of 370 z~3-7 galaxies spanning -23 &lt;M_\mathrm{UV} &lt; -15.5 (median M_\mathrm{UV}\approx -18) with deep multi-band HST and JWST/NIRCam photometry covering the rest-UV to optical from the GLASS and UNCOVER JWST surveys. Our sample includes 102 galaxies with Lyman-alpha emission detected in MUSE spectroscopy. We use H-alpha fluxes inferred from NIRCam photometry to estimate the production rate of ionizing photons which do not escape these galaxies \xi_\mathrm{ion}(1-f_\mathrm{esc}). We find median \log_{10}\xi_\mathrm{ion}(1-f_\mathrm{esc})=25.33\pm 0.47, with a broad intrinsic scatter 0.42 dex, implying a broad range of galaxy properties and ages in our UV-faint sample. Galaxies detected with Lyman-alpha have ~0.1 dex higher \xi_\mathrm{ion}(1-f_\mathrm{esc}), which is explained by their higher H-alpha EW distribution, implying younger ages, higher sSFR and thus more O/B stars. We find significant trends of increasing \xi_\mathrm{ion}(1-f_\mathrm{esc}) with increasing H-alpha EW, decreasing UV luminosity, and decreasing UV slope, implying the production of ionizing photons is enhanced in young, low metallicity galaxies. We find no significant evidence for sources with very high ionizing escape fraction (f_\mathrm{esc}&gt;0.5) in our sample, based on their photometric properties, even amongst the Lyman-alpha selected galaxies. This work demonstrates that considering the full distribution of \xi_\mathrm{ion} across galaxy properties is important for assessing the primary drivers of reionization.

Norman </p>
<p>
Star cluster formation in the early universe and their contribution to reionization remains to date largely unconstrained. Here we present JWST/NIRCam imaging of the most highly magnified galaxy known at z ~ 6, the Sunrise arc. We identify six young massive star clusters (YMCs) with measured radii spanning ~ 20 pc down to ~ 1 pc (corrected for lensing magnification), estimated stellar masses of ~ 10^{(6-7)} Msun, and with ages 1-30 Myr based on SED fitting to photometry measured in 8 filters extending to rest-frame 7000A. The resulting stellar mass surface densities are higher than 1000 Msun pc^{-2} (up to a few 10^5 Msun pc^{-2}) and their inferred dynamical ages qualify the majority of these systems as gravitationally-bound stellar clusters. The star cluster ages map the progression of star formation along the arc, with to evolved systems (&gt;~ 10 Myr old) followed by very young clusters. The youngest stellar clusters (&lt; 5 Myr) show evidence of prominent Hbeta + [OIII]4959,5007 emission, based on photometry, with equivalent widths larger than 1000 A rest-frame, and are hosted in a 200 pc sized star-forming complex. Such a region dominates the ionizing photon production, with a high efficiency log(\xi_{ion} [Hz erg^{-1}]) ~ 25.7. A significant fraction of the recently formed stellar mass of the galaxy (&gt; 10-30 %) occurred in these YMCs. We speculate that such sources of ionizing radiation boost the ionizing photon production efficiency which eventually carve ionized channels that might favor the escape of Lyman continuum radiation. The survival of some of the clusters would make them the progenitors of massive and relatively metal-poor globular clusters in the local Universe.

We present the spectroscopic confirmation of a protocluster at z=7.88 behind the galaxy cluster Abell2744 (hereafter A2744-z7p9OD). Using JWST NIRSpec, we find seven galaxies within a projected radius of 60kpc. Although the galaxies reside in an overdensity around &gt;20\times greater than a random volume, they do not show strong Lyman-alpha emission. We place 2-\sigma upper limits on the rest-frame equivalent width &lt;16-28AA. Based on the tight upper limits to the Lyman-alpha emission, we constrain the volume-averaged neutral fraction of hydrogen in the intergalactic medium to be x_{\rm HI} &gt; 0.45 (68% CI). Using an empirical M_{\rm UV}-M_{\rm halo} relation for individual galaxies, we estimate that the total halo mass of the system is \gtrsim 4\times10^{11}\,M_\odot. Likewise, the line of sight velocity dispersion is estimated to be 1100 \pm 200km/s. Using an empirical relation, we estimate the present-day halo mass of A2744-z7p9OD to be ~2\times10^{15}\,M_\odot, comparable to the Coma cluster. A2744-z7p9OD is the highest redshift spectroscopically confirmed protocluster to date, demonstrating the power of JWST to investigate the connection between dark-matter halo assembly and galaxy formation at very early times with medium-deep observations at &lt;20hrs total exposure time. Follow-up spectroscopy of the remaining photometric candidates of the overdensity will further refine the features of this system and help characterize the role of such overdensities in cosmic reionization.

We present ALMA Band~7 observations of a remarkably bright galaxy candidate at z_{\rm phot}=16.7^{+1.9}_{-0.3} (M_{\rm UV}=-21.6), S5-z17-1, identified in JWST Early Release Observation data of Stephen's Quintet. We do not detect the dust continuum at 866~&mu;m, ruling out the possibility that \targb\ is a low-z dusty starburst with a star-formation rate of \gtrsim 30~M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}. We detect a 5.1\sigma line feature at 338.726\pm0.007~GHz exactly coinciding with the JWST source position, with a 2&percnt; likelihood of the signal being spurious. The most likely line identification would be [OIII]52&mu;m at z=16.01 or [CII]158&mu;m at z=4.61, whose line luminosities do not violate the non-detection of the dust continuum in both cases. Together with three other z\gtrsim 11--13 candidate galaxies recently observed with ALMA, we conduct a joint ALMA and JWST spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis and find that the high-z solution at z~11--17 is favored in every candidate as a very blue (UV continuum slope of ~eq-2.3) and luminous (M_{\rm UV}~eq[-24:-21]) system. Still, we find in several candidates that reasonable SED fits (\Delta \chi^{2}\lesssim4) are reproduced by type-II quasar and/or quiescent galaxy templates with strong emission lines at z~3--5, where such populations predicted from their luminosity functions and EW([OIII]+H\beta) distributions are abundant in survey volumes used for the identification of the z~11--17 candidates. While these recent ALMA observation results have strengthened the likelihood of the high-z solutions, lower-z possibilities are not completely ruled out in several of the z~11--17 candidates, indicating the need to consider the relative surface densities of the lower-z contaminants in the ultra high-z galaxy search.

We present the first constraints on the prevalence of z&gt;10 galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) leveraging new NIRCam observations from JEMS (JWST Extragalactic Medium-band Survey). These NIRCam observations probe redward of 1.6&mu;m, beyond the wavelength limit of HST, allowing us to search for galaxies to z&gt;10. These observations indicate that the highest redshift candidate identified in the HUDF09 data with HST, UDFj-39546284, has a redshift of z&gt;11.5, as had been suggested in analyses of the HUDF12/XDF data. This has now been confirmed with JWST NIRSpec. This source is thus the most distant galaxy discovered by HST in its &gt;30 years of operation. Additionally, we identify nine other z~8-13 candidate galaxies over the HUDF, two of which are new discoveries that appear to lie at z~11-12. We use these results to characterize the evolution of the UV luminosity function (LF) from z~15 to z~8.7. While our LF results at z~8.7 and z~10.5 are consistent with previous findings over the HUDF, our new LF estimates at z~12.6 are higher than other results in the literature, potentially pointing to a milder evolution in the UV luminosity density from z~12.6. We emphasize that our LF results are uncertain given the small number of z~12.6 sources and limited volume probed. The new NIRCam data also indicate that the faint z~8-13 galaxies in the HUDF/XDF show blue UV-continuum slopes beta~-2.7, high specific star formation rates ~24.5 Gyr**-1, and high EW (~1300A) [OIII]+H\beta emission, with two z~8.5 sources showing [OIII]+H\beta EWs of ~2300 A.

<p>
Ultraviolet light from early galaxies is thought to have ionized gas in the intergalactic medium. However, there are few observational constraints on this epoch because of the faintness of those galaxies and the redshift of their optical light into the infrared. We report the observation, in JWST imaging, of a distant galaxy that is magnified by gravitational lensing. JWST spectroscopy of the galaxy, at rest-frame optical wavelengths, detects strong nebular emission lines that are attributable to oxygen and hydrogen. The measured redshift is z = 9.51 +- 0.01, corresponding to 510 million years after the Big Bang. The galaxy has a radius of 16.2+4.6-7.2 parsecs, which is substantially more compact than galaxies with equivalent luminosity at z = 6 to 8, leading to a high star formation rate surface density.

In the first billion years after the Big Bang, sources of ultraviolet (UV) photons are believed to have ionized intergalactic hydrogen, rendering the Universe transparent to UV radiation. Galaxies brighter than the characteristic luminosity L^{*} do not provide enough ionizing photons to drive this cosmic reionization. Fainter galaxies are thought to dominate the photon budget; however they are surrounded by neutral gas that prevents the escape of the Lyman-\alpha photons, which has been the dominant way to identify them so far. JD1 was previously identified as a triply-imaged galaxy with a magnification factor of 13 provided by the foreground cluster Abell 2744, and a photometric redshift of z~10. Here we report the spectroscopic confirmation of this very low luminosity (~0.05 L^{*}) galaxy at z=9.79, observed 480 Myr after the Big Bang, by means of the identification of the Lyman break and redward continuum, as well as multiple \gtrsim4\sigma emission lines, with the Near-InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec) and Near-InfraRed Camera (NIRCam) instruments. The combination of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and gravitational lensing shows that this ultra-faint galaxy (M_{\rm UV}=-17.35) -- with a luminosity typical of the sources responsible for cosmic reionization -- has a compact (~150 pc) and complex morphology, low stellar mass (10^{7.19} M_\odot), and subsolar (~0.6 Z_{\odot}) gas-phase metallicity.

MACS0647-JD is a triply-lensed z~11 galaxy originally discovered with the Hubble Space Telescope. Here we report new JWST imaging, which clearly resolves MACS0647-JD as having two components that are either merging galaxies or stellar complexes within a single galaxy. Both are very small, with stellar masses ~10^8\,M_\odot and radii r&lt;100\,\rm pc. The brighter larger component "A" is intrinsically very blue (\beta~-2.6), likely due to very recent star formation and no dust, and is spatially extended with an effective radius ~70\,\rm pc. The smaller component "B" appears redder (\beta~-2), likely because it is older (100-200\,\rm Myr) with mild dust extinction (A_V~0.1\,\rm mag), and a smaller radius ~20\,\rm pc. We identify galaxies with similar colors in a high-redshift simulation, finding their star formation histories to be out of phase. With an estimated stellar mass ratio of roughly 2:1 and physical projected separation ~400\,\rm pc, we may be witnessing a galaxy merger 400 million years after the Big Bang. We also identify a candidate companion galaxy C ~3\,{\rm kpc} away, likely destined to merge with galaxies A and B. The combined light from galaxies A+B is magnified by factors of ~8, 5, and 2 in three lensed images JD1, 2, and 3 with F356W fluxes ~322, 203, 86\,\rm nJy (AB mag 25.1, 25.6, 26.6). MACS0647-JD is significantly brighter than other galaxies recently discovered at similar redshifts with JWST. Without magnification, it would have AB mag 27.3 (M_{UV}=-20.4). With a high confidence level, we obtain a photometric redshift of z=10.6\pm0.3 based on photometry measured in 6 NIRCam filters spanning 1-5\rm&mu; m, out to 4300\,\r{A} rest-frame. JWST NIRSpec observations planned for January 2023 will deliver a spectroscopic redshift and a more detailed study of the physical properties of MACS0647-JD.

We report the discovery of four galaxy candidates observed 450 - 600 Myr after the Big Bang with photometric redshifts between z ~ 8.3 - 10.2 measured using the JWST NIRCam imaging of the galaxy cluster WHL0137-08 observed in 8 filters spanning 0.8-5.0 micron, plus 9 Hubble filters spanning 0.4-1.7 micron. One candidate is gravitationally lensed with a magnification of ~8, while the other three are located in a nearby NIRCam module with expected magnifications of &lt;~ 1.1. Using SED fitting, we estimate the stellar masses of these galaxies are typically in the range log M*/Msun = 8.3 - 8.7. All appear young with mass-weighted ages &lt; 240 Myr, low dust content A_V &lt; 0.15 mag, and specific star formation rates sSFR ~0.25 - 10 /Gyr for most. One z ~ 9 candidate is consistent with an age &lt; 5 Myr and a sSFR ~10 /Gyr, as inferred from a strong F444W excess, implying [OIII]+H-beta rest-frame equivalent width ~2000 Angstrom, although an older z ~ 10 object is also allowed. Another z ~ 9 candidate is lensed into an arc 2.4 arcsec long with a magnification of ~8. This arc is the most spatially-resolved galaxy at z ~ 9 known to date, revealing structures ~30 pc across. Follow-up spectroscopy of WHL0137-08 with JWST/NIRSpec will be useful to spectroscopically confirm these high-redshift galaxy candidates and to study their physical properties in more detail.

### 127) [2208.03468](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03468v3): Early results from GLASS-JWST XV: properties of the faintest red sources in the NIRCAM deep fields

<p> Karl Glazebrook, T. Nanayakkara, C. Jacobs, N. Leethochawalit, A. Calabrò, A. Bonchi, M. Castellano, A. Fontana, C. Mason, E. Merlin, T. Morishita, D. Paris, M. Trenti, T. Treu, P. Santini, X. Wang, K. Boyett, Marusa Bradac, G. Brammer, T. Jones, D. Marchesini, M. Nonino, B. Vulcani </p>
<p>
We present a first look at the reddest 2-5&mu;\rm m sources found in deep images from the GLASS Early Release Science program. We undertake a general search, i.e. not looking for any particular spectral signatures, for sources detected only in bands redder than reachable with the Hubble Space Telescope, and which would likely not have been identified in pre-JWST surveys. We search for sources down to AB ~ 27 (corresponding to &gt;10\sigma detection threshold) in any of the F200W to F444W filters,with a &gt;1 magnitude excess relative to F090W to F150W bands. Fainter than F444W&gt;25 we find 56 such sources of which 37 have reasonably constrained spectral energy distributions to which we can fit photometric redshifts. We find the majority of this population (~ 65%) as 2&lt;z&lt;6 star forming low-attenuation galaxies that are faint at rest-frame ultraviolet-optical wavelengths, have stellar masses 10^{8.5}-10^{9.5} M_\odot, and have observed fluxes at &gt;2&mu; \rm m boosted by a combination of the Balmer break and emission lines. The typical implied rest equivalent widths are ~200\unicode{0x212B} with some extreme objects up to ~ 1000\unicode{0x212B}. This is in contrast with brighter magnitudes where the red sources tend to be z&lt;3 quiescent galaxies and dusty star forming objects. Our general selection criteria for red sources allow us to independently identify other phenomena as diverse as extremely low mass (~ 10^8 M_\odot) quiescent galaxies at z&lt;1, recover recently identified z&gt;11 galaxies and a very cool brown dwarf.

### 128) [2207.14733](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14733v2): Unveiling the Nature of Infrared Bright, Optically Dark Galaxies with Early JWST Data

<p>
Over the last few years, both ALMA and Spitzer/IRAC observations have revealed a population of likely massive galaxies at z&gt;3 that was too faint to be detected in HST rest-frame ultraviolet imaging. However, due to the very limited photometry for individual galaxies, the true nature of these so-called HST-dark galaxies has remained elusive. Here, we present the first sample of such galaxies observed with very deep, high-resolution NIRCam imaging from the Early Release Science Program CEERS. 30 HST-dark sources are selected based on their red colours across 1.6 &mu;m to 4.4 &mu;m. Their physical properties are derived from 12-band multi-wavelength photometry, including ancillary HST imaging. We find that these galaxies are generally heavily dust-obscured (A_{V}~2 mag), massive (\log (M/M_{\odot}) ~10), star-forming sources at z~2-8 with an observed surface density of ~0.8 arcmin^{-2}. This suggests that an important fraction of massive galaxies may have been missing from our cosmic census at z&gt;3 all the way into the Reionization epoch. The HST-dark sources lie on the main sequence of galaxies and add an obscured star formation rate density (SFRD) of \mathrm{3.2^{+1.8}_{-1.3} \times 10^{-3} M_{\odot}/yr/Mpc^{3}} at z~7 showing likely presence of dust in the Epoch of Reionization. Our analysis shows the unique power of JWST to reveal this previously missing galaxy population and to provide a more complete census of galaxies at z=2-8 based on rest-frame optical imaging.
