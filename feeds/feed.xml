&lt;p&gt;
The origin of Lyman Continuum (LyC) photons responsible for reionizing the universe remains a mystery, with the fraction of escaping LyC photons from galaxies at z~ 6 to 12 being highly uncertain. While direct detection of LyC photons from this epoch is hindered by absorption from the intergalactic medium, lower redshift analogs offer a promising avenue to study LyC leakage. We present Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (HST COS) observations of five low redshift (z~ 0.3) massive starburst galaxies, selected for their high stellar mass and weak [SII] nebular emission - an indirect tracer of LyC escape. Three of the five galaxies show LyC leakage, highlighting the reliability of weak [SII] as a tracer, especially in light of recent JWST discoveries of z &amp;gt; 5 galaxies with similarly weak [SII] emission. The dust corrected LyC escape fractions, which represent the LyC photons that would escape in the absence of dust, range from 33% to 84%. However, the absolute escape fractions, which show the LyC photons escaping after passing through both neutral hydrogen absorption and dust attenuation, are significantly lower, ranging between 1% and 3%. This suggests that while the galaxies are nearly optically thin to HI, their high dust content significantly suppresses LyC photon escape. These [SII] weak, massive leakers are distinct from typical low-redshift LyC emitters, showing higher metallicity, lower ionization states, more dust extinction and higher star formation surface densities. This suggests that these galaxies constitute a distinct population, likely governed by a different mechanism facilitating LyC photon escape. We propose that the feedback-driven winds in these compact starbursts create ionized channels through which LyC photons escape, aligning with a picket-fence model.

&lt;p&gt;
We analyze two galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses, SPT0418-47 and SPT2147-50, using JWST NIRCam imaging across multiple filters. To account for angular complexity in the lens mass distribution, we introduce multipole perturbations with orders m=1, 3, 4. Our results show strong evidence for angular mass complexity in SPT2147, with multipole strengths of 0.3-1.7 &amp;percnt; for m=3, 4 and 2.4-9.5 &amp;percnt; for m=1, while SPT0418 shows no such preference. We also test lens models that include a dark matter substructure, finding a strong preference for a substructure in SPT2147-50 with a Bayes factor (log-evidence change) of ~ 60 when multipoles are not included. Including multipoles reduces the Bayes factor to ~ 11, still corresponding to a 5\sigma detection of a subhalo with an NFW mass of \log_{10}(M_{200}/M_{\odot}) = 10.87\substack{+0.53\\ -0.71}. While SPT2147-50 may represent the fourth detection of a dark matter substructure in a strong lens, further analysis is needed to confirm that the signal is not due to systematics associated with the lens mass model.

&lt;p&gt;
Ethanolamine (NH_2CH_2CH_2OH, EA) has been identified in the gas phase of the ISM within molecular clouds. Although EA has not been directly observed in the molecular ice phase, a solid state formation mechanism has been proposed. However, the current literature lacks an estimation of the infrared band strengths of EA ices. We conducted an experimental investigation of solid EA ice at low temperatures to ascertain its infrared band strengths, phase transition temperature, and multilayer binding energy. The commonly used laser interferometry method was not applied. Infrared band strengths were determined using three distinct methods. The obtained lab spectrum of EA was compared with the publicly available MIRI MRS James Webb Space Telescope observations toward a low mass protostar. The phase transition temperature for EA ice falls within the range of 175 to 185 K. Among the discussed methods, the simple pressure gauge method provides a reasonable estimate of band strength. We derive a band strength value of about 1\times10^{-17} cm molecule^{-1} for the NH_2 bending mode in the EA molecules. Additionally, temperature-programmed desorption analysis yielded a multilayer desorption energy of 0.61\pm0.01 eV. By comparing the laboratory data documented in this study with the JWST spectrum of the low mass protostar IRAS 2A, an upper-limit for the EA ice abundances was derived.

&lt;p&gt;
We present deep Subaru/FOCAS spectra for two extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) at z~ 1 with strong {\sc[Oiii]}\lambda5007 emission lines, exhibiting equivalent widths (EWs) of 2905^{+946}_{-578} &amp;#8491;\ and 2000^{+188}_{-159} &amp;#8491;, comparable to those of EELGs at high redshifts that are now routinely identified with JWST spectroscopy. Adding a similarly large {\sc [Oiii]} EW (2508^{+1487}_{-689} &amp;#8491;) EELG found at z~ 2 in the JWST CEERS survey to our sample, we explore for the physical origins of the large {\sc [Oiii]} EWs of these three galaxies with the Subaru spectra and various public data including JWST/NIRSpec, NIRCam, and MIRI data. While there are no clear signatures of AGN identified by the optical line diagnostics, we find that two out of two galaxies covered by the MIRI data show strong near-infrared excess in the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) indicating obscured AGN. Because none of the three galaxies show clear broad H\beta lines, the upper limits on the flux ratios of broad-H\beta to {\sc [Oiii]} lines are small, \lesssim 0.15 that are comparable with Seyfert 1.8-2.0 galaxies. We conduct \texttt{Cloudy} modeling with the stellar and AGN incident spectra, allowing a wide range of parameters including metallicities and ionization parameters. We find that the large {\sc [Oiii]} EWs are not self-consistently reproduced by the spectra of stars or unobscured AGN, but obscured AGN that efficiently produces O^{++} ionizing photons with weak nuclear and stellar continua that are consistent with the SED shapes.

Classical nova eruptions result from thermonuclear-powered runaways in, and ejection of, the hydrogen-rich envelopes of white dwarf stars accreted from their close binary companions. Novae brighten to up to 1,000,000 solar luminosities, and recur thousands of times over their lifetimes spanning several billion years. Between eruptions, mass transfer from the donor star to the white dwarf proceeds via an accretion disk unless the white dwarf possesses a strong magnetic field which can partially or totally disrupt the disk. In that case, accretion is focussed by the white dwarf's magnetic field towards its magnetic poles. Optical spectroscopy and interferometric radio maps demonstrate the presence of bipolar jets, typically arcsec in angular size, and orders of magnitude smaller than one parsec in linear size, during the days to months after nova eruptions. These jets expel collimated matter from the white dwarfs in nova binary stars, but well-resolved images of them are lacking. Here we report the Condor telescope's detection of a hitherto unknown, highly resolved and braided jet, three degrees (at least 25 parsecs) in length. The jet originates at the white dwarf of the old nova GK Persei (nova Per 1901 CE). It precesses on a ~ 3600 yr timescale, and must be at least 7200 years old. Detected across four decades of wavelength, the jet's ultimate energy source is likely the strong accretion shocks near the white dwarf's magnetic poles.

&lt;p&gt;
We present the first spatially-resolved infrared images of supernova remnants (SNRs) in M33 with the unprecedented sensitivity and resolution of JWST. We analyze 43 SNRs in four JWST fields: two covering central and southern M33 with separate NIRCam (F335M, F444W) and MIRI (F560W, F2100W) observations, one ~5 kpc-long radial strip observed with MIRI F770W, and one covering the giant HII region NGC 604 with multiple NIRCam and MIRI broad/narrowband filters. Of the 21 SNRs in the MIRI field, we found three clear detections (i.e., identical infrared and \ha morphologies), and six partial-detections, implying a detection fraction of 43&amp;percnt; in these bands. In contrast, only one SNR (out of 16) is detectable in the NIRCam field. One of the SNRs, L10-080, is a potential candidate for having freshly-formed ejecta dust, based on its size and centrally-concentrated 21 &amp;mu;m emission. Two SNRs near NGC 604 have strong evidence of molecular (H_2) emission at 4.7 &amp;mu;m, making them the farthest known SNRs with visible molecular shocks. Five SNRs have F770W observations, with the smaller younger objects showing tentative signs of emission, while the older, larger ones have voids. Multi-wavelength data indicate that the clearly-detected SNRs are also among the smallest, brightest at other wavelengths (\ha, radio and X-ray), have the broadest line widths (H\alpha FWHM~250-350 km/s), and the densest environments. No strong correlation with star-formation histories are seen, with the clearly-detected SNRs having both high-mass (~35 \Msun) and low-mass (\lesssim10 \Msun) progenitors.

We present the first results of the JWST Emission Line Survey (JELS). Utilising the first NIRCam narrow-band imaging at 4.7&amp;mu;m, over 63 arcmin^{2} in the PRIMER/COSMOS field, we have identified 609 emission line galaxy candidates. From these, we robustly selected 35 H\alpha star-forming galaxies at z ~ 6.1, with H\alpha star-formation rates (\rm{SFR_{H\alpha}}) of ~0.9-15\ \rm{M_{\odot} yr^{-1}}. Combining our unique H\alpha sample with the exquisite panchromatic data in the field, we explore their physical properties and star-formation histories, and compare these to a broad-band selected sample at z~ 6 to offer vital new insight into the nature of high-redshift galaxies. UV-continuum slopes (\beta) are considerably redder for our H\alpha sample (\langle\beta\rangle~-1.92) compared to the broad-band sample (\langle\beta\rangle~-2.35). This is not due to dust attenuation as our H\alpha sample is relatively dust-poor (median A_V=0.23); instead, we argue that the reddened slopes could be due to nebular continuum. We compared \rm{SFR_{H\alpha}} and the UV-continuum-derived \rm{SFR_{UV}} to SED-fitted measurements averaged over canonical timescales of 10 and 100 Myr (\rm{SFR_{10}} and \rm{SFR_{100}}). We find an increase in recent SFR for our sample of H\alpha emitters, particularly at lower stellar masses (&amp;lt;10^9 \rm{M_{\odot}}). We also find that \rm{SFR_{H\alpha}} strongly traces SFR averaged over 10 Myr timescales, whereas the UV-continuum over-predicts SFR on 100 Myr timescales at low stellar masses. These results point to our H\alpha sample undergoing `bursty' star formation. Our F356W z ~ 6 sample show a larger scatter in \rm{SFR_{10}/SFR_{100}} across all stellar masses, highlighting how narrow-band photometric selections of H\alpha emitters are key to quantifying the burstiness of star-formation activity.

&lt;p&gt;
Observations of the high-z Universe from JWST have revealed a new population of bright, early galaxies. A robust statistical interpretation of this data requires fast forward models that account for uncertainties in galaxy evolution and incorporate observational systematic effects. We present a probabilistic framework for population synthesis of high-z galaxies and inference of their properties. Our framework is based on the semi-analytic galaxy-formation model Galacticus. To infer the astrophysical parameters governing high-z galaxy evolution, we analyze JWST data from the CEERS and NGDEEP surveys and calculate the likelihood of observing individual objects in apparent magnitude--redshift space, for z\geq8.5 galaxy candidates. We include observational selection effects due to limited survey volume and depth, as well as photometric redshift uncertainties. We recover the posterior probability distribution for parameters describing star formation and outflow rates. We place an upper limit on the star formation timescale of 500~\mathrm{Myr} at a disk velocity of 50~\mathrm{km\ s}^{-1}, and we infer a characteristic velocity at which the outflow mass-loading factor is ~ 1 of 150^{+280}_{-60}~\mathrm{km\ s}^{-1}, both at 95&amp;percnt; confidence. Marginalizing over our astrophysical model, we find that galaxies in CEERS and NGDEEP data occupy halos with virial masses 10^{10\pm 0.5}~M_{\mathrm{\odot}} at 8.5\leq z\leq 12, at 95&amp;percnt; confidence. The star formation timescale preferred by our fit is relatively short compared to typical values at lower redshifts, consistent with previous findings. The modeling and analysis framework presented here can enable systematic tests of high-z galaxies' dust content, initial mass functions, and star formation burstiness in the future.

&lt;p&gt;
A detection of the 21-cm signal power spectrum from the Epoch of Reionization is imminent, thanks to consistent advancements from telescopes such as LOFAR, MWA, and HERA, along with the development of SKA. In light of this progress, it is crucial to expand the parameter space of simulations used to infer astrophysical properties from this signal. In this work, we explore the role of cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant H_0 and the matter clustering amplitude \sigma_8, whose values as provided by measurements at different redshifts are in tension. We run N-body simulations using GADGET-4, and post-process them with the reionization simulation code POLAR, that uses L-GALAXIES to include galaxy formation and evolution properties and GRIZZLY to execute 1-D radiative transfer of ionizing photons in the intergalactic medium (IGM). We compare our results with the latest JWST observations and explore which astrophysical properties for different cosmologies are necessary to match the observed UV luminosity functions at redshifts z = 10 and 9. Additionally, we explore the impact of these parameters on the observed 21-cm signal power spectrum, focusing on the redshifts within the range of LOFAR 21-cm signal observations (z \approx 8.5-10). Despite differences in cosmological and astrophysical parameters, the 21-cm power spectrum at these redshifts agrees with presently observed upper limits. This suggests the need for broader physical parameter spaces for inference modeling to account for all models that agree with observations. However, we also propose stronger constraining power by using a combination of galactic and IGM observables.

Near-infrared (NIR) emission is less affected by dust than UV and optical emission and is therefore useful for studying the properties of dust-obscured galaxies. Although rest-frame NIR observations of high-redshift galaxies have long been made using space telescopes, their structures were unresolved due to the lack of angular resolution. This letter reports the early results from the analysis of high-resolution Pa\beta imaging of the Spiderweb protocluster at z=2.16 with the JWST Near Infrared Camera. We investigate radial profiles of Pa\beta lines and rest-frame NIR continua from luminous H\alpha-emitting galaxies (HAEs) in the protocluster. Particularly, we compare those of 11 HAEs (N-HAEs) on the star-forming main sequence with those of 8 HAEs (X-HAEs) with X-ray AGNs. Resultant composite Pa\beta line images of N-HAEs indicate significant star formation in galactic disks. In contrast, X-HAEs are dominated by point source components rather than outer star formation, as inferred from our earlier work based on multi-wavelength SED fitting. Given their higher stellar potentials suggested from their rest-frame NIR images, the different characteristics may be driven by the impact of AGN feedback.

The near-infrared (NIR) emission of the youngest protostars still needs to be characterized to better understand the evolution of their accretion and ejection activity. We analyze James Webb Space Telescope NIRSpec 1.7 -- 5.3 &amp;mu;m observations of two deeply embedded sources in the S68N protostellar core in Serpens. The North Central (NC) source exhibits a highly obscured spectrum (A_K ~ 4.8 mag) that is modeled with a pre-main-sequence photosphere and a hot disk component. The photospheric parameters are consistent with a young, low-mass photosphere, as suggested by the low surface gravity, log g of 1.94 \pm 0.15 cm s^{-2}. The hot disk suggests that accretion onto the central protostellar embryo is ongoing, although prototypical accretion-tracing emission lines HI are not detected. The South Central (SC) source, which is even more embedded (A_K ~ 8 mag; no continuum is detected shortward of 3.6 &amp;mu;m) appears to be driving the large-scale S68N protostellar outflow, and launches a collimated hot molecular jet detected in \Ht and CO ro-vibrational lines. Shock modeling of the \Ht (ro)vibrational lines establishes that fast C-type shocks (\geq 30 km s^{-1}), with high pre-shock density (\geq 10^7 cm^{-3}), and strong magnetic field (b ~ 3--10, where B = b\,\times\,\sqrt{\textrm{n}_{\textrm{H}} (\textrm{cm}^{-3})}\,&amp;mu;\textrm{G}) best match the data. The bright CO fundamental line forest suggests energetic excitation, with the contribution of non-LTE effects, ie irradiation pumping. Detected OH and CH^{+} ro-vibrational lines support this hypothesis. These two Class 0 protostars seem to be in very young evolutionary stages and still have to acquire the bulk of their final stellar masses. These results demonstrate that JWST enables unprecedented diagnostics of these first stages of the protostellar evolutionary phase.

The James Webb Space Telescope is revolutionising our ability to understand the host galaxies and local environments of high-z quasars. Here we obtain a comprehensive understanding of the host galaxy of the z=7.08 quasar J1120+0641 by combining NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy with NIRCam photometry of the host continuum emission. Our emission line maps reveal that this quasar host is undergoing a merger with a bright companion galaxy. The quasar host and the companion have similar dynamical masses of ~10^{10}M_\odot, suggesting that this is a major galaxy interaction. Through detailed quasar subtraction and SED fitting using the NIRCam data, we obtain an estimate of the host stellar mass of M_{\ast}~eq2.6\times10^9M_\odot, with M_{*}~eq5.0\times10^9M_\odot for the companion galaxy. Using the H\beta Balmer line we estimate a virial black hole mass of M_{\rm{BH}}~eq1.4\times10^9 M_\odot. Thus, J1120+0641 has an extreme black hole - stellar mass ratio of M_{\rm{BH}}/M_\ast~eq0.54, which is ~3 dex larger than expected by the local scaling relations between black hole and stellar mass. J1120+0641 is powered by an overmassive black hole with the highest reported black hole - stellar mass ratio, in a quasar host that is currently undergoing a major merger -- these new insights highlight the power of JWST for measuring and understanding these extreme first quasars.

&lt;p&gt;
Although the circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a vital role in galaxy evolution, studying the emission from CGM is challenging due to its low surface brightness and the complexities involved in interpreting resonant lines like Ly\alpha. The near-infrared coverage, unprecedented sensitivity, and high spatial resolution of the JWST enable us to study the optical strong lines associated with the extended Ly\alpha "nebulae" at redshift 2-3. These lines serve as diagnostic tools to infer the physical conditions in the massive CGM gas reservoir of these systems. In deep medium-band images taken by the JWST, we serendipitously discover the [O III] emission from the CGM surrounding a massive interacting galaxy system at redshift z ~ 2.8, known to be embedded in a bright extended (100 kpc) Ly\alpha "nebula". This is the first time that the [O III] lines are detected from a Ly\alpha "nebula", and the JWST images reveal that the CGM gas actually resides in narrow (~ 2.5 kpc) filamentary structures with strong [O III] emission, tracing the same extent as the Ly\alpha emission. Analysis of the [O III] suggests that the emitting CGM is fully ionized and is energetically dominated by mechanical heating. We also find that the inferred density and pressure are higher than those commonly predicted by simulations of the CGM. We conclude that the observed CGM emission originates from the gas expelled by the episodic feedback processes, cooling down and enriching the CGM, while travelling to a distance of at least 60 kpc. These observations demonstrate how fierce feedback processes shape gas distribution and properties in the CGM around massive halos. While the deep high-resolution imaging opens up a new discovery space for investigating the CGM, it also challenges numerical simulations to explain and reproduce the exquisitely complex structures revealed by the observations.

&lt;p&gt;
Accurately quantifying the ionizing photon production efficiency (\xi_\rm{ion}) of z&amp;gt;6 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is necessary to understand their contribution to reionization. We investigate the ionizing properties of N=289 SFGs selected at z=6.9-7.6 from the JWST Cycle-1 imaging programmes; PRIMER and JADES. We use BAGPIPES to consistently infer the equivalent widths of their [OIII]+\rm{H\beta} emission lines (W_\lambda) and their physical properties. To supplement our high-redshift galaxies, we measure W_\lambda photometrically for a sample of N=253 z=3.2-3.6 SFGs selected from the VANDELS spectroscopic survey. Comparing these samples, we find a strong apparent redshift evolution in their median W_\lambda, increasing from W_\lambda =310\pm25\,\r{A} in VANDELS to W_\lambda =630\pm30\,\r{A} in our JWST-based sample. In the JWST sample at z&amp;gt;7, we find that W_\lambda correlates with both stellar mass and UV luminosity, with high-mass, M_{ UV}-faint galaxies producing systematically weaker emission lines. Moreover, we discover a departure from the standard log-normal shape of the W_\lambda distribution, characterised by a more pronounced tail at lower W_\lambda, consistent with increasingly bursty star formation. Using W_\lambda as a proxy for \xi_\rm{ion}, and UV spectral slope as a proxy for LyC escape fraction (f_\rm{esc}), we find a minority of galaxies with high \xi_\rm{ion} and f_\rm{esc} (e.g., \rm{log(\xi_{ion}/erg^{-1}Hz})~25.6 and f_\rm{esc}~0.15). However, we find that the LyC photon budget at z&amp;gt;7 is dominated by galaxies with more moderate output, close to the sample median of \rm{log(\xi_{ion}/erg^{-1}Hz})~25.3 and f_\rm{esc}~0.05. This is consistent with estimates for the number of LyC photons required to power reionization at z&amp;gt;7, with no evidence for over or under-production.

We present a sample of 1956 individual stellar clumps at redshift 0.7&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;10, detected with JWST/NIRCam in 476 galaxies lensed by the galaxy cluster Abell2744. The lensed clumps present magnifications ranging between &amp;mu;=1.8 and &amp;mu;=300. We perform simultaneous size-photometry estimates in 20 JWST/NIRCam median and broad-band filters from 0.7 to 5 &amp;mu;m. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting analyses enable us to recover the physical properties of the clumps. The majority of the clumps are spatially resolved and have effective radii in the range R_eff = 10 - 700 pc. We restrict this first study to the 1751 post-reionisation era clumps with redshift &amp;lt;5.5. We find a significant evolution of the average clump ages, SFR, SFR surface densities and metallicity with increasing redshift, while median stellar mass and stellar mass surface densities are similar in the probed redshift range. We observe a strong correlation between the clump properties and the properties of their host galaxies, with more massive galaxies hosting more massive and older clumps. We find that clumps closer to their host galactic center are on average more massive, while their ages do not show clear sign of migration. We find that clumps at cosmic noon sample the upper-mass end of the mass function to higher masses than at z&amp;gt;3, reflecting the rapid increase towards the peak of the cosmic star formation history. We conclude that the results achieved over the studied redshift range are in agreement with expectation of in-situ clump formation scenario from large-scale disk fragmentation.

We present JWST/NIRSpec PRISM follow-up of candidate galaxies at z=9-11 selected from deep JWST/NIRCam photometry in GLASS-JWST Early Release Science data. We spectroscopically confirm six sources with secure redshifts at z = 9.52-10.43, each showing multiple emission lines. An additional object is likely at z = 10.66, based on its Lya-break and a single emission feature, while one source is a lower redshift interloper. The sample includes the first JWST-detected candidate at z=10, GHZ1/GLASS-z10, which we confirm at z = 9.875, and the X-ray detected AGN GHZ9 confirmed at z = 10.145. Three objects in our sample, including GHZ9, have EW(CIII])&amp;gt;20A and occupy a region compatible with AGN emission in the EW(CIII]) vs CIV/CIII] diagram. The spectroscopic sample confirms a high abundance of galaxies at z &amp;gt; 9. We measure a number density of z=10 galaxies in the GLASS-JWST ERS field that is a factor of &amp;gt;3 higher than other JWST-based estimates at demagnified rest-frame magnitudes of -21 &amp;lt; Muv &amp;lt; -19. We find that the positions of these galaxies in redshift and angular space are not consistent with all of them being part of a unique progenitor of present-day galaxy clusters. The high density of objects in the GLASS region can be explained either by clustering on large scales or by a superposition of different forming structures of which we observe only the brightest members. By considering all the spectroscopic z=10 sources in the Abell-2744 field, we identify two potential galaxy proto-clusters centered around GHZ9 and JD1, with relative separations between their members of 1-2 pMpc. The potential AGN nature of three of the sources in our sample lends support to a scenario in which the high abundance of bright sources determined by JWST surveys at cosmic dawn may be affected by AGN contribution to their UV luminosity.

&lt;p&gt;
We present the first spectroscopic confirmation of a dust-obscured dwarf galaxy, CEERS-14821. The analysis is performed combining JWST NIRCam broad-band photometry and NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopic data. From the detection of multiple rest-frame optical lines, we derive that CEERS-14821 is located at z=4.883\pm0.003. Moreover, from a secure detection of the H_{\alpha} and H_{\beta} we derived that the galaxy has a dust extinction ranging from Av=2.2 to Av=3.3, depending on the assumed reddening law. This value is extremely large given that we estimated a low stellar mass around log(M/Mo)=8.0-8.2. Moreover, using different metallicity tracers, we verify that the galaxy is also metal-rich, with 12+log(O/H)&amp;gt;8.3. This is well above the expectation from both the mass-metallicity relation and the fundamental mass-metalliticy relation. CEERS-14821 is going through a burst of star formation, there are no indications of a strong contribution from an active galactic nuclei (f(AGN)&amp;lt;0.5 with respect to the total dust luminosity). Based on the rest-frame optical images, this source has a size compatible with galaxies of similar stellar mass and redshift. Finally, with the current data, it seems that there are galaxies closely interacting with CEERS-14821.

&lt;p&gt;
Cooling flows are common in galaxy clusters which have cool cores. The soft X-ray emission below 1 keV from the flows is mostly absorbed by cold dusty gas within the central cooling sites. Further evidence for this process is presented here through a more detailed analysis of the nearby Centaurus cluster and some additional clusters. Predictions of JWST near and mid-infrared spectra from cooling gas are presented. [NeVI] emission at 7.65 micron should be an important diagnostic of gas cooling between 6 and 1.5 times 10^5 K. The emerging overall picture of hidden cooling flows is explored. The efficiency of AGN feedback in reducing the total cooling rate in cool cores is shown to be above 50 percent for many clusters but is rarely above 90 per cent. The reduction is mostly in outer gas. Cooling dominates in elliptical galaxies and galaxy groups which have mass flow rates below about 15M/yr and in some massive clusters where rates can exceed 1000M/yr.

&lt;p&gt;
In 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) obtained 1-5um images of the center of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). I have analyzed these data in an attempt to search for substellar members of the cluster. Using a pair of color-color diagrams, I have identified &amp;gt;200 brown dwarf candidates that lack spectral classifications. Some of the candidates could be protostars (either stellar or substellar) given their very red colors. Based on the age of the ONC and the photometry predicted by theoretical evolutionary models, the faintest candidates could have masses of 1-2 Mjup. This sample of candidates may prove to be valuable for studying various aspects of young brown dwarfs, including their mass function and minimum mass. However, spectroscopy is needed to confirm the membership (via signatures of youth) and late spectral types of the candidates. Finally, I note that most of the "Jupiter-mass binary objects" that have been previously identified with these JWST images are absent from my sample of candidates because their colors are indicative of reddened background sources rather than young brown dwarfs or their photometry is inadequate for assessing their nature because of very low signal-to-noise ratios and/or detections in only a few bands.

We have used the multiobject mode of the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to obtain low-resolution 1-5um spectra of 22 brown dwarf candidates in the Orion Nebula Cluster, which were selected with archival images from the Hubble Space Telescope. One of the targets was previously classified as a Herbig-Haro (HH) object and exhibits strong emission in H I, H2, and the fundamental band of CO, further demonstrating that HH objects can have bright emission in that CO band. The remaining targets have late spectral types (M6.5 to early L) and are young based on gravity sensitive features, as expected for low-mass members of the cluster. According to theoretical evolutionary models, these objects should have masses that range from the hydrogen burning limit to 0.003-0.007 Msun. Two of the NIRSpec targets were identified as proplyds in earlier analysis of Hubble images. They have spectral types of M6.5 and M7.5, making them two of the coolest and least massive known proplyds. Another brown dwarf shows absorption bands at 3-5um from ices containing H2O, CO2, OCN-, and CO, indicating that it is either an edge-on class II system or a class I protostar. It is the coolest and least massive object that has detections of these ice features. In addition, it appears to be the first candidate for a protostellar brown dwarf that has spectroscopy confirming its late spectral type.

&lt;p&gt;
We present results of cosmological zoom-in simulations of a massive protocluster down to redshift z\approx4 (when the halo mass is \approx10^{13} M_\odot) using the SWIFT code and the EAGLE galaxy formation model, focusing on supermassive black hole (BH) physics. The BH was seeded with a mass of 10^4 M_\odot at redshift z\approx17. We compare the base model that uses an Eddington limit on the BH accretion rate and thermal isotropic feedback by the AGN, with one where super-Eddington accretion is allowed, as well as two other models with BH spin and jets. In the base model, the BH grows at the Eddington limit from z=9 to z=5.5, when it becomes massive enough to halt its own and its host galaxy's growth through feedback. We find that allowing super-Eddington accretion leads to drastic differences, with the BH going through an intense but short super-Eddington growth burst around z\approx7.5, during which it increases its mass by orders of magnitude, before feedback stops further growth (of both the BH and the galaxy). By z\approx4 the galaxy is only half as massive in the super-Eddington cases, and an order of magnitude more extended, with the half-mass radius reaching values of a few physical kpc instead of a few hundred pc. The BH masses in our simulations are consistent with the intrinsic BH mass-stellar mass relation inferred from high-redshift observations by JWST. This shows that galaxy formation models using the \LambdaCDM cosmology are capable of reproducing the observed massive BHs at high redshift. Allowing jets, either at super- or sub-Eddington rates, has little impact on the host galaxy properties, but leads to lower BH masses as a result of stronger self-regulation, which is itself a consequence of higher feedback efficiencies.

&lt;p&gt;
We demonstrate how near infrared (NIR) imaging of resolved luminous asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars can be used to measure well-constrained star formation histories (SFHs) across cosmic time. Using UKIRT J and K-band imaging of M31, we first show excellent agreement over the past ~8 Gyr between the PHAT SFH of M31's outer disk derived from a deep optical color-magnitude diagram (CMD; ~3.3\times10^{7} stars with M_{F814W} \lesssim +2), and our spatially-matched SFH based only on modeling AGB stars on a NIR CMD (~2.3\times10^{4} stars with M_{J} \lesssim -5). We find that only hundreds of AGB stars are needed for reliable SFH recovery, owing to their excellent age sensitivity in the NIR. We then measure the spatially resolved SFH of M31's inner stellar halo (D_{M31, projected} ~20-30 kpc) using ~10^5 AGB stars. We find: (i) a dominant burst of star formation across M31's inner stellar halo from 4-5 Gyr ago and lower level, spatially distributed star formation ~1-2 Gyr ago; (ii) a younger 'quenching time' in the vicinity of NGC 205 (~1 Gyr ago) than near M32 (~1.1 Gyr ago); (iii) M_{\star}~4\pm0.5\times10^9 M_{\odot} formed over the past ~8 Gyr. We discuss some caveats and the enormous potential of resolved AGB stars in the NIR for measuring SFHs back to ancient epochs (~13 Gyr ago) in galaxies to large distances (D\gtrsim20 Mpc) with JWST, Roman, and Euclid.

&lt;p&gt;
We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)-NIRCam observations of the massive star-forming molecular cloud Sagittarius C (Sgr C) in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). In conjunction with ancillary mid-IR and far-IR data, we characterize the two most massive protostars in Sgr C via spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, estimating that they each have current masses of m_* ~ 20\:M_\odot and surrounding envelope masses of ~ 100\:M_\odot. We report a census of lower-mass protostars in Sgr C via a search for infrared counterparts to mm continuum dust cores found with ALMA. We identify 88 molecular hydrogen outflow knot candidates originating from outflows from protostars in Sgr C, the first such unambiguous detections in the infrared in the CMZ. About a quarter of these are associated with flows from the two massive protostars in Sgr C; these extend for over 1 pc and are associated with outflows detected in ALMA SiO line data. An additional ~ 40 features likely trace shocks in outflows powered by lower-mass protostars throughout the cloud. We report the discovery of a new star-forming region hosting two prominent bow shocks and several other line-emitting features driven by at least two protostars. We infer that one of these is forming a high-mass star given an SED-derived mass of m_* ~ 9\:M_\odot and associated massive (~ 90\:M_\odot) mm core and water maser. Finally, we identify a population of miscellaneous Molecular Hydrogen Objects (MHOs) that do not appear to be associated with protostellar outflows.

&lt;p&gt;
Bursty star formation at early times can explain the surprising abundance of early UV-bright galaxies revealed by JWST but can also be a reason for the delayed formation of galactic disks in high-resolution cosmological simulations. We investigate this interplay in a cosmological simulation of an early-forming Milky Way analog with detailed modeling of cold turbulent interstellar medium (ISM), star formation, and feedback. We find that the modeling of locally variable star formation efficiency (SFE) coupled with the ISM turbulence on the scales of star-forming regions is important for producing both early bursty evolution and early formation and survival of galactic disks. Such a model introduces a qualitatively new channel of the global star formation rate (SFR) burstiness caused by chaotic fluctuations in the average SFE due to changes in the ISM turbulence, which, in our simulation, dominates the short-term SFR variability. The average SFE stays low, close to ~ 1&amp;percnt; per freefall time, and its variation decreases when the gas disk forms, leading to only mild effects of stellar feedback on the early disk, enabling its survival. By rerunning our simulation with fixed SFE values, we explicitly show that low SFEs lead to smoother SFR histories and disk survival, while high SFEs lead to bursty SFRs and hinder disk formation. The model with variable SFE switches between these two regimes at the moment of disk formation. These trends are missing in more commonly used star formation prescriptions with fixed SFE; in particular, the prescriptions tying star formation to molecular gas should be interpreted with caution because the two are decoupled at early times, as we also show in this paper.

&lt;p&gt;
Extreme magnification of stars near the caustics of clusters allow to detect individual luminous stars at high redshift. We show how deep exposures of caustic crossing galaxies at z\lesssim1 with IR telescopes such as JWST, can detect non-explosive distance calibrators, such as Cepheids, carbon stars in the asymptotic giant branch or stars in the tip of the red giant branch. A large number of such detections, combined with careful modelling of the magnification affecting these stars (including microlensing), opens the door to using them as alternative standard candles to SNe in a redshift range that would extend the cosmic distance ladder two orders of magnitude for these distance calibrators. As a bonus, strongly lensed stars detected in deep exposures provide also a robust method of mapping small dark matter substructures since they cluster around the critical curves of small scale dark matter halos.

Dust from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), specifically Type IIP SNe, has been suggested to be a significant source of the dust observed in high-redshift galaxies. CCSNe eject large amounts of newly formed heavy elements, which can condense into dust grains in the cooling ejecta. However, infrared (IR) observations of typical CCSNe generally measure dust masses that are too small to account for the dust production needed at high redshifts. Type IIn SNe, classified by their dense circumstellar medium (CSM), are also known to exhibit strong IR emission from warm dust, but the dust origin and heating mechanism have generally remained unconstrained because of limited observational capabilities in the mid-IR. Here, we present a JWST/MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) spectrum of the Type IIn SN 2005ip nearly 17 years post-explosion. The Type IIn SN 2005ip is one of the longest-lasting and most well-studied SNe observed to date. Combined with a Spitzer mid-IR spectrum of SN 2005ip obtained in 2008, this data set provides a rare 15-year baseline, allowing for a unique investigation of the evolution of dust. The JWST spectrum shows a new high-mass dust component (\gtrsim0.08 M_{\odot}) that is not present in the earlier Spitzer spectrum. Our analysis shows dust likely formed over the past 15 years in the cold, dense shell (CDS), between the forward and reverse shocks. There is also a smaller mass of carbonaceous dust (\gtrsim0.005 M_{\odot}) in the ejecta. These observations provide new insights into the role of SN dust production, particularly within the CDS, and its potential contribution to the rapid dust enrichment of the early Universe.

We present a spatially-resolved (~3 pc pix^{-1}) analysis of the distribution, kinematics, and excitation of warm H2 gas in the nuclear starburst region of M83. Our JWST/MIRI IFU spectroscopy reveals a clumpy reservoir of warm H2 (&amp;gt; 200 K) with a mass of ~2.3 x 10^{5} Msun in the area covered by all four MRS channels. We additionally use the [Ne II] 12.8 {&amp;mu;}m and [Ne III] 15.5 {&amp;mu;}m lines as tracers of the star formation rate, ionizing radiation hardness, and kinematics of the ionized ISM, finding tantalizing connections to the H2 properties and to the ages of the underlying stellar populations. Finally, qualitative comparisons to the trove of public, high-spatial-resolution multiwavelength data available on M83 shows that our MRS spectroscopy potentially traces all stages of the process of creating massive star clusters, from the embedded proto-cluster phase through the dispersion of ISM from stellar feedback.

We present the JWST Emission Line Survey (JELS), a Cycle 1 JWST imaging programme exploiting the wavelength coverage and sensitivity of NIRCam to extend narrow-band rest-optical emission line selection into the epoch of reionization (EoR) for the first time, and to enable unique studies of the resolved ionised gas morphology in individual galaxies across cosmic history. The primary JELS observations comprise ~4.7&amp;mu;m narrow-band imaging over ~63 arcmin^{2} designed to enable selection of H\alpha emitters at z~6.1, as well as the selection of a host of novel emission-line samples including [OIII] at z~8.3 and Pa \alpha/\beta at z~1.5/2.8. For the prime F466N and F470N narrow-band observations, the emission-line sensitivities achieved are up to ~2\times more sensitive than current slitless spectroscopy surveys (5\sigma limits of 1.1-1.6\times10^{-18}\text{erg s}^{-1}\text{cm}^{-2}), corresponding to unobscured H\alpha star-formation rates (SFRs) of 1-1.6 \text{M}_{\odot}\,\text{yr}^{-1} at z~6.1 and extending emission-line selections in the EoR to fainter populations. Simultaneously, JELS also obtained F200W broadband and F212N narrow-band imaging (H\alpha at z~2.23) that probes SFRs \gtrsim5\times fainter than previous ground-based narrow-band studies (~0.2 \text{M}_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}), offering an unprecedented resolved view of star formation at cosmic noon. In this paper we describe the detailed JELS survey design, key data processing steps specific to the survey observations, and demonstrate the exceptional data quality and imaging sensitivity achieved. We then summarise the key scientific goals of JELS and present some early science results, including examples of spectroscopically confirmed H\alpha and [OIII] emitters discovered by JELS that illustrate the novel parameter space probed.

&lt;p&gt;
We present the analysis of three intermediate-mass quiescent galaxies (QGs) with stellar masses of ~10^{10}M_{\rm \odot} at redshifts z~ 3 - 4 using NIRSpec low-resolution spectroscopy. Utilising the SED fitting code BAGPIPES, we confirm these target galaxies are consistent with quiescent population, with their specific star formation rates (sSFR) falling below 2-dex the star-forming main sequence at the same redshifts. Additionally, we identify these QGs to be less massive than those discovered in previous works, particularly prior to the JWST era. Two of our target galaxies exhibit the potentially-blended H{\alpha}+[NII] emission line within their spectra with S/N&amp;gt;5. We discuss whether this feature comes from an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) or star formation although future high-resolution spectroscopy is required to reach a conclusion. One of the target galaxies is covered by JWST/NIRCam imaging of the PRIMER survey. Using the 2D profile fitting code Galfit, we examine its morphology, revealing a disc-like profile with a S\'{e}rsic index of n=1.1 \pm 0.1. On the size-mass relation, we find a potential distinction between less-massive (\log_{10}{(M_*/M_\odot)}&amp;lt;10.3) and massive (\log_{10}{(M_*/M_\odot)}&amp;gt;10.3) QGs in their evolutionary pathways. The derived quenching timescales for our targets are less than 1 Gyr. This may result from these galaxies being quenched by AGN feedback, supporting the AGN scenario of the emission line features.

James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered many faint AGNs at high-z by detecting their broad Balmer lines. However, their high number density, lack of X-ray emission, and overly high black hole masses with respect to their host stellar masses suggest that they are a distinct population from general type-1 quasars. Here, we present clustering analysis of 28 low-luminosity broad-line AGNs found by JWST (JWST AGNs) at 5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6 based on cross-correlation analysis with 679 photometrically-selected galaxies to characterize their host dark matter halo (DMH) masses. From angular and projected cross-correlation functions, we find that their typical DMH mass is \log (M_\mathrm{halo}/h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot) = 11.61_{-0.24}^{+0.19}, and 11.72_{-0.20}^{+0.17}, respectively. This result implies that the host DMHs of these AGNs are ~1 dex smaller than that of luminous quasars. The DMHs of JWST AGNs at 5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6 are predicted to grow to 10^{12\unicode{x2013}13}\,h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot, a typical mass of quasar at z\lesssim3. Applying the empirical stellar-to-halo mass ratio to the measured DMH mass, their host stellar mass is evaluated as \log(M_*/\mathrm{M}_\odot)=9.72_{-0.39}^{+0.31}, and 9.90_{-0.33}^{+0.27}, which are higher than some of those estimated by the SED fitting. We also evaluate their duty cycle as f_\mathrm{duty}=0.36_{-0.14}^{+0.18} per cent, namely ~7\times10^6 yr as the lifetime of JWST AGNs. While we cannot exclude the possibility that JWST AGNs are simply low-mass type-1 quasars, these results suggest that JWST AGNs are a different population from type-1 quasars, and may be the ancestors of quasars at z\lesssim3.

We present a rest-frame optical, spatially resolved analysis of more than 100 \mathrm{H\alpha} emitters (HAEs) at z~2.2 in the ZFOURGE-CDFS field using NIRCam imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). The ultra-deep, high-resolution data gives us maps of the resolved emission line regions of HAEs with stellar mass ranging from 10^{8}\,M_{\odot} to 10^{10}\,M_{\odot}. An [OIII] emission-line map of each HAE is created from the flux excess in the F150W filter, leading to the discovery of a population of kiloparsec-scale compact emission line regions (``Green Seeds") with high equivalent widths (\mathrm{EW}). We obtain a sample of 128 Green Seeds from 68 HAEs with rest-frame \mathrm{EW_{[OIII]}}&amp;gt;200\r{A}. Moreover, 17 of them have extremely large \mathrm{EW_{[OIII]}}&amp;gt;1000\r{A}, suggesting the possible Lyman continuum (LyC) leakage from these emission line regions. Embedded within the host galaxy, many Green Seeds correspond to UV star-forming clumps and H{\sc ii} regions, indicating elevated starburst activity in them, with specific star formation rates (sSFR) several times higher than that of the host galaxy. Based on theoretical frameworks, Green Seeds are expected to be formed through gravitational disk instability and/or galaxy mergers. Considering the stellar masses of Green Seeds, we speculate that high-mass Green Seeds may migrate toward the galactic center to build the central bulge, while low-mass Green Seeds are easily disrupted and short-lived. Besides, we propose that some Green Seeds could be the progenitors of globular clusters or ultracompact dwarf galaxies observed in the local universe.

The dearth of high quality spectroscopy of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) -- the main drivers of the assembly of dust and stellar mass at the peak of activity in the Universe -- greatly hinders our ability to interpret their physical processes and evolutionary pathways. We present JWST/NIRSpec observations from RUBIES of four submillimeter-selected, ALMA-detected DSFGs at cosmic noon, z~2.3-2.7. While photometry uniformly suggests vigorous ongoing star formation for the entire sample in line with canonical DSFGs, the spectra differ: one source has spectroscopic evidence of an evolved stellar population, indicating a recent transition to a post-starburst phase, while the remainder show strong spectroscopic signatures of ongoing starbursts. All four galaxies are infrared-luminous (log_{10}L_{\rm{IR}}/L_{\rm \odot} &amp;gt;12.4), massive (log_{10}\,M_\star/M_{\rm \odot} &amp;gt;11), and very dust-obscured (A_V~3-4 ABmag). Leveraging detections of multiple Balmer and Paschen lines, we derive an optical attenuation curve consistent with Calzetti overall, yet an optical extinction ratio R_V~2.5, potentially indicating smaller dust grains or differences in star-dust geometry. This case study provides some of the first detailed spectroscopic evidence that the DSFGs encompass a heterogeneous sample spanning a range of star formation properties and evolutionary stages, and illustrates the advantages of synergistic JWST and ALMA analysis of DSFGs.

We study the stellar mass function (SMF) and the co-evolution with dark matter halos via abundance matching in the largest redshift range to date 0.2&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;12 in 0.53 \, {\rm deg}^2 imaged by JWST from the COSMOS-Web survey. At z&amp;gt;5, we find increased abundances of massive (log\, M_{\star}/M_{\odot}&amp;gt;10.5) implying integrated star formation efficiencies (SFE) \epsilon_{\star}\equiv M_{\star}\, f_{\rm b}^{-1} M_{\rm halo}^{-1} \gtrsim 0.5. We find a flattening of the SMF at the high-mass end that is better described by a double power law at z&amp;gt;5.5. At z \lesssim 5.5 it transitions to a Schechter law which coincides with the emergence of the first massive quiescent galaxies in the Universe. We trace the cosmic stellar mass density (SMD) and infer the star formation rate density (SFRD), which at z&amp;gt;7.5 agrees remarkably with recent \JWST{} UV luminosity function-derived estimates. However, at z \lesssim 3.5, we find significant tension (~ 0.3 dex) with the cosmic star formation (SF) history from instantaneous SF measures, the causes of which remain poorly understood. We infer the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) and the SFE from abundance matching out to z=12, finding a non-monotonic evolution. The SFE has the characteristic strong dependence with mass in the range of 0.02 - 0.2, and mildly decreases at the low mass end out to z~3.5. At z~3.5 the SFE increases sharply from ~ 0.1 to approach high SFE of 0.8-1 by z~ 10 for log(M_{\rm h}/M_{\odot})\approx11.5, albeit with large uncertainties. Finally, we use the SHMR to track the SFE and stellar mass growth throughout the halo history and find that they do not grow at the same rate -- from the earliest times up until z~3.5 the halo growth rate outpaces galaxy assembly, but at z&amp;gt;3.5 halo growth stagnates and accumulated gas reservoirs keep the SF going and galaxies outpace halos.

High-resolution imaging and strong gravitational lensing of high-redshift galaxies have enabled the detection of compact sources with properties similar to nearby massive star clusters. Often found to be very young, these sources may be globular clusters detected in their earliest stages. In this work, we compare predictions of high-redshift (z ~ 1--10) star cluster properties from the E-MOSAICS simulation of galaxy and star cluster formation with those of the star cluster candidates in strongly lensed galaxies from James Webb (JWST) and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging. We select galaxies in the simulation that match the luminosities of the majority of lensed galaxies with star cluster candidates observed with JWST. We find that the luminosities, ages and masses of the brightest star cluster candidates in the high-redshift galaxies are consistent with the E-MOSAICS model. In particular, the brightest cluster ages are in excellent agreement. The results suggest that star clusters in both low- and high-redshift galaxies may form via common mechanisms. However, the brightest clusters in the lensed galaxies tend to be \approx 1--1.5 mag brighter and \approx 0.5 dex more massive than the median E-MOSAICS predictions. We discuss the large number of effects that could explain the discrepancy, including simulation and observational limitations, stellar population models, cluster detection biases and nuclear star clusters. Understanding these limitations would enable stronger tests of globular cluster formation models.

&lt;p&gt;
Recently, NIRSpec PRISM/CLEAR observations by JWST have begun providing rest-frame UV continuum measurements of galaxies at z\gtrsim7, revealing signatures of Ly\alpha damping-wing (DW) absorption by the intergalactic medium (IGM). We develop a methodology to constrain the global ionization fraction of the IGM (Q_{\rm HII}) using low-resolution spectra, employing the random forest classification (RFC) method. We construct mock spectra using the simulated galaxies and the IGM from the Cosmic Dawn II simulation and train RFC models to estimate Q_{\rm HII} at the redshift of the source and to detect the presence of a damped Ly\alpha absorber (DLA). We find that individual galaxy spectra with spectral bins between 1220 and 1270 {&amp;#8491;} and with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 20 can place tight constraints on Q_{\rm HII}, provided the UV continuum is accurately modeled. This method is particularly effective for the early phase of reionization (Q_{\rm HII}&amp;lt;50&amp;percnt;), when the IGM opacity is high in the DW. As a demonstration, we apply our model to existing NIRSpec PRISM/CLEAR spectra, placing upper bounds of Q_{\rm HII}=59.6&amp;percnt;, 5.6&amp;percnt;, and 18.5&amp;percnt; at z=7.7,~9.4, and 10.6, respectively, with 68&amp;percnt; confidence, though several modeling uncertainties remain to be discussed. These constraints favor late-starting reionization models, where \gtrsim 80&amp;percnt; of the IGM is ionized after z=8. We conclude that high SNR observations of carefully selected targets around z~7-9 can effectively constrain reionization models.

JWST spectroscopy has discovered a population of z \gtrsim 3.5 galaxies with broad Balmer emission lines, and narrow forbidden lines, that are consistent with hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN). Many of these systems, now known as ``little red dots" (LRDs), are compact and have unique colors that are very red in the optical/near-infrared and blue in the ultraviolet. The relative contribution of galaxy starlight and AGN to these systems remains uncertain, especially for the galaxies with unusual blue+red spectral energy distributions. In this work, we use Balmer decrements to measure the independent dust attenuation of the broad and narrow emission-line components of a sample of 29 broad-line AGN identified from three public JWST spectroscopy surveys: CEERS, JADES, and RUBIES. Stacking the narrow components from the spectra of 25 sources with broad H\rm{\alpha} and no broad H\rm{\beta} results in a median narrow H\rm{\alpha}/H\rm{\beta} = 2.47^{+0.05}_{-0.05} (consistent with A_{v} = 0) and broad H\rm{\alpha}/H\rm{\beta} &amp;gt; 8.85 (A_{v} &amp;gt; 3.63). The narrow and broad Balmer decrements imply little-to-no attenuation of the narrow emission lines, which are consistent with being powered by star formation and located on larger physical scales. Meanwhile, the lower limit in broad H\rm{\alpha}/H\rm{\beta} decrement, with broad H\rm{\beta} undetected in the stacked spectrum of 25 broad-H\rm{\alpha} AGN, implies significant dust attenuation of the broad-line emitting region that is presumably associated with the central AGN. Our results indicate that these systems, on average, are consistent with heavily dust-attenuated AGN powering the red parts of their SED while their blue UV emission is powered by unattenuated star formation in the host galaxy.

We use James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) medium-resolution spectrometer (MRS) observations of UGC 8782, CGCG 012-070 and NGC 3884 to investigate the origin of the H_2 emission. These three nearby AGN hosts are known to present H_2 emission excess relative to star-forming galaxies, as traced by the H_2 S(3)/PAH_{\rm 11.3&amp;mu; m} line ratio. For every spaxel, we also measure the velocity width (W_{\rm 80}) of H_2 S(3). We find that the distribution of H_2 in the space of these parameters - H_2/PAH and its velocity width - is bimodal: one cluster of points shows approximately constant values of W_{\rm 80}, while the other cluster exhibits a strong correlation between W_{\rm 80} and H_2/PAH. We estimated the temperature of the H_2 gas assuming a power-law distribution and find flatter distributions in regions where a correlation between W_{\rm 80} and H_2 S(3)/PAH_{\rm 11.3&amp;mu; m} is observed. Additionally, we observed a correlation between the [Fe II]_{\rm 5.34 &amp;mu; m} (a known shock tracer) and the H_2 emission. This indicates that the excess H_2 emission excess is associated to shock heating of the gas, generated by outflows or by the interaction of the radio jet with the ambient gas.

The composition of protoplanetary disks, and hence the initial conditions of planet formation, may be strongly influenced by the infall and thermal processing of material during the protostellar phase. Composition of dust and ice in protostellar envelopes, shaped by energetic processes driven by the protostar, serves as the fundamental building material for planets and complex organic molecules. As part of the JWST GO program, "Investigating Protostellar Accretion" (IPA), we observed an intermediate-mass protostar HOPS 370 (OMC2-FIR3) using NIRSpec/IFU and MIRI/MRS. This study presents the gas and ice phase chemical inventory revealed with the JWST in the spectral range of ~2.9 to 28 &amp;mu;m and explores the spatial variation of volatile ice species in the protostellar envelope. We find evidence for thermal processing of ice species throughout the inner envelope. We present the first high-spatial resolution (~ 80 au) maps of key volatile ice species H_{2}O, CO_{2}, ^{13}CO_2, CO, and OCN^-, which reveal a highly structured and inhomogeneous density distribution of the protostellar envelope, with a deficiency of ice column density that coincides with the jet/outflow shocked knots. Further, we observe high relative crystallinity of H_{2}O ice around the shocked knot seen in the H_2 and OH wind/outflow, which can be explained by a lack of outer colder material in the envelope along the line of sight due to the irregular structure of the envelope. These observations show clear evidence of thermal processing of the ices in the inner envelope, close to the outflow cavity walls, heated by the luminous protostar.

JWST has revealed an abundance of compact, red objects at z\approx5-8 dubbed "little red dots" (LRDs), whose SEDs display a faint blue UV continuum followed by a steep rise in the optical. Despite extensive study of their characteristic V-shaped SEDs, the nature of LRDs remains unknown. We present a new analysis of the NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum of A2744-QSO1, a triply imaged LRD at z=7.04 from the UNCOVER survey. The spectrum shows a strong Balmer break and broad Balmer emission lines, both of which are difficult to explain with models invoking exclusively AGN or stellar contributions. Our fiducial model decomposes the spectrum into a post-starburst galaxy dominating the UV-optical continuum and a reddened AGN being sub-dominant at all wavelength and contributing at ~20&amp;percnt; level. However, our most credible model infers a stellar mass of M_\star\approx 4\times10^9\,\mathrm{M_\odot} within a radius of r_\mathrm{e}&amp;lt;30\,pc, driving its central density to the highest among observations to date. This high central density could be explained if A2744-QSO-1 is the early-forming core of a modern-day massive elliptical galaxy that later puffed up via the inside-out growth channel. The models also necessitate an unusually steep dust law to preserve the strong break strength, though this steepness may be explained by a deficit of large dust grains. It is also probable that these challenges reflect our ignorance of A2744-QSO1's true nature. Future variability and reverberation mapping studies could help disentangle the galaxy and AGN contribution to the continuum, and deeper redder observations could also unveil the dust properties in LRDs.

&lt;p&gt;
Supermassive black holes with masses \gtrsim 10^9\,M_\odot have been discovered by JWST at high redshifts (z~ 7). It is difficult to explain such objects as the result of accretive growth of stellar-mass seeds, as the rate at which baryons can be fed to the black hole is limited by the radiation pressure of the infalling matter. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism to create the early progenitors: the collapse of small dark matter halos through a dissipative cooling mechanism in the dark sector. These small black holes can then be efficiently fed with additional dissipative dark matter due to the comparatively weak interactions between the dark radiation and dark matter, which results in a very short Eddington time and high accretion rates.

&lt;p&gt;
We present 850&amp;mu;m polarized observations of the molecular cloud G34.26+0.15 taken using the POL-2 polarimeter mounted on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). G34.26+0.15 is a hub-filament system with ongoing high-mass star-formation, containing multiple HII regions. We extend the Histogram of Relative Orientations technique with an alternative application that considers the alignment of the magnetic field to the filaments and a HII region boundary, denoted as the filament alignment factor (\xi_{F}) and the ellipse alignment factor (\xi_{E}) respectively. Using these metrics, we find that, although in general the magnetic field aligns parallel to the filamentary structure within the system in the north-west, the magnetic field structure of G34.26+0.15 has been radically reshaped by the expansion of an evolved HII region in the south-east, which itself may have triggered further high-mass star formation in the cloud. Thus, we suggest high-mass star formation is both occurring through mass accretion as per the hub-filament model from one side, and through compression of gas under stellar feedback from the other. We also use HARP observations of C^{18}O from the CHIMPS survey to estimate the magnetic field strength across the cloud, finding strengths of ~0.5-1.4 mG.

&lt;p&gt;
The high redshift (z&amp;gt;10) galaxies GHZ9 and UHZ1 observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are very massive and have exceptionally high black hole-to-star mass ratios with the central black hole masses M\gtrsim 10^7\rm~M_\odot. In this paper, we explore the possibility that they are seeded by the supermassive primordial black holes (SMPBHs), which came into being in the very early universe, with initial masses ~ 10^7\rm~M_\odot. We present the self-similar accretion solutions for SMPBHs, and find that the mass growth of SMPBHs during pregalactic era may be negligible. These SMPBHs, when the redshift z\lesssim 20, can accelerate seeding high-redshift galaxies and their baryonic content, and consequently explain the central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of high-redshift massive galaxies through sub-Eddington accretion. According to our results, SMPBHs actually could lead to the existence of more massive SMBHs at higher redshifts compared to other SMBH seed scenarios, specially SMBHs with masses M\gtrsim 10^7~\rm M_\odot at z&amp;gt;20 might only origin from SMPBHs, thus the corresponding observation can serve as a potential probe to PBHs.

Combining Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array CO(2-1) mapping and JWST near- and mid-infrared imaging, we characterize the relationship between CO(2-1) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission at ~100 pc resolution in 66 nearby star-forming galaxies, expanding the sample size from previous ~100 pc resolution studies by more than an order of magnitude. Focusing on regions of galaxies where most of the gas is likely to be molecular, we find strong correlations between CO(2-1) and 3.3 micron, 7.7 micron, and 11.3 micron PAH emission, estimated from JWST's F335M, F770W, and F1130W filters. We derive power law relations between CO(2-1) and PAH emission, which have indices in the range 0.8-1.2, implying relatively weak variations in the observed CO-to-PAH ratios across the regions that we study. We find that CO-to-PAH ratios and scaling relationships near HII regions are similar to those in diffuse sight lines. The main difference between the two types of regions is that sight lines near HII regions show higher intensities in all tracers. Galaxy centers, on the other hand, show higher overall intensities and enhanced CO-to-PAH ratios compared to galaxy disks. Individual galaxies show 0.19 dex scatter in the normalization of CO at fixed I_PAH and this normalization anti-correlates with specific star formation rate (SFR/M*) and correlates with stellar mass. We provide a prescription that accounts for these galaxy-to-galaxy variations and represents our best current empirical predictor to estimate CO(2-1) intensity from PAH emission, which allows one to take advantage of JWST's excellent sensitivity and resolution to trace cold gas.

We present a detailed analysis of JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam observations of ZF-UDS-7329, a massive, quiescent galaxy at redshift z=3.2, which has been put forward to challenge cosmology and galaxy formation physics. Our study extends previous works by focusing on the impact of different star formation history (SFH) priors, stellar libraries, metallicity, and initial mass function assumptions. Our results show that ZF-UDS-7329, with a formed stellar mass of M_{\star} \approx 10^{11.4}~M_{\odot} and a specific star formation rate of \mathrm{sSFR} \approx 0.03 Gyr^{-1}, formed efficiently in the first billion years of the Universe. In agreement with previous work, we find that the spectrum is consistent with mass-weighted stellar ages of 1.3-1.8 Gyr, depending on the SFH prior used. A physically motivated rising SFH prior makes the formation history of ZF-UDS-7329 compatible with stellar mass and star-formation rate estimates of high-redshift (z&amp;gt;6) galaxies. Using NIRCam imaging, we identify a colour gradient indicative of an old, quiescent bulge and a younger disc component, as expected from a complex formation history. The inferred SFH is consistent a high stellar fraction of f_{\star}=M_{\star}/(f_b \cdot M_{\rm h}) \approx 100&amp;percnt; at z=7-12, implying an extremely high integrated star-formation efficiency. However, when considering cosmic variance and possible mergers as expected in over-dense environments - as traced by ZF-UDS-7329 - the stellar fractions could be reduced to f_{\star} \approx 50&amp;percnt;, which is more consistent with galaxy formation models and the stellar-to-halo mass relation at lower redshifts. We conclude that ZF-UDS-7329 forms extremely efficient in the early universe, but does not necessitate unseen galaxies at higher redshifts since the inferred SFR of ancestors are consistent with those seen in z&amp;gt;6 galaxies.

In the first two years of operation JWST has delivered key new insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies in the early Universe. By combining imaging with spectroscopy, we discovered and characterised the first generation of galaxies, probing the Universe at an age of 300 million years. While the current JWST observations confirm the overall cosmological framework and the paradigm of galaxy formation, there are also surprises, including large abundances of bright galaxies and accreting black holes in the early Universe. These observations, together with detailed measurements of the stellar populations and morphological structure, will help us to develop in the coming years a more refined understanding of the baryonic physics (including star formation and feedback processes) that leads to the formation of mature systems at later epochs, including our own Milky Way galaxy.

We demonstrate that gas disks around binary systems might deliver gas to the binary components only when the circumbinary disk is relatively warm. We present new grid-based hydrodynamics simulations, performed with the binary on the grid and a locally isothermal equation of state, in which the binary is seen to functionally ``stop accreting'' if the orbital Mach number in the disk exceeds a threshold value of about 40. Above this threshold, the disk continues to extract angular momentum from the binary orbit, but it delivers very little mass to the black holes, and instead piles up mass in a ring surrounding the binary. This ring will eventually become viscously relaxed and deliver mass to the binary at the large-scale inflow rate. However we show that the timescale for such relaxation can far exceed the implied binary lifetime. We demonstrate that the ability of a binary-disk system to equilibrate is dependent on the efficiency at which accretion streams deposit mass onto the binary; which in turn is highly sensitive to the thermodynamic conditions of the inner disk. If disks around massive black hole binaries do operate in such non-accreting regimes, it suggests these systems may be dimmer than their single black hole counterparts, but could exhibit dramatic re-brightening after the black holes in-spiral and merge. This dimming occurs at high photon energies, corresponding to the effective truncation of the circumbinary disk. As a result, such system may be underluminous in UV bands and missing X-ray emission entirely, potentially resembling the spectra of `Little Red Dots'' recently identified in JWST observations.

We present paper II comprising a 35 arcmin^2 JWST/NIRCam imaging and wide-field slitless spectroscopy mosaic centered on J0305-3150, a luminous quasar at z=6.61. The F356W grism data reveals 124 [OIII]+H\beta emitters at 5.3&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;7, 53 of which constitute a protocluster spanning (10 cMpc)^2 across 6.5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6.8. We find no evidence of any broad-line AGN in individual galaxies or stacking, reporting a median H\beta FWHM of 585 \pm 152 km s^{-1}; however, the mass-excitation diagram and ``little red dot" color and compactness criteria suggest that there are a few AGN candidates on the outskirts of the protocluster. We fit the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the [OIII] emitters with Prospector and Bagpipes, and find that none of the SED-derived properties (stellar mass, age, or star formation rate) correlates with proximity to the quasar. While there is no correlation between galaxy age and local galaxy density, we find modest correlations between local galaxy density with increasing stellar mass, decreasing 10-to-100 Myr star formation rate ratios and decreasing nebular line equivalent widths. We further find that the protocluster galaxies are consistent with being more massive, older, and hosting higher star formation rates than the field sample at the 3\sigma level, distributed in a filamentary structure which supports inside-out formation of the protocluster. There is modest evidence that galaxy evolution proceeds differently as a function of the density of local environment within protoclusters during the epoch of reionization, and the central quasar has little effect on the galaxy properties of the surrounding structure.

ASPIRE (A SPectroscopic survey of bIased halos in the Reionization Era) is a quasar legacy survey primarily using JWST to target a sample of 25 z&amp;gt;6 quasars with NIRCam slitless spectroscopy and imaging. The first study in this series found evidence of a strong overdensity of galaxies around J0305-3150, a luminous quasar at z=6.61, within a single NIRCam pointing obtained in JWST Cycle 1. Here, we present the first results of a JWST Cycle 2 mosaic that covers 35 arcmin^2 with NIRCam imaging/WFSS of the same field to investigate the spatial extent of the putative protocluster. The F356W grism data targets [OIII]+H\beta at 5.3&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;7 and reveals a population of 124 line emitters down to a flux limit of 1.2\times10^{-18} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2}. Fifty-three of these galaxies lie at 6.5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6.8 spanning 10 cMpc on the sky, corresponding to an overdensity within a 2500 cMpc^3 volume of 12.5 \pm 2.6, anchored by the quasar. Comparing to the [OIII] luminosity function from the Emission line galaxies and Intergalactic Gas in the Epoch of Reionization (EIGER) project, we find a dearth of faint [OIII] emitters at log(L/erg s^{-1}) &amp;lt; 42.3, which we suggest is consistent with either bursty star formation causing galaxies to scatter around the grism detection limit or modest suppression from quasar feedback. While we find a strong filamentary overdensity of [OIII] emitters consistent with a protocluster, we suggest that we could be insensitive to a population of older, more massive Lyman-break galaxies with weak nebular emission on scales &amp;gt;10 cMpc.

&lt;p&gt;
A direct link between large-scale environment and galaxy properties is very well established in the local universe. However, very little is known about the role of the environment for galaxy growth before the peak of the cosmic star formation history at z&amp;gt;3 due to the rarity of high-redshift, overdense structures. Using a combination of deep, multiwalength observations, including MUSE, JWST, Chandra, HST and ground-based imaging, we detect and study the properties of a population of star-forming galaxies in the field of a hyperluminous quasar at z\approx3.25 associated with the giant Ly\alpha nebula MQN01. We find that this region hosts one of the largest overdensity of galaxies found so far at z&amp;gt;3, with \rho/\bar{\rho}=53\pm17 within 4\times4\rm\,cMpc^2 and |\Delta v|&amp;lt;1000\rm\,km\,s^{-1} from the quasar, providing a unique laboratory to study the link between overdense regions and galaxy properties at high redshift. Even in these rare overdense regions, galaxies are forming stars at a rate consistent with the main sequence at z\approx3, demonstrating that their SFR is regulated by local properties correlated with their stellar mass rather than by their environment. However, the high-mass-end of the stellar mass function is significantly elevated with respect to that of galaxies in the field at \log(M_\star/{M_\odot})\gtrsim10.5, suggesting that massive galaxies in overdense regions build-up their stellar mass earlier or more efficiently than in average regions of the universe. Finally, the overdensity of color-selected Lyman break galaxies observed on larger scales, across \approx24\times24\rm\,cMpc^2, is found to be aligned toward the structure traced by the spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies identified with MUSE in the inner 4\times4\rm\,cMpc^2, suggesting that this highly overdense region could further extend up to a few tens of comoving Mpc.

We combine JWST/NIRCam and Subaru/MOIRCS dual Pa\mathrm{\beta} + H\mathrm{\alpha} narrow-band imaging to trace the dust attenuation and the star-formation activities of a sample of 43 H\mathrm{\alpha} emitters at the core of one of the most massive and best-studied clusters in formation at the cosmic noon: the Spiderweb protocluster at \mathrm{z=2.16}. We find that most H\mathrm{\alpha} emitters display Pa\mathrm{\beta}/H\mathrm{\alpha} ratios compatible with Case B recombination conditions, which translates into nebular extinction values ranging at \mathrm{A_V\approx0-3} magnitudes, and dust corrected \mathrm{Pa\beta} star formation rates consistent with coeval main sequence field galaxies at fixed stellar mass (\mathrm{9.4&amp;lt;\log M_*/M_\odot&amp;lt;11.0}) during this cosmic epoch. Furthermore, we investigate possible environmental impacts on dust extinction across the protocluster large-scale structure and find no correlation between the dustiness of its members and environmental proxies such as phase-space position, clustercentric radius, or local density. These results support the scenario for which dust production within the main galaxy population of this protocluster is driven by secular star formation activities fueled by smooth gas accretion across its large-scale structure. This downplays the role of gravitational interactions in boosting star formation and dust production within the Spiderweb protocluster, in contrast with observations in higher redshift and less evolved protocluster cores.

&lt;p&gt;
We report the initial result of our Pa\beta narrowband imaging on a protocluster with the JWST Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam). As NIRCam enables deep narrowband imaging of rest-frame NIR lines at z&amp;gt;1, we target one of the most studied protoclusters, the Spiderweb protocluster at z=2.16, in which previous studies have confirmed more than a hundred member galaxies. The NIRCam F405N narrowband filter covers in Pa\beta line the protocluster redshift given by known protocluster members, allowing the search for new member candidates. The weight-corrected color-magnitude diagram obtained 57 sources showing narrowband excesses, 41 of which satisfy further color selection criteria for limiting the sample to Pa\beta emitter candidates at z~2.16, and 24 of them do not have H\alpha emitter counterparts. The Pa\beta emitter candidates appear to follow the spatial distribution of known protocluster members; however, follow-up spectroscopic confirmation is required. Only 17 out of 58 known H\alpha-emitting cluster members are selected as Pa\beta emitters in the current data, albeit the rest fall out of the narrowband selection owing to their small Pa\beta equivalent widths. We derive Pa\beta luminosity function in the Spiderweb protocluster, showing a normalization density of \log{\phi^\ast}=-2.53\pm0.15 at a characteristic Pa\beta luminosity of \log{L^\ast}=42.33\pm0.17. Furthermore, we examine the possibility of detecting faint line emitters visible only in the narrow-band image, but find no promising candidates.

&lt;p&gt;
We present indirect constraints on the absolute escape fraction of ionizing photons (f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}) of the system GN 42912 which comprises two luminous galaxies (M_{\rm UV} magnitudes of -20.89 and -20.37) at z~7.5, GN 42912-NE and GN 42912-SW, to determine their contribution to the ionizing photon budget of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The high-resolution James Webb Space Telescope NIRSpec and NIRCam observations reveal the two galaxies are separated by only ~0.1" (0.5 kpc) on the sky and have a 358 km s^{-1} velocity separation. GN 42912-NE and GN 42912-SW are relatively massive for this redshift (log(M_\ast/M_\odot) ~ 8.4 and 8.9, respectively), with gas-phase metallicities of 18 per cent and 23 per cent solar, O_{32} ratios of 5.3 and &amp;gt;5.8, and \beta slopes of -1.92 and -1.51, respectively. We use the Mg II\lambda\lambda2796,2803 doublet to constrain f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}. Mg II has an ionization potential close to that of neutral hydrogen and, in the optically thin regime, can be used as an indirect tracer of the LyC leakage. We establish realistic conservative upper limits on f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC} of 8.5 per cent for GN 42912-NE and 14 per cent for GN 42912-SW. These estimates align with f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC} trends observed with \beta, O_{32}, and the H\beta equivalent width at z&amp;lt;4. The small inferred ionized region sizes (&amp;lt;0.3 pMpc) around both galaxies indicate they have not ionized a significant fraction of the surrounding neutral gas. While these z&amp;gt;7 f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC} constraints do not decisively determine a specific reionization model, they support a minor contribution from these two relatively luminous galaxies to the EoR.

To date, JWST has detected the earliest known star clusters in our Universe (Adamo et al. 2024, Messa et al. 2024, Vanzella et al. 2024, Mowla et al. 2024). They appear to be relatively compact (~few pc, Adamo et al. 2024) and had only recently formed their stars. It was speculated that these clusters may be the earliest progenitors of globular clusters ever detected. Globular clusters are a relic of the initial stages of star formation in the Universe. However, because they contain little to no dark matter (e.g., Heggie &amp; Hut 1996, Bradford et al. 2011, Conroy et al. 2011, Ibata et al. 2013), their formation mechanism poses a significant theoretical challenge. A recent suggestion pointed out that the relative velocity between the gas and the dark matter (Tseliakhovich &amp; Hirata 2010) in the early Universe could naturally form potentially star-forming regions outside of dark matter halos. Here, for the first time, we follow the star formation process of these early Universe objects using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, including mechanical feedback. Our results suggest that the first dark matter-less star clusters are top-heavy, with a higher abundance of massive stars compared to today's clusters and extremely high stellar mass surface densities compared to the local Universe.

Galaxy emission-line fluxes can be analyzed to determine star formation rates (SFR) and ISM ionization. Here, we investigate rest-frame optical emission lines of 71 star-forming galaxies at redshift 0.7 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 7 from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey using JWST/NIRSpec. We use H{\alpha} line fluxes to measure SFRs. We combine these with HST CANDELS stellar mass estimates to determine the redshift evolution of specific SFR (sSFR) and compare our sample with the star-forming galaxy main sequence. We create [O III]{\lambda}5008/H{\beta} versus [Ne III]{\lambda}3870/[O II]{\lambda}3728 line ratio diagrams and correlate these ratios with sSFR and the distance of each galaxy from the main sequence (excess sSFR). We find a modest correlation between the line ratios and sSFR, which is consistent with previous work analyzing similar samples. However, we find a weak correlation between the line ratios and excess sSFR. Taken together, our results suggest that sSFR is the parameter that governs ionization conditions rather than SFR or a galaxy's distance from the main sequence. These measurements reveal a rich diversity of ISM conditions and physical galaxy properties throughout cosmic time.

We present the formation histories of 19 massive (\gtrsim3\times10^{10}\text{M}_\odot) quiescent galaxy candidates at z~3.0-4.5 observed using JWST/NIRSpec. This completes the spectroscopic confirmation of the 24 K-selected quiescent galaxy sample from the ZFOURGE and 3DHST surveys \citep{Schreiber2018}. Utilizing Prism 1-5&amp;mu;m spectroscopy, we confirm that all 12 sources that eluded confirmation by ground-based spectroscopy lie at z&amp;gt;3, resulting in a spectroscopically confirmed number density of ~1.4\times10^{-5}\text{Mpc}^{-3} between z~3-4. Rest-frame U-V vs V-J color selections show high effectiveness in identifying quiescent galaxies, with a purity of ~90&amp;percnt;. Our analysis shows that parametric star-formation histories (SFHs) from FAST++ and binned SFHs from Prospector on average yield consistent results, revealing diverse formation and quenching times. The oldest galaxy formed ~6\times10^{10}\text{M}_\odot by z~10 and has been quiescent for over 1 Gyr at z~3.2. We detect two galaxies with ongoing star formation and six with active galactic nuclei (AGN). We demonstrate that the choice of stellar population models, stellar libraries, wavelength range, and nebular or AGN contributions does not significantly affect the derived average SFHs of the galaxies. The assumed SFH prior, however, influences the star formation rate at early times, where spectral diagnostic power is limited. Simulated z~3 quiescent galaxies from IllustrisTNG, SHARK, and Magneticum broadly match the average SFHs of the observed sample but struggle to capture the full diversity, particularly at early stages. Our results emphasize the need for mechanisms that rapidly build stellar mass and quench star formation within the first billion years of the Universe.

IRAC data have long implied that early (z\gtrsim6) galaxies often have very high specific star formation rates (sSFR\gtrsim30 Gyr^{-1}), but JWST data have shown that at least some early galaxies are forming stars far less vigorously. Here, we systematically analyze the recent star formation histories (SFHs) of a large (N=368) sample of z~6 Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) spanning -22\lesssim M_\mathrm{UV}\lesssim-16 assembled from ACS+NIRCam imaging in the GOODS and Abell 2744 fields. We find that very low H\alpha-to-UV luminosity ratios (L_\mathrm{H\alpha}/L_\mathrm{UV}) and strong recent downturns in star formation rate (SFR) are \approx5\times more common among the UV-faintest subset of our sample (\langle M_\mathrm{UV}\rangle=-17.4) compared to the brightest subset (\langle M_\mathrm{UV}\rangle=-20.0). The frequency of high L_\mathrm{H\alpha}/L_\mathrm{UV} and strong recent SFR upturns is approximately constant with UV luminosity. We discuss how bursty SFHs naturally reproduce this much greater diversity in recent SFHs among very UV-faint galaxies. Using public NIRSpec/prism data, we newly confirm recent strong SFR downturns among three LBGs in our sample, and validate our photometric inferences on key SFH signatures among z~6 LBGs in general. Our results imply that early galaxies frequently cycle through phases of rapid stellar mass assembly and other periods of much slower growth. This yields huge (\gtrsim1-2 mag) fluctuations in M_\mathrm{UV} on rapid (~10-30 Myr) timescales, helping explain the surprising abundance of z&amp;gt;10 galaxies. Finally, we caution that this burstiness causes all existing high-redshift samples (particularly line-selected samples) to be far less complete to galaxies with long recent phases of low sSFR than those currently undergoing a burst.

Dwarf galaxies hold the key to crucial frontiers of astrophysics, however, their faintness renders spectroscopy challenging. Here we present the JWST Cycle 2 survey, All the Little Things (ALT, PID 3516), which is designed to seek late-forming Pop III stars and the drivers of reionization at z~6-7. ALT has acquired the deepest NIRCam grism spectroscopy yet (7-27 hr), at JWST's most sensitive wavelengths (3-4 &amp;mu;m), covering the powerful lensing cluster Abell 2744. Over the same 30 arcmin^2, ALT's ultra-deep F070W+F090W imaging (~30 mag) enables selection of very faint sources at z&amp;gt;6. We demonstrate the success of ALT's novel ``butterfly" mosaic to solve spectral confusion and contamination, and introduce the ``Allegro" method for emission line identification. By collecting spectra for every source in the field of view, ALT has measured precise (R~1600) redshifts for 1630 sources at z=0.2-8.5. This includes one of the largest samples of distant dwarf galaxies: [1015, 475, 50] sources less massive than the SMC, Fornax, and Sculptor with \log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})&amp;lt;[8.5, 7.5, 6.5]. We showcase ALT's discovery space with: (i) spatially resolved spectra of lensed clumps in galaxies as faint as M_{\rm{UV}}~-15; (ii) large-scale clustering -- overdensities at z=[2.50, 2.58, 3.97, 4.30, 5.66, 5.77, 6.33] hosting massive galaxies with striking Balmer breaks; (iii) small-scale clustering -- a system of satellites around a Milky Way analog at z~6; (iv) spectroscopically confirmed multiple images that help constrain the lensing model underlying all science in this legacy field; (v) sensitive star-formation maps based on dust-insensitive tracers such as Pa\alpha; (vi) direct spectroscopic discovery of rare sources such as AGN with ionized outflows. These results provide a powerful proof of concept for how grism surveys maximize the potential of strong lensing fields.

We present the PANORAMIC survey, a pure parallel extragalactic imaging program with NIRCam observed during JWST Cycle 1. The survey obtained ~530 sq arcmin of NIRCam imaging from 1-5&amp;mu;m, totaling ~192 hours of science integration time. This represents the largest on-sky time investment of any Cycle 1 GO extragalactic NIRCam imaging program by nearly a factor of 2. The survey includes ~432 sq arcmin of novel sky area not yet observed with JWST using at least 6 NIRCam broad-band filters, increasing the existing area covered by similar Cycle 1 data by ~60%. 70 square arcmin was also covered by a 7th filter (F410M). A fraction of PANORAMIC data (~200 sq arcmin) was obtained in or around extragalactic deep-fields, enhancing their legacy value. Pure parallel observing naturally creates a wedding cake survey with both wide and ultra-deep tiers, with 5\sigma point source depths at F444W ranging from 27.8-29.4 (ABmag), and with minimized cosmic variance. The 6+ filter observing setup yields remarkably good photometric redshift performance, achieving similar median scatter and outlier fraction as CANDELS (\sigma_{\rm NMAD}~0.07; \eta~0.2), which enables a wealth of science across redshift without the need for followup or ancillary data. We overview the proposed survey, the data obtained as part of this program, and document the science-ready data products in the first data release. PANORAMIC has delivered wide-area and deep imaging with excellent photometric performance, demonstrating that pure parallel observations with JWST are a highly efficient observing mode that is key to acquiring a complete picture of galaxy evolution from rare bright galaxies to fainter, more abundant sources at all redshifts.

The MIRI-MRS instrument onboard JWST allows for probing the molecular gas composition at mid-IR wavelengths at unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. It is important to study these features in low-mass embedded protostellar systems since the formation of planets is thought to start in this phase. We present JWST/MIRI-MRS data of 18 low-mass protostellar systems in the JOYS program, focusing on gas-phase molecular lines in spectra extracted from the central protostellar positions. Besides H2, the most commonly detected molecules are H2O, CO2, CO, and OH. Other molecules such as 13CO2, C2H2, 13CCH, HCN, C4H2, CH4, and SO2 are detected only toward at most three of the sources. The JOYS data also yield the surprising detection of SiO gas toward two sources (BHR71-IRS1, L1448-mm) and for the first time CS and NH3 at mid-IR wavelengths toward a low-mass protostar (B1-c). The temperatures derived for the majority of the molecules are 100-300 K, much lower than what is typically derived toward more evolved Class II sources (&amp;gt;500 K). Toward three sources (e.g., TMC1-W), hot (~1000 K) H2O is detected, indicative of the presence of hot molecular gas in the embedded disks, but such warm emission from other molecules is absent. The agreement in abundance ratios with respect to H2O between ice and gas point toward ice sublimation in a hot core for a few sources (e.g., B1-c) whereas their disagreement and velocity offsets hint at high-temperature (shocked) conditions toward other sources (e.g., L1448-mm, BHR71-IRS1). The typical temperatures of the gas-phase molecules of 100-300 K are consistent with both ice sublimation in hot cores as well as high-temperature gas phase chemistry. Molecular features originating from the inner embedded disks are not commonly detected, likely because they are too extincted even at mid-IR wavelengths by small not-settled dust grains in upper layers of the disk.

Identification of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is extremely important for understanding galaxy evolution and its connection with the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBH). With the advent of deep and high angular resolution imaging surveys such as those conducted with the {\it James Webb} Space Telescope (JWST), it is now possible to identify galaxies with a central point source out to the very early Universe. In this study, we develop a fast, accurate and precise method to identify galaxies which host AGNs and recover the intrinsic AGN contribution to the observed total light (f_{AGN}). We trained a deep learning (DL) based method Zoobot to estimate the fractional contribution of a central point source to the total light. Our training sample comprises realistic mock JWST images of simulated galaxies from the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We injected different amounts of the real JWST point spread function (PSF) models to represent galaxies with different levels of f_{AGN}. We analyse the performance of our method and compare it with results obtained from the traditional light profile fitting tool GALFIT. We find excellent performance of our DL method in recovering the injected AGN fraction f_{AGN}, both in terms of precision and accuracy. The mean difference between the predicted and true injected f_{AGN} is -0.0006 and the overall root mean square error (RMSE) is 0.027. The relative absolute error (RAE) is 0.086 and the outlier (defined as predictions with RAE &amp;gt;20&amp;percnt;) fraction is 7.8&amp;percnt;. In comparison, using GALFIT on the same dataset, we achieve a mean difference of -0.024, RMSE of 0.09, RAE of 0.19 and outlier fraction of 19&amp;percnt;. Our DL-based method to identify AGNs and estimate f_{AGN} is extremely fast and easy to use and has a huge potential in future applications to large galaxy imaging surveys.

With the advent of JWST ice observations, dedicated studies on the formation reactions of detected molecules are becoming increasingly important. One of the most interesting molecules in interstellar ice is CO_2. Despite its simplicity, the main formation reaction considered, CO + OH -&amp;gt; CO_2 + H through the energetic HOCO* intermediate on ice dust, is subject to uncertainty because it directly competes with the stabilization of HOCO as a final product which is formed through energy dissipation of HOCO* to the water ice. When energy dissipation to the surface is effective during reaction, HOCO can be a dominant product. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate that the major product of the reaction is indeed not CO_2, but rather the highly reactive radical HOCO. The HOCO radical can later evolve into CO_2 through H-abstraction reactions, but these reactions compete with addition reactions, leading to the formation of carboxylic acids (R-COOH). Our results highlight the importance of HOCO chemistry and encourage further exploration of the chemistry of this radical.

Understanding when and how reionization happened is crucial for studying the early structure formation and the properties of first galaxies in the Universe. At z&amp;gt;5.5, the observed IGM optical depth shows a significant scatter, indicating an inhomogeneous reionization process. However, the nature of the inhomogeneous reionization remains debated. ASPIRE is a JWST Cycle 1 program that has spectroscopically identified &amp;gt;400 [OIII] emitters in 25 quasar fields at z&amp;gt;6.5. Combined with deep ground-based optical spectroscopy of ASPIRE quasars, ASPIRE program provides the current largest sample for IGM-galaxy connection studies during cosmic reionization. We present the first results of IGM effective optical depth measurements around [OIII] emitters using 14 ASPIRE quasar fields. We find the IGM transmission is tightly related with reionization-era galaxies to the extent that significant excess of Ly\alpha transmission exists around [OIII] emitters. We measure the stacked IGM effective optical depth of IGM patches associated with [OIII] emitters and find they reach the same IGM effective optical depth at least dz~0.1 ahead of those IGM patches where no [OIII] emitters are detected, supporting earlier reionization around [OIII] emitters. Our results indicate an enhancement in IGM Ly\alpha transmission around [OIII] emitters at scales beyond 25 h^{-1} cMpc, consistent with the predicted topology of reionization from fluctuating UV background (UVB) models.

Active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback and its impact on their host galaxies are critical to our understanding of galaxy evolution. Here, we present a combined analysis of new high resolution ultraviolet (UV) data from the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on AstroSat and archival optical spectroscopic data from VLT/MUSE, for the Seyfert galaxy, NGC 1365. Concentrating on the central 5 kpc region, the UVIT images in the far and near UV show bright star forming knots in the circumnuclear ring as well as a faint central source. After correcting for extinction, we found the star formation rate (SFR) surface density of the circumnuclear 2 kpc ring to be similar to other starbursts, despite the presence of an AGN outflow, as seen in [OIII] 5007 Angstrom. On the other hand, we found fainter UV and thus lower SFR in the direction south-east of the AGN relative to north-west in agreement with observations at other wavelengths from JWST and ALMA. The AGN outflow velocity is found to be lesser than the escape velocity, suggesting that the outflowing gas will rain back into the galaxy. The deep UV data has also revealed diffuse UV emission in the direction of the AGN outflow. By combining [OIII] and UV data, we found the diffuse emission to be of AGN origin.

In this paper, we present a simple but compelling argument, focusing on galaxy science, for preserving the main imagers and operational modes of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) for as long as is technically feasible. While star-formation started at redshifts z\gtrsim10-13, when the universe was less than 300-500 Myr old, the CSFH did not peak until z~eq1.9, and has steadily declined since that time. Hence, at least half of all stars in the universe formed in the era where HST provides its unique rest-frame UV view of unobscured young, massive stars tracing cosmic star-formation. By rendering a subset of the 556.3 hours of available HST images in 12 filters of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) in an appropriate mix of colors, we illustrate the unique capabilities of HST for galaxy science emphasizing that rest-frame UV-optical wavelength range. We then contrast this with the 52.7 publicly available hours of JWST/NIRCam images in 8 filters of the same HUDF area from the JADES project, rendering these at the redder near-IR wavelengths to illustrate the unique capabilities of JWST to detect older stellar populations at higher redshifts, as well as very dusty stellar populations and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). HST uniquely probes (unobscured) young, hot, massive stars in galaxies, while JWST reveals more advanced stages of older stellar populations, as well as relatively short-lived phases where galaxies produce and shed a lot of dust from intense star-formation, and the very high redshift universe (z\gtrsim10-11) not accessible by HST. We conclude that HST and JWST are highly complementary facilities that took decades to build to ensure decades of operation. To maximize return on investment on both HST and JWST, ways will need to be found to operate HST imaging instruments in all relevant modes for as long as possible into the JWST mission.

JWST has now revealed a population of broad-line AGN at z&amp;gt;4 characterized by a distinctive SED shape, with very red rest-frame optical and very blue rest-frame UV continuum. While the optical continuum is thought to originate from the accretion disk, the origin of the UV continuum has been largely unclear. We report the detection of the strong rest-frame UV emission lines of CIII]\lambda\lambda1907,1909 and CIV\lambda\lambda1549,1551 in a "little red dot" AGN, COS-66964. Spectroscopically confirmed at z=7.0371, COS-66964 exhibits broad H\alpha emission (FWHM ~ 2000 km s^{-1}), and weak broad H\beta, implying significant dust attenuation to the BLR (A_V = 3.9^{+1.7}_{-0.9}). The H\alpha line width implies a central SMBH mass of M_{\rm BH} = \left(1.9^{+1.6}_{-0.7}\right)\times10^{7} M_\odot, and an Eddington ratio \lambda~0.3-0.5. While marginal HeII\lambda4687 and [FeX]\lambda6376 detections further indicate that the AGN dominates in the rest-frame optical, the non-detection of HeII\lambda1640 in the UV despite high EW CIII] and CIV (~ 35 {&amp;#8491;}) is more consistent with photoionization by massive stars. The non-detection of MgII\lambda\lambda2800 is similarly inconsistent with an AGN scattered light interpretation. Assuming the rest-frame UV is dominated by stellar light, we derive a stellar mass of \log M_\star/M_\odot~8.5, implying an elevated M_{\rm BH}/M_\star ratio ~2 orders of magnitude above the local relation, but consistent with other high-z AGN discovered by JWST. The source is unresolved in all bands, implying a very compact size \lesssim200 pc in the UV. This suggests that the simultaneous buildup of compact stellar populations (i.e., galaxy bulges) and the central SMBH is ongoing even at z&amp;gt;7.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered an abundance of z&amp;gt;10 galaxies bright in the ultraviolet (UV) that has challenged traditional theoretical models at high redshifts. Recently, various new models have emerged to address this discrepancy by refining their description of star formation. Here we investigate whether modifications to the stellar initial mass function (IMF) alone can reproduce the z&amp;gt;10 UV luminosity functions (UV LFs) when the star formation rate is used as a proxy for the fraction of massive stars. We incorporate an Evolving IMF into the {\sc astraeus} galaxy evolution and reionisation simulation framework, which becomes increasingly top-heavy as the gas density in a galaxy rises above a given threshold. Our implementation accounts for the IMF's effects on supernova (SN) feedback, metal enrichment, and the UV and ionising emissivities. For this Evolving IMF model, we find that (i) the maximum UV luminosity enhancement is twice as large in massive galaxies (\Delta M_\mathrm{UV}~eq2.6) than those where star formation is strongly limited by SN feedback (\Delta M_\mathrm{UV}~eq1.3); (ii) it successfully reproduces the observed UV LFs at z=5-15; (iii) galaxies with top-heavy IMFs exhibit the highest star formation rates, driven by their location in local density peaks, which facilitates higher gas accretion rates; (iv) the 1\sigma variances in the UV luminosity are only slightly higher compared to when assuming a Salpeter IMF, but the 2\sigma variances are significantly increased by a factor of 1.4-2 boosting the abundance of UV-bright galaxies at z&amp;gt;10; (v) reionisation begins earlier with more extended large ionised regions and fewer smaller ones during its initial stages, though these differences diminish at lower redshifts, leading to a similar end of reionisation at z~eq5.6.}

&lt;p&gt;
Detecting or placing upper limits on spacetime variations of fundamental constants requires quantifying every potential source of uncertainty. We continue our previous study into the impact of continuum variations on measurements of the fine structure constant, here in the context of quasar absorption systems. An automated (hence objective and reproducible) continuum modelling method is reported in an accompanying paper. We apply the method to the z_{abs}=1.7975 absorption system towards the quasar PHL957. Multiple continuum fits are generated, and for each, we derive independent models of the system, each giving its own measurement of the fine structure constant \alpha. This process isolates and quantifies the error contribution associated with continuum placement uncertainty. This source of uncertainty, ignored in many previous measurements, arises in two ways: (i) slight local continuum tilt uncertainty generates small line shifts, and (ii) different continuum estimates produce slightly different kinematic structures in the absorption system model. Taking continuum placement uncertainty into account, the new PHL957 measurement we obtain is \Delta\alpha/\alpha= -0.53^{+5.45}_{-5.51} \times 10^{-6}. This measurement assumes terrestrial magnesium isotopic abundances. Recommendations are provided for future \alpha measurements. Finally, we also note the potential importance of the effects identified here for future redshift drift experiments.

&lt;p&gt;
A simple model for the X-ray weakness of JWST-selected broad-line AGNs is proposed under the assumption that the majority of these sources are fed at super-Eddington accretion rates. In these conditions, the hot inner corona above the geometrically thin disk that is responsible for the emission of X-rays in "normal" AGNs will be embedded instead in a funnel-like reflection geometry. The coronal plasma will Compton upscatter optical/UV photons from the underlying thick disk as well as the surrounding funnel walls, and the high soft-photon energy density will cool down the plasma to temperatures in the range 30-40 keV. The resulting X-ray spectra are predicted to be extremely soft, with power-law photon indices Gamma=2.8-4.0, making high-z super-Eddington AGNs largely undetectable by Chandra.

&lt;p&gt;
Rest-frame far-ultraviolet (FUV) observations from JWST are revolutionizing our understanding of the high-z galaxies that drove reionization and the mechanisms by which they accomplished it. To fully interpret these observations, we must be able to diagnose how properties of the interstellar medium (ISM; e.g., column density, covering fraction, outflow velocity) directly relate to the absorption features produced. Using the high-S/N and high-resolution FUV spectra of 45 nearby star-forming galaxies from CLASSY, we present the largest uniform, simultaneous characterization of neutral and low-ionization state (LIS) interstellar UV absorption lines (OI, SiII, SII, CII, AlII) across a wide range of galaxy properties. We also present 21-cm HI observations for 35 galaxies, multiple of which are gas-poor or non-detected, possibly indicating the onset of a post-starburst phase. We find that our simultaneous 1-component Voigt profile fits are capable of accurately modeling the LIS absorption for ~75% of galaxies, mitigating challenges associated with saturation, infilling, and degeneracies. While the most massive galaxies require additional components, our 1-component fits return average properties of the absorbing gas and follow the scaling relations described by a single gas cloud. We explore connections between LIS absorption and direct tracers of the neutral ISM (OI, Ly-alpha, HI 21-cm), finding that CII most closely traces the neutral gas trends while other ions exhibit weaker correlations. Given the challenges with directly observing HI at higher-z, we demonstrate that LIS absorption can be a powerful means to study the neutral ISM and present empirical relationships for predicting neutral gas properties.

We study star formation variability, or burstiness, as a method to constrain and compare different galaxy formation models at high redshift using the Azahar simulation suite. The models range from magneto-hydrodynamics with a magneto-thermo-turbulent prescription for star formation (iMHD) to more sophisticated setups incorporating radiative transfer (RTiMHD) and cosmic ray physics (RTnsCRiMHD). Analysing a sample of galaxies at redshifts z=4-10, we find that the RTnsCRiMHD model exhibits more regular star formation periodicity compared to iMHD and RTiMHD, as revealed by the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. While the RTiMHD model captures a notable degree of stochasticity in star formation without cosmic rays, RTnsCRiMHD galaxies display even greater scatter in the burst intensity and in the scatter around the star-forming main sequence. To evaluate the burstiness in RTnsCRiMHD against observations, we generate a mock spectrum during a mini-quenching event at z=7.5. This spectrum aligns well with the low-mass quiescent galaxy JADES-GS-z7-01-QU observed at z=7.3, though some discrepancies attributed to stellar metallicity hint at a composite spectrum. Our findings highlight the importance of including complex physical processes like cosmic rays and radiative transfer in simulations to accurately capture the bursty nature of star formation in high-redshift galaxies. Future JWST observations, particularly regarding the scatter around the star-forming main sequence, have the potential to refine and guide the next generation of galaxy formation models.

We present the properties of a massive, large, dusty, metal-rich, star-forming galaxy at z_spec=6.73. GOODSN-100182 was observed with JWST/NIRSpec as part of the AURORA survey, and is also covered by public multi-wavelength HST and JWST imaging. While the large mass of GOODSN-100182 (~10^10 M_sun) was indicated prior to JWST, NIRCam rest-optical imaging now reveals the presence of an extended disk (r_eff~1.5 kpc). In addition, the NIRSpec R~1000 spectrum of GOODSN-100182 includes the detection of a large suite of rest-optical nebular emission lines ranging in wavelength from [OII]3727 up to [NII]6583. The ratios of Balmer lines suggest significant dust attenuation (E(B-V)_gas=0.40+0.10/-0.09), consistent with the red rest-UV slope inferred for GOODSN-100182 (beta=-0.50+/-0.09). The star-formation rate based on dust-corrected H-alpha emission is log(SFR(H-alpha)/ M_sun/yr)=2.02+0.13/-0.14, well above the z~7 star-forming main sequence in terms of specific SFR. Strikingly, the ratio of [NII]6583/H-alpha emission suggests almost solar metallicity, as does the ratio ([OIII]5007/H-beta)/([NII]6583/H-alpha) and the detection of the faint [FeII]4360 emission feature, whereas the [OIII]5007/[OII]3727 ratio suggests roughly 50% solar metallicity. Overall, the excitation and ionization properties of GOODSN-100182 more closely resemble those of typical star-forming galaxies at z~2-3 rather than z~7. Based on public spectroscopy of the GOODS-N field, we find that GOODSN-100182 resides within a significant galaxy overdensity, and is accompanied by a spectroscopically-confirmed neighbor galaxy. GOODSN-100182 demonstrates the existence of mature, chemically-enriched galaxies within the first billion years of cosmic time, whose properties must be explained by galaxy formation models.

The Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a versatile instrument for collecting imaging and wide-field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) data for surveys of galaxy clusters, emission-line galaxies, stellar populations, and more. Dispersed zodiacal light imprints distinct structures on space-based near-infrared imaging and WFSS observations, necessitating careful subtraction during JWST NIRISS data reduction. As of 2024-09-24 NIRISS WFSS calibration backgrounds introduce significant spatially-dependent artifacts, up to 5% of the overall background level, which can severely affect data quality and following astronomical analysis. Notably, there are no existing backgrounds for NIRISS imaging data which also show systematic artifacts, such as the `light saber' effect. In this work, we present improved empirical JWST NIRISS imaging and WFSS backgrounds derived from all available public data in the F115W, F150W, and F200W filters. We demonstrate that our empirical backgrounds provide a more accurate representation of the background structure in NIRISS imaging and WFSS data than existing reference files, mitigating the impact of spatially-dependent artifacts. Our empirical backgrounds are publicly available and can be used to improve the quality of JWST NIRISS imaging and WFSS data reduction.

The current paradigm for the co-evolution of galaxies and their supermassive black holes postulates that dust-obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) represent a transitional phase towards a more luminous and unobscured state. However, our understanding of dusty AGNs and their host galaxies at early cosmic times is inadequate due to observational limitations. Here, we present JWST observations of CID-931, an X-ray-detected AGN at a spectroscopic redshift of z_{\rm spec}=4.91. Multiband NIRCam imaging from the COSMOS-Web program reveals an unresolved red core, similar to JWST-discovered dusty AGNs. Strikingly, the red core is surrounded by at least eight massive star-forming clumps spread over 1.\!\!^{\prime\prime}6 \approx 10~{\rm kpc}, each of which has a stellar mass of 10^9-10^{10}M_\odot and ~0.1-1~{\rm kpc} in radius. The whole system amounts to 10^{11}M_\odot in stellar mass, higher than typical star-forming galaxies at the same epoch. In this system, gas inflows and/or complex merger events may trigger clump formation and AGN activity thus leading to the rapid formation of a massive galaxy hosting a supermassive black hole. Future follow-up observations will provide new insights into the evolution of the galaxy-black hole relationship during such transitional phases in the early universe.

Recently, a large number of compact sources at z &amp;gt; 4 with blue UV slopes and extremely red rest-frame optical slopes have been found in James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) extragalactic surveys. As a subsample of these sources, commonly called ``little red dots'' (LRDs), have been spectroscopically observed to host a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN), they have been the focus of multiple recent studies in an attempt to understand the origin of their UV and optical emission. Here, we assemble a sample of 123 LRDs from the literature along with spectroscopic and photometric JWST-identified samples of AGNs to compare their colors and spectral slopes. We find that while obscured AGNs at z &amp;lt; 6 have highly dissimilar colors to LRDs, unobscured AGNs at z &amp;lt; 6 span a wide range of colors, with only a subsample showing colors similar to LRDs. At z &amp;gt; 6, the majority of the unobscured AGNs that have been found in these samples are LRDs, but this may be related to the fact that these sources are at large bolometric luminosities. Because LRDs occupy a unique position in galaxy color space, they are more straightforward to target, and the large number of broad-line AGNs that do not have LRD colors and slopes are therefore underrepresented in many spectroscopic surveys because they are more difficult to pre-select. Current LRD selection techniques return a large and disparate population, including many sources having 2-5&amp;mu;m colors impacted by emission line flux boosting in individual filters.

We report the first successful ALMA follow-up observations of a secure z &amp;gt; 10 JWST-selected galaxy, by robustly detecting (6.6\sigma) the [OIII]_{88&amp;mu; m}\, line in JADES-GS-z14-0 (hereafter GS-z14). The ALMA detection yields a spectroscopic redshift of z=14.1793\pm0.0007, and increases the precision on the prior redshift measurement of z=14.32_{-0.20}^{+0.08} from NIRSpec by \gtrsim180\times. Moreover, the redshift is consistent with that previously determined from a tentative detection (3.6\sigma) of CIII]_{1907,1909} (z=14.178\pm0.013), solidifying the redshift determination via multiple line detections. We measure a line luminosity of L_\mathrm{[OIII]88} = (2.1 \pm 0.5)\times10^8\,L_\odot, placing GS-z14 at the lower end, but within the scatter of, the local L_\mathrm{[OIII]88}-star formation rate relation. No dust continuum from GS-z14 is detected, suggesting an upper limit on the dust-to-stellar mass ratio of &amp;lt; 2 \times 10^{-3}, consistent with dust production from supernovae with a yield y_d &amp;lt; 0.3\,M_\odot. Combining a previous JWST/MIRI photometric measurement of the [OIII]\lambda\lambda4959,5007\mathrm{\mathring{A}} and H\beta lines with Cloudy models, we find GS-z14 to be surprisingly metal-enriched (Z~0.05 - 0.2\,Z_\odot) a mere 300\,\mathrm{Myr} after the Big Bang. The detection of a bright oxygen line in GS-z14 thus reinforces the notion that galaxies in the early Universe undergo rapid evolution.

JADES-GS-z14-0 is the most distant spectroscopically confirmed galaxy so far, at z&amp;gt;14. With a UV magnitude of -20.81, it is one of the most luminous galaxies at cosmic dawn and its half-light radius of 260 pc means that stars dominate the observed UV emission. We report the ALMA detection of [OIII]88&amp;mu;m line emission with a significance of 6.67\sigma and at a frequency of 223.524 GHz, corresponding to a redshift of 14.1796\pm0.0007, which is consistent with the candidate CIII] line detected in the NIRSpec spectrum. At this spectroscopic redshift, the Lyman break identified with NIRSpec requires a damped Lyman-\alpha absorber with a column density of \log(N_{\rm HI}/\mathrm{cm}^{-2})=22.23. The total [OIII]88&amp;mu;m luminosity (log((L_{\rm [OIII]}/L_\odot) = 8.3\pm0.1) is fully consistent with the local L_{\rm [OIII]}-SFR relation. Based on the {L_{\rm [OIII]}/SFR}, we infer a gas-phase metallicity &amp;gt;0.1~{\rm Z_{\rm \odot}}, which is somewhat unexpected given the weakness of the UV emission lines. Using prospector SED modeling and combining the ALMA data with JWST observations, we find Z=0.17~{Z_{\rm \odot}} and an escape fraction of ionizing photons of 20%, which is necessary to explain the UV spectrum. We measure an [O III]5007\r{A}/[O III]88&amp;mu;m line flux ratio between 1 and 10, resulting in an upper limit to the electron density of roughly 300 cm^{-3}, which is lower than those measured in other high-z luminous galaxies. The [OIII]88&amp;mu;m emission line is spectrally resolved, with a FWHM of 100 km/s, resulting in a dynamical mass of \log(M_{\rm dyn}/M_\odot) = 9.0\pm0.2. This value is comparable to the stellar mass derived from the SED fitting, which implies a very low gas fraction. Past radiation-driven outflows may have cleared the galaxy from the gas, reducing the gas fraction and thus increasing the escape fraction of ionizing photons.

We introduce a new physically-motivated spectral template set for fitting the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of high-z galaxies. We use the public galaxy formation code ARES to generate star formation histories of thirteen representative galaxies with diverse masses and generate their predicted spectra across a set of redshifts at z &amp;gt; 6. The model parameters are calibrated to reproduce the properties of z &amp;gt; 6 galaxies observed by HST. Motivated by the apparent importance of bursty star formation at high redshifts, we also include templates with recent starbursts. We use these templates with the SED-fitting code EAZY to analyze both an independent theoretical model and a public sample of JWST-observed galaxies from the JADES survey. The comparison with a semi-analytic model demonstrates that our fitting framework accurately measures the galaxy properties, even when the underlying assumptions of the model differ from ours. Our preliminary application to JWST data shows that galaxies at z &amp;gt; 8 are often bursty (especially at small galaxy masses), follow a star-forming main sequence similar to those at lower redshift (albeit with a higher normalization), and form stars earlier than expected in ares. Our SED-fitting framework is very fast (thanks to the efficiency of EAZY) but provides full inferred star formation histories for each source. Additionally, it enables a direct comparison to theoretical models and helps point toward improvements necessary in those models.

Lyman continuum (LyC) emitters at z&amp;gt;3 provide critical samples for studying the contribution of galaxies to the ionizing background in the Epoch of Reionization. We collect a sample of z&amp;gt;3 LyC emitters, a dominant fraction (~60%-70%) of which shows spatial offsets between LyC emission and the non-ionizing continuum. From this sample, especially, we find a case of an offset LyC emitter, CDFS-6664 (z=3.797), which shows two components in the high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) images. The exceptionally rich data set of CDFS-6664 enables us to extract the two components across multiple wavelengths and estimate their physical properties. We show that CDFS-6664 is consistent with a major merger system with boosted star formation in both components and the offset LyC emission is most likely associated with the bluer and younger component in this merging system. Our result offers an example in which the offset can be caused by a merger. Future observations of more offset LyC emitters would elucidate the role that mergers play in the escape of LyC photons.

We investigate the star-forming properties of 23 Lyman Continuum (LyC) leakers at z &amp;gt; 3 in the Great Observatories' Deep Survey-South (GOODS-S) field based on a systematic review of LyC observations from the literature. Using data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we construct the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for these LyC leakers, covering the spectrum from rest-frame ultraviolet to near-infrared. Through the application of a unified modeling approach, we measure the ultraviolet slope, star formation rate, and stellar mass for these LyC leakers in a consistent manner. These high-redshift LyC leakers demonstrate statistically blue UV-continuum slopes, which is consistent with their high escape fraction of LyC photons. We find that these high-redshift LyC leakers span a wide range of specific star formation rate (log(sSFR/yr) from -8.6 to -6.7). Ten of these LyC leakers are located on the star formation main sequence, instead of all being in the starburst mode. The results indicate that intense bursts of star formation are not necessarily required for the leakage of LyC photons for galaxies at z &amp;gt; 3.

Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered massive galaxies at high redshifts, with their abundance significantly surpassing expectations. This finding poses a substantial challenge to both galaxy formation models and our understanding of cosmology. Additionally, discrepancies between the Hubble parameter inferred from high-redshift cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations and those derived from low-redshift distance ladder methods have led to what is known as the ``Hubble tension''. Among the most promising solutions to this tension are Early Dark Energy (EDE) models. In this study, we employ an axion-like EDE model in conjunction with a universal Salpeter initial mass function to fit the luminosity function derived from JWST data, as well as other cosmological probes, including the CMB, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and the SH0ES local distance ladder. Our findings indicate that JWST observations favor a high energy fraction of EDE, f_\text{EDE} ~ 0.2 \pm 0.03 , and a high Hubble constant value of H_0 ~ 74.6 \pm 1.2 km/s/Mpc, even in the absence of SH0ES data. This suggests that EDE not only addresses the H_0 tension but also provides a compelling explanation for the observed abundance of massive galaxies identified by JWST.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled us to uncover faint galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the early universe. Taking advantage of the unique filter combination used in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) program, we perform an extensive photometric search of galaxies emitting strong H\beta+[O III] and H\alpha lines. The redshift range of the galaxies is limited to 5.03\leq z\leq 5.26 by requiring photometric excesses in NIRCam's F277W and F410M images. A total of 261 H\beta+[O III] and H\alpha dual-line emitters are found over the absolute UV magnitude -22\lesssim M_{\mathrm{UV}}\lesssim -17, with a mean rest-frame equivalent width of 1010 A for H\beta+[O III] and 1040 A for H\alpha. This population accounts for ~ 40&amp;percnt; of the Lyman break galaxies at this redshift range. Intriguingly, there are 58 objects (22% of the whole sample) that exhibit compact morphology at the rest-UV or optical wavelength. With an assumption that these compact dual-line emitters are dominated by AGN, their AGN bolometric luminosities are in the range of 2\times 10^{43} \lesssim L_{\rm bol}/({\rm erg~s}^{-1})\lesssim 3\times 10^{44}. Their number density is two orders of magnitude higher than the extrapolation from the UV-selected luminous quasars, which is in good agreement with previous JWST studies of broad-line AGNs, requiring a ~ 10&amp;percnt; of the AGN duty cycle. Moreover, our dual-line emitter sample reaches the faint end of the H\alpha and [O III] luminosity functions down to \lesssim 10^{42}~{\rm erg~s}^{-1}. Spectroscopic follow-up observations are planned in an approved JWST Cycle 3 program, in which we aim to confirm their nature, characterize their black hole activity, and construct their mass distribution at 10^6\lesssim M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot \lesssim 10^8.

We introduce the new cosmological simulation project cosmosTNG, a first-of-its-kind suite of constrained galaxy formation simulations for the universe at Cosmic Noon (z~ 2). cosmosTNG simulates a 0.2 deg^2 patch of the COSMOS field at z ~eq 2.0-2.2 using an initial density field inferred from galaxy redshift surveys and the CLAMATO Lyman-alpha forest tomography survey, reconstructed by the TARDIS algorithm. We evolve eight different realizations of this volume to capture small-scale variations. All runs use the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model with a baryonic mass resolution of 10^6 M_\odot, equal to TNG100-1. In this initial study, we demonstrate qualitative agreement between the evolved large-scale structure and the spatial distribution of observed galaxy populations in COSMOS, emphasizing the zFIRE protocluster region. We then compare the statistical properties and scaling relations of the galaxy population, covering stellar, gaseous, and supermassive black hole (SMBH) components, between cosmosTNG, observations in COSMOS, and z ~ 2 observational data in general. We find that galaxy quenching and environmental effects in COSMOS are modulated by its specific large-scale structure, particularly the collapsing protoclusters in the region. With respect to a random region of the universe, the abundance of high-mass galaxies is larger, and the quenched fraction of galaxies is significant lower at fixed mass. This suggests an accelerated growth of stellar mass, as reflected in a higher cosmic star formation rate density, due to the unique assembly histories of galaxies in the simulated COSMOS subvolume. The cosmosTNG suite will be a valuable tool for studying galaxy formation at cosmic noon, particularly when interpreting extragalactic observations with HST, JWST, and other large multi-wavelength survey programs of the COSMOS field.

Isolated, low-mass galaxies provide the opportunity to assess the impact of reionization on their star formation histories (SFHs) without the ambiguity of environmental processes associated with massive host galaxies. There are very few isolated, low-mass galaxies that are close enough to determine their SFHs from resolved star photometry reaching below the oldest main sequence turnoff. JWST has increased the volume for which this is possible, and here we report on JWST observations of the low-mass, isolated galaxy Leo P. From NIRCam imaging in F090W, F150W, and F277W, we derive a SFH which shows early star formation followed by a pause subsequent to the epoch of reionization which is then later followed by a re-ignition of star formation. This is very similar to the SFHs from previous studies of other dwarf galaxies in the ``transition zone'' between quenched very low-mass galaxies and the more massive galaxies which show no evidence of the impact of reionization on their SFHs; this pattern is rarely produced in simulations of SFHs. The lifetime SFH reveals that Leo P's stellar mass at the epoch of reionization was in the range that is normally associated with being totally quenched. The extended pause in star formation from z~5-1 has important implications for the contribution of low-mass galaxies to the UV photon budget at intermediate redshifts. We also demonstrate that, due to higher sensitivity and angular resolution, observing in two NIRCam short wavelength filters is superior to observing in a combination of a short and a long wavelength filter.

&lt;p&gt;
The scenario of feedback-free starbursts (FFB), which predicts excessively bright galaxies at cosmic dawn as observed using JWST, may provide a natural setting for black hole (BH) growth. This involves the formation of intermediate-mass seed BHs and their runaway mergers into super-massive BHs with high BH-to-stellar mass ratios and low AGN luminosities. We present a scenario of merger-driven BH growth in FFB galaxies and study its feasibility. BH seeds form within the building blocks of the FFB galaxies, namely, thousands of compact star clusters, each starbursting in a free-fall time of a few Myr before the onset of stellar and supernova feedback. The BH seeds form by rapid core collapse in the FFB clusters, in a few free-fall times, sped up by the migration of massive stars due to the young, broad stellar mass function and stimulated by a `gravo-gyro' instability due to internal cluster rotation and flattening. BHs of 10^4 M_\odot are expected in 10^6 M_\odot FFB clusters within sub-kpc galactic disks at z ~ 10. The BHs then migrate to the galaxy center by dynamical friction, hastened by the compact FFB stellar galactic disk configuration. Efficient mergers of the BH seeds will produce 10^{6-8} M_\odot BHs with a BH-to-stellar mass ratio ~ 0.01 by z ~ 4-7, as observed. The growth of the central BH by mergers can overcome the bottleneck introduced by gravitational wave recoils if the BHs inspiral within a relatively cold disk or if the escape velocity from the galaxy is boosted by a wet compaction event. Such events, common in massive galaxies at high redshifts, can also help by speeding up the inward BH migration and by providing central gas to assist with the final parsec problem. The cold disk version of the FFB scenario provides a feasible route for the formation of supermassive BHs.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a new population of candidate broad-line AGN emerging in the early Universe, named ''little red dots'' (LRDs) because of their compactness and red colors at optical wavelengths. LRDs appear to be surprisingly abundant (\approx 10^{-5}\,\mathrm{cMpc}^{-3}) given that their inferred bolometric luminosities largely overlap with the ones of the UV-luminous quasars identified at high z in wide-field spectroscopic surveys. In this work, we investigate how the population of LRDs and/or other UV-obscured AGN relates to the one of unobscured, UV-selected quasars. By comparing their number densities, we infer an extremely large and rapidly evolving obscured:unobscured ratio, ranging from \approx20:1 at z\approx4 to \approx2300:1 at z\approx7, and possibly extending out to very high (\approx10^{47}\,\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}) bolometric luminosities. This large obscured:unobscured ratio is incompatible with the UV-luminous duty cycle measured for unobscured quasars at z\approx4-6, suggesting that LRDs are too abundant to be hosted by the same halos as unobscured quasars. This implies that either (a) the bolometric luminosities of LRDs are strongly overestimated (possibly because LRDs are dominated by stellar galaxy light) or (b) LRDs follow different scaling relations than the ones of UV-selected quasars, representing a new population of accreting SMBHs emerging in the early Universe. A direct comparison between the clustering of LRDs and the one of faint UV-selected quasars will ultimately confirm these findings, and shed light on key properties of LRDs such as their host mass distribution and duty cycle. We provide a mock analysis for the clustering of LRDs and show that it is feasible with current and upcoming JWST surveys.

Massive black holes (BHs) grow by gas accretion and mergers, observable through electromagnetic (EM) and gravitational wave (GW) emission. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has detected faint active galactic nuclei (AGNs), revealing an abundant population of accreting BHs with masses of M_\bullet~ 10^{6-8}~M_\odot. This mass range overlaps with the detection scopes of space-based GW interferometers and approaches the upper bounds of the predicted mass of seed BHs. We model BH mass assembly in light of the new JWST findings to investigate their formation channels and predict merger events. Two types of seed BHs are considered: heavy seeds (M_\bullet~ 10^{2-5}~M_\odot) formed in rare and overdense cosmic regions, and light seeds (M_\bullet~ 10^{1-3}~M_\odot) formed as stellar remnants in less massive dark-matter halos. The BHs grow through episodic accretion and merger events, which we model by fitting the AGN luminosity function to observational data including JWST-identified AGNs at z~ 5. We find that heavy seeds alone struggle to explain quasars and faint JWST-selected AGNs simultaneously, requiring the more abundant light seeds. The observed merger rate of BHs from heavy seeds alone is limited to \lesssim 10^{-1}~{\rm yr}^{-1} for major mergers at z\geq5. However, the presence of light seeds increases the major merger rate by several orders of magnitude, which peaks at a total BH mass of M_\bullet~eq 2\times 10^3~M_\odot over 5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;10 at a rate of ~ 30~{\rm yr}^{-1}. These events are detectable by future GW observatories such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Precise sky localization and distance measurement of those GW events, with solid angle and luminosity distance uncertainties \Delta\Omega\Delta\log D_L\lesssim 10^{-4}~\rm deg^2, will enable EM identification of mergers at z\geq5 and multi-messenger follow-up observations.

We investigate early, z &amp;gt; 3, galaxy formation in a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a close, early-forming Milky Way (MW) analog extracted from TNG50 simulation and re-simulated with detailed modeling of cold interstellar medium (ISM) formation, coupled with on-the-fly UV radiative transfer, turbulence-regulated star formation, and stellar feedback. In our enhanced-physics simulation, the galaxy develops a bi-stable ISM structure (warm, with T ~ 10^4 K, and cold, with T &amp;lt; 100 K) and exhibits significantly more efficient, early, and bursty star formation than in TNG. Notably, the stellar disk of this MW progenitor forms extremely early, around z~6-7, and exhibits chemo-kinematic properties consistent with the low-metallicity population of the MW stars. The disk forms rapidly, on a timescale of ~0.2 Gyr which is significantly shorter than the timescale implied by the observable chemo-kinematic signatures of disk spinup, ~0.7 Gyr, due to the scatter in the age-metallicity relation. The rotational support of the gas disk and the location of the galaxy on the main sequence are consistent with early disk galaxies observed by JWST and ALMA at z~4-7, suggesting that some of these galaxies could be progenitors of MW-like systems. Remarkably, the variation of the global star formation rate (SFR) before disk formation is similar to the observed SFR scatter at these early times. Our findings underscore the critical role of modeling a turbulent cold ISM and turbulence-regulated star formation and feedback in driving early SFR variability, while at the same time enabling early disk formation, without destroying it with overly efficient stellar feedback.

Fast accreting, extremely luminous quasars contribute heavily to the feedback process within galaxies. While these systems are most common at cosmic noon (z~2), here we choose to study PDS 456, an extremely luminous (L_{bol}~ 10^{47} erg s^{-1}) but nearby (z~0.185) quasar where the physics of feedback can be studied in greater detail. We present the results from our analysis of the JWST MIRI/MRS integral field spectroscopic (IFS) data of this object. The extreme brightness of PDS 456 makes it challenging to study the extended emission even in this nearby object. MIRI/MRS instrumental effects are mitigated by using complementary NIRSpec and MUSE IFS data cubes. We show clear evidence of a multiphase gas outflow extending up to 15 kpc from the central source. This includes emission from warm molecular (H_2 \nu = 0 - 0 and 1 - 0) and ionized (e.g. Pa\alpha, [O III], [Ne III], [Ne VI]) gas with typical blueshifted velocities down to -500 km s^{-1}. We are also able to probe the nuclear dust emission in this source through silicate and PAH emission features but are unable to spatially resolve it. Our results are consistent with this powerful quasar driving a radiatively driven wind over a broad range of distances and altering the ionization structure of the host galaxy.

&lt;p&gt;
Observational studies showed that galaxy disks are already in place in the first few billion years of the universe. The early disks detected so far, with typical half-light radii of 3 kiloparsecs at stellar masses around 10^11 M_sun for redshift z~3, are significantly smaller than today's disks with similar masses, in agreement with expectations from current galaxy models. Here, we report observations of a giant disk at z=3.25, when the universe was only 2 billion years old, with a half-light radius of 9.6 kiloparsecs and stellar mass of 3.7^+2.6_-2.2x10^11 M_sun. This galaxy is larger than any other kinematically-confirmed disks at similar epochs and surprisingly similar to today's largest disks regarding size and mass. JWST imaging and spectroscopy reveal its spiral morphology and a rotational velocity consistent with local Tully-Fisher relation. Multi-wavelength observations show that it lies in an exceptionally dense environment, where the galaxy number density is over ten times higher than the cosmic average and mergers are frequent. The discovery of such a giant disk suggests the presence of favorable physical conditions for large-disk formation in dense environments in the early universe, which may include efficient accretion of gas carrying coherent angular momentum and non-destructive mergers between exceptionally gas-rich progenitor galaxies.

The H{\alpha} nebular emission line is an optimal tracer for recent star formation in galaxies. With the advent of JWST, this line has recently become observable at z&amp;gt;3 for the first time. We present a catalog of 1013 H{\alpha} emitters at 3.7&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6.7 in the GOODS fields obtained from a blind search in JWST NIRCam/grism data. We make use of the FRESCO survey's 124 arcmin^2 of observations in GOODS-North and GOODS-South with the F444W filter, probing H{\alpha} at 4.9&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6.7; and the CONGRESS survey's 62 arcmin^2 in GOODS-North with F356W, probing H{\alpha} at 3.8&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;5.1. We find an overdensity with 97 sources at z~4.4 in GOODS-N and confirm previously reported overdensities at z~5.2 in GOODS-N and at z~5.4 and z~5.9 in GOODS-S. We compute the observed H{\alpha} luminosity functions (LFs) in three bins centered at z~4.45, 5.30, and 6.15, which are the first such measurements at z&amp;gt;3 obtained based purely on spectroscopic data, robustly tracing galaxy star formation rates (SFRs) beyond the peak of the cosmic star formation history. We compare our results with theoretical predictions from three different simulations and find good agreement at z~4-6. The UV LFs of this spectroscopically-confirmed sample are in good agreement with pre-JWST measurements obtained with photometrically-selected objects. Finally, we derive SFR functions and integrate these to compute the evolution of the cosmic star-formation rate densities across z~4-6, finding values in good agreement with recent UV estimates from Lyman-break galaxies, which imply a continuous decrease in SFR density by a factor of 3x over z~4 to z~6. Our work shows the power of NIRCam grism observations to efficiently provide new tests for early galaxy formation models based on emission line statistics.

&lt;p&gt;
The carbon isotope ratio is a powerful tool for studying the evolution of stellar systems. Recent detections of CO isotopologues in disks and exoplanet atmospheres pointed towards significant fractionation in these systems. In order to understand the evolution of this quantity, it is crucial to trace the isotope abundance from stellar nurseries to planetary systems. During the protostellar stage the multiple vibrational modes of CO_2 and CO ice provide a unique opportunity to examine the carbon isotope ratio in the solid state. Now with the sensitivity of the \textit{James Webb Space Telescope}, these absorption features have become accessible at high S/N in Solar-mass systems. We quantify the ^{12}CO_2/^{13}CO_2 and the ^{12}CO/^{13}CO isotope ratios in 17 class 0/I low mass protostars from the ^{12}CO_2 combination modes (2.70 {&amp;mu;}m and 2.77 {&amp;mu;}m), the ^{12}CO_2 stretching mode (4.27 {&amp;mu;}m), the ^{13}CO_2 stretching mode (4.39 {&amp;mu;}m), the ^{12}CO_2 bending mode (15.2 {&amp;mu;}m), the ^{12}CO stretching mode (4.67 {&amp;mu;}m) and the ^{13}CO stretching mode (4.78 {&amp;mu;}m) using JWST observations. We also report a detection of the ^{12}CO overtone mode at 2.35 {&amp;mu;}m. The ^{12}CO_2/^{13}CO_2 ratios are in agreement and we find mean ratios of 85 \pm 23, 76 \pm 12 and 97 \pm 17 for the 2.70 {&amp;mu;}m, 4.27 {&amp;mu;}m and the 15.2 {&amp;mu;}m bands, respectively. The main source of uncertainty stem from the error on the band strengths. The ^{12}CO/^{13}CO ratios derived from the 4.67 {&amp;mu;}m bands are consistent, albeit elevated with respect to the ^{12}CO_2/^{13}CO_2 ratios and we find a mean ratio of 165 \pm 52. These findings indicate that ices leave the pre-stellar stage with elevated carbon isotope ratios relative to the interstellar medium and that fractionation becomes significant during the later stages.

&lt;p&gt;
A major unsolved problem in galaxy evolution is the early appearance of massive quiescent galaxies that no longer actively form stars only ~ 1 billion years after the Big Bang. Their high stellar masses and extremely compact structure indicate that they formed through rapid bursts of star formation between redshift z ~ 6-11. Theoretical models of galaxy evolution cannot explain their high number density, rapid growth and truncation of star formation at such early times, which likely requires extreme feedback to destroy the cold interstellar medium (the fuel for star formation). We report the discovery of a significant reservoir of hot dust in one of the most distant known examples at z = 4.658, GS-9209. The dust was identified using JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), whose unprecedented sensitivity and high spatial resolution, for the first time, firmly show that this dust is significantly more extended than the stars by \gtrsim 3 times. We find that the dust has preferentially been evacuated or diluted in the galaxy center. Our analysis finds that the extended hot dust emission is consistent with recent heating by a younger and more spatially extended generation of star formation. This reveals that the earliest quiescent galaxies did not form in a single rapid burst; instead, similar to galaxy growth at later times, the center formed first with star formation continuing in an extended envelope. The growth of this galaxy is truncating from the inside out, consistent with central gas depletion from early AGN feedback.

&lt;p&gt;
The abundance and blue color of super-early (redshift z&amp;gt;10), luminous galaxies discovered by JWST can be explained if radiation-driven outflows have ejected their dust on kpc-scales. To test this hypothesis, we predict the ALMA detectability of such extended dust component. Given the observed properties of the galaxy, its observed continuum flux at 88 &amp;mu;m, F_{88}, depends on the dust-to-stellar mass ratio, \xi_d, and extent of the dust distribution, r_d. Once applied to the most distant galaxy known, GS-z14-0 at z=14.32, the fiducial model (\xi_d = 1/529) predicts F_{88}^{\rm fid} = 14.9\, &amp;mu;Jy, and a dust extent r_d=1.4 kpc. If the galaxy is very dust-rich (\xi_d =1/40), F_{88}^{\rm max} = 40.1\, &amp;mu;Jy. These values are smaller (F_{88}^{\rm fid} = 9.5\, &amp;mu;Jy) if the dust is predominantly made of large grains as those formed in SN ejecta. Forthcoming ALMA observations might come very close to constraining the fiducial predictions of the outflow-based attenuation-free model. Other super-early galaxies are predicted to be fainter at 88 &amp;mu;m, mostly because of their lower SFR compared to GS-z14-0, with fiducial fluxes in the range 2-5.2\ &amp;mu;Jy.

&lt;p&gt;
We present the results of a James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam and NIRSpec investigation into the young massive star cluster (YMC) population of NGC 3256, the most cluster-rich luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG) in the Great Observatories All Sky LIRG Survey. We detect 3061 compact YMC candidates with a S/N \geq 3 at F150W, F200W, and F335M. Based on yggdrasil stellar population models, we identify 116/3061 sources with F150W - F200W &amp;gt; 0.47 and F200W - F355M &amp;gt; -1.37 colors suggesting they are young (t \leq 5 Myr), dusty (A_{V} = 5 - 15), and massive (M_{\odot} &amp;gt; 10^{5}). This increases the sample of dust-enshrouded YMCs detected in this system by an order of magnitude relative to previous HST studies. With NIRSpec IFU pointings centered on the northern and southern nucleus, we extract the Pa\alpha and 3.3&amp;mu;m PAH equivalent widths for 8 bright and isolated YMCs. Variations in both the F200W - F335M color and 3.3&amp;mu;m PAH emission with the Pa\alpha line strength suggest a rapid dust clearing (&amp;lt; 3 - 4 Myr) for the emerging YMCs in the nuclei of NGC 3256. Finally, with both the age and dust emission accurately measured we use yggdrasil to derive the color excess (E(B - V)) for all 8 YMCs. We demonstrate that YMCs with strong 3.3&amp;mu;m PAH emission (F200W - F335M &amp;gt; 0) correspond to sources with E(B - V) &amp;gt; 3, which are typically missed in UV-optical studies. This underscores the importance of deep near-infrared imaging for finding and characterizing these very young and dust-embedded sources.

&lt;p&gt;
We infer supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion rates and Eddington ratios as a function of SMBH/host galaxy mass and redshift with the empirical TRINITY model of dark matter halo--galaxy--SMBH connection. The galaxy--SMBH mass and growth rate connection from TRINITY is constrained by galaxy observables from 0&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;13 and SMBH observables from 0&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6.5. Key findings include: 1) the ratio between cosmic SMBH accretion rate and galaxy star formation rate stays constant at ~ 2\times 10^{-3} from z=0-4, and decreases by 2 orders of magnitude from z=4-10; 2) the average SMBH Eddington ratio \overline{\eta} increases towards higher redshifts, nearly reaching \overline{\eta}=1 at z~ 10; 3) at fixed redshift for z&amp;lt;3, SMBHs/galaxies with higher masses have lower \overline{\eta}, consistent with AGN downsizing; 4) the average ratio of specific SMBH accretion rate (\overline{\mathrm{SBHAR}}) to average specific star formation rate (\overline{\mathrm{SSFR}}) is nearly mass-independent, with a value \overline{\mathrm{SBHAR}}/\overline{\mathrm{SSFR}}~ 1, which decreases slightly from z=10 to z=0; 5) similar to galaxies, SMBHs reach their peak efficiency to convert baryons into mass when host halos reach 10^{12} M_\odot; 6) given galaxy and SMBH growth histories from TRINITY, the local descendants of 1&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;11 overmassive JWST AGNs will remain outliers from the local SMBH mass--galaxy mass relation. These findings combine to give a simple explanation for massive (10^9-10^{10}M_\odot) quasars at z&amp;gt;6: at these redshifts, dark matter halos experience ~Eddington specific growth rates, driving ~Eddington specific growth rates in both galaxies and SMBHs.

&lt;p&gt;
The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration measured a tight relation between the Hubble constant (H_0) and the distance to the Coma cluster using the fundamental plane (FP) relation of the deepest, most homogeneous sample of early-type galaxies. To determine H_0, we measure the distance to Coma by several independent routes each with its own geometric reference. We measure the most precise distance to Coma from 12 Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) in the cluster with mean standardized brightness of m_B^0=15.712\pm0.041 mag. Calibrating the absolute magnitude of SNe Ia with the HST distance ladder yields D_{\textrm Coma}=98.5\pm2.2 Mpc, consistent with its canonical value of 95--100 Mpc. This distance results in H_0=76.5 \pm 2.2 km/s/Mpc from the DESI FP relation. Inverting the DESI relation by calibrating it instead to the Planck+\LambdaCDM value of H_0=67.4 km/s/Mpc implies a much greater distance to Coma, D_{\textrm Coma}=111.8\pm1.8 Mpc, 4.6\sigma beyond a joint, direct measure. Independent of SNe Ia, the HST Key Project FP relation as calibrated by Cepheids, Tip of the Red Giant Branch from JWST, or HST NIR surface brightness fluctuations all yield D_{\textrm Coma}&amp;lt; 100 Mpc, in joint tension themselves with the Planck-calibrated route at &amp;gt;3\sigma. From a broad array of distance estimates compiled back to 1990, it is hard to see how Coma could be located as far as the Planck+\LambdaCDM expectation of &amp;gt;110 Mpc. By extending the Hubble diagram to Coma, a well-studied location in our own backyard whose distance was in good accord well before the Hubble Tension, DESI indicates a more pervasive conflict between our knowledge of local distances and cosmological expectations. We expect future programs to refine the distance to Coma and nearer clusters to help illuminate this new, local window on the Hubble Tension.

&lt;p&gt;
We analyze JWST MIRI/MRS IFU observations of three Seyferts and showcase the intriguing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission characteristics in regions of ~ 500\,\rm pc scales over or around their active galactic nuclei (AGN). Combining the model predictions and the measurements of PAH features and other infrared emission lines, we find that the central regions containing a high fraction of neutral PAHs with small sizes, e.g., those in ESO137-G034, are in highly heated environments, due to collisional shock heating, with hard and moderately intense radiation fields. Such environments are proposed to be associated with inhibited growth or preferential erosion of PAHs, decreasing the average PAH size and the overall abundance of PAHs. We additionally find that the central regions containing a high fraction of ionized PAHs with large sizes, e.g., those in MCG-05-23-016, are likely experiencing severe photo-ionization because of the radiative effects from the radiative shock precursor besides the AGN. The severe photo-ionization can contribute to the ionization of all PAHs and further destruction of small PAHs. Overall, different Seyferts, even different regions in the same galaxy, e.g., those in NGC\,3081, can contain PAH populations of different properties. Specifically, Seyferts that exhibit similar PAH characteristics to ESO137-G034 and MCG-05-23-016 also tend to have similar emission line properties to them, suggesting that the explanations for PAH characteristics of ESO137-G034 and MCG-05-23-016 may also apply generally. These results have promising application in the era of JWST, especially in diagnosing different (i.e., radiative, and kinetic) AGN feedback modes.

&lt;p&gt;
Hubble Space Telescope imaging shows that most star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon -- the peak of cosmic star formation history -- appear disk-dominated, leaving the origin of the dense cores in their quiescent descendants unclear. With the James Webb Space Telescope's (JWST) high-resolution imaging to 5 {&amp;mu;}m, we can now map the rest-frame near-infrared emission, a much closer proxy for stellar mass distribution, in these massive galaxies. We selected 70 star-forming galaxies with 10&amp;lt;log(M)&amp;lt;12 and 1.5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;3 in the CEERS survey and compare their morphologies in the rest-frame optical to those in the rest-frame near-IR. While the bulk of these galaxies are disk-dominated in 1.5 {&amp;mu;}m (rest-frame optical) imaging, they appear more bulge-dominated at 4.4 {&amp;mu;}m (rest-frame near-infrared). Our analysis reveals that in massive star-forming galaxies at z~2, the radial surface brightness profiles steepen significantly, from a slope of ~0.3/dex at 1.5 {&amp;mu;}m to ~1.4/dex at 4.4 {&amp;mu;}m within radii &amp;lt; 1 kpc. Additionally, we find their total flux contained within the central 1 kpc is approximately 7 times higher in F444W than in F150W. In rest-optical emission, a galaxy's central surface density appears to be the strongest indicator of whether it is quenched or star-forming. Our most significant finding is that at redder wavelengths, the central surface density ratio between quiescent and star-forming galaxies dramatically decreases from ~10 to ~1. This suggests the high central densities associated with galaxy quenching are already in place during the star-forming phase, imposing new constraints on the transition from star formation to quiescence.

We present a set of photometric catalogs primarily aimed at providing the community with a comprehensive database for the study of galaxy populations in the high redshift Universe. The set gathers data from eight JWST NIRCam observational programs, targeting the Abell 2744 (GLASS-JWST, UNCOVER, DDT2756 and GO3990), EGS (CEERS), COSMOS and UDS (PRIMER), and GOODS North and South (JADES and NGDEEP) deep fields, for a total area of ~0.2 sq. degrees. Photometric estimates are obtained by means of well-established techniques, including tailored improvements designed to enhance the performance on the specific dataset. We also include new measurements from HST archival data, thus collecting 16 bands spanning from 0.44 to 4.44 &amp;mu;m. A grand total of ~530 thousand sources is detected on stacks of NIRCam 3.56 and 4.44 &amp;mu;m mosaics. We assess the photometric accuracy by comparing fluxes and colors against archival catalogs. We also provide photometric redshift estimates, statistically validated against a large set of robust spectroscopic data. The catalogs are publicly available on the Astrodeep website.

The discovery and characterization of free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPMOs) is fundamental to our understanding of star and planet formation. Here we report results from an extremely deep spectroscopic survey of the young star cluster NGC1333 using NIRISS WFSS on the James Webb Space Telescope. The survey is photometrically complete to K~21, and includes useful spectra for objects as faint as K~20.5. The observations cover 19 known brown dwarfs, for most of which we confirm spectral types using NIRISS spectra. We discover six new candidates with L-dwarf spectral types that are plausible planetary-mass members of NGC1333, with estimated masses between 5-15 MJup. One, at ~5 MJup, shows clear infrared excess emission and is a good candidate to be the lowest mass object known to have a disk. We do not find any objects later than mid-L spectral type (M &amp;lt; ~4 MJup). The paucity of Jupiter-mass objects, despite the survey's unprecedented sensitivity, suggests that our observations reach the lowest mass objects formed like stars in NGC1333. Our findings put the fraction of FFPMOs in NGC1333 at ~10% of the number of cluster members, significantly more than expected from the typical log-normal stellar mass function. We also search for wide binaries in our images and report a young brown dwarf with a planetary-mass companion.

It is not straightforward to physically interpret the apparent morphology of galaxies. Recent observations by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) revealed a dominant galaxy population at high redshifts (z&amp;gt;2) that were visually classified as discs for their flattened shapes and/or exponential light profiles. The extensively accepted interpretation is that they are dynamically cold discs supported by bulk rotation. However, it is long known that flattened shapes and exponential profiles are not exclusive for rotating disc structure. To break degeneracy and assess the rotational support of typical high-z galaxies in the JWST samples, those with active star formation and stellar masses \mathrm{lg}(\mathcal{M}_{\star}/\mathcal{M}_{\odot})~9, we study the kinematics of their equal-mass counterparts at z=0. While these local star-forming low-mass galaxies are photometrically similar to real dynamically cold discs, they are not supported by ordered rotation but primarily by random motion, and their flattened shapes result largely from tangential orbital anisotropy. Given the empirical and theoretical evidence that young galaxies are dynamically hotter at higher redshifts, our results suggest that the high-z JWST galaxies may not be cold discs but are dynamically warm/hot galaxies with flattened shapes driven by anisotropy. While both having low rotational support, local low-mass galaxies possess oblate shapes, contrasting the prolate shapes (i.e. cigar-like) of low-mass systems at high redshifts. Such shape transition (prolate\Rightarrowoblate) indicates an associated change in orbital anisotropy (radial\Rightarrowtangential), with roots likely in the assembly of their host dark matter halos.

Integral field spectroscopy (IFS) is a powerful tool for understanding the formation of galaxies across cosmic history. We present the observing strategy and first results of MSA-3D, a novel JWST program using multi-object spectroscopy in a slit-stepping strategy to produce IFS data cubes. The program observed 43 normal star-forming galaxies at redshifts 0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 1.5, corresponding to the epoch when spiral thin-disk galaxies of the modern Hubble sequence are thought to emerge, obtaining kpc-scale maps of rest-frame optical nebular emission lines with spectral resolution R~eq2700. Here we describe the multiplexed slit-stepping method which is &amp;gt;15 times more efficient than the NIRSpec IFS mode for our program. As an example of the data quality, we present a case study of an individual galaxy at z=1.104 (stellar mass M_{*} = 10^{10.3}~M_{\odot}, star formation rate~=3~M_{\odot} yr^{-1}) with prominent face-on spiral structure. We show that the galaxy exhibits a rotationally supported disk with moderate velocity dispersion (\sigma = 36^{+5}_{-4}~\kms), a negative radial metallicity gradient (-0.020\pm0.002~dex\,kpc^{-1}), a dust attenuation gradient, and an exponential star formation rate density profile which closely matches the stellar continuum. These properties are characteristic of local spirals, indicating that mature galaxies are in place at z~1. We also describe the customized data reduction and original cube-building software pipelines which we have developed to exploit the powerful slit-stepping technique. Our results demonstrate the ability of JWST slit-stepping to study galaxy populations at intermediate to high redshifts, with data quality similar to current surveys of the z~0.1 universe.

Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered at redshift z\lesssim2.5 are presumed to be produced from Population (Pop) I/II stars. {In this work, we investigate the production of SNe Ia from Pop III binaries in the cosmological framework. We derive the SN Ia rate as a function of redshift under a theoretical context for the production of first generation stars and emanate the likelihood of their detection by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).} {Assuming the initial stellar mass function (IMF) favors low-mass stars as from recent numerical simulations, we found Pop III stars may give rise to a considerable amount of SNe Ia at high redshift and Pop III stars may even be the dominant SN Ia producer at z \gtrsim 6.} {In an optimistic scenario, we expect ~ 1(2) SNe Ia from Pop III stars at z\approx 4(5) for a survey of area 300 \;\rm arcmin^2 during a 3\;\rm yr period with JWST. The same survey may record more than ~ 400 SNe Ia at lower redshift (z\lesssim 2.5) but with only about one of them from Pop III progenitors. There will be ~ 6 Pop III SNe Ia in the same field of view at redshifts of 5-10.} Observational constraints on SN Ia rates at the redshift range of 5-10 can place crucial constraints on the IMF of Pop III stars.

JWST has revealed a population of low-luminosity AGN at z&amp;gt;4 in compact, red hosts (the "Little Red Dots", or LRDs), which are largely undetected in X-rays. We investigate this phenomenon using GRRMHD simulations of super-Eddington accretion onto a SMBH with M_\bullet=10^7 \,\rm M_\odot at z~6, representing the median population; the SEDs that we obtain are intrinsically X-ray weak. The highest levels of X-ray weakness occur in SMBHs accreting at mildly super-Eddington rates (1.4&amp;lt;f_{\rm Edd}&amp;lt;4) with zero spin, viewed at angles &amp;gt;30^\circ from the pole. X-ray bolometric corrections in the observed 2-10 keV band reach ~10^4 at z=6, ~5 times higher than the highest constraint from X-ray stacking. Most SEDs are extraordinarily steep and soft in the X-rays (median photon index \Gamma=3.1, mode of \Gamma=4.4). SEDs strong in the X-rays have harder spectra with a high-energy bump when viewed near the hot (&amp;gt;10^8 K) and highly-relativistic jet, whereas X-ray weak SEDs lack this feature. Viewing a SMBH within 10^\circ of its pole, where beaming enhances the X-ray emission, has a ~1.5&amp;percnt; probability, matching the LRD X-ray detection rate. Next-generation observatories like AXIS will detect X-ray weak LRDs at z~6 from any viewing angle. Although many SMBHs in the LRDs are already estimated to accrete at super-Eddington rates, our model explains 50&amp;percnt; of their population by requiring that their masses are overestimated by a mere factor of ~3. In summary, we suggest that LRDs host slowly spinning SMBHs accreting at mildly super-Eddington rates, with large covering factors and broad emission lines enhanced by strong winds, providing a self-consistent explanation for their X-ray weakness and complementing other models.

We present an [O/Fe] ratio of a luminous galaxy GN-z11 at z=10.60 derived with the deep public JWST/NIRSpec data. We fit the medium-resolution grating (G140M, G235M, and G395M) data with the model spectra consisting of BPASS-stellar and CLOUDY-nebular spectra in the rest-frame UV wavelength ranges with Fe absorption lines, carefully masking out the other emission and absorption lines in the same manner as previous studies conducted for lower redshift (z~ 2-6) galaxies with oxygen abundance measurements. We obtain an Fe-rich abundance ratio \mathrm{[O/Fe]}=-0.37^{+0.43}_{-0.22}, which is confirmed with the independent deep prism data as well as by the classic 1978 index method. This [O/Fe] measurement is lower than measured for star-forming galaxies at z~ 2-3. Because z=10.60 is an early epoch after the Big Bang (~ 430 Myr) and the first star formation (likely ~ 200 Myr), it is difficult to produce Fe by Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) requiring sufficient delay time for white-dwarf formation and gas accretion. The Fe-rich abundance ratio in GN-z11 suggests that the delay time is short, or that the major Fe enrichment is not accomplished by SNeIa but bright hypernovae (BrHNe) and/or pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), where the yield models of BrHNe and PISNe explain Fe, Ne, and O abundance ratios of GN-z11. The [O/Fe] measurement is not too low to rule out the connection between GN-z11 and globular clusters (GCs) previously suggested by the nitrogen abundance, but rather supports the connection with a GC population at high [N/O] if a metal dilution process exists.

Large area observations of extragalactic deep fields with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have provided a wealth of candidate low-mass L- and T-class brown dwarfs. The existence of these sources, which are at derived distances of hundreds of parsecs to several kiloparsecs from the Sun, has strong implications for the low-mass end of the stellar initial mass function, and the link between stars and planets at low metallicities. In this letter, we present a JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectrum of brown dwarf JADES-GS-BD-9, confirming its photometric selection from observations taken as part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program. Fits to this spectrum indicate that the brown dwarf has an effective temperature of 800-900K (T5 - T6) at a distance of 1.8 - 2.3kpc from the Sun, with evidence of the source being at low metallicity ([M/H] \leq -0.5). Finally, because of the cadence of JADES NIRCam observations of this source, we additionally uncover a proper motion between the 2022 and 2023 centroids, and we measure a proper motion of 20 \pm 4 mas yr^{-1} (a transverse velocity of 214 km s^{-1} at 2.25 kpc). At this predicted metallicity, distance, and transverse velocity, it is likely that this source belongs either to the edge of the Milky Way thick disk or the galactic halo. This spectral confirmation demonstrates the efficacy of photometric selection of these important sources across deep extragalactic JWST imaging.

JWST has discovered a large population of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) at high redshift. Many of these newly discovered AGN have broad permitted lines (typically H\alpha), but are extremely weak in the X-rays. Here we present the NIRSpec spectrum of the most extreme of these objects, GN-28074, an AGN at z=2.26 with prominent Balmer, Paschen and \HeI broad lines, and with the highest limit on the bolometric to X-ray luminosity ratio among all spectroscopically confirmed AGN in GOODS. This source is also characterized by a mid-IR excess, most likely associated with the AGN torus' hot dust. The high bolometric luminosity and moderate redshift of this AGN allow us to explore its properties more in depth relative to other JWST-discovered AGN. The NIRSpec spectrum reveals prominent, slightly blueshifted absorption of H\alpha, H\beta and \HeI\lambda10830. The Balmer absorption lines require gas with densities of n_{\rm H}&amp;gt; 10^8~{\rm cm}^{-3}, inconsistent with an ISM origin, but fully consistent with clouds in the Broad Line Region (BLR). This finding suggests that at least part of the X-ray weakness is due to high (Compton thick) X-ray absorption by (dust-free) clouds in the BLR, or in its outer, slowly outflowing regions. GN-28074 is also extremely radio-weak. The radio weakness can also be explained in terms of absorption, as the inferred density of the clouds responsible for H\alpha absorption makes them optically thick to radio emission through free-free absorption. Alternatively, in this and other JWST-discovered AGN, the nuclear magnetic field may have not developed properly yet, resulting both in intrinsically weak radio emission and also lack of hot corona, hence intrinsic X-ray weakness. Finally, we show that recently proposed scenarios, invoking hyper-dense and ultra-metal-poor outflows or Raman scattering to explain the broad H\alpha, are completely ruled out.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unearthed black holes as massive as 10^{6.2-8.1}M_\odot at redshifts of z ~ 8.5-10.6 with many systems showing unexpectedly high black hole to stellar mass ratios &amp;gt;=30%, posing a crucial challenge for theoretical models. Using analytic calculations, we explore the combination of {\it astrophysical} seeding mechanisms and Eddington accretion rates that can explain the observed objects. We then appeal to {\it cosmological} primordial black hole (PBH) seeds and show how these present an alternative path for "seeding" early structures and their baryonic contents. Assuming seeding (via astrophysical means) at a redshift of z_{\rm seed}=25 and continuous accretion, all of the black holes studied here can either be explained through super-Eddington accretion (at an Eddington fraction of f_{\rm Edd}&amp;lt;= 2.1 ) onto low-mass (100M_\odot) seeds or Eddington-limited accretion onto high-mass (10^5 M_\odot) seeds. The upper limit, where we assume a primordial origin for all of these black holes, yields a continuous primordial black hole mass function (between 10^{-5.25} and 10^{3.75} M_\odot) and a fractional PBH value &amp;lt;= 10^{-12}, in good agreement with observational constraints. Starting at the redshift of matter-radiation equality (z ~ 3400), we show how PBH-driven structure formation can reproduce the observed stellar and black hole masses for two of the highest redshift black holes (UHZ1 and GHZ9 at z ~ 10.3) with the same parameters governing star formation, black hole accretion and their feedbacks. Exploring a wide swathe of model parameter space for GHZ9, we find black hole-to-stellar mass ratios ranging between 0.1-1.86 i.e. in some cases (of high supernova feedback), the black hole grows to be more massive than the stellar mass of its host, presenting an attractive alternative to seeding these puzzling early systems.

The recent JWST observation of the Firefly Sparkle at z=8.3 offers a unique opportunity to link the high- and the low-z Universe. Indeed, the claim of it being a Milky Way (MW) type of assembly at the cosmic dawn opens the possibility of interpreting the observation with locally calibrated galaxy-formation models. Here, we use the MW-evolution model NEFERTITI to perform forward modeling of our Galaxy's progenitors at high-z. We build a set of mock spectra for the MW building blocks to make predictions for JWST and to interpret the Firefly Sparkle observation. First, we find that the most massive MW progenitor becomes detectable in a deep survey like JADES from z\approx 8.2, meaning that we could have already observed MW-analogs that still need interpretation. Second, we provide predictions for the number of detectable MW progenitors in lensed surveys like CANUCS, and interpret the Firefly Sparkle as a group of MW building blocks. Both the number of detections and the observed NIRCam photometry are consistent with our predictions. By identifying the MW progenitors whose mock photometry best fits the data, we find bursty and extended star-formation histories, lasting &amp;gt; 150-300~Myr, and estimate their properties: M_h \approx 10^{8-9} \, M_{\odot}, M_\star \approx 10^{6.2-7.5}\, M_{\odot}, SFR \approx 0.04-0.20 \, M_{\odot} yr^{-1} and Z_{gas} \approx 0.04 - 0.24 \, Z_{\odot}. Uncovering the properties of MW-analogs at cosmic dawn by combining JWST observations and locally-constrained models, will allow us to understand our Galaxy's formation, linking the high- and low-z perspectives.

Context. The recent detection of nitrogen-enhanced, metal-poor galaxies at high redshift by the James Webb Space Telescope has sparked renewed interest in exploring the chemical evolution of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen (the CNO elements) at early times, prompting fresh inquiries into their origins. Aims. The main goal of this paper is to shed light onto the early evolution of the main CNO isotopes in our Galaxy and in young distant systems, such as GN-z11 at z=10.6. Methods. To this aim, we incorporate a stochastic star-formation component into a chemical evolution model calibrated with high-quality Milky Way (MW) data, focusing on the contribution of Population III (Pop III) stars to the early chemical enrichment. Results. By comparing the model predictions with CNO abundance measurements from high-resolution spectroscopy of an homogeneous sample of Galactic halo stars, we first demonstrate that the scatter observed in the metallicity range -4.5 &amp;lt; [Fe/H] &amp;lt;-1.5 can be explained by pre-enrichment from Pop III stars that explode as supernovae (SNe) with different initial masses and energies. Then, by exploiting the chemical evolution model, we provide testable predictions for log(C/N), log(N/O), and log(C/O) vs. log(O/H)+12 in MW-like galaxies observed at different cosmic epochs/redshifts. Finally, by calibrating the chemical evolution model to replicate the observed properties of GN-z11, we provide an alternative interpretation of its log(N/O) abundance ratio, demonstrating that its high N content can be reproduced through enrichment from high-mass faint Pop III SNe. Conclusions. Stochastic chemical enrichment from primordial stars explains both the observed scatter in CNO abundances in MW halo stars and the exceptionally high N/O ratios in some distant galaxies. These findings emphasize the critical role of Pop III stars in shaping early chemical evolution.

Thanks to the successful performance of the James Webb Space Telescope, our understanding of the epoch of reionization of the Universe has been advanced. The ultraviolet luminosity functions (UV LFs) of galaxies span a wide range of redshift, not only revealing the connection between galaxies and dark matter (DM) halos but also providing the information during reionization. In this work, we develop a model connecting galaxy counts and apparent magnitude based on UV LFs, which incorporates redshift-dependent star formation efficiency (SFE) and corrections for dust attenuation. By synthesizing some observations across the redshift range 4\le z \le 10 from various galaxy surveys, we discern the evolving SFE with increasing redshift and DM halo mass through model fitting. Subsequent analyses indicate that the Thomson scattering optical depth was \tau_{\rm e} = 0.054^{+0.001}_{-0.003} and the epoch of reionization started (ended) at z=18.8^{+7.2}_{-6.0} (z=5.3^{+0.8}_{-1.0}) which is insensitive to the choice of the truncated magnitude of the UV LFs. Incorporating additional dataset and some reasonable constraints, the amplitude of matter perturbation is found to be \sigma_8=0.80\pm0.05, which is consistent with the standard \LambdaCDM model. Future galaxy surveys and the dynamical simulations of galaxy evolution will break the degeneracy between SFE and cosmological parameters, improving the accuracy and the precision of the UV LF model further.

&lt;p&gt;
We present the census of H\beta+[OIII] 4960,5008 &amp;#8491; emitters at 6.8&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;9.0 from the JWST FRESCO survey over 124 arcmin^2 in the GOODS-North and GOODS-South fields. Our unbiased spectroscopic search results in 137 spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at 6.8&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;9.0 with observed [OIII] fluxes f_{[OIII]}\gtrsim 1\times 10^{-18}\ \rm{ergs}\ \rm{s}^{-1} \ \rm{cm}^{-2}. The rest-frame optical line ratios of the median stacked spectrum (median M_{\rm{UV}}=-19.65^{+0.59}_{-1.05}) indicate negligible dust attenuation, low metallicity (12+\log(\rm{O/H})= 7.2-7.7) and a high ionisation parameter \log_{10}U ~eq -2.5. We find a factor \times 1.3 difference in the number density of 6.8&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;9.0 galaxies between GOODS-South and GOODS-North, which is caused by a single overdensity at 7.0&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;7.2 in GOODS-North. The bright end of the UV luminosity function of spectroscopically-confirmed [OIII] emitters is in good agreement with HST dropout-selected samples. Discrepancies between the observed [OIII] LF, [OIII]/UV ratio and [OIII] equivalent widths, and that predicted by theoretical models, suggest burstier star-formation histories and/or more heterogeneous metallicity and ionising conditions in z&amp;gt;7 galaxies. We report a rapid decline of the [OIII] luminosity density at z\gtrsim 6-7 which cannot be explained by the evolution of the cosmic star-formation rate density. Finally we find that FRESCO detects in only 2h galaxies likely accounting for ~ 10-20&amp;percnt; of the ionising budget at z=7-8 (assuming an escape fraction of 10%), raising the prospect of directly detecting a significant fraction of the sources of reionisation with JWST.

&lt;p&gt;
The James \ Webb \ Space \ Telescope \ (JWST) recently reported a large population of UV luminous galaxies at high redshifts, z &amp;gt; 10, as well as Lyman-\alpha emitting (LAE) galaxies out to z ~ 11. We use the observed UV luminosities along with a data-driven approach at lower redshifts to place constraints on the observability of the intergalactic Lyman-\alpha intensity, scattered in the form of Loeb-Rybicki haloes, during the pre-reionization and reionization epochs (z ~ 9-16). We forecast the sensitivity and resolution required to detect these intergalactic haloes, finding that individual haloes with LAE luminosities &amp;gt; 10^{43} ergs/s are detectable at a few sigma level at z \lesssim 9, while stacking of ~ 10 haloes is expected to result in detections out to z ~ 16. Finding these haloes is expected to shed light on the neutral intergalactic hydrogen during cosmic reionization.

&lt;p&gt;
We investigate the dynamics of GN-z11, a luminous galaxy at z=10.60, carefully analyzing the public deep integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data taken with JWST NIRSpec IFU. While the observations of the IFS data originally targeted a He II clump near GN-z11, we find that CIII]\lambda\lambda1907,1909 emission from ionized gas at GN-z11 is bright and spatially extended significantly beyond the point-spread function (PSF). The spatially extended CIII emission of GN-z11 shows a velocity gradient, red- and blue-shifted components in the north and south directions, respectively, which cannot be explained by the variation of [CIII]\lambda1907/CIII]\lambda1909 line ratios. Assuming the velocity gradient is produced by disk rotation, we perform forward modeling with GalPak^{3D}, including the effects of PSF smearing and line blending, and obtain a rotation velocity of v_{rot}=257^{+138}_{-117} km s^{-1}, a velocity dispersion of \sigma_v=91^{+18}_{-32} km s^{-1}, and a ratio of v_{rot}/\sigma_v=2.83^{+1.82}_{-1.41}. The v_{rot}/\sigma_v value would suggest a rotation-dominated disk existing at z&amp;gt;10 albeit with the large uncertainties. The rotation velocity agrees with those of numerical simulations predicting a rotating disk formed in the early universe under the condition of mass compaction and weak feedback. While the velocity gradient is consistent with the rotating disk solution, we recognize that galactic outflows can also explain the velocity gradient as well as the extended morphology and the high velocity dispersion found in the outskirt. Higher S/N and resolution data are necessary to conclude the physical origin of the velocity gradient in GN-z11.

JWST spectroscopy has revolutionized our understanding of galaxies in the early universe. Covering wavelengths up to 5.3\,{\rm &amp;mu; m}, NIRSpec can detect rest-frame optical emission lines H\alpha out to z = 7 and [O III] to z = 9.5. Observing these lines in more distant galaxies requires longer wavelength spectroscopy with MIRI. Here we present MIRI MRS IFU observations of the lensed galaxy merger MACS0647-JD at z = 10.165. With exposure times of 4.2 hours in each of two bands, we detect H\alpha at 9\sigma, [O III]\,\lambda5008 at 11\sigma, and [O III]\,\lambda4960 at 3\sigma. Combined with previously reported NIRSpec spectroscopy that yields seven emission lines including the auroral line [O III]\,\lambda4363, we present the first direct metallicity measurement of a z &amp;gt; 10 galaxy: 12+{\rm log(O/H)}= 7.79\pm0.09, or 0.13^{+0.02}_{-0.03}\,Z_{\odot}. This is similar to galaxies at z ~ 4 - 9 with direct metallicity measurements, though higher than expected given the high specific star formation rate {\rm log(sSFR / yr^{-1})} = -7.4 \pm 0.3. We further constrain the ionization parameter {\rm log}(U) = -1.9 \pm 0.1, ionizing photon production efficiency {\rm log}(\xi_{\rm ion}) = 25.3\pm0.1, and star formation rate 5.0\pm0.6\,M_{\odot}/{\rm yr} within the past 10\,{\rm Myr}. These observations demonstrate the combined power of JWST NIRSpec and MIRI for studying galaxies in the first 500 million years.

&lt;p&gt;
Data from the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed an intriguing population of bright galaxies at high redshifts. In this work, we use extreme-value statistics to calculate the distribution (in UV magnitude) of the brightest galaxies in the redshift range 9 \lesssim z \lesssim 16. We combine the Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) approach with modelling of the galaxy luminosity function. We obtain predictions of the brightest galaxies for a suite of luminosity functions, including the Schechter and double power law functions, as well as a model parametrised by the stellar formation efficiency f_*. We find that the JWST data is broadly consistent with f_* of 5&amp;percnt;-10&amp;percnt;, and that the brightest galaxy at z~16 will have M_{\rm UV}\approx -23.5^{0.8}_{0.4}. If f_* is dependent on halo mass, we predict M_{\rm UV}\approx -22.5^{0.5}_{1.5} for such an object. We show that extreme-value statistics not only predicts the magnitude of the brightest galaxies at high redshifts, but may also be able to distinguish between models of star formation in high-redshift galaxies.

&lt;p&gt;
Within the established framework of structure formation, galaxies start as systems of low stellar mass and gradually grow into far more massive galaxies. The existence of massive galaxies in the first billion years of the Universe, suggested by recent observations, appears to challenge this model, as such galaxies would require highly efficient conversion of baryons into stars. An even greater challenge in this epoch is the existence of massive galaxies that have already ceased forming stars. However, robust detections of early massive quiescent galaxies have been challenging due to the coarse wavelength sampling of photometric surveys. Here we report the spectroscopic confirmation with the James Webb Space Telescope of the quiescent galaxy RUBIES-EGS-QG-1 at redshift z=4.90, 1.2 billion years after the Big Bang. Deep stellar absorption features in the spectrum reveal that the galaxy's stellar mass of 10^{11}\,M_\odot, corroborated by the mass implied by its gas kinematics, formed in a short 200\,Myr burst of star formation, after which star formation activity dropped rapidly and persistently. According to current galaxy formation models, systems with such rapid stellar mass growth and early quenching are too rare to plausibly occur in the small area probed spectroscopically with JWST. Instead, the discovery of RUBIES-EGS-QG-1 implies that early massive quiescent galaxies can be quenched earlier or exhaust gas available for star formation more efficiently than currently assumed.

We describe new ultra-deep James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec PRISM and grating spectra for the galaxies JADES-GS-z11-0 (z_{\mathrm{spec}} = 11.122^{+0.005}_{-0.003}) and JADES-GS-z13-0 (z_{\mathrm{spec}} = 13.20^{+0.03}_{-0.04}), the most distant spectroscopically-confirmed galaxy discovered in the first year of JWST observations. The extraordinary depth of these observations (75 hours and 56 hours, respectively) provides a unique opportunity to explore the redshifts, stellar properties, UV magnitudes, and slopes for these two sources. For JADES-GS-z11-0, we find evidence for multiple emission lines, including [\ion{O}{2}]\lambda\lambda3726,3729&amp;#8491; and [\ion{Ne}{3}]\lambda3869&amp;#8491;, resulting in a spectroscopic redshift we determine with 94&amp;percnt; confidence. We present stringent upper limits on the emission line fluxes and line equivalent widths for JADES-GS-z13-0. At this spectroscopic redshift, the Lyman-\alpha break in JADES-GS-z11-0 can be fit with a damped Lyman-\alpha absorber with \log{(N_\mathrm{HI}/\mathrm{cm}^{-2})} = 22.42^{+0.093}_{-0.120}. These results demonstrate how neutral hydrogen fraction and Lyman-damping wings may impact the recovery of spectroscopic redshifts for sources like these, providing insight into the overprediction of the photometric redshifts seen for distant galaxies observed with JWST. In addition, we analyze updated NIRCam photometry to calculate the morphological properties of these resolved sources, and find a secondary source 0.3^{\prime\prime} south of JADES-GS-z11-0 at a similar photometric redshift, hinting at how galaxies grow through interactions in the early Universe.

We report the chemical abundance pattern of GS\_3073, a galaxy at z=5.55 which was previously confirmed to host an overmassive active black hole, by leveraging the detection of about 40 emission lines, combining JWST/NIRSpec observations and ground-based (VLT/VIMOS) data. Based on the rest-frame UV emission lines, which trace high-density (~ 10^5~{\rm cm}^{-3}) and highly ionized gas, we derived an abundance ratio of \rm log(N/O) = 0.42^{+0.13}_{-0.10}. At an estimated metallicity of 0.2~Z_{\odot}, this is the most extreme nitrogen-rich object found by JWST thus far. In comparison, the relative carbon abundance derived from the rest-frame UV emission lines is \rm log(C/O) = -0.38^{+0.13}_{-0.11}, which is not significantly higher than those in local galaxies and stars with similar metallicities. We also found potential detection of coronal lines including [FeVII]\lambda 6087 and [FeXIV]\lambda 5303, both blended with [CaV]. We inferred a range of Fe abundances compatible with those in local stars and galaxies. Overall, the chemical abundance pattern of GS\_3073 is compatible with enrichment by super-massive stars with M_* \gtrsim 1000~M_\odot, asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, or Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Interestingly, when using optical emission lines which trace lower density (~ 10^3~{\rm cm}^{-3}) and lower ionization gas, we found a sub-solar N/O ratio. We interpret the difference in N/O derived from UV lines and optical lines as evidence for a stratified system, where the inner and denser region is both more chemically enriched and more ionized. Taking this luminous, well-studied system as a benchmark, our results suggest that nitrogen loudness in high-z galaxies is confined to the central, dense, and highly ionized region of the galaxies, while the bulk of the galaxies evolves more normally.

&lt;p&gt;
Recent observations from the EIGER JWST program have measured for the first time the quasar-galaxy cross-correlation function at z\approx6. The auto-correlation function of faint z\approx6 quasars was also recently estimated. These measurements provide key insights into the properties of quasars and galaxies at high redshift and their relation with the host dark matter halos. In this work, we interpret these data building upon an empirical quasar population model that has been applied successfully to quasar clustering and demographic measurements at z\approx2-4. We make use of a new, large-volume N-body simulation with more than a trillion particles, FLAMINGO-10k, to model quasars and galaxies simultaneously. We successfully reproduce observations of z\approx6 quasars and galaxies (i.e., their clustering properties and luminosity functions), and infer key quantities such as their luminosity-halo mass relation, the mass function of their host halos, and their duty cycle/occupation fraction. Our key findings are: (i) quasars reside on average in \approx10^{12.5}\,{\rm M}_\odot halos (corresponding to \approx5\sigma fluctuations in the initial conditions of the linear density field), but the distribution of host halo masses is quite broad; (ii) the duty cycle of (UV-bright) quasar activity is relatively low (\approx1&amp;percnt;); (iii) galaxies (that are bright in [OIII]) live in much smaller halos (\approx10^{10.9}\,{\rm M}_\odot) and have a larger duty cycle (occupation fraction) of \approx13&amp;percnt;. Finally, we focus on the inferred properties of quasars and present a homogeneous analysis of their evolution with redshift. The picture that emerges reveals a strong evolution of the host halo mass and duty cycle of quasars at z\approx2-6, and calls for new investigations of the role of quasar activity across cosmic time.

We study the reionization of the Universe due to haloes that host galaxies undergoing bursts of star formation. By comparing the recent results from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation EAGLE at z\ge 6, we find that bursty galaxies have specific star formation rate, sSFR &amp;gt;10^{-2} Myr^{-1}, and magnitude, M_{\rm UV}\leq -17. Most of them reside in haloes of mass ~ 10^9 M_\odot and some in more massive haloes. We then construct the models of escape fraction and find that a skewed Gaussian function with a flat tail towards the high mass end best describes the mean dependence of escape fraction on halo mass, considering the haloes hosting bursty galaxies as the primary drivers of reionization. We implement the models of escape fraction in the code 21cmFAST to study the progress of reionization and derive the evolution of the mean ionized fraction that agrees well with observations. We also calculate the brightness temperature, spin temperature, and kinetic temperature and further study the spatial fluctuations in these quantities to gain insights into the progress of reionization. We compute the 21 cm power spectrum and predict a peak in power at 180 MHz corresponding to redshift, z\approx 6.8, that is testable by the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Our findings suggest that the Universe was reionized by the haloes of \gtrsim 10^{9} M_\odot.

The Near-infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on the James Webb Space Telescope is uniquely suited to studying galaxies in the distant Universe with its combination of multi-object capabilities and sensitivity over a large range in wavelength (0.6-5.3 microns). Here we present the NIRSpec Wide survey, part of the NIRSpec Instrument Science Team's Guaranteed Time Observations, using NIRSpec's microshutter array to obtain spectra of more than 3200 galaxies at z&amp;gt;1 at both low- and high-resolution (R\approx100 and 2700) for a total of 105 hours. With 31 pointings covering \approx320 arcmin^2 across the five CANDELS fields with exquisite ancillary photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope, the NIRSpec Wide survey represents a fast and efficient way of using JWST to probe galaxies in the early Universe. Pointing centers are determined to maximize the observability of the rarest, high-value sources. Subsequently, the microshutter configurations are optimized to observe the maximum number of "census" galaxies with a selection function based primarily on HST/F160W magnitude, photometric/slitless grism redshift, and predicted \ha\ flux tracing the bulk of the galaxy population at cosmic noon (z_{\rm med}=2.0). We present details on the survey strategy, the target selection, an outline of the motivating science cases, and discuss upcoming public data releases to the community.

We present the High-z Evolution of Large and Luminous Objects (HELLO) project, a set of ~\!30 high-resolution cosmological simulations aimed to study Milky Way analogues (M_\star~10^{10-11}\,\Msun) at high redshift (z~ [2-4]). Based on the Numerical Investigation of a Hundred Astrophysical Objects (NIHAO), HELLO features an updated scheme for chemical enrichment and the addition of local photoionization feedback. Independently of redshift and mass, our galaxies exhibit a smooth progression along the star formation main sequence until M_\star ~\!10^{10.5}, around which our sample at z ~ 4 remains mostly unperturbed while the most massive galaxies at z ~ 2 reach their peak star formation rate (SFR) and its subsequent decline, due to a mix of gas consumption and stellar feedback. While AGN feedback remains subdominant with respect to stellar feedback for energy deposition, its localised nature likely adds to the physical processes leading to declining SFRs. The phase in which a galaxy in our mass range can be found at a given redshift is set by its gas reservoir and assembly history. Finally, our galaxies are in excellent agreement with various scaling relations observed with the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} and the \textit{James Webb Space Telescope}, and hence can be used to provide the theoretical framework to interpret current and future observations from these facilities and shed light on the transition from star-forming to quiescent galaxies.

Gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters involves hundreds of galaxies over a large redshift range and increases the likelihood of rare phenomena (supernovae, dark substructures, etc.). We present the detailed analysis of \elanz, a prominent quintuply imaged dusty star-forming galaxy (\zs=2.29), mainly lensed by three members of the massive galaxy cluster ACT-CL\,J0102-4915, also known as \elgor (z_{\rm d}=0.87). We leverage JWST/NIRCam images, which contain lensing features that were unseen in previous HST images, using a Bayesian, multi-wavelength, differentiable and GPU-accelerated modeling framework that combines \herculens (lens modeling) and \nifty (field model and inference) software packages. For one of the deflectors, we complement lensing constraints with stellar kinematics measured from VLT/MUSE data. In our lens model, we explicitly include the mass distribution of the cluster, locally corrected by a constant shear field. We find that the two main deflectors (L1 and L2) have logarithmic mass density slopes steeper than isothermal, with \gamma_{\rm L1} = 2.23\pm0.05 and \gamma_{\rm L2} = 2.21\pm0.04. We argue that such steep density profiles can arise due to tidally truncated mass distributions, which we probe thanks to the cluster lensing boost and the strong asymmetry of the lensing configuration. Moreover, our three-dimensional source model captures most of the surface brightness of the lensed galaxy, revealing a clump with a maximum diameter of 400 parsecs at the source redshift, visible at wavelengths \lambda_{\rm rest}\gtrsim0.6 &amp;mu;m. Finally, we caution on using point-like features within extended arcs to constrain galaxy-scale lens models before securing them with extended arc modeling.

The analysis of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data acquired by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the large-scale (\ell\lesssim1300) Planck Telescope show a preference for the Early Dark Energy (EDE) theory, which was set to alleviate the Hubble tension of the \Lambda Cold Dark Matter (\LambdaCDM) model by decreasing the sound horizon r_{s}, and gives H_{0} \approx 72 km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}. However, the EDE model is commonly questioned for exacerbating the \sigma_8 tension on top of the \LambdaCDM model, and its lack of preference from the late-time matter power spectrum observations, e.g., Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). In light of the current obscurities, we inspect if the high redshift galaxy abundance, i.e., Stellar Mass Function/Density (SMF/SMD) and Luminosity Function (LF), can independently probe the EDE model. Our result shows that, compared to \LambdaCDM, the EDE model prediction at z&amp;gt;10 displays better consistency with the unexpectedly high results observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). At lower redshift, the EDE model only fits the most luminous/massive end, with the majority of the data presenting better consistency with \LambdaCDM, implying that adding an extra luminosity/mass-sensitive suppression mechanism of the galaxy formation is required for EDE to explain all data around z~7-10.

We demonstrate that enhanced early galaxy formation can generically arise in axion-like particle (ALP) dark matter (DM) models with a delayed onset of axion field oscillation. In these models, the formation of localized massive objects enhances structure formation, potentially addressing the excess recently observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), while remaining consistent with existing constraints. We identify viable parameter space with the ALP mass in the range of 10^{-22}~{\rm eV}&amp;lt;m_a&amp;lt;10^{-19}~\rm eV. In addition, we show that the ALP parameter regions of interest can lead to intriguing complementary signatures in the small-scale structure of DM halos and existing experimental searches for ALPs.

We present a spatially resolved study of stellar populations in 6 galaxies with stellar masses M_*~10^{10}M_\odot at z~3.7 using 14-filter JWST/NIRCam imaging from the JADES and JEMS surveys. The 6 galaxies are visually selected to have clumpy substructures with distinct colors over rest-frame 3600-4100\r{A}, including a red, dominant stellar core that is close to their stellar-light centroids. With 23-filter photometry from HST to JWST, we measure the stellar-population properties of individual structural components via SED fitting using Prospector. We find that the central stellar cores are \gtrsim2 times more massive than the Toomre mass, indicating they may not form via single in-situ fragmentation. The stellar cores have stellar ages of 0.4-0.7 Gyr that are similar to the timescale of clump inward migration due to dynamical friction, suggesting that they likely instead formed through the coalescence of giant stellar clumps. While they have not yet quenched, the 6 galaxies are below the star-forming main sequence by 0.2-0.7 dex. Within each galaxy, we find that the specific star formation rate is lower in the central stellar core, and the stellar-mass surface density of the core is already similar to quenched galaxies of the same masses and redshifts. Meanwhile, the stellar ages of the cores are either comparable to or younger than the extended, smooth parts of the galaxies. Our findings are consistent with model predictions of the gas-rich compaction scenario for the buildup of galaxies' central regions at high redshifts. We are likely witnessing the coeval formation of dense central cores, along with the onset of galaxy-wide quenching at z&amp;gt;3.

Dark Energy is the largest fraction of the energy density of our Universe - yet it remains one of the enduring enigmas of our times. Here we show that Dark Energy can be used to solve 2 tantalizing mysteries of the observable universe. We build on existing models of Dark Energy linked to neutrino masses. In these models Dark Energy can undergo Phase Transitions and form Black Holes. Here we look at the implications of the family structure of neutrinos for the phase transitions in dark energy and associated peaks in black hole formation. It has been previously shown that one of these peaks in Black Hole formation is associated with the observed peak in Quasar formation. Here, we predict that there will also be an earlier peak in the Dark Energy Black Holes at high redshifts. These Dark Energy Black Holes formed at high redshifts are Intermediate Mass Black Holes (IMBHs).These Dark Energy Black Holes at large redshift can help explain both the EDGES observations and the observations of large Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs) at redshifts z ~ 7. The existence of an earlier phase of Dark Energy Black Holes take care of some current challenges to theory implied by existing astronomical data and also helps us look for these Dark Energy Black Holes at high redshifts as predicted here through targeted searches for these Black Holes at the redshifts z ~ 18. There is a slight dependence of the location of the peak on the lightest neutrino mass - so the peak may be located at a slightly lower value of the redshift. This may actually enable a measurement of the lightest neutrino mass. Finding these Dark Energy Black Holes of Intermediate Mass should be within the reach of upcoming observations - particularly with the James Webb Space Telescope - but perhaps also through the use of other innovative techniques focusing specifically on the redshifts around z ~ 18.
