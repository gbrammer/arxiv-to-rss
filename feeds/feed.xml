&lt;p&gt;
We analyze 23 spectroscopically confirmed Type-2 quasars (QSOs) selected from the WISE 22\rm &amp;mu;m band in the SDSS Stripe 82 region, focusing on their multi-band photometry and spectral energy distributions (SEDs). These objects were selected to be IR-luminous (\rm flux_{W4} &amp;gt; 5mJy, i.e., 12.62 &amp;lt; W4 &amp;lt; 14.62 \rm\ AB \, magnitude), optically faint (r &amp;gt; 23) or with red color (r - W4 &amp;gt;8.38). Gemini/GNIRS observations were conducted for all 24 candidates, and 18/24 were also observed with Keck/LRIS. The observations confirm 23 to be real Type-2 QSOs in the redshift range 0.88 - 2.99 (12 are at z&amp;gt;2). We collect multi-band photometry and conduct SED fitting. The composite photometry probes the wavelength from 0.1\rm &amp;mu;m to 10\rm &amp;mu;m at the rest frame. The IR emission is dominated by dust torus implying an average torus luminosity for the sample of L_{\rm torus} 10^{46.84} \rm erg/s. The origin of the rest-UV/optical light is not definitive, but we present three possible scenarios: scattered light, stellar emission, and the reddened accretion disk. Assuming an obscured:unobscured ratio of approximately 1:1, our targets have L_{\rm bol} = 10^{46.28} \rm erg \,s^{-1} - 10^{47.49} \rm erg \,s^{-1} and around SMBH masses \rm 10^{8.18} M_{\odot} - 10^{9.39} M_{\odot}, assuming they accreate at the Eddington limit. Compared to previous Type-2 AGN SEDs, our targets have a brighter dust torus and redder optical-IR color. By comparing the SED to the results from JWST `little red dots' (LRDs), we find that these IR-selected Type-2 QSOs have similar SED shapes to the LRDs. This pilot Type-2 QSO survey demonstrates that mid-IR selection is an efficient way to find luminous Type-2 QSOs at z&amp;gt;2. Finally, the composite photometry and Type-2 QSOs SED model generated by this sample provide a guide for finding more Type-2 QSOs at higher redshift.

&lt;p&gt;
The Lyman Alpha damping wing is seen in absorption against the spectra of high-redshift galaxies. Modeling of this wing is a way to measure the volume neutral hydrogen fraction of the Universe, as well as to measure the strength of HI absorption in the form of a damped Ly{\alpha} absorber (DLA). We use very high-quality ultraviolet spectra of low-z galaxies to create mock high-redshift, low-resolution spectra complete with a damping wing resulting from the IGM and HI absorption from local, dense gas to mimic current James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of the early universe. The simulated spectra are used to test the ability to recover the "true" values of the column density of the DLA (N_DLA) and the volume neutral hydrogen fraction (x_HI) of the IGM through modified stellar continuum fitting. We find that the ability to recover the true values of N_DLA and x_HI simultaneously is compromised by degeneracies between these two parameters, and the spectral shape itself at low-resolution (R~100). The root mean squared error between the recovered and true column density of the DLAs is on the order of 1 dex. This error somewhat decreases with improved resolution (R~1000), but systematically underestimates N_DLA when Ly{\alpha} emission is present in the mock spectra. The recovered values of x_HI are poorly constrained and do not improve substantially with the higher resolution. We recommend accounting for these sources of uncertainty and biases when using galaxies' Ly{\alpha} damping wings to measure the intergalactic neutral hydrogen fraction.

&lt;p&gt;
Recent observations from JWST have revealed an abundant population of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and so-called ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) at 2\lesssim z \lesssim 11, many of which are characterized by V-shaped UV-to-optical continua with turnovers around the Balmer limit. The physical nature of these LRDs is unclear, and it remains debated whether the peculiar spectral shape originates from AGN, compact galaxies, or both. We present the analysis of new NIRSpec-IFU data from the BlackTHUNDER JWST Large Programme and archival NIRSpec-MSA data of a lensed LRD at z=7.04. The spectra confirm the presence of a smooth Balmer break and a broad H\beta tracing the Broad Line Region (BLR) of an AGN. The small velocity dispersion of the H\beta narrow component indicates a small dynamical mass of the host galaxy of M_{\rm dyn}&amp;lt;4 \times 10^8~M_{\odot}, which implies that the stellar population cannot contribute more than 10% to the optical continuum. We show that the Balmer break can be well described by an AGN continuum absorbed by very dense (n_{\rm H}~ 10^{10}~{\rm cm^{-3}}) and nearly dust-free gas along our line-of-sight (possibly gas in the BLR or its surrounding). The same gas is expected to produce H\beta absorption, at a level consistent with a tentative detection (3\sigma) in the high-resolution spectrum. Such a non-stellar origin of the Balmer break may apply to other LRDs, and would alleviate the issue of extremely high stellar mass surface densities inferred in the case of a stellar interpretation of the Balmer break. We note that this is a rare case of a black hole that is overmassive relative to both the host galaxy stellar and dynamical masses. We finally report indications of variability and the first attempt of AGN reverberation mapping at such an early epoch.

&lt;p&gt;
X-ray observations of the optically selected z=6.025 QSO CFHQS J164121+375520 (hereafter J1641) revealed that its flux dropped by a factor \gtrsim7 from 2018, when it was a bright and soft X-ray source, to 2021. Such a strong variability amplitude has not been observed before among z&amp;gt;6 QSOs, and the underlying physical mechanism was unclear. We carried out a new X-ray and rest-frame UV monitoring campaign of J1641 over 2022-2024. We detected J1641 with Chandra in the 2-7 keV band, while no significant emission is detected at softer X-ray energies, making J1641 an X-ray changing look QSO at z&amp;gt;6. Comparing with the 2018 epoch, the 0.5-2 keV flux dropped dramatically by a factor &amp;gt;20. We ascribe this behaviour to intervening, and still ongoing, obscuration by Compton-thick gas intercepting our line of sight between 2018 and 2021. The screening material could be an inner disk or a failed nuclear wind that increased their thickness. Another possibility is that we have witnessed an occultation event due to dust-free clouds located at sub-pc/pc scales, similar to those recently invoked to explain the remarkable X-ray weakness of AGN discovered by JWST. These interpretations are also consistent with the lack of strong variations of the QSO rest-frame UV lightcurve over the same period. Future monitoring of J1641 and the possible discovery of other X-ray changing look QSOs at z&amp;gt;6 will provide us with precious information about the physics of rapid supermassive black-hole growth at high redshift.

&lt;p&gt;
We present the first interferometric imaging of molecular line emission from the Ring Nebula, NGC~6720, in the form of Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations of CO J=2\rightarrow 1 emission. The SMA ^{12}CO(2--1) mapping data, with ~3'' spatial resolution and 2 km s^{-1} velocity resolution, provide an unprecedentedly detailed, 3D view of the Ring's clumpy molecular envelope. The morphology of the velocity-integrated SMA ^{12}CO(2--1) image closely resembles those of near-IR H_2 and PAH emission in JWST/NIRCam imaging of NGC~6720, with the molecular gas forming a geometrically thin layer surrounding the ionized gas imaged by HST and JWST. A simple, geometrical model of the ^{12}CO(2--1) data shows that the intrinsic structure of NGC~6720's molecular envelope closely resembles a truncated, triaxial ellipsoid that is viewed close to pole-on, and that the dynamical age of the molecular envelope is ~6000 yr. The SMA ^{12}CO(2--1) data furthermore reveal that filamentary features seen projected in the Ring's interior in JWST imaging are in fact fast-moving polar knots or bullets with radial velocities of \pm45--50 km s^{-1} relative to systemic, and that the hot progenitor star remnant is positioned at the precise geometric center of the clumpy, ellipsoidal molecular shell. We assert that the Ring's molecular envelope was formed via a relatively sudden, AGB-terminating mass ejection event ~6000 yr ago, and that this ellipsoidal envelope was then punctured by fast, collimated polar outflows resulting from interactions between the progenitor and one or more companion stars. Such an evolutionary scenario may describe most molecule-rich, ``Ring-like'' planetary nebulae.

&lt;p&gt;
We use the inertial-inflow model of massive star formation to describe the formation of globular clusters (GCs) in turbulent molecular clouds. A key aspect of this model is that the maximum stellar mass scales linearly with cloud mass, such that extremely massive stars (EMSs, 10^{3-4}\,{\rm M}_\odot) form in massive GCs (\gtrsim10^5\,M_\odot). The total wind mass loss is dominated by accreting EMSs (aEMSs), whose wind mass-loss rates become comparable to their accretion rates (\gtrsim10^{-2}\,{\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}). These winds pollute the intra-cluster medium with hot-hydrogen burning yields during GC formation. We propose a parameterised model for the evolution of the stellar mass function during GC formation (~ 1-2\,{\rm Myr}), accounting for gas inflow, wind mass loss and mixing of aEMS yields with pristine gas that has initial proto-GC abundances. Low-mass stars (\lesssim1\,{\rm M}_\odot) form continuously from this mixed gas and their abundances resemble observed abundance trends with GC mass and metallicity, specifically: (i) the helium spread in a typical GC is small (\Delta Y ~eq 0.01) and increases with GC mass; (ii) the fraction of polluted stars increases with GC mass and metallicity; (iii) the extent of the Mg-Al anticorrelations is more pronounced in metal-poor and massive GCs. We conclude that GCs formed with a population of EMSs, that may leave behind black holes with masses above the pair-instability gap (\gtrsim120\,{\rm M}_\odot) and that the nitrogen-rich galaxies found by the James Webb Space Telescope ({\it JWST}) are in the first phase of galaxy evolution, when a large fraction of star formation occurs in the form of GCs.

&lt;p&gt;
Context. The UVJ color-color diagram is a widely used diagnostic to separate star-forming and quiescent galaxies. Observational data from photometric surveys reveal a strong stellar mass trend, with higher-mass star-forming galaxies being systematically more dust-reddened. Aims. We analyze the UVJ diagram in the TNG100 cosmological simulation at cosmic noon (z\approx2). Specifically, we focus on the trend between UVJ colors and mass which has so far not been reproduced in any cosmological simulation. Methods. We apply the SKIRT dust radiative transfer code to the TNG100 simulation to generate rest-frame UVJ fluxes. These UVJ colors are then compared to observational data from several well-studied extragalactic fields from the CANDELS/3D-HST programs, augmented by recent JWST/NIRCam photometry. Results. Quiescent and low-mass (M_\star\lesssim10^{10.5}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot) galaxies at cosmic noon do not require significant levels of dust reddening, as opposed to massive (M_\star\gtrsim10^{11}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot) star-forming galaxies. An extensive range of possible dust models fall short of the required dust reddening in V-J color for massive star-forming galaxies, with the simulated galaxies being too blue by \approx0.9\,\mathrm{mag}. Conclusions. We find that only variations in the star-to-dust geometries of the simulated galaxies can yield V-J colors that are red enough to match the observations. A toy model with isolated dust screens around younger stellar populations (with ages below ~1\,\mathrm{Gyr}) can reproduce the observational data, while all conventional dust radiative transfer models (where the dust distribution follows the metals in the interstellar medium) fail to achieve the required V-J colors.

We present new JWST NIRSpec integral field unit (IFU) G395H/F290LP observations of a merging galaxy system at z=7.88, part of A2744-z7p9, the most distant protocluster to date. The IFU cube reveals [OIII] emissions in two previously known galaxies (ZD3 and ZD6) and a newly identified galaxy, ZD12, at z_{\rm spec}=7.8762. One of the detected \oiii-emitting regions has a detection of the auroral [OIII]4363, line, allowing us to derive a direct metallicity of \log(O/H)+12=7.4\pm0.2, while metallicities in other regions are measured using strong line calibration methods. We find large deviations within the measured metallicity (\Delta \log {\rm (O/H)}~1), which suggests a fast chemical enrichment from intense star formation and merger-driven growth, as expected in early galaxies. Our analysis shows that metal-poor regions could easily be outshone by more enriched regions, posing a challenge for spectroscopic analysis based on integrated light (i.e., NIRSpec MSA) against identifying metal-free star formation in the early universe. NIRCam imaging reveals seven UV-bright clumps in ZD12, in the range of stellar mass \log M_*/M_\odot~7.6--8.9. Four of them are unresolved (&amp;lt; 100pc) and intensely star-forming (&amp;gt;30 M_\odot {\rm yr^{-1} kpc^{-2}}), likely contributing to the scatter in metallicity by producing an ideal environment for rapid chemical cycles. Lastly, we revisit the nature of the host protocluster by including new member galaxies identified here and in the literature, and obtain local overdensity factor \delta=44_{-31}^{+89}, total halo mass M_{\rm h} = 5.8_{-0.3}^{+0.2}\times10^{11}\,M_\odot, and a formal velocity dispersion of 1100\pm500 km s^{-1}.

JWST provides a unique dataset to study reionization's earliest stages, promising insights into the first galaxies. Many JWST/NIRSpec prism spectra reveal smooth Lyman-alpha breaks in z&amp;gt;5 galaxies, implying damping wing scattering by neutral hydrogen. We investigate what current prism spectra imply about the intergalactic medium (IGM), and how best to use NIRSpec spectra to recover IGM properties. We use a sample of 99 z~5.5-13 galaxies with high S/N prism spectra in the public archive, including 12 at z&amp;gt;10. We analyse these spectra using damping wing sightlines from inhomogeneous reionizing IGM simulations, mapping between the distance of a source from neutral IGM and the mean IGM neutral fraction. We marginalise over absorption by local HI around galaxies, and Lyman-alpha emission. We observe a decline in the median and variance of flux around the Lyman-alpha break with increasing redshift, consistent with an increasingly neutral IGM, as ionized regions become smaller and rarer. At z\gtrsim9 the spectra become consistent with an almost fully neutral IGM. We find S/N&amp;gt;15 per pixel is required to robustly estimate IGM properties from prism spectra. We fit a sub-sample of high S/N spectra and infer mean neutral fractions \overline{x}_\mathrm{HI}=0.33^{+0.18}_{-0.27}, 0.64^{+0.17}_{-0.23} (&amp;gt;0.70 excluding GNz11) at z \approx 6.5, 9.3. We also investigate local HI absorption, finding median column density \log_{10}N_\mathrm{HI}\approx10^{20.8} cm^{-2}, comparable to z~3 Lyman-break galaxies, with no significant redshift evolution. We find galaxies showing the strongest absorption are more likely to be in close associations (&amp;lt;500 pkpc), implying enhanced absorption in massive dark matter halos. Future deep prism and grating spectroscopy of z&amp;gt;9 sources will provide tighter constraints on the earliest stages of reionization, key for understanding the onset of star formation.

Detecting the first generation of stars, Population III (PopIII), has been a long-standing goal in astrophysics, yet they remain elusive even in the JWST era. Here we present a novel NIRCam-based selection method for PopIII galaxies, and carefully validate it through completeness and contamination simulations. We systematically search ~500 arcmin^{2} across JWST legacy fields for PopIII candidates, including GLIMPSE which, assisted by gravitational lensing, has produced JWST's deepest NIRCam imaging thus far. We discover one promising PopIII galaxy candidate (GLIMPSE-16043) at z=6.50^{+0.03}_{-0.24}, a moderately lensed galaxy (mu=2.9) with an intrinsic UV magnitude of M_{UV}=-15.89. It exhibits key PopIII features: strong H\alpha emission (rest-frame EW 2810\pm550&amp;#8491;); a Balmer jump; no dust (UV slope \beta=-2.34\pm0.36); and undetectable metal lines (e.g., [OIII]; [OIII]/H\beta&amp;lt;0.44) implying a gas-phase metallicity of Zgas/Zsun&amp;lt;0.5%. These properties indicate the presence of a nascent, metal-deficient young stellar population (&amp;lt;5Myr) with a stellar mass of ~eq10^{5}M_{\odot}. Intriguingly, this source deviates significantly from the extrapolated UV-metallicity relation derived from recent JWST observations at z=4-10, consistent with UV enhancement by a top-heavy PopIII initial mass function or the presence of an extremely metal-poor AGN. We also derive the first observational constraints on the PopIII UV luminosity function at z~6-7. The volume density of GLIMPSE-16043 (\approx10^{-4} cMpc^{-3}) is in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions, independently reinforcing its plausibility. This study demonstrates the power of our novel NIRCam method to finally reveal distant galaxies even more pristine than the Milky Way's most metal-poor satellites, thereby promising to bring us closer to the first generation of stars than we have ever been before.

We explore the evolving relationship between galaxies and their dark matter halos from z ~ 0.1 to z ~ 12 using mass-limited angular clustering measurements in the 0.54 deg^2 of the COSMOS-Web survey. This study provides the first measurements of the mass-limited two-point correlation function at z \ge 10 and a consistent analysis spanning 13.4 Gyr of cosmic history, setting new benchmarks for future simulations and models. Using a halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework, we derive characteristic halo masses and the stellar-to-halo mass relationship (SHMR) across redshifts and stellar mass bins. Our results first indicate that HOD models fit data at z \ge 2.5 best when incorporating a non-linear scale-dependent halo bias, boosting clustering at non-linear scales (r = 10-100 kpc). We find that galaxies at z &amp;gt; 10.5 with \log(M_\star / M_\odot) \ge 8.85 are hosted by halos with M_{\rm h} ~ 10^{10.5}\,M_\odot, achieving a star formation efficiency (SFE) M_\star / (f_b M_{\rm h}) up to 1 dex higher than at z \le 1. The high galaxy bias at z \ge 8 suggests that these galaxies reside in massive halos with intrinsic high SFE. Our SHMR evolves significantly with redshift, starting high at z \ge 10.5, decreasing until z ~ 2 - 3, then increasing again until the present. Current simulations fail to reproduce both massive high-z galaxies and this evolution, while semi-empirical models linking SFE to halo mass, accretion rates, and redshift align with our findings. We propose that z &amp;gt; 8 galaxies experience bursty star formation without significant feedback altering their growth, driving the rapid growth of massive galaxies observed by JWST. Over time, increasing feedback efficiency and exponential halo growth suppress star formation. At z ~ 2 - 3 and after, halo growth slows down while star formation continues, supported by gas reservoirs in halos.

Spiral galaxies are ubiquitous in the local Universe. However the properties of spiral arms in them are still not well studied, and there is even less information concerning spiral structure in distant galaxies. We aim to measure the most general parameters of spiral arms in remote galaxies and trace their changes with redshift. We perform photometric decomposition, including spiral arms, for 159 galaxies from the HST COSMOS and JWST CEERS and JADES surveys, which are imaged in optical and near-infrared rest-frame wavelengths. We confirm that, in our representative sample of spiral galaxies, the pitch angles increase, and the azimuthal lengths decrease with increasing redshift, implying that the spiral structure becomes more tightly wound over time. For the spiral-to-total luminosity ratio and the spiral width-to-disc scale length ratio, we find that band-shifting effects can be as significant as, or even stronger than, evolutionary effects. Additionally, we find that spiral structure becomes more asymmetric at higher redshifts.

We present 450&amp;mu;m and 850&amp;mu;m James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) observations of the Corona Australis (CrA) molecular cloud taken as part of the JCMT Gould Belt Legacy Survey (GBLS). We present a catalogue of 39 starless and protostellar sources, for which we determine source temperatures and masses using SCUBA-2 450&amp;mu;m/850&amp;mu;m flux density ratios for sources with reliable 450&amp;mu;m detections, and compare these to values determined using temperatures measured by the Herschel Gould Belt Survey (HGBS). In keeping with previous studies, we find that SCUBA-2 preferentially detects high-volume-density starless cores, which are most likely to be prestellar (gravitationally bound). We do not observe any anti-correlation between temperature and volume density in the starless cores in our sample. Finally, we combine our SCUBA-2 and Herschel data to perform SED fitting from 160-850&amp;mu;m across the central Coronet region, thereby measuring dust temperature T, dust emissivity index \beta and column density N({\rm H}_2) across the Coronet. We find that \beta varies across the Coronet, particularly measuring \beta = 1.55 \pm 0.35 in the colder starless SMM-6 clump to the north of the B star R CrA. This relatively low value of \beta is suggestive of the presence of large dust grains in SMM-6, even when considering the effects of T-\beta fitting degeneracy and ^{12}CO contamination of SCUBA-2 850&amp;mu;m data on the measured \beta values.

We combine the deepest X-ray survey from the Chandra Deep Field-South (CDF-S) `7-Ms' survey with the deepest mid-infrared (5.6 &amp;mu; m) image from the JWST/MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) in the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF) to study the infrared counterparts and point-source emission of 31 X-ray sources with a median, intrinsic, rest-frame X-ray luminosity of \log_{10}(L_{\rm Xc}^{\rm 0.5-7keV})=42.04\pm0.22 erg \rm s^{-1}. The sample includes 24 AGN with a redshift range, as set by the X-ray detectability, of z ~eq 0.5-3. Through a multi-wavelength morphological decomposition, employing three separate classifications (visual, parametric and non-parametric) we separate (where present) the luminosity of the point-like AGN component from the remainder of the host-galaxy emission. The unprecedented mid-infrared sensitivity and imaging resolution of MIRI allows, in many cases, the direct characterisation of point-like (i.e. unresolved) components in the galaxies' emission. We establish a broad agreement between the three morphological classifications. At least 70% of the X-ray sources, including some classified as galaxies, show unresolved emission in the MIRI images, with the unresolved-to-total flux fraction at rest-frame 2&amp;mu; m ranging from ~0.2 to ~0.9. At high X-ray luminosities (\log_{10}(L_{\rm Xc})&amp;gt;43 erg \rm s^{-1}) we derive a consistent rest-frame near-infrared 2 &amp;mu; m point-source luminosity to that derived for local AGN, whilst at lower X-ray luminosity we identify an excess in the 2 &amp;mu; m emission compared to pre-JWST studies. We speculate this offset may be driven by a combination of Compton-thick AGN components and nuclear starburst, merger driven activity. Our observations highlight the complex nature of X-ray sources in the distant Universe and demonstrate the power of JWST/MIRI in quantifying their nuclear infrared emission. (Abridged)

Recent cosmological observations indicate a 5\sigma discrepancy between the values of the Hubble constant H_0 derived from late and early universe probes. A further possible tension at the ~ 3\sigma level arises from different measurements of \sigma_8. These measurements suggest the existence of new physics. Here, we explore several theories of modified gravity that may help to resolve these cosmological tensions. These include a family of phenomenological modified theories, where only Newton's gravitational constant and the Einstein-Boltzmann equations are affected. We consider one particular class of these theories: cosmologies with varying growth index \gamma and varying dark energy Equation of State (EoS) w_\Lambda. We also consider the normal branch of the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (nDGP) model as well as k-mouflage gravity, which involves a non-trivially coupled scalar field. Our main aim is to narrow down the modified gravity landscape by constraining each model using high-redshift JWST data. Several probes are considered in this work: Stellar Mass Function (SMF), Stellar Mass Density (SMD), Star Formation Rate Density (SFRD) and Ultra-Violet Luminosity Function (UVLF) along with the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). We find that generally, the choice of r_c\gtrsim 10^{3.5} Mpc is preferred for nDGP, while \beta~0.1, K_0\gtrsim 0.9 is favored for k-mouflage. Moreover, in the context of phenomenological gravity, phantom-like dark energy EoS w_\Lambda\lesssim -1 is preferred over the quintessence.

We present an analysis of the rest-frame optical (\lambda ~eq 3100-5600 \,\r{A}) spectrum of a \mathrm{log}_{10}(M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot}) = 8.6 star-forming galaxy at z=8.271 (EXCELS-63107) from JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution observations taken as part of the EXCELS survey. EXCELS-63107 is a compact object consistent with the size of local star-forming cluster complexes (r_e &amp;lt; 200 \, \rm{pc}) and has an extremely steep UV continuum measured from JWST/NIRCam photometry (\beta=-3.3\pm0.3). The JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectrum of EXCELS-63107 is notable for its strong [OIII]\lambda4363 auroral-line emission relative to the [OIII]\lambda5007 forbidden line. Via a detailed emission-line and photoionization-modelling analysis, we find that the the observed properties of EXCELS-63107 are consistent with the presence of an ionizing source with an effective temperature of T_{\rm eff} \gtrsim 80 \, 000\,\rm{K} heating ionized gas with a density of n_e &amp;lt; 10^4 \, \rm{cm}^{-3} to a volume-averaged electron temperature of T_e ~eq 34 \, 000\,\rm{K}. Crucially, we find that stellar population models assuming a standard IMF are not capable of producing the required heating. We determine an oxygen abundance of {12+\mathrm{log(O/H)}= 6.89^{+0.26}_{-0.21}} which is one of the lowest directly constrained oxygen abundances measured in any galaxy to date, and ~eq 10 \times lower than is typical for z~eq8 galaxies with the same stellar mass. The extremely low metallicity of EXCELS-63107 places it in a regime in which theoretical models expect a transition to a top-heavy IMF, and we speculate that a ~eq 10-30 \, \times excess of M &amp;gt; 50 \, \rm{M}_{\odot} stars is one plausible explanation for its observed properties. However, more exotic scenarios, such as Pop III star formation within a mildly enriched halo, are also consistent with the observations.

Metallicity is a crucial tracer of galaxy evolution, providing insights into gas accretion, star formation, and feedback. At high redshift, these processes reveal how early galaxies assembled and enriched their interstellar medium. In this work, we present rest-frame optical spectroscopy of 12 massive (\log(M_*/\mathrm{M_{\odot}})&amp;gt;9) galaxies at z~ 6-8 from the REBELS ALMA large program, observed with JWST NIRSpec/IFU in the prism mode. These observations span emission lines from [OII]\lambda3727,9 to [SII]\lambda6716,31, providing key information on nebular dust attenuation, ionisation states, and chemical abundances. We find lower O32 ratios (average ~3.7) and [OIII]\lambda5007 equivalent widths (average {EW_{[OIII]}}~390&amp;#8491;) than are generally found in existing large spectroscopic surveys at z&amp;gt;6, indicating less extreme ionising conditions. Strong-line diagnostics suggest that these systems are some of the most metal-rich galaxies observed at z&amp;gt;6 (average Z_{\mathrm{gas}}~ 0.4 Z_{\odot}), including sources with near-solar oxygen abundances, in line with their high stellar masses (average \log{M_*/\mathrm{M_{\odot}}}~9.5). Supplementing with literature sources at lower masses, we investigate the mass-metallicity and fundamental metallicity relations (MZR and FMR, respectively) over a 4 dex stellar mass range at 6&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;8. In contrast to recent studies of lower-mass galaxies, we find no evidence for negative offsets to the z=0 FMR for the REBELS galaxies. This work demonstrates the existence of chemically-enriched galaxies just ~1 Gyr after the Big Bang, and indicates that the MZR is already in place at these early times, in agreement with other recent z&amp;gt;3 studies.

&lt;p&gt;
We present measurements of the dust attenuation curves of 12 massive (9~&amp;lt;~\log(M_{\star}/{M}_{\odot}) &amp;lt;~10) Lyman-break galaxies at z=6.5-7.7 derived from James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy. The galaxies are drawn from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Reionization Era Bright Emission Line Survey (REBELS) large program. The dust attenuation curves were obtained by fitting spectral energy distribution (SED) models with a flexible dust law to the full galaxy spectra over observed wavelengths 0.6-5.3 &amp;mu;m. These attenuation curves show a range of recovered slopes (-0.39\leq\delta\leq0.08) that are on average slightly flatter than seen in local sources of the same stellar masses, with none exhibiting very steep slopes. Three galaxies exhibit evidence for a 2175 \r{A} dust bump (&amp;gt;4\sigma) and we find SED fitting excluding the bump can overestimate derived stellar masses by up to 0.4 dex. Correcting for the dust attenuation with our best-fit attenuation curves we recover a range of intrinsic UV-slopes (-2.5\leq\beta_0\leq-2.2). The galaxies show moderate reddening (A_V~=~0.1-0.6 mag) and the A_V to stellar mass relation is consistent with local sources. The attenuation law slope is found to correlate with A_V, while we see no strong correlation with stellar mass, {M_{\rm UV}}, or gas-phase metallicity. Overall, our results show little evolution in dust properties in the REBELS sources compared to the local Universe. Comparing our recovered trends to empirical models suggests that the most important factor driving the variation in the attenuation curves in our sample is the dust-star geometry, not the properties of the dust grains themselves.

&lt;p&gt;
We present a comparison of observed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) feature ratios in 19 nearby galaxies with a grid of theoretical expectations for near- and mid-infrared dust emission. The PAH feature ratios are drawn from Cycle 1 JWST observations and are measured for 7224 stellar clusters and 29176 stellar associations for which we have robust ages and mass estimates from HST five-band photometry. Though there are galaxy-to-galaxy variations, the observed PAH feature ratios largely agree with the theoretical models, particularly those that are skewed toward more ionized and larger PAH size distributions. For each galaxy we also extract PAH feature ratios for 200 pc-wide circular regions in the diffuse interstellar medium, which serve as a non-cluster/association control sample. Compared to what we find for stellar clusters and associations, the 3.3um/7.7um and 3.3um/11.3um ratios from the diffuse interstellar medium are ~ 0.10-0.15 dex smaller. When the observed PAH feature ratios are compared to the radiation field hardness as probed by the [OIII]/H\beta ratio, we find anti-correlations for nearly all galaxies in the sample. These results together suggest that the PAH feature ratios are driven by the shape intensity of the radiation field, and that the smallest PAHs -- observed via JWST F335M imaging -- are increasingly 'processed' or destroyed in regions with the most intense and hard radiation fields.

&lt;p&gt;
In recent years, observations with the JWST have started to map out the rapid metal enrichment of the early Universe, while (sub)millimeter observations have simultaneously begun to reveal the ubiquity of dust beyond z\gtrsim6. However, the pathways that led to the assembly of early dust reservoirs remain poorly quantified, and require pushing our understanding of key scaling relations between dust, gas and metals into the early Universe. We investigate the dust build-up in twelve 6.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 7.7 galaxies drawn from the REBELS survey that benefit from (i) JWST/NIRSpec strong-line metallicity measurements, (ii) ALMA [CII]-based redshifts and gas masses, and (iii) dust masses from single- or multi-band ALMA continuum observations. Combining these measurements, we investigate the dust-to-gas (DtG), dust-to-metal (DtM), and dust-to-stellar mass (DtS) ratios of our sample as a function of metallicity. While our analysis is limited by systematic uncertainties related to the [CII]-to-H_2 conversion factor and dust temperature, we explore a wide range of possible values, and carefully assess their impact on our results. Under a fiducial set of assumptions, we find an average \log(\mathrm{DtG}) = -3.02 \pm 0.23, only slightly below that of local metal-rich galaxies. On the other hand, at fixed metallicity our average \log(\mathrm{DtS}) = -2.15 \pm 0.42 is significantly larger than that of low-redshift galaxies. Finally, through a comparison to various theoretical models of high-redshift dust production, we find that assembling the dust reservoirs in massive galaxies at z\approx7 likely requires the combination of rapid supernova enrichment and efficient ISM dust growth.

&lt;p&gt;
The hierarchical interplay among gravity, magnetic fields, and turbulent gas flows in delivering the necessary material to form massive protostellar clusters remains enigmatic. We have performed high-resolution (beam size ~14 arcsec ~eq 0.05 pc at a distance 725 pc) 850 &amp;mu;m dust polarization and C^{18}O molecular line observations of Cepheus A (Cep A), the second closest massive star-forming region, using the 15-meter James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) along with the SCUBA-2/POL-2 and HARP instruments. Our key analyses reveal that (i) morphologically, all three fields--gravitational (G), magnetic (B), and kinetic (K) fields--are aligned with each other, and (ii) energetically, they exhibit a hierarchical relationship with gravitational (E_{\mathrm{G}}) &amp;gt; magnetic (E_{\mathrm{B}}) &amp;gt; kinetic (E_{\mathrm{K}}). Gravity dominates in Cep A clump and, as a primary active player, dictates the other two agents. Consequently, gravity plays two active roles: (i) induces gas flows and (ii) drags B-field lines toward the gravitational trough. Since magnetic energy dominates kinetic energy, E_{\mathrm{B}} &amp;gt; E_{\mathrm{K}}, the "dragged-in" B-field as a secondary active player can mitigate turbulence and instabilities, thereby regularizing gas flows into a more ordered configuration. At the ~0.60 pc clump scale, these flows deliver material at a substantially high rate of ~ 2.1\times10^{-4} M_{\odot} yr^{-1} toward the cluster center. Our study, for the first time, presents new insights into how B-fields and turbulent gas flows passively assist the active role of gravity in the formation of a protostellar cluster, contrasting with the standard notion that these agents primarily oppose gravitational collapse.

&lt;p&gt;
We combine infrared (IR) observations collected by the James Webb Space Telescope with optical deep images by the Hubble Space Telescope taken approximately 20 years earlier to compute proper-motion membership for the globular cluster (GC) M 4 (NGC 6121) along its entire white dwarf (WD) cooling sequence (CS). These new IR observations allow us, for only the second time in a GC, to compare WD models with observations over a wide range of wavelengths, constraining fundamental astrophysical properties of WDs. Furthermore, we investigate the presence of WDs with IR excess along the WD CS of M 4, similar to the recent study conducted on the GC NGC 6397. We also determine the age difference between M 4 and NGC 6397 by comparing the absolute F150W2 magnitudes of the luminosity function peak at the bottom of the observed WD CS, and find that M 4 is slightly younger, by 0.8+/-0.5 Gyr.

&lt;p&gt;
Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered a substantial population of high-redshift broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) characterized by moderate luminosities, weak X-ray emissions, and faint high-ionization lines, challenging conventional models of black hole growth and AGN activity. In this study, we propose that these sources are accreting at super-Eddington rates and use geometrically thick, non-advective disk models to investigate the critical roles of photon scattering, reflections, and shadowing within funnel-like structures along the disk's rotation axis. Our models predict highly collimated radiation fields, with isotropic-equivalent luminosities vastly exceeding the Eddington limit in polar directions, and significant suppression of emission at higher inclination angles due to shadowing. These effects result in altered spectral energy distributions and pronounced anisotropies in observable properties. Key features include ultra-blue UV continuum slopes (alpha=+0.5 to +0.8), bolometric correction factors varying by over an order of magnitude with orientation, and suppressed coronal X-ray emissions. The anisotropy and shadowing effects may also explain the observed faintness of broad high-ionization emission lines, as the viewing angle strongly modulates both continuum brightness and the illumination of the broad-line region. These findings indicate that super-Eddington accretion flows, shaped by thick disk geometries and anisotropic radiation fields, can naturally account for many puzzling features of JWST-discovered AGNs and provide new insights into black hole growth in the early universe.

&lt;p&gt;
Redshift and luminosity distributions are essential for understanding the cosmic evolution of extragalactic objects and phenomena, such as galaxies, gamma-ray bursts, and fast radio bursts (FRBs). For FRBs, these distributions are primarily estimated using the fluence and the Dispersion Measure (DM). Calibrating their joint distribution has been challenging due to a lack of accurate fluences in the intensity data of the CHIME/FRB survey. Using the baseband update of CHIME/FRB Catalog 1, we calibrate the 2D fluence-DM distribution for the first time. We find the energy distribution is described well by a Schechter function with power-law slope of -1.94^{+0.14}_{-0.12}. Testing two types of redshift evolution models suggests a likely combination of young and old formation channels. 31^{+31}_{-21}&amp;percnt; of FRB sources may track star formation, or correspondingly, FRB sources may have delay times of 1.94^{+1.54}_{-1.31} Gyr. A pure star formation tracking population is excluded by only one model at &amp;gt; 2\sigma confidence. An updated cosmic star formation rate density evolution up to redshift 14 is constrained by compiling results from several JWST studies. Using this information, we expect next-generation radio telescopes to detect a few dozen bursts per year at z \gtrsim 6. A radio telescope with a system-equivalent flux density of \leq 1 Jy (equivalent to a detection threshold of 14 mJy ms) and instantaneous sky coverage of \gtrsim 200 square degrees should be able to detect 1.4^{+1.6}_{-1.0}\times 10^3 FRBs year^{-1} at z \gtrsim 6 and 234^{+250}_{-162} FRBs year^{-1} at z\gtrsim 8, which is sufficient to differentiate between reionization histories.

We explore spectroscopic and photometric methods for identifying high-redshift galaxies containing an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) with JWST observations. After demonstrating the limitations of standard optical methods, which appear ineffective in the low-metallicity environment of the early universe, we evaluate alternative diagnostic techniques using the current JWST observational capabilities. Our analysis focuses on line ratios and equivalent widths (EWs) of UV emission lines: CIV, HeII \lambda1640, OIII] \lambda1665, and CIII], and the faint optical line, HeII \lambda4686. We find that the most valuable diagnostic quantities for finding AGN are the line ratios: (CIII] + CIV) / HeII \lambda1640 and CIII] / HeII \lambda1640, as well as the EW of HeII \lambda1640. For more reliable AGN identification, the HeII \lambda1640 and OIII] \lambda1665 lines would need to be detected separately. We show that the HeII \lambda1640/H\beta ratio effectively separates AGN from star-forming galaxies, though it is contingent on a low dust content. We also show that in order to effectively use these diagnostics, future observations require longer exposure times, especially for galaxies at z &amp;gt; 6. Subsequently, we plot three real high-redshift sources on these diagrams which present strong UV emission lines. However, in order to classify them as strong AGN candidates, further study is needed due to the blending of HeII + OIII] and unreliable optical lines. Lastly, we carry out a selection process using spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with EAZY to identify strong AGN candidates in the JADES NIRCam photometry. One galaxy in our sample emerged as a strong AGN candidate, supported by both photometric selection and strong UV emission. We present a sample of similar AGN candidates in the JADES data based on this method.

&lt;p&gt;
Quiescent galaxies over 3&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6 are rare and puzzling. They formed and quenched within two billion years and simulations routinely struggle to predict their observed abundances. Developing a robust identification technique for these galaxies is crucial for constraining galaxy evolution models. Traditional rest-frame color-color selection techniques for quiescent galaxies are known to break down or require adjustments at z\gtrsim3. Recently, observed-frame color-color criteria have been established with JWST/NIRCam colors that efficiently pre-select high-redshift quiescent galaxies using only \lesssim1&amp;percnt; of a given sample. In this work, the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection machine-learning technique is applied to pre-select quiescent galaxies over 3&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6 using observed NIRCam colors. From a parent sample of 43,926 galaxies in JADES, we ultimately find 44 quiescent candidates from a pool of \approx2,300 galaxies. This is about five times fewer galaxies than what would be pre-selected using color-color criteria. Two-thirds of these candidates can be pre-selected from a pool as small as 247, which is about twice as efficient as existing observed-frame color selection techniques. Nearly two-thirds of the candidates are new discoveries and include quiescent galaxies with mass-weighted ages as young as \lesssim300 Myr. We obtain number densities in agreement with the literature at z&amp;lt;4 and find generally higher abundances at z&amp;gt;4, although our measurements are consistent within errors. This technique may be applied to other JWST surveys.

Galaxy groups with M_{tot} \lesssim 10^{14} M_\odot and up to a few tens of members are the most common galaxy environment, marking the transition between field and massive clusters. Identifying groups plays a crucial role in understanding structure formation and galaxy evolution. Modern deep surveys allow us to build well-characterized samples of groups up to the regime where structures were taking shape. We aimed to build the largest deep catalog of galaxy groups to date over the COSMOS-Web field effective area of 0.45 deg^2, leveraging the deep high quality data of the new COSMOS-Web photometric catalog resulted from the James Webb Space Telescope observations of the COSMOS-Web field. We performed the group search with the AMICO algorithm, a linear matched filter based on an analytical model for the group signal. AMICO has already been tested in wide and deep field surveys, including COSMOS data up to z=2. In this work, we tested the algorithm performances at even higher redshift and searched for protocluster cores at z&amp;gt;2. We compiled a list of known protoclusters in COSMOS at 2 \leq z \leq 3.7, matched them with our detections and studied the clustering of the detected cores. We estimated purity and completeness of our sample by creating data-driven mocks with the SinFoniA code and linked signal-to-noise to purity. We detected 1678 groups in the COSMOS-Web field up to z=3.7, including lists of members extending nearly two magnitudes deeper than the previous AMICO-COSMOS catalog. 756 groups were detected with purity of 80&amp;percnt;. More than 500 groups have their redshift confirmed by assigning spectroscopic counterparts. This group catalog offers a unique opportunity to explore galaxy evolution in different environments spanning ~12 Gyr and to study groups, from the least rich population to the formation of the most massive clusters.

In this work we estimate the explosion and progenitor properties of six Type II supernovae (SNe) at 0.675 &amp;lt;= z &amp;lt;= 3.61 discovered by the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) transient survey by modeling their light curves. This high-redshift Type II SN sample allows us to compare low-redshift Type II SNe to their high-redshift counterparts. Two Type II SNe are found to have high explosion energies of 3e51 erg, while the other four Type II SNe are estimated to have typical explosion energies found in the local Universe [(0.5-2)e51 erg]. The fraction of Type II SNe with high explosion energies might be higher at high redshifts because of, e.g., lower metallicity, but it is still difficult to draw a firm conclusion because of the small sample size and potential observational biases. We found it difficult to constrain the progenitor masses for Type II SNe in our sample because of the sparse light-curve data. We found two Type II SN light curves can be better reproduced by introducing confined, dense circumstellar matter. Thus, the confined, dense circumstellar matter frequently observed in nearby Type II SNe is likely to exist in Type II SNe at high redshifts as well. Two Type II SNe are estimated to have high host galaxy extinctions, showing the ability of JWST to discover dust-obscured SNe at high redshifts. More high-redshift Type II SNe are required to investigate the differences in the properties of Type II SNe near and far, but here we show the first glimpse into the high-redshift population of Type II SNe.

We present integral field unit observations of the Phoenix Cluster with the JWST Mid-infrared Instrument's Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI/MRS). We focus this study on the molecular gas, dust, and star formation in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We use precise spectral modeling to produce maps of the silicate dust, molecular gas, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the inner ~50 kpc of the cluster. We have developed a novel method for measuring the optical depth from silicates by comparing the observed H_2 line ratios to those predicted by excitation models. We provide updated measurements of the total molecular gas mass of 2.2^{+0.4}_{-0.1} \times 10^{10} {\rm M}_\odot, which agrees with CO-based estimates, providing an estimate of the CO-to-H_2 conversion factor of \alpha_{\rm CO} = 0.9 \pm 0.2\,{\rm M}_{\odot}\,{\rm pc}^{-2}\,({\rm K}\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1})^{-1}; an updated stellar mass of M_* = 2.6 \pm 0.5 \times 10^{10} {\rm M}_\odot; and star formation rates averaged over 10 and 100 Myr of \langle{\rm SFR}\rangle_{\rm 10} = 1340 \pm 100 {\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1} and \langle{\rm SFR}\rangle_{\rm 100} = 740 \pm 80 {\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}, respectively. The H_2 emission seems to be powered predominantly by star formation within the central ~ 20 kpc, with no need for an extra particle heating component as is seen in other BCGs. Additionally, we find nearly an order of magnitude drop in the star formation rates estimated by PAH fluxes in cool core BCGs compared to field galaxies, suggesting that hot particles from the intracluster medium are destroying PAH grains even in the centralmost 10s of kpc.

Compact, star-forming galaxies with high star formation rate surface densities (\Sigma_{\text{SFR}}) are often efficient Lyman continuum (LyC) emitters at z\leq 4.5, likely as intense stellar feedback creates low-density channels that allow photons to escape. Irregular or disturbed morphologies, such as those resulting from mergers, can also facilitate LyC escape by creating anisotropic gas distributions. We investigate the influence of galaxy morphology on LyC production and escape at redshifts 5 \leq z \leq 7 using observations from various \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) surveys. Our sample consists of 436 sources, which are predominantly low-mass (~ 10^{8.15} M_\odot), star-forming galaxies with ionizing photon efficiency (\xi_{\rm ion}) values consistent with canonical expectations. Since direct measurements of f_{\rm esc} are not possible during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), we predict f_{\rm esc} for high-redshift galaxies by applying survival analysis to a subsample of LyC emitters from the Low-Redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS), selected to be direct analogs of reionization-era galaxies. We find that these galaxies exhibit on average modest predicted escape fractions (~ 0.04). Additionally, we assess the correlation between morphological features and LyC emission. Our findings indicate that neither \xi_{\rm ion} nor the predicted f_{\rm esc} values show a significant correlation with the presence of merger signatures. This suggests that in low-mass galaxies at z \geq 5, strong morphological disturbances are not the primary mechanism driving LyC emission and leakage. Instead, compactness and star formation activity likely play a more pivotal role in regulating LyC escape.

&lt;p&gt;
We investigate the behavior of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters (GCs) using photometric diagrams constructed with Euclid photometry. By employing synthetic spectra and isochrones that incorporate the chemical differences between first-population (1P) stars, resembling field stars, and second-population (2P) stars, enriched in helium and nitrogen but depleted in carbon and oxygen, we identify, from a theoretical perspective, the color-magnitude diagrams and the chromosome maps most effective at distinguishing these populations within GCs. Euclid photometry proves to be a powerful tool for identifying multiple populations among M-dwarfs, as 1P and 2P stars form distinct sequences in well-chosen photometric diagrams, driven by differences in the strength of oxygen-based molecular features, such as water vapor. To validate our theoretical findings, we analyzed Euclid photometry and astrometry of the GC NGC 6397, complemented by photometric and astrometric data from the Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope, enabling a comprehensive study of its stellar populations across a wide field of view. We find that the 1P constitutes about 30% of the M-dwarfs in NGC 6397, with the fraction of 1P stars remaining consistent across different stellar masses and throughout the entire field of view. 2P stars exhibit an [O/Fe] depletion of about 0.3 dex relative to 1P stars, and both populations display isotropic proper motions. This study represents the first comprehensive analysis of multiple populations among M-dwarfs across a wide field of view, demonstrating that Euclid photometry is a powerful instrument for investigating multiple populations in GCs.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is discovering an increasing number of galaxies well into the early stages of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Many of these galaxies are clustered with strong Lyman alpha (Ly\alpha) emission, motivating the presence of surrounding cosmic HII regions that would facilitate Ly\alpha transmission through the intergalactic medium (IGM). Detecting these HII "bubbles" would allow us to connect their growth to the properties of the galaxies inside them. Here we develop a new forward-modeling framework to estimate the local HII region size and location from Ly\alpha spectra of galaxy groups in the early stages of the EoR. Our model takes advantage of the complementary information provided by neighboring sightlines through the IGM. Our forward models sample the main sources of uncertainty, including: (i) the global neutral fraction; (ii) EoR morphology; (iii) emergent Ly\alpha emission; and (iv) NIRSpec instrument noise. Depending on the availability of complementary nebular lines, ~ 0.006 \unicode{x2013} 0.01 galaxies per cMpc^3, are required to be \gtrsim95&amp;percnt; confident that the HII bubble location and size recovered by our method is accurate to within ~ 1 comoving Mpc. This corresponds roughly to tens of galaxies at z~7\unicode{x2013}8 in ~2x2 tiled pointing with JWST NIRSpec. Such a sample is achievable with a targeted survey with completeness down to M_{\rm UV}^{\rm min}\lesssim -19 \unicode{x2013} -17, depending on the over-density of the field. We test our method on 3D EoR simulations as well as misspecified equivalent width distributions, in both cases accurately recovering the HII region surrounding targeted galaxy groups.

&lt;p&gt;
Globular clusters (GCs) are some of the oldest bound structures in the Universe, holding clues to the earliest epochs of star formation and galaxy assembly. However, accurate age measurements of ancient clusters are challenging due to the age-metallicity degeneracy. Here, we report the discovery of 42 compact stellar systems within the 'Relic', a massive, quiescent galaxy at z=2.53. The Relic resides in an over-density behind the Abell 2744 cluster, with a prominent tidal tail extending towards two low-mass companions. Using deep data from the UNCOVER/MegaScience JWST Surveys, we find that clusters formed in age intervals ranging from 8 Myr up to ~2 Gyr, suggesting a rich formation history starting at z~10. While the cluster-based star formation history is broadly consistent with the high past star formation rates derived from the diffuse host galaxy light, one potential discrepancy is a tentative ~2-3\times higher rate in the cluster population for the past Gyr. Taken together with the spatial distribution and low inferred metallicities of these young-to-intermediate age clusters, we may be seeing direct evidence for the accretion of star clusters in addition to their early in-situ formation. The cluster masses are high, ~10^6-10^7~M_{\odot}, which may explain why we are able to detect them around this likely post-merger galaxy. Overall, the Relic clusters are consistent with being precursors of the most massive present-day GCs. This unique laboratory enables the first connection between long-lived, high-redshift clusters and local stellar populations, offering insights into the early stages of GC evolution and the broader processes of galaxy assembly.

&lt;p&gt;
The time-variable emission from the accretion flow of Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center, has long been examined in the radio-to-mm, near-infrared (NIR), and X-ray regimes of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, until now, sensitivity and angular resolution have been insufficient in the crucial mid-infrared (MIR) regime. The MIRI instrument on JWST has changed that, and we report the first MIR detection of Sgr A*. The detection was during a flare that lasted about 40 minutes, a duration similar to NIR and X-ray flares, and the source's spectral index steepened as the flare ended. The steepening suggests synchrotron cooling is an important process for Sgr A*'s variability and implies magnetic field strengths ~40--70 Gauss in the emission zone. Observations at 1.3~\mathrm{mm} with the Submillimeter Array revealed a counterpart flare lagging the MIR flare by \approx10 minutes. The observations can be self-consistently explained as synchrotron radiation from a single population of gradually cooling high-energy electrons accelerated through (a combination of) magnetic reconnection and/or magnetized turbulence.

We present the spectral analysis of J-138717, a post-starburst galaxy observed at z=1.8845 with JWST, for which we estimate a stellar mass M_* = 3.5\pm0.2\times10^{10}M_\odot and velocity dispersion \sigma_* = 198\pm10 km/s. From the fits of the NIRspec low-resolution prism and medium resolution grating spectra, we estimate an age of ~0.9 Gyr, a metallicity of ~ -0.3 dex, and a dust attenuation A_{\rm V} ~ 0.7 mag. From the H\alpha and [OII] emission lines we derive a star-formation rate (SFR)~ 0.1 M_\odot yr^{-1}, corresponding to a specific SFR~ 4 \times 10^{-12} yr^{-1}. By reconstructing its SFH, we find that this galaxy formed most of its stellar mass quickly (0.4-0.8 Gyr) and then rapidly quenched about 0.4 Gyr lookback time. The analysis of the emission lines ([OII], [NeIII], [OIII], H\alpha, and [NII]) indicates a low-level residual star formation or a weak AGN as the ionization source. Further, the lack of evidence for ongoing outflows in both the absorption and emission lines tracing the neutral and ionized gas argues against the presence of strong AGN feedback. Thanks to the high quality of the data, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the NIR spectral indices. This is the first time NIR spectral indices have been investigated at such a high redshift. We find that the observed CO and CN indices are generally weak and in better agreement with models with a lower contribution from thermally pulsating (TP-)AGB stars, indicating that either TP-AGB stars do not contribute significantly to the spectrum of J-138717 or the prescriptions in the models for these evolved phases should be substantially improved. In general, we find that all models struggle to reproduce the NIR indices consistently, pointing to the importance of improving state-of-the-art stellar population models in the NIR, especially at young ages.

We compare the internal stellar structures of central galaxies in the TNG50 and TNG100 simulations and field galaxies in the CALIFA survey. The luminosity fractions of the dynamically cold, warm, and hot components in both TNG50 and TNG100 galaxies exhibit general consistency with those observed in CALIFA galaxies. For example, they all exhibit a minimum luminosity fraction of the dynamically hot component in galaxies with intermediate stellar masses, and the morphology of each orbital component in the TNG50 and TNG100 galaxies closely resembles that found in the CALIFA galaxies. We therefore use the simulations to quantify the physical origins of the different components, focusing on the dynamically hot component in TNG50. We identify three primary regimes and thus physical processes: (1) in low mass galaxies that have not experienced major mergers, stars are born with a wide range of circularity distributions and have remained relatively unchanged until the present day. Consequently, hot stars in such galaxies at redshift 0 are predominantly born hot. (2) In higher mass galaxies lacking major mergers, most stars are initially born cold but are subsequently heated through secular evolution. (3) In galaxies across the entire mass range, mergers, if they occurred, significantly increased the hot orbital fraction. As a result, the dynamically hot bulge within R_e of present-day galaxies does not indicate their past merger histories; instead, the hot stars in the outer regions are mostly heated or accreted by mergers, thus indicating galaxy merger history. The massive galaxies are initially born with cold, rotationally supported structures, consistent with recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) regarding high-redshift galaxies.

&lt;p&gt;
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently conducted observations of massive galaxies at high redshifts, revealing a notable anomaly in their star formation efficiency (SFE). Motivated by the recent identification of three ~ 10^{6}M_\odot dark star candidates, we investigate whether dark stars can be the origin of the SFE excess. It turns out that the excess can be reproduced by a group of dark stars with M \gtrsim 10^{3}\, \rm M_{\odot}, because of their domination in generating primary UV radiation in high-redshift galaxies. The genesis of these dark stars is attributed to the capture of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) within a mass range of tens of GeV to a few TeV. However, if the top-heavy initial mass function of dark stars holds up to ~ 10^{5}M_\odot, the relic black holes stemming from their collapse would be too abundant to be consistent with the current observations of Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). We thus suggest that just a small fraction of SFE excess may be contributed by the very massive dark stars and the majority likely originated from other reasons such as the Population III stars in view of their rather similar UV radiation efficiencies.

The formation time-scales of quiescent galaxies can be estimated in two different ways, by their star formation history and by their chemistry. Previously, both methods yielded conflicting results, especially when considering \alpha-enhanced objects. This is primarily due to the time resolution limitations of very old stellar populations that prevent us from accurately constraining their star formation histories. We analyse the JWST observations of the extremely massive galaxy ZF-UDS-7329 at z~3.2 and show that we can achieve the higher time resolution necessary to match the chemical formation time-scales using stellar population synthesis by studying galaxies at high redshift. We compare it to the well known relic galaxy NGC 1277, arguing that ZF-UDS-7329 is an early Universe example of the cores of present day massive elliptical galaxies or, if left untouched, a relic galaxy.

We present the statistical properties of Ly\alpha emission in 586 galaxies at z=4.5-14.2, observed by multiple JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy projects, including JADES, GLASS, CEERS, and GO/DDT programs. We obtain Ly\alpha equivalent width (EW), Ly\alpha escape fraction, and ionizing photon production efficiency measurements or upper limits for these galaxies, and confirm that the Ly\alpha emitting galaxy fraction decreases towards higher redshifts. We derive Ly\alpha luminosity functions from z~ 5 to z~ 10-14 with the observed Ly\alpha EW distributions and galaxy UV luminosity functions, and find a ~3 dex decrease in number density at L_\mathrm{Ly\alpha}=10^{42}-10^{43} erg s^{-1} over the redshift range. We obtain the neutral hydrogen fractions of x_\mathrm{HI}=0.17_{-0.16}^{+0.23}, 0.63_{-0.28}^{+0.18}, 0.79_{-0.21}^{+0.13}, and 0.88_{-0.13}^{+0.11} at z~6, 7, 8-9, and 10-14, respectively, via comparisons of the reionization models developed by semi-numerical simulations with 21cmFAST explaining the observations of Ly\alpha, UV continuum, and Planck electron optical depth. The high x_\mathrm{HI} values over z~ 7-14 suggest a late and sharp reionization, with the primary reionization process occurring at z~ 6-7. Such a late and sharp reionization is not easily explained by either a clumpy inter-galactic medium or sources of reionization in a classical faint-galaxy or a bright-galaxy/AGN scenario, unless a very high escape fraction or AGN duty cycle is assumed at z~ 6-7.

&lt;p&gt;
The extended narrow line region (NLR) of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) provides a valuable laboratory for exploring the relationship between AGN and their host galaxies, often appearing as an ''ionization cone'' that can extend out to the very edge of the galaxy. We use new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam imaging to study the morphologies and sizes of NLRs traced by [O III] at cosmic noon (z~2-3), measurements which were previously only well-studied at z~0 with IFU spectroscopy. To determine NIRCam's ability to probe the properties of the NLR in cosmic noon galaxies, we present simulated images of AGN at z=2-3 created with archival data cubes from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) of nine nearby (z&amp;lt;0.05) AGN host galaxies with previously confirmed extended NLRs. Our simulated images show that NIRCam is able to resolve the morphologies of NLRs at z=2-3 with narrow- and medium-band observations. We then search for extended NLRs with NIRCam medium-band observations targeting the [O III] emission in twenty-seven previously identified AGN at z=2.4-3.4 in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey South (GOODS-S) field. We detect six galaxies in our observed sample with [O III] morphologies consistent with AGN ionization cones with characteristic NLR sizes of 1-2.5 kpc. Thanks to our simulated data, we can predict the effects of cosmological surface brightness dimming and instrument noise on the NLR size measurements at high redshift, which has the biasing effect of lowering the NLR size-AGN Luminosity trend that is observed at low redshift by a factor of ~ 2.

Transient astronomy in the early, high-redshift (z &amp;gt; 3) Universe is an unexplored regime that offers the possibility of probing the first stars and the Epoch of Reionization. During Cycles 1 and 2 of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program enabled one of the first searches for transients in deep images (~30 AB mag) over a relatively wide area (25 arcmin^2). One transient, AT 2023adsv, was discovered with an F200W magnitude of 28.04 AB mag, and subsequent JWST observations revealed that the transient is a likely supernova (SN) in a host with z_spec = 3.613 +/- 0.001 and an inferred metallicity at the position of the SN of Z_* = 0.3 +/- 0.1 Z_{\odot}. At this redshift, the first detections in F115W and F150W show that AT 2023adsv had bright rest-frame ultraviolet flux at the time of discovery. The multi-band light curve of AT 2023adsv is best matched by a template of an SN IIP with a peak absolute magnitude of M_B ~ -18.3 AB mag. We find a good match to a 20 M_{\odot} red supergiant progenitor star with an explosion energy of 2.0x10^51 ergs, likely higher than normally observed in the local Universe, but consistent with SNe IIP drawn from local, lower metallicity environments. AT 2023adsv is the most distant photometrically classified SN IIP yet discovered with a spectroscopic redshift measurement, and may represent a global shift in SNe IIP properties as a function of redshift.

Radio observations can provide crucial insight into the nature of a new abundant and mysterious population of dust-reddened active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), including ``Little Red Dots" (LRDs). In this study, we search for radio bright sources in a large sample of ~700 JWST discovered AGN candidates (z~2-11) in the 0.144-3 GHz frequency range, utilizing deep radio imaging in COSMOS, GOODS-N, and GOODS-S. Only one source is significantly detected in our radio surveys, which is PRIMER-COS 3866 at z=4.66. Its radio properties are consistent with both an AGN and star formation origin with a spectral index of \alpha=-0.76^{+0.11}_{-0.09} and a radio-loudness of R\approx0.5. The derived brightness temperature limit of PRIMER-COS 3866 of T_b \gtrsim 10^{3} K is too low to confirm its AGN nature. Our stacking results yield non-detections in all fields with the most constraining 3\sigma limit L_{1.3\text{GHz}} &amp;lt; 1.3\times10^{39} erg s^{-1} (rms of ~0.15 &amp;mu;Jy beam^{-1} at z_{\text{median}}=6.1) obtained for photometrically selected AGN candidates in the COSMOS field. This result is still consistent with expectations from the empirical L_X - L_{\text{H}\alpha} and L_X - L_R correlations established for local AGN. We conclude that current radio observations have insufficient depth to claim JWST discovered AGN candidates are radio-weak. We project that future surveys carried out by the SKA and ngVLA should be able to obtain significant detections within a few hours, providing crucial measurements of their brightness temperature, which would allow for distinguishing between AGN and starburst-driven origins of this new abundant population.

We present a study of the size growth of the red sequence between 0.5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;3, tracing the evolution of quiescent galaxies in both effective half-light and half-mass radii using multi-wavelength JWST/NIRCam imaging provided by the PRIMER survey. Half-light radii are measured from imaging in 6 different filters for 455 quiescent galaxies with log(M_*/M_{\odot})&amp;gt;10, whereas half-mass radii are derived from the F444W profiles together with the F277W-F444W color-M_*/L relation. We investigate the dependence of the ratio r_{e, \mathrm{mass}}/r_{e, \mathrm{light}} on redshift, stellar mass, and the wavelength used to measure r_{e, \mathrm{light}}, also separating the sample into younger and older quiescent galaxies. Our data demonstrate that rest-frame infrared sizes accurately trace mass-weighted sizes while sizes measured at rest-frame optical wavelengths (0.5-0.7&amp;mu;m) are 0.1-0.2 dex larger, with only minor variations in redshift. We find that the average size of young quiescent galaxies agrees with that of old quiescent galaxies at intermediate masses, 10&amp;lt;log(M_*/M_{\odot})&amp;lt;11, within their respective uncertainties in all observed-frame half-light, rest-frame half-light and half-mass radius measurements. At face value, our results point to a combination of progenitor bias and minor mergers driving the size growth of intermediate-mass quiescent galaxies at 0.5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;3. Our results further indicate that the varying contributions to the general quiescent population by young and old quiescent galaxies can mimic evolution in redshift.

&lt;p&gt;
Using JWST Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) images of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae (or NGC 104), taken at two epochs just 7 months apart, we derived proper-motion membership down to m_{\rm F322W2} ~ 27. We identified an intriguing feature at the very low-mass end of the main sequence, around ~ 0.08 solar masses, at magnitudes m_{\rm F322W2} ~ 24 and m_{\rm F150W2} ~ 25. This feature, dubbed "kink", is characterized by a prominent discontinuity in the slope of the main sequence. A similar discontinuity is seen in theoretical isochrones with oxygen-poor chemistries, related to the rapid onset of CH_4 absorption. We therefore hypothesize that the cluster hosts disproportionately more oxygen-poor stars near the bottom of the main sequence compared to the upper main sequence and the red giant branch. Our results show no strong or conclusive evidence of a rise in the brown dwarf luminosity function at faint magnitudes, in contrast to previous findings likely affected by faint red background galaxies. In our analysis, we accounted for this contamination by using proper motion membership.

Although the star formation process has been studied for decades, many important aspects of the physics involved remain unsolved. Recent advancement of instrumentation in the infrared, far-infrared and sub-millimetre wavelength regimes have contributed to a significantly improved understanding of processes in the interstellar medium (ISM) leading to star formation. The future of research on the ISM and star formation looks exciting with instruments like the JWST, ALMA, etc., already contributing to the topic by gathering high-resolution high-sensitivity data and with several larger ground- and space-bound facilities either being planned or constructed. India has a sizable number of astronomers engaged in research on topics related to the ISM and star formation. In this white paper invited by the Astronomical Society of India to prepare a vision document for Indian astronomy, we review the Indian contributions to the global understanding of the star formation process and suggest areas that require focused efforts both in creating observing facilities and in theoretical front in India, in order to improve the impact of our research in the coming decades.

We present first results of JWST Cycle 1 and 2 observations of Sgr A* using NIRCam taken simultaneously at 2.1 and 4.8 micron for a total of ~48 hours over seven different epochs in 2023 and 2024. We find correlated variability at 2.1 and 4.8 micron in all epochs, continual short-time scale (a few seconds) variability and epoch-to-epoch variable emission implying long-term ( ~days to months) variability of Sgr A*. A highlight of this analysis is the evidence for sub-minute, horizon-scale time variability of Sgr A*, probing inner accretion disk size scales. The power spectra of the light curves in each observing epoch also indicate long-term variable emission. With continuous observations, JWST data suggest that the flux of Sgr A* is fluctuating constantly. The flux density correlation exhibits a distinct break in the slope at ~3 mJy at 2.1 micron. The analysis indicates two different processes contributing to the variability of Sgr A*. Brighter emission trends towards shallower spectral indices than the fainter emission. Cross correlation of the light curves indicates for the first time, a time delay of 3 - 40 sec in the 4.8 micron variability with respect to 2.1 micron. This phase shift leads to loops in plots of flux density vs spectral index as the emission rises and falls. Modeling suggests that the synchrotron emission from the evolving, age-stratified electron population reproduces the shape of the observed light curves with a direct estimate of the magnetic field strengths in the range between 40-90 G, and upper cutoff energy, E_c, between 420 and 720 MeV.

We present the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey, a 77.2 hour Director's Discretionary Early Release Science Program. CEERS demonstrates, tests, and validates efficient extragalactic surveys using coordinated, overlapping parallel observations with the JWST instrument suite, including NIRCam and MIRI imaging, NIRSpec low (R~100) and medium (R~1000) resolution spectroscopy, and NIRCam slitless grism (R~1500) spectroscopy. CEERS targets the Hubble Space Telescope-observed region of the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) field, supported by a rich set of multiwavelength data. CEERS facilitated immediate community science in both of the extragalactic core JWST science drivers ``First Light" and ``Galaxy Assembly," including: 1) The discovery and characterization of large samples of galaxies at z &amp;gt;~ 10 from ~90 arcmin^2 of NIRCam imaging, constraining their abundance and physical nature; 2) Deep spectra of &amp;gt;1000 galaxies, including dozens of galaxies at 6&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;10, enabling redshift measurements and constraints on the physical conditions of star-formation and black hole growth via line diagnostics; 3) Quantifying the first bulge, bar and disk structures at z&amp;gt;3; and 4) Characterizing galaxy mid-IR emission with MIRI to study dust-obscured star-formation and supermassive black hole growth at z~1-3. As a legacy product for the community, the CEERS team has provided several data releases, accompanied by detailed notes on the data reduction procedures and notebooks to aid in reproducibility. In addition to an overview of the survey and quality of the data, we provide science highlights from the first two years with CEERS data.

Star-forming clumps have been found to significantly influence the star formation of gas-rich z&amp;gt;1 galaxies. Using public data from JWST/NIRCam (COSMOS-Web) and ALMA (FMOS-COSMOS), we study a sample of 32 massive (&amp;gt;10^{10.5}\,\rm M_{\odot}) main-sequence galaxies at z_{\rm spec}~1.5 with ~0.3\,\rm kpc resolution. We create composite morphological models consisting of bulge, disk, and clumps to fully 'deconstruct' the galaxy images. With the resulting measurements of the flux and size of these components, we find the following: (I)The combined contribution of clumps is 1-30&amp;percnt; towards the net star formation rate (SFR) of the host while contributing 1-20&amp;percnt; to its stellar mass. The clumps show a correlation between their stellar mass and SFR, but have an increased specific-SFR (sSFR) relative to the star-forming main sequence, with offsets ranging from 0\lesssim\Delta\log\rm sSFR\lesssim 0.4. They feature star formation surface densities of 10^{-2}-10^{2}\,\rm M_{\odot}/yr/kpc^{2}, consistent with values observed in local star-forming and starburst galaxies. (II)The clumps span a large range of characteristic sizes (r_{e}~0.1-1\,\rm kpc) and stellar masses (~ 10^{8.0-9.5}\,\rm M_{\odot}). We estimate a mass-size relation (r_{e}\propto\rm M_{\star}^{\,0.52\pm0.07}) along with a stellar mass function (slope, \alpha=-1.85\pm 0.19), both suggesting a hierarchical nature similar to that expected in star-forming regions in local galaxies. (III)Our measurements agree with the properties of stellar clumps in z\gtrsim1 lensed systems, bridging the gap between lensed and unlensed studies by detecting structures at sub-kpc scales.(IV)Clumps are found to be preferentially located along spiral features visible primarily in the residual rest-frame near-IR images. In conclusion, we present an observation-based, coherent picture of star-forming clumps at z&amp;gt;1.

&lt;p&gt;
Recent JWST observations have revealed the prevalence of spiral structures at z &amp;gt; 1. Unlike in the local Universe, the origin and the consequence of spirals at this epoch remain unexplored. We use public JWST/NIRCam data from the COSMOS-Web survey to map spiral structures in eight massive (&amp;gt; 10^{10.5}\,\rm M_{\odot}) star-forming galaxies at z_{\rm spec} ~ 1.5. We present a method for systematically quantifying spiral arms at z&amp;gt;1, enabling direct measurements of flux distributions. Using rest-frame near-IR images, we construct morphological models accurately tracing spiral arms. We detect offsets (~ 0.2 - 0.8\,\rm kpc) between the rest-frame optical and near-IR flux distributions across most arms. Drawing parallels to the local Universe, we conclude that these offsets reflect the presence of density waves. For nine out of eighteen arms, the offsets indicate spiral shocks triggered by density waves. Five arms have offsets in the opposite direction and are likely associated with tidal interactions. For the remaining cases with no detected offsets, we suggest that stochastic 'clumpy' star formation is the primary driver of their formation. In conclusion, we find a multi-faceted nature of spiral arms at z &amp;gt; 1, similar to that in the local Universe.

&lt;p&gt; Jillian Bellovary &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I hypothesize a physical explanation for the "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The first star formation in the universe occurs in dense clusters, some of which may undergo runaway collapse and form an intermediate mass black hole. This process would appear as a very dense stellar system, with recurring tidal disruption events (TDEs) as stellar material is accreted by the black hole. Such a system would be compact, UV-emitting, and exhibit broad H-alpha emission. If runaway collapse is the primary mechanism for forming massive black hole seeds, this process could be fairly common and explain the large volume densities of LRDs. In order to match the predicted number density of runaway collapse clusters, the tidal disruption rate must be on the order of 10^-4 per year. A top-heavy stellar initial mass function may be required to match observations without exceeding the predicted LambdaCDM mass function. The TDE LRD hypothesis can be verified with followup JWST observations looking for TDE-like variability.

Early JWST observations have revealed substantial numbers of galaxies out to redshifts as high as z ~eq 14, reflecting a slow evolution of the galaxy UV luminosity function (LF) not anticipated by many models of galaxy evolution. It has also been discovered that fairly massive galaxies existed at early times, a finding again viewed as a challenge to our understanding of early galaxy growth or even {\rm \Lambda}CDM cosmology. Here we develop and test a simple theoretical model which shows that these observations are unsurprising, but instead are arguably as expected if one assumes a non-evolving halo-mass dependent galaxy-formation efficiency consistent with that observed today. Crucially, this simple model matches the observed galaxy UV LF over the redshift range z ~eq 6-13 and the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) at z ~eq 6-8. When combined with new constraints on Lyman continuum escape and the ionizing photon production efficiency of early galaxies, our model also predicts the progress of cosmic hydrogen reionization consistent with current observational constraints. The requirement to fit both the UV LF and the GSMF breaks the degeneracy between mass-light ratio and star-formation efficiency, and our model only works if the typical mass-to-light ratio of galaxies increases systematically with redshift beyond z ~eq 6. However, at present this does not require changes to the IMF, cosmic dust, or any other new astrophysics. Rather, the current data can be reproduced simply by assuming ever-younger stellar populations consistent with a formation epoch at z ~eq 15. A key prediction of our model is thus that there should be a more rapid drop-off in the numbers of galaxy number density beyond z ~eq 15, where one can no longer appeal to ever younger ages to offset the precipitous descent of the halo mass function.

&lt;p&gt;
False-positive emission-line detections bias our understanding of astronomical sources; for example, falsely identifying z~3-4 passive galaxies as z&amp;gt;10 galaxies leads to incorrect number counts and flawed tests of cosmology. In this work, we provide a novel but simple tool to better quantify the detection of faint lines in interferometric data sets and properly characterize the underlying noise distribution. We demonstrate the method on three sets of archival observations of z&amp;gt;10 galaxy candidates, taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). By jackknifing the visibilities using our tool, jackknify, we create observation-specific noise realizations of the interferometric measurement set. We apply a line-finding algorithm to both the noise cubes and the real data and determine the likelihood that any given positive peak is a real signal by taking the ratio of the two sampled probability distributions. We show that the previously reported, tentative emission-line detections of these z&amp;gt;10 galaxy candidates are consistent with noise. We further expand upon the technique and demonstrate how to properly incorporate prior information on the redshift of the candidate from auxiliary data, such as from JWST. Our work highlights the need to achieve a significance of \gtrsim 5\sigma to confirm an emission line when searching in broad 30 GHz bandwidths. Using our publicly available method enables the quantification of false detection likelihoods, which are crucial for accurately interpreting line detections.

&lt;p&gt;
The James Webb Space Telescope has ushered in an era of abundant high-redshift observations of young stellar populations characterized by strong emission lines, motivating us to integrate nebular emission into the new Maraston stellar population model which incorporates the latest Geneva stellar evolutionary tracks for massive stars with rotation. We use the photoionization code Cloudy to obtain the emergent nebular continuum and line emission for a range of modelling parameters, then compare our results to observations on various emission line diagnostic diagrams. We carry out a detailed comparison with several other models in the literature assuming different input physics, including modified prescriptions for stellar evolution and the inclusion of binary stars, and find close agreement in the H\rm \beta, H\rm \alpha, [N II]\lambda 6583, and [S II]\lambda 6731 luminosities between the models. However, we find significant differences in lines with high ionization energies, such as He II\lambda1640 and [O III]\lambda 5007, due to large variations in the hard ionizing photon production rates. The models differ by a maximum of \hat{Q}_{\rm [O III]\lambda 5007} = \rm 6 \times 10^9 \; s^{-1} \, M_{\odot}^{-1}, where these differences are mostly caused by the assumed stellar rotation and effective temperatures for the Wolf Rayet phase. Interestingly, rotation and uncorrected effective temperatures in our single star population models alone generate [O III] ionizing photon production rates higher than models including binary stars with ages between 1 to 8 Myr. These differences highlight the dependence of derived properties from SED fitting on the assumed model, as well as the sensitivity of predictions from cosmological simulations.

&lt;p&gt;
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is unveiling the rest-frame near-IR structure of galaxies. We measure the evolution with redshift of the rest-frame optical and near-IR S\'ersic index (n), and examine the dependence on stellar mass and star-formation activity across the redshift range 0.5\leq z\leq2.5. We infer rest-frame near-IR S\'ersic profiles for \approx 15.000 galaxies in publicly available NIRCam imaging mosaics from the COSMOS-Web and PRIMER surveys. We augment these with rest-frame optical S\'ersic indices, previously measured from HST imaging mosaics. The median S\'ersic index evolves slowly or not at all with redshift, except for very high-mass galaxies (M_\star &amp;gt; 10^{11}~{\text{M}}_\odot), which show an increase from n\approx 2.5 to n\approx 4 at z&amp;lt;1. High-mass galaxies have higher n than lower-mass galaxies (M_\star=10^{9.5}~{\text{M}}_\odot) at all redshifts, with a stronger dependence in the rest-frame near-IR than in the rest-frame optical at z&amp;gt;1. This wavelength dependence is caused by star-forming galaxies that have lower optical than near-IR n at z&amp;gt;1 (but not at z&amp;lt;1). Both at optical and near-IR wavelengths, star-forming galaxies have lower n than quiescent galaxies, fortifying the connection between star-formation activity and radial stellar mass distribution. At z&amp;gt;1 the median near-IR n varies strongly with star formation activity, but not with stellar mass. The scatter in near-IR n is higher in the green valley (0.25 dex) than on the star-forming sequence and among quiescent galaxies (0.18 dex) -- this trend is not seen in the optical because dust and young stars contribute to the variety in optical light profiles. Our newly measured rest-frame near-IR radial light profiles motivate future comparisons with radial stellar mass profiles of simulated galaxies as a stringent constraint on processes that govern galaxy formation.

&lt;p&gt;
The total deuterium abundance [D/H] in the universe is set by just two processes: the creation of deuterium in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis at an abundance of [D/H]=2.58\pm0.13\times10^{-5}, and its destruction within stellar interiors. Measurements of the total [D/H] abundance can potentially provide a probe of Galactic chemical evolution, however, most measurements of [D/H] are only sensitive to the gas-phase deuterium, and the amount of deuterium sequestered in carbonaceous dust grains is debated. With the launch of JWST, it is now possible to measure the gas-phase [D/H] at unprecedented sensitivity and distances through observation of mid-IR lines of H_2 and HD. We employ data from the JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS) program to measure the gas-phase [D/H] abundance with a rotation diagram analysis towards 5 nearby low-mass and 5 distant high-mass protostellar outflows. The gas-phase [D/H] varies between low-mass sources by up to a factor of ~4, despite these sources likely having formed in a region of the Galactic disk that would be expected to have nearly constant total [D/H]. Most measurements of gas-phase [D/H] from our work or previous studies produce [D/H] \lesssim 1.0\times10^{-5}, a factor of 2-4 lower than found from local UV absorption lines and as expected from Galactic chemical evolution models. The variations in [D/H] between our low-mass sources and the low [D/H] with respect to Galactic chemical evolution models suggest that our observations are not sensitive to the total [D/H]. Significant depletion of deuterium onto carbonaceous dust grains is a possible explanation, and tentative evidence of enhanced [D/H] towards shock positions with higher gas-phase Fe abundance is seen in the HH 211 outflow. Deeper observations of HD and H_2 in shocked environments and modelling of dust-grain destruction are warranted to test for the effects of depletion.

The high-redshift UV luminosity function provides important insights into the evolution of early galaxies. JWST has revealed an unexpectedly large population of bright (M_\mathrm{UV} \lesssim -20) galaxies at z\gtrsim10, implying fundamental changes in the star forming properties of galaxies at increasingly early times. However, constraining the fainter population (M_\mathrm{UV} \gtrsim -18) has been more challenging. In this work, we present the z\gtrsim9 UV luminosity function from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey. We calculate the UV luminosity function from several hundred z\gtrsim9 galaxy candidates that reach UV luminosities of M_\mathrm{UV}~-17 in redshift bins of z~9-12 (309 candidates) and z~12-16 (63 candidates). We search for candidates at z~16-22.5 and find none. We also estimate the z~14-16 luminosity function from the z\geq14 subset of the z~12-16 sample. Consistent with other measurements, we find an excess of bright galaxies that is in tension with many theoretical models, especially at z\gtrsim12. However, we also find high number densities at -18\lesssim M_\mathrm{UV} \lesssim-17, suggesting that there is a larger population of faint galaxies than expected, as well as bright ones. From our parametric fits for the luminosity function, we find steep faint end slopes of -2.5\lesssim\alpha\lesssim-2.3, suggesting a large population of faint (M_\mathrm{UV} \gtrsim -17) galaxies. Combined, the high normalization and steep faint end slope of the luminosity function could imply that the reionization process is appreciably underway as early as z=10.

&lt;p&gt;
Star clusters, including high-mass stars, form within hub-filament systems (HFSs). Observations of HFSs that remain unaffected by feedback from embedded stars are rare yet crucial for understanding the mass inflow process in high-mass star formation. Using the JWST NIRCAM images, Dewangan et al. 2024, reported that the high-mass protostar G11P1 is embedded in a candidate HFS (G11P1-HFS; &amp;lt;0.6 pc). Utilizing ALMA N_{2}H^{+}(1-0) data, we confirm the presence of G11P1-HFS and study the dense gas kinematics. We analyzed the position-position-velocity (PPV) map and estimated on-sky velocity gradient (V_g) and gravity (\mathcal{F}_{g}) vectors. The spatial distribution of gas velocity and H_2 column density was examined. The steep V_g of 5 km s^{-1} pc^{-1} and -7 km s^{-1} pc^{-1} toward either side of G11P1-hub, and the decreasing V_g toward the hub, identify G11P1-HFS as a small-scale HFS in its nascent phase. V_g and \mathcal{F}_{g} align along the filaments, indicating gravity-driven flows. This work highlights the wiggled, funnel-shaped morphology of a HFS in PPV space, suggesting the importance of subfilaments or transverse gas flows in mass transportation to the hub.

&lt;p&gt;
We present an observational study of the S284-RE region, a low-metallicity area associated with the extended S284 HII region. A thermally supercritical filament (mass ~2402 M_{\odot}, length ~8.5 pc) is investigated using the Herschel column density map. The Spitzer ratio 4.5 &amp;mu;m/3.6 &amp;mu;m map traces the H_{2} outflows in this filament, where previously reported young stellar objects (YSOs) are spatially distributed. Analysis of the YSO distribution has revealed three active star-forming clusters (YCl1, YCl2, YCl3) within the filament. YCl3 seems to be the most evolved, YCl2 the youngest, while YCl1 displays signs of non-thermal fragmentation. The JWST (F470N+F444W)/F356W ratio map reveals at least seven bipolar H_{2} outflows, with four (olc1--olc4) in YCl1 and three (ol1--ol3) in YCl2. The driving sources of these outflows are identified based on outflow geometry, ALMA continuum peaks, and YSO positions. Two ALMA continuum sources, #2 and #3, from the M-R_{\rm eff} plot are recognized as potential massive star formation candidates. The ALMA continuum source #2 hosts at least three outflow-driving sources, whereas the ALMA continuum source #3 contains two. The bipolar outflow olc1, driven by an embedded object within the continuum source #2, is likely a massive protostar, as indicated by Br-\alpha and PAH emissions depicted in the JWST (F405N+F444W)/F356W ratio map. The presence of H_{2} knots in the outflows olc1 and ol1 suggests episodic accretion. Overall, the study investigates a massive protostar candidate, driving the ~2.7 pc H_{2} outflow olc1 and undergoing episodic accretion.

First stars powered by dark matter (DM) heating instead of fusion can appear in the early Universe from theories of new physics. These dark stars (DSs) can be significantly larger and cooler than early Population III stars, and could seed supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We show that neutrino emission from supermassive DSs provides a novel window into probing SMBH progenitors. We estimate first DS constraints using data from Super-Kamiokande and IceCube neutrino experiments, and consistent with James Webb Space Telescope observations. Upcoming neutrino telescopes offer distinct opportunities to further explore DS properties.

&lt;p&gt;
We present a new description of the 7.7~&amp;mu;m region towards the high-mass star-forming region IRAS 23385+6053 taken from open James Webb Space Telescope Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium Resolution Spectrometer (JWST MIRI/MRS) data. This area is commonly attributed to the \nu_4 deformation mode of methane ice. For the first time gaseous and solid methane were analyzed simultaneously in IRAS 23385+6053. The band at 7.58--7.8 &amp;mu;m (1320--1280 cm^{-1}) is interpreted as a wide solid absorption methane feature overlapped by the sharp features of the methane emission. We report the detection of gaseous methane and estimate its emitting area radius~R, temperature~T and column density~N as R=2940~au, T=103^{+13}_{-11}~K, and N=0.78_{+6.18}^{-0.64}\times10^{17}~cm^{-2}, correspondingly. The ice content was analyzed with the laboratory spectra dataset of methane in different molecular environments obtained on the Ice Spectroscopy Experimental Aggregate (ISEAge). We were able to describe the wide feature of solid methane with the following laboratory spectra: CH_4~:~CO_2~=~1~:~5 (at 27.4^{+6.0}_{-10.8}~K) and CH_4~:~H_2O~=~1~:~10 (at 8.4^{+16.4}_{-1.7}~K) deposited at 6.7~K and warmed up at a rate of 0.5 K per minute. The derived column densities are N_{\text{CH}_4}(CO_2)~=~2.97^{+0.37}_{-0.57}\times10^{17}~cm^{-2} and N_{\text{CH}_4}(H_2O)~=~1.02^{+0.46}_{-0.27}\times10^{17}~cm^{-2}. According to the best fit solid methane is mostly surrounded by CO_2 rather than H_2O. The residuals analysis reveals the unassigned region at 1283--1297~cm^{-1} (7.71--7.79~&amp;mu;m) which is tentatively assigned to nitrous oxide (N_2O) in various environments.

Dwarf galaxies are thought of as the building blocks of large galaxies such as our Milky Way. This paper presents new high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies and their intergalactic medium with the \texttt{GIZMO} code. Our simulations consider the key physical processes of galaxy evolution, such as gas cooling, chemistry, and stellar and black hole feedback. Unlike the previous work, the initial conditions of our simulations taking the dwarf galaxies of 2-5 \times 10^{10} \, M_\odot from the realistic cosmology simulations, \texttt{IllustrisTNG}. We further increase the original resolution of \texttt{IllustrisTNG} by a factor of ~ 100 via a particle splitting scheme. Our results show that the evolution of complex multiphase CGM and its metal content is sensitive to the redshift of dwarf galaxies. The accretion of CGM into dwarf galaxies plays a key role in providing 20 &amp;percnt; - 50 &amp;percnt; of the star-forming gas and replenishing 40 &amp;percnt; - 70 &amp;percnt; of the total mass in the galactic disk. Furthermore, the accretion history of supermassive black holes in the centers of high-z dwarf galaxies shows episodic patterns with high-accreting states close to ~ 10 &amp;percnt; of the Eddington mass accretion rate, implying the rapid growth of supermassive black holes in the early universe, which may be revealed by the coming observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope revealed a surprisingly large number of galaxies formed at high redshift. Along with strong lensing studies and nearby galaxy observations, these could challenge the standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmology with a power-law primordial power spectrum. In this study, we conduct high-resolution cosmological zoom-in dark matter-only simulations of Milky Way host size halos with a blue, tilted primordial power spectrum (P(k)\propto k^{m_s} with m_s&amp;gt;1 at small scales &amp;gt;1~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}). We find that the blue-tilted subhalo mass functions can be enhanced by more than a factor of two for subhalo masses M_{\rm sub} \lesssim 10^{10}~ M_{\odot}, whereas the subhalo V_{\rm max} functions can be enhanced by a factor of four for maximum circular velocities V_{\rm max}\lesssim 30 ~{\rm km/s}. The blue-tilted scaled cumulative substructure fraction can be an order of magnitude higher at ~10&amp;percnt; of the virial radius. The blue-tilted subhalos also have higher central densities, since the blue-tilted subhalos reach the same V_{\rm max} at a smaller distance R_{\rm max} from the center. We have also verified these findings with higher-resolution simulations.

We report the detection of the [O III] auroral line in 42 galaxies within the redshift range of 3 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 10. These galaxies were selected from publicly available JWST data releases, including the JADES and PRIMALsurveys, and observed using both the low-resolution PRISM/CLEAR configuration and medium-resolution gratings. The measured electron temperatures in the high-ionization regions of these galaxies range from T_e([O III]) = 12,000 to 24,000 K, consistent with temperatures observed in local metal-poor galaxies and previous JWST studies. In 10 galaxies, we also detect the [O II] auroral line, allowing us to determine electron temperatures in the low-ionization regions, which range between T_e([O II]) = 10,830 and 20,000 K. The direct-T_e-based metallicities of our sample span from 12 + log(O/H) = 7.2 to 8.4, indicating these high-redshift galaxies are relatively metal-poor. By combining our sample with 25 galaxies from the literature, we expand the dataset to a total of 67 galaxies within 3 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 10, effectively more than doubling the previous sample size for direct-T_e based metallicity studies. This larger dataset allow us to derive empirical metallicity calibration relations based exclusively on high-redshift galaxies, using six key line ratios: R3, R2, R23, Ne3O2, O32, and O3N2. Notably, we derive a novel metallicity calibration relation for the first time using high-redshift T_e-based metallicities: \hat{R} = 0.18log R2 + 0.98log R3. This new calibration significantly reduces the scatter in high-redshift galaxies compared to the \hat{R} relation previously calibrated for low-redshift galaxies.

Supermassive black holes are prevalent at the centers of massive galaxies, and their masses scale with galaxy properties, increasing evidence suggesting that these trends continue to low stellar masses. Seeds are needed for supermassive black holes, especially at the highest redshifts explored by the James Webb Space Telescope. We study the hierarchical merging of galaxies via cosmological merger trees and argue that the seeds of supermassive black holes formed in nuclear star clusters via stellar black hole mergers at early epochs. Observable tracers include intermediate-mass black holes, nuclear star clusters, and early gas accretion in host dwarf galaxies, along with a potentially detectable stochastic gravitational wave background, ejection of intermediate and supermassive black holes, and consequences of a significant population of tidal disruption events and extreme-mass ratio inspirals.

&lt;p&gt;
We present JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of the z=7.152 galaxy system B14-65666, as part of the GA-NIFS survey. Line and continuum emission in this massive system (log10(M*/Msol)=9.8+/-0.2) is resolved into two strong cores, two weaker clumps, and a faint arc, as seen in recent JWST/NIRCam imaging. Our dataset contains detections of [OII]3727,3729, [NeIII]3869,3968, Balmer lines (HBeta, HGamma, HDelta, HEpsilon, HZeta), [OIII]5007, and weak [OIII]4363. Each spectrum is fit with a model that consistently incorporates interstellar medium conditions (i.e., electron temperature, T_e, electron density, n_e, and colour excess, E(B-V)). The resulting line fluxes are used to constrain the gas-phase metallicity (~0.3-0.4 solar) and HBeta-based SFR (310+/-40 Msol/yr) for each region. Common line ratio diagrams (O32-R23, R3-R2, Ne3O2-R23) reveal that each line-emitting region lies at the intersection of local and high-redshift galaxies, suggesting low ionisation and higher metallicity compared to the predominantly lower-mass galaxies studied with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU so far at z&amp;gt;5.5. Spaxel-by-spaxel fits reveal evidence for both narrow (FWHM&amp;lt;400 km/s) and broad (FWHM &amp;gt;500 km/s) line emission, the latter of which likely represents tidal interaction or outflows. Comparison to ALMA [CII]158um and [OIII]88um data shows a similar velocity structure, and optical-far infrared diagnostics suggest regions of high Lyman continuum escape fraction and n_e. This source lies on the mass-metallicity relation at z&amp;gt;4, suggesting an evolved nature. The two core galaxies show contrasting properties (e.g., SFR, M*, gas-phase metallicity), suggesting distinct evolutionary pathways. Combining the NIRSpec IFU and ALMA data sets, our analysis opens new windows into the merging system B14-65666.

We present a structural analysis of 521 galaxy candidates at 6.5 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 12.5, with SNR &amp;gt; 10\sigma in the F444W filter, taken from the EPOCHS v1 sample, consisting of uniformly reduced deep JWST NIRCam data, covering the CEERS, JADES GOOD-S, NGDEEP, SMACS0723, GLASS and PEARLS surveys. We use standard software to fit single S\'ersic models to each galaxy in the rest-frame optical and extract their parametric structural parameters (S\'ersic index, half-light radius and axis-ratio), and \texttt{Morfometryka} to measure their non-parametric concentration and asymmetry parameters. We find a wide range of sizes for these early galaxies, but with a strong galaxy-size mass correlation up to z ~ 12 such that galaxy sizes continue to get progressively smaller in the high-redshift regime, following R_{e} = 2.74 \pm 0.49 \left( 1 + z \right) ^{-0.79 \pm 0.08} kpc. Using non-parametric methods we find that galaxy merger fractions, classified through asymmetry parameters, at these redshifts remain consistent with those in literature, maintaining a value of f_{m} ~ 0.12 \pm 0.07 showing little dependence with redshift when combined with literature at z &amp;gt; 4. We find that galaxies which are smaller in size also appear rounder, with an excess of high axis-ratio objects. Finally, we artificially redshift a subsample of our objects to determine how robust the observational trends we see are, determining that observed trends are due to real evolutionary effects, rather than being a consequence of redshift effects.

&lt;p&gt;
As part of the guaranteed time observations program Mid-Infrared Characterization Of Nearby Iconic galaxy Centers (MICONIC), we used the medium-resolution spectrometer (MRS) of the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on board of the JWST to study the nearby merger NGC6240. We aim to characterise the dual active galactic nuclei (AGN), the ionised gas outflows and the main properties of the interstellar medium over a mapped area of 6.6"x7.7". We obtained integral field spectroscopic mid-infrared data of NGC6240, resolving both nuclei for the first time in the full 5-28{&amp;mu;}m spectral range. We modelled the emission lines through a kinematic decomposition, finding that the fine-structure lines in the southern (S) nucleus are broader than for the northern (N) nucleus (full width at half maximum of \geq1500 vs ~700 km s^{-1} on average). High excitation lines, such as [NeV], [NeVI], and [MgV], are clearly detected in the N nucleus. In the S nucleus, the same lines can be detected but only after a decomposition of the PAH features in the integrated spectrum, due to a combination of a strong mid-IR continuum, the broad emission lines, and the intense star formation (SF). The SF is distributed all over the mapped FoV of 3.5kpc x 4.1kpc (projected), with the maximum located around the S nucleus. Both nuclear regions appear to be connected by a bridge region detected with all the emission lines. Based on the observed MRS line ratios and the high velocity dispersion ({\sigma}~600 km s^{-1}), shocks are also dominating the emission in this system. We detected the presence of outflows as a bubble north-west from the N nucleus and at the S nucleus. We estimated a ionised mass outflow rate of 1.4\pm0.3 M yr^{-1} and 1.8\pm0.2 M yr^{-1}, respectively. Given the derived kinetic power of these outflows, both the AGN and the starburst could have triggered them. [Abridged]

Merger events are thought to be an important phase in the assembly of massive galaxies. At the same time, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) play a fundamental role in the evolution of their star formation histories. Both phenomena can be observed at work in NGC 6240, a local prototypical merger, classified as an UltraLuminous InfraRed Galaxy (ULIRG) thanks to its elevated infrared luminosity. Interestingly, NGC 6240 hosts two AGN separated by 1.5''(~ 735 pc), detected in both X-ray and radio band. Taking advantage of the unprecedented sensitivity and wavelength coverage provided by the Integral Field Unit (IFU) of the NIRSpec instrument onboard JWST, we observed the nuclear region of NGC 6240 in a FoV of 3.7'' x 3.7''(1.9 x 1.9 kpc^2), to investigate gas kinematics and InterStellar Medium (ISM) properties with a high spatial resolution of ~ 0.1'' (or ~ 50 pc). We separated the different gas kinematic components through multi-Gaussian fitting and studied the excitation properties of the ISM from the NIR diagnostic diagram based on the H_2 1-0 S(1)/BrGamma and [Fe II]1.257micron/PaBeta lines ratios. We isolated the ionization cones of the two nuclei, and detected coronal lines emission from both of them. Using H_2 line ratios, we found that the molecular hydrogen gas is excited mostly by thermal processes. We computed a hot molecular gas mass of 1.3 x 10^5 M_sun and an ionized gas mass in the range of 10^5 - 10^7 M_sun. We studied with unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity the kinematics of the molecular and ionized gas phases. We revealed the complex structure of the molecular gas and found a blueshifted outflow near the Southern nucleus, together with filaments connecting a highly redshifted H_2 cloud with the two nuclei. We speculate on the possible nature of this H_2 cloud and propose two possible scenarios: either outflowing gas, or a tidal cloud falling onto the nuclei.

&lt;p&gt;
The Ly\alpha emission line is a characteristic feature found in high-z galaxies, serving as a probe of cosmic reionization. While previous works present various correlations between Ly\alpha emission and physical properties of host galaxies, it is still unclear which characteristics predominantly determine the Ly\alpha emission. In this study, we introduce a neural network approach to simultaneously handle multiple properties of galaxies. The neural-network-based prediction model that identifies Ly\alpha emitters (LAEs) from six physical properties: star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass, UV absolute magnitude M_\mathrm{UV}, age, UV slope \beta, and dust attenuation E(B-V), obtained by the SED fitting. The network is trained with galaxy samples from the VANDELS and MUSE spectroscopic surveys and achieves the performance of 77% true positive rate and 14% false positive rate. The permutation feature importance method shows that \beta, M_\mathrm{UV}, and M_* are important for the prediction of LAEs. As an independent validation, we find that 91% of LAEs spectroscopically confirmed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have a probability of LAE higher than 70% in this model. This prediction model enables the efficient construction of a large LAE sample in a wide and continuous redshift space using only photometric data. We apply the prediction model to the JWST photometric galaxy sample and obtain Ly\alpha fraction consistent with previous studies. Moreover, we demonstrate that the difference between the distributions of LAEs predicted by the model and the spectroscopically identified LAEs provides a strong constraint on the HII bubble size.

&lt;p&gt;
We present the initial results of MEAD (Measuring Extinction and Abundances of Dust), with a focus on the dust extinction features observed in our JWST near- and mid-infrared spectra of nine diffuse Milky Way sightlines (1.2 \leq A(V) \leq 2.5). For the first time, we find strong correlations between the 10 &amp;mu;m silicate feature strength and the column densities of Mg, Fe and O in dust. This is consistent with the well-established theory that Mg- and Fe-rich silicates are responsible for this feature. We obtained an average stoichiometry of the silicate grains in our sample of Mg:Fe:O = 1.1:1:11.2, constraining the grain composition. We find variations in the feature properties, indicating that different sightlines contain different types of silicates. In the average spectrum of our sample, we tentatively detect features around 3.4 and 6.2 &amp;mu;m, which are likely caused by aliphatic and aromatic/olefinic hydrocarbons, respectively. If real, to our knowledge, this is the first detection of hydrocarbons in purely diffuse sightlines with A(V) \leq 2.5, confirming the presence of these grains in diffuse environments. We detected a 3 &amp;mu;m feature toward HD073882, and tentatively in the sample average, likely caused by water ice (or solid-state water trapped on silicate grains). If confirmed, to our knowledge, this is the first detection of ice in purely diffuse sightlines with A(V) \leq 2.5, supporting previous findings that these molecules can exist in the diffuse ISM.

&lt;p&gt;
Early JWST observations are providing growing evidence for a ubiquitous population of accreting supermassive black holes (BHs) at high redshift, many of which appear overmassive compared to the empirically-derived local scaling relation between black hole mass and host galaxy stellar mass. In this study, we leverage predictions from the semi-analytical Cosmic Archaeology Tool (CAT) to reconstruct the evolutionary pathways for this overmassive BH population, investigating how they assemble over cosmic time and interact with their host galaxies. We find that the large M_{\rm BH}-M_{\rm star} ratios can be explained if light and heavy BH seeds grow by short, repeated episodes of super-Eddington accretion, triggered by major galaxy mergers. On average, we find that BH-galaxy co-evolution starts in earnest only at z &amp;lt; 8, when ~eq 30&amp;percnt; of the final galaxy stellar mass has formed outside the massive black hole host. Our model suggests that super-Eddington bursts of accretion last between 0.5-3 Myr, resulting in a duty cycle of 1-4 &amp;percnt; for the target BH sample. The boost in luminosity of BHs undergoing super-Eddington accretion helps explaining the luminosity function of Active Galactic Nuclei observed by JWST. At the same time, a large population of these overmassive BHs are predicted to be inactive, with Eddington ratio \lambda_{\rm Edd} &amp;lt; 0.05, in agreement with recent observations.

``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) are an abundant high-redshift population newly discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). They are characterized by a red color in the rest-frame optical band, compact morphology, and broad Balmer emission lines ({\rm FWHM} \gtrsim 1000~{\rm km\,s^{-1}}) that suggest an AGN nature. Using a method of pixel-by-pixel color selection and relaxing the compactness criteria, we identify three of the first dual LRD candidates in the COSMOS-Web survey with projected separations of 0.\!\!^{\prime\prime}2-0.\!\!^{\prime\prime}4 (1-2 pkpc at their photometric redshifts). A comparison between existing LRD samples and mock data reveals that the projected separations of these dual LRD candidates are unlikely to result from chance projections of objects at different redshifts. In one case (CW-B5-15958), the dual LRD includes two bright sources (m_{\rm F444W}=24.3 and 24.8) with characteristic V-shape spectral energy distribution (SEDs) and photometric redshifts consistent with each other. We find that CW-B5-15958 has a faint off-centered component and a companion galaxy. In the other two dual systems, the brighter LRD exhibits a V-shape SED, while the fainter LRD (m_{\rm F444W}\gtrsim26) is undetected in both F115W and F150W. These discoveries suggest that the angular auto-correlation function (ACF) of LRDs exhibits a significant excess (~3\times10^2 times) on sub-arcsec (kilo-parsec) separations compared to the extrapolation of a power-law ACF of JWST-found AGNs measured over 10^{\prime\prime}-100^{\prime\prime}. Follow-up spectroscopic confirmation of their redshifts and the construction of a larger sample are essential to advance our understanding of the evolution of supermassive black holes and the importance of mergers in the early universe.

We report the discovery of an ultra-massive grand-design red spiral galaxy, named Zh\'ul\'ong (Torch Dragon), at z_{\rm phot} = 5.2^{+0.3}_{-0.2} in the JWST PANORAMIC survey, identified as the most distant bulge+disk galaxy with spiral arms known to date. Zh\'ul\'ong displays an extraordinary combination of properties: 1) a classical bulge centered in a large, face-on exponential stellar disk (half-light radius of R_{\rm e} = 3.7 \pm 0.1 \, \mathrm{kpc}), with spiral arms extending across 19 kpc; 2) a clear transition from the red, quiescent core (F150W-F444W=3.1 mag) with high stellar mass surface density (\log(\Sigma M_{\star}/M_{\odot} \, \mathrm{kpc}^{-2}) = 9.91_{-0.09}^{+0.11}) to the star-forming outer regions, as revealed by spatially resolved SED analysis, which indicates significant inside-out galaxy growth; 3) an extremely high stellar mass at its redshift, with \log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot})=11.03_{-0.08}^{+0.10} comparable to the Milky Way, and an implied baryon-to-star conversion efficiency (\epsilon ~ 0.3) that is 1.5 times higher than even the most efficient galaxies at later epochs; 4) despite an active disk, a relatively modest overall star formation rate (\mathrm{SFR} =66_{-46}^{+89} ~M_{\odot} \, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}), which is &amp;gt;0.5 dex below the star formation main sequence at z ~ 5.2 and &amp;gt;10 times lower than ultra-massive dusty galaxies at z=5-6. Altogether, Zh\'ul\'ong shows that mature galaxies emerged much earlier than expected in the first billion years after the Big Bang through rapid galaxy formation and morphological evolution. Our finding offers key constraints for models of massive galaxy formation and the origin of spiral structures in the early universe.

Direct-detection searches for dark matter are insensitive to dark matter particles that have large interactions with ordinary matter, which are stopped in the atmosphere or the Earth's crust before reaching terrestrial detectors. We use ``dark'' calibration images taken with the HgCdTe detectors in the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to derive novel constraints on sub-GeV dark matter candidates that scatter off electrons. We supplement the JWST analysis pipeline with additional masks to remove pixels with high-energy background events. For a 0.4% subcomponent of dark matter that interacts with an ultralight dark photon, we disfavor all previously allowed parameter space at high cross sections, and constrain some parameter regions for subcomponent fractions as low as ~0.01%.

We investigate the deconvolved color profiles of 223 disk galaxies at redshifts of z=1-3 observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as part of the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science survey (CEERS). The filters were selected to approximate the rest-frame B-Y color, which is used to identify U-shaped color profiles -- those becoming progressively bluer with increasing radius, then turning redder beyond a specific point. We find that 36% of Type II (down-bending) disks exhibit U-shaped color profiles with a minimum at or near the disk break. In contrast, no Type I (single-exponential) disks and only 9% of Type III (up-bending) disks show such a profile. The presence of U-shaped color profiles in Type II disks likely arises from the interplay between a star-formation threshold and spiral- or bar-driven secular radial migration of older stars outward. The fraction of Type II disks exhibiting a U-shaped color profile remains almost consistent across two redshift bins, z=1-2 and z=2-3, but is significantly lower than that observed in the local Universe, likely because the secular process of radial migration at high redshift may not have had sufficient time to significantly influence the disk structure. The absence of U-shaped color profiles in Type II disks could point to rapid rather than secular radial star migration potentially caused by violent clump instabilities, transporting both younger and older stars to the outer disk. Our results provide useful constraints on the formation and evolution models of disk galaxies in the early Universe.

&lt;p&gt;
This paper presents a deep MIRI/JWST medium resolution spectroscopy (MRS) covering the rest-frame optical spectrum of the GN-z11 galaxy. The [OIII]5008 and H\alpha emission lines are detected and spectroscopically resolved. The line profiles are well-modeled by a narrow Gaussian component with intrinsic FWHMs of 189\pm25 and 231\pm52 kms^{-1}, respectively. We do not find any evidence of a dominant broad H\alpha emission line component tracing a Broad Line Region in a type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, a broad (~430-470 kms^{-1}) and weak (&amp;lt; 20-30%) H\alpha line component, tracing a minor AGN contribution in the optical, cannot be ruled out completely with the sensitivity of the present data. The physical and excitation properties of the ionized gas are consistent with a low-metallicity starburst forming stars at a rate of SFR(H\alpha)=24 \pm3M_{\odot}yr^{-1}. The electron temperature of the ionized gas is T_{\mathrm{e}}(O^{++})=14000\pm2100K, while the direct-T_{\mathrm{e}} gas-phase metallicity is 12+\log(O/H)=7.91\pm0.07 (Z=0.17\pm0.03Z_{\odot}). The optical line ratios locate GN-z11 in the starburst or AGN region but more consistent with those of local low-metallicity starbursts and high-z luminous galaxies detected at redshifts similar to GN-z11. We conclude that the MRS optical spectrum of GN-z11 is consistent with that of a massive, compact, and low-metallicity starburst galaxy. Due to its high SFR and stellar mass surface densities, close to that of the densest stellar clusters, we speculate that GN-z11 could be undergoing a feedback-free, highly efficient starburst phase. Additional JWST data are needed to validate this scenario, and other recently proposed alternatives, to explain the existence of bright compact galaxies in the early Universe.

&lt;p&gt;
We present a study of a double-peaked Ly\alpha emitter, named LAE-11, found in the proximity zone of QSO J0910-0414 at z~6.6. We use a combination of deep photometric data from Subaru Telescope, HST, and JWST with spectroscopic data from Keck/DEIMOS, NIRCam WFSS and NIRSpec MSA to characterise the ionising and general properties of the galaxy, as well as the quasar environment surrounding it. We detect Ly\alpha, H\beta, [OIII] doublet, and H\alpha emission lines in the various spectral datasets. The presence of a double-peaked Ly\alpha line in the spectrum allows us to characterise the opening angle and lifetime of the QSO as \theta_Q&amp;gt;49.62{\deg} and t_Q &amp;gt; 3.8\times10^5 years. LAE-11 is a fairly bright (M_\rm{UV} = -19.84^{+0.14}_{-0.16}), blue galaxy with a UV slope of \beta = -2.61^{+0.06}_{-0.08}. Since the galaxy is located in a quasar-ionised region, we have a unique opportunity to measure the escape fraction of Lyman Continuum photons using the un-attenuated double-peaked Ly\alpha emission profile and its equivalent width at such high redshift. We employ diagnostics which do not rely on the detection of Ly\alpha for comparison, and find that all tracers of ionising photon leakage agree within 1\sigma uncertainty. We measure a moderate escape of Lyman Continuum photons from LAE-11 of f_\rm{esc}^\rm{LyC} = (8 - 33)&amp;percnt;. Detections of both H\alpha and H\beta emission lines allow for separate measurements of the ionising photon production efficiency, resulting with \log(\xi_\rm{ion}/\rm{Hz~erg^{-1}}) = 25.59\pm0.08 and 25.65\pm0.09, for H\alpha and H\beta, respectively. The total ionising output of LAE-11, \log(f_\rm{esc}^\rm{LyC}\xi_\rm{ion, H\alpha}/\rm{Hz~erg^{-1}}) = 24.85^{+0.24}_{-0.34}, is higher than the value of 24.3 - 24.8 which is traditionally assumed as needed to drive Reionisation forward.

The neglect of modelling both stellar and nebular emission significantly affects the derived physical properties of galaxies, particularly those with high star formation rates. While this issue has been studied, it has not been established a clear threshold for a significant impact on the estimated physical properties of galaxies due to accounting for both stellar and nebular emission. We analyse galaxies from SDSS-DR7 across a wide range of star-forming activity levels, comparing the results obtained from two spectral fitting tools: FADO (which considers both stellar and nebular continuum) and STARLIGHT (only considers the stellar continuum). A strong linear correlation is found between the rest-frame H\alpha and H\beta equivalent widths (EWs) and the optical nebular contribution, identifying these as reliable tracers. The results show that when the nebular contribution exceeds 8% (corresponding to EW(H\alpha)~eq500 \r{A} and EW(H\beta)~eq110 \r{A}), there is a significant impact on the estimation of galaxy properties, namely stellar mass, age and metallicity. Our results highlight the importance of taking into account both the stellar and nebular continuum when analysing the optical spectra of star-forming galaxies. In particular, this is a fundamental aspect for galaxies with a rest-frame EW(H\alpha)\gtrsim500 \r{A} (or the scaled value of 375 \r{A} for pseudo-continuum measures). At low redshifts, this mostly impacts extreme emission line galaxies, while at higher redshifts it becomes a dominant aspect given the higher star-forming activity in the younger Universe. In light of current JWST observations and future instruments designed for high-redshift observations, such as MOONS, this reveals as a critical issue to take into consideration.

We present a detailed investigation into the abundance and morphology of high redshift quenched galaxies at 3 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 7 using James Webb Space Telescope data in the NEP, CEERS and JADES fields. Within these fields, we identify 90 candidate passive galaxies using specific star formation rates modelled with the BAGPIPES SED fitting code, which is more effective at identifying recently quenched systems than the classical UVJ method. With this sample of galaxies, we find number densities broadly consistent with other works and a rapidly evolving passive fraction of high mass galaxies (\log_{10}{(M_{\star}/M_{\odot})} &amp;gt; 9.5) between 3 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 5. We find that the fraction of galaxies with low star formation rates and mass 9.5 &amp;lt; \log_{10}{(M_{\star}/M_{\odot})} &amp;lt; 10.5 decreases from ~25% at 3 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 4 to ~2% at 5 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 7. Our passive sample of galaxies is shown to exhibit more compact light profiles compared to star-forming counterparts and some exhibit traces of AGN activity through detections in either the X-ray or radio. At the highest redshifts (z &amp;gt; 6.5) passive selections start to include examples of 'little red dots' which complicates any conclusions until their nature is better understood.

&lt;p&gt;
We present JWST-NIRCam narrow-band, 4.05 &amp;mu;m Brackett-\alpha images of the Sgr C HII region, located in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Galaxy. Unlike any HII region in the Solar vicinity, the Sgr C plasma is dominated by filamentary structure in both Brackett-\alpha and the radio continuum. Some bright filaments, which form a fractured arc with a radius of about 1.85 pc centered on the Sgr C star-forming molecular clump, likely trace ionization fronts. The brightest filaments form a `\pi-shaped' structure in the center of the HII region. Fainter filaments radiate away from the surface of the Sgr C molecular cloud. The filaments are emitting optically thin free-free emission, as revealed by spectral index measurements from 1.28 GHz (MeerKAT) to 97 GHz (ALMA). But, the negative in-band 1 to 2 GHz spectral index in the MeerKAT data alone reveals the presence of a non-thermal component across the entire Sgr C HII region. We argue that the plasma flow in Sgr C is controlled by magnetic fields, which confine the plasma to rope-like filaments or sheets. This results in the measured non-thermal component of low-frequency radio emission plasma, as well as a plasma \beta (thermal pressure divided by magnetic pressure) below 1, even in the densest regions. We speculate that all mature HII regions in the CMZ, and galactic nuclei in general, evolve in a magnetically dominated, low plasma \beta regime.

&lt;p&gt;
Previous Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of the star-forming cluster NGC 346 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) had revealed a large population of pre-main sequence (PMS) candidates, characterised by Halpha excess emission in their photometry. However, without access to spectroscopy, the nature of these objects remained unclear. Using the NIRSpec instrument on board JWST, we studied a sample of these stars, with masses in the range ~0.9-1.8 Msun, effective temperatures in the range 4,500-8,000 K, and PMS ages between ~0.1 and 30 Myr. Here we present the first spectra of solar-mass PMS stars in the metal-poor SMC (Z=1/8 Zsun) and discuss the physical properties of ten representative sources with good signal-to-noise ratio. The observations indicate that even the oldest of these PMS candidates are still accreting gas with typical rates of ~10^{-8} Msun/yr for stars older than ~10 Myr, confirming their PMS nature. The spectra also reveal near-infrared excess and molecular hydrogen excitation lines consistent with the presence of discs around these stars. These findings suggest that in a low-metallicity environment circumstellar discs can live longer than previously thought.

We present a JWST MIRI/MRS spectrum of the inner disk of WISE J044634.16-262756.1B (hereafter J0446B), an old (~34 Myr) M4.5 star but with hints of ongoing accretion. The spectrum is molecule-rich and dominated by hydrocarbons. We detect 14 molecular species (H_2, CH_3, CH_4, C_2H_2, ^{13}CCH_2, C_2H_4, C_2H_6, C_3H_4, C_4H_2, C_6H_6, HCN, HC_3N, CO_2 and ^{13}CO_2) and 2 atomic lines ([Ne II] and [Ar II]), all observed for the first time in a disk at this age. The detection of spatially unresolved H_2 and Ne gas strongly supports that J0446B hosts a long-lived primordial disk, rather than a debris disk. The marginal H_2O detection and the high C_2H_2/CO_2 column density ratio indicate that the inner disk of J0446B has a very carbon-rich chemistry, with a gas-phase C/O ratio \gtrsim2, consistent with what have been found in most primordial disks around similarly low-mass stars. In the absence of significant outer disk dust substructures, inner disks are expected to first become water-rich due to the rapid inward drift of icy pebbles, and evolve into carbon-rich as outer disk gas flows inward on longer timescales. The faint millimeter emission in such low-mass star disks implies that they may have depleted their outer icy pebble reservoir early and already passed the water-rich phase. Models with pebble drift and volatile transport suggest that maintaining a carbon-rich chemistry for tens of Myr likely requires a slowly evolving disk with \alpha-viscosity \lesssim10^{-4}. This study represents the first detailed characterization of disk gas at ~30 Myr, strongly motivating further studies into the final stages of disk evolution.

Recent observations by JWST have revealed supersolar ^{14}N abundances in galaxies at very high redshift. On the other hand, these galaxies show subsolar metallicity. The observed N/O ratios are difficult to reproduce in the framework of chemical evolution models for the Milky Way. Our aim is to reproduce these high N/O ratios with chemical evolution models assuming different histories of star formation triggering galactic winds coupled with detailed nucleosynthesis prescriptions for ^{14}N, ^{12}C, ^{16}O and ^{56}Fe. We compute several models for small galaxies (10^{9}\text{ - }10^{10}\text{ M}_{\odot}) with high star formation efficiency and strong galactic winds. These winds are assumed to be differential, carrying out mainly the products of the explosion of core-collapse supernovae. We find that only models with high star formation rates, normal initial mass function, and differential galactic winds can reproduce the observed chemical abundances. We also find that with the same assumptions about star formation and galactic winds, but with a very rapid formation resulting from fast gas infall, we can also reproduce the estimated ages of these objects. We find no necessity to invoke peculiar nucleosynthesis from Population III stars, very massive stars and supermassive stars.

We report the discovery of a large (~ 10 kpc diameter), massive (\log(M_\star/M_\odot) = 10.15^{+0.01}_{-0.01}), grand-design spiral galaxy with photometric redshift z_{\text{phot}} = 4.03 in the UNCOVER and Medium Band Mega Science surveys with JWST. This is the highest redshift spiral galaxy discovered with JWST so far. In the rest-frame near-UV and far-UV, we clearly see the beads-on-a-string pattern of star formation; in the rest-frame visible bands, each string appears as an arm. Spectral energy distribution modeling using the Bagpipes code is strongly constrained by detections and flux measurements in 21 JWST and HST filters. The stellar mass-weighted age is 228 Myr, implying that 50% of the stars in the galaxy formed after z ~ 4.5. This is a highly star-forming galaxy with a star formation rate (SFR) of 57.57^{+1.80}_{-1.90} \, M_\odot\, \text{yr}^{-1}. We detect strong H-\alpha + [NII] emission from the entire disk. The detection of a spiral galaxy at z ~ 4 indicates that massive and large spiral galaxies and disks were already in place merely 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang.

&lt;p&gt;
Morphological classification of galaxies becomes increasingly challenging with redshift. We apply a hybrid supervised-unsupervised method to classify ~ 14,000 galaxies in the CANDELS fields at 0.2 \leq z \leq 2.4 into spheroid, disk, and irregular systems. Unlike previous works, our method is applied to redshift bins of width 0.2. Comparison between models applied to a wide redshift range versus bin-specific models reveals significant differences in galaxy morphology beyond z \geq 1 and a consistent ~ 25&amp;percnt; disagreement. This suggests that using a single model across wide redshift ranges may introduce biases due to the large time intervals involved compared to galaxy evolution timescales. Using the FERENGI code to assess the impact of cosmological effects, we find that flux dimming and smaller angular scales may lead to the misclassification of up to 18&amp;percnt; of disk galaxies as spheroids or irregulars. Contrary to previous studies, we find an almost constant fraction of disks (~ 60&amp;percnt;) and spheroids (~ 30&amp;percnt;) across redshifts. We attribute discrepancies with earlier works, which suggest a decreasing fraction of disks beyond z ~ 1, to the biases introduced by visual classification. Our claim is further strengthened by the striking agreement to the results reported by Lee et al. (2024) using an objective, unsupervised method applied to James Webb Space Telescope data. Exploring mass dependence, we observe a ~ 40&amp;percnt; increase in the fraction of massive (M_{\rm stellar} \geq 10^{10.5}{\rm M}_{\odot}) spheroids with decreasing redshift, well balanced with a decrease of ~ 20&amp;percnt; in the fraction of M_{\rm stellar} \geq 10^{10.5}{\rm M}_{\odot} disks, suggesting that merging massive disk galaxies may form spheroidal systems.

&lt;p&gt;
Recent findings from photometric and spectroscopic JWST surveys have identified examples of high-redshift galaxies at z \gtrsim 10. These high-z galaxies appear to form much earlier and exhibit greater UV luminosity than predicted by theoretical work. In this study, our goal is to reproduce the brightness of these sources by simulating high-redshift galaxies with virial masses M_{\rm vir} = 10^{9} - 10^{10} M_{\odot} at z &amp;gt; 10. To achieve this, we conduct cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations, modifying baryonic sub-grid physics, and post-process our simulation results to confirm the observability of our simulated galaxies. Specifically, we enhanced star formation activity in high-redshift galaxies by either increasing the star formation efficiency up to 100&amp;percnt; or adopting a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF). Our simulation results indicate that both increasing star formation efficiency and adopting a top-heavy IMF play crucial roles in boosting the UV luminosity of high-redshift galaxies, potentially exceeding the limiting magnitude of JWST surveys in earlier epochs. Especially, the episodic starburst resulting from enhanced star formation efficiency may explain the high-redshift galaxies observed by JWST, as it evacuates dust from star-forming regions, making the galaxies more observable. We demonstrate this correlation between star formation activity and dust mass evolution within the simulated galaxies. Also, adopting a top-heavy IMF could enhance observability due to an overabundance of massive stars, although it may also facilitate rapid metal enrichment. Using our simulation results, we derive several observables such as effective radius, UV slope, and emission line rates, which could serve as valuable theoretical estimates for comparison with existing spectroscopic results and forthcoming data from the JWST NIRSpec and MIRI instruments.

&lt;p&gt;
We present an analysis of eight star-forming galaxies with \langle z \rangle = 4.0 from the JWST EXCELS survey for which we obtain robust chemical abundance estimates for the \alpha-elements O, Ne and Ar. The \alpha-elements are primarily produced via core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) which should result in \alpha-element abundance ratios that do not vary significantly across cosmic time. However, Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) models predict an excess production of Ar relative to O and Ne. The Ar/O abundance ratio can therefore be used as a tracer of the relative enrichment of CCSNe and SNe Ia in galaxies. Our sample significantly increases the number of sources with measurements of {\rm Ar/O} at z &amp;gt; 2, and we find that our sample exhibits sub-solar Ar/O ratios on average, with \rm{Ar/O} = 0.65 \pm 0.10 \, (\rm{Ar/O})_{\odot}. In contrast, the average Ne/O abundance is fully consistent with the solar ratio, with \rm{Ne/O} = 1.07 \pm 0.12 \, (\rm{Ne/O})_{\odot}. Our results support a scenario in which Ar has not had time to build up in the interstellar medium of young high-redshift galaxies, which are dominated by CCSNe enrichment. We show that these abundance estimates are in good agreement with recent Milky Way chemical evolution models, and with Ar/O trends observed for planetary nebulae in the Andromeda galaxy. These results highlight the potential for using multiple element abundance ratios to constrain the chemical enrichment pathways of early galaxies with JWST.

We propose that modifications to the Higgs potential within a narrow atmospheric layer near the event horizon of an astrophysical black hole could significantly enhance the rate of sphaleron transitions, as well as transform the Chern-Simons number into a dynamic variable. As a result, sphaleron transitions in this region occur without suppression, in contrast to low-temperature conditions, and each transition may generate a substantially greater baryon number than would be produced by winding around the Higgs potential in Minkowski spacetime. This effect amplifies baryon number violation near the black hole horizon, potentially leading to a considerable generation of matter. Given the possibility of a departure from equilibrium during the absorption of matter and the formation of relativistic jets in supermassive black holes, we conjecture that this process could contribute to the creation of a significant amount of matter around such black holes. This phenomenon may offer an alternative explanation for the rapid growth of supermassive black holes and their surrounding galaxies in the early Universe, as suggested by recent observations from the JWST. Furthermore, this mechanism may provide insights into the low-mass gap puzzle, addressing the observed scarcity of black holes with masses near the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit.

HeH^+ was the first heteronuclear molecule to form in the metal-free Universe after the Big Bang. The molecule gained significant attention following its first circumstellar detection in the young and dense planetary nebula NGC 7027. We target some hydride ions associated with the noble gases (HeH^+, ArH^+, and NeH^+) to investigate their formation in harsh environments like the nova outburst region. We use a photoionization modeling (based on previously published best-fit physical parameters) of the moderately fast ONe type nova, QU Vulpeculae 1984, and the CO type novae, RS Ophiuchi and V1716 Scorpii. Our steady-state modeling reveals a convincing amount of HeH^+, especially in the dense clump of RS Ophiuchi and V1716 Scorpii. The calculated upper limit on the surface brightness of HeH^+ transitions suggests that the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) could detect some of them, particularly in sources like RS Ophiuchi and V1716 Scorpii, which have similar physical and chemical conditions and evolution. It must be clearly noted that the sources studied are used as templates, and not as targets for observations. The detection of these lines could be useful for determining the physical conditions in similar types of systems and for validating our predictions based on new electron-impact ro-vibrational collisional data at temperatures of up to 20,000 K.

We investigate the host galaxy properties of eight little red dots (LRDs) selected from the JWST UNCOVER survey, applying a new technique ({\tt\string GalfitS}) to simultaneously fit the morphology and spectral energy distribution using multi-band NIRCam images covering ~ 1-4\,&amp;mu; {\rm m}. We detect the host galaxy in only one LRD, MSAID38108 at z = 4.96, which has a stellar mass of \log (M_*/M_{\odot}) = 8.66^{+0.24}_{-0.23}, an effective radius R_e=0.66^{+0.08}_{-0.05} kpc, and a S\'ersic index n=0.71^{+0.07}_{-0.08}. No host emission centered on the central point source is found in the other seven LRDs. We derive stringent upper limits for the stellar mass of a hypothetical host galaxy by conducting realistic mock simulations that place high-redshift galaxy images under the LRDs. Based on the black hole masses estimated from the broad H\alpha emission line, the derived stellar mass limits are at least a factor of 10 lower than expected from the z \approx 0 scaling relation between black hole mass and host galaxy stellar mass. Intriguingly, four of the LRDs (50&amp;percnt; of the sample) show extended, off-centered emission, which is particularly prominent in the bluer bands. The asymmetric emission of two sources can be modeled as stellar emission, but the nature of the other two is unclear.

We combine stellar mass functions and the recent first JWST-based galaxy--black hole scaling relations at z=6 to for the first time compute the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass volume density at this epoch, and compare this to the integrated SMBH mass growth from the population of UV-luminous quasars at z&amp;gt;6. We show that even under very conservative assumptions almost all growth of supermassive black hole mass at z&amp;gt;6 does not take place in these UV-luminous quasars, but must occur in systems obscured through dust and/or with lower radiative efficiency than standard thin accretion disks. The `Soltan argument' is not fulfilled by the known population of bright quasars at z&amp;gt;6: the integrated SMBH mass growth inferred from these largely unobscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early Universe is by a factor \ge10 smaller than the total black hole mass volume density at z=6. This is valid under a large range of assumption about luminosity and mass functions as well as accretion modes, and is likely still at least a factor &amp;gt;2 smaller when accounting for the known obscuration fractions at this epoch. The resulting consequences are: &amp;gt;90%, possibly substantially more, of SMBH-buildup in the early Universe does not take place in luminous unobscured quasar phases, but has to occur in obscured systems, with dust absorbing most of the emitted UV--visible AGN emission, potentially with accretion modes with super-Eddington specific accretion rates. This is consistent with short lifetime arguments for luminous quasar phases from quasar proximity zone studies and clustering. This would remove the empirical need for slow SMBH growth and hence exotic `high-mass seed' black holes at early cosmic time. It also predicts a large population of luminous but very obscured lower-mass quasars at z&amp;gt;6, possibly the JWST `Little Red Dots'.

We present a joint analysis of high-resolution CO(2-1) and Paschen-\alpha emission lines to trace gas dynamics and spatially resolved star formation in ASPECS-LP.3mm.06, a z=1.1 main sequence galaxy. Utilizing data from the ALMA and JWST NIRCam Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS), we explore both ionized gas and molecular gas within this galaxy. With a substantial molecular gas fraction (f_\mathrm{mol} = 0.44 \pm 0.02), ASPECS-LP.3mm.06 remains on the star-forming main sequence and adheres to the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, indicating typical gas-to-star conversion efficiency. Our analysis reveals extended structures across multiple wavelengths, suggesting regulated star formation within a stable disk. The spatially resolved star formation efficiency (SFE) and kinematic analysis indicate that ASPECS-LP.3mm.06 features a smooth mass assembly process across bulge and disk. Additionally, the galaxy exhibits modest dust extinction (A_\mathrm{V} = 0.8), potentially linked to self-regulation during bulge formation. These findings position ASPECS-LP.3mm.06 as a prototypical galaxy, offering valuable insights into the mechanisms governing normal disk galaxy growth at z~1.

The intracluster medium (ICM) today is comprised largely of hot gas with clouds of cooler gas of unknown origin and lifespan. We analyze the evolution of cool gas (temperatures \lesssim10^{4.5} K) in the ICM of 352 galaxy clusters from the TNG-Cluster simulations, with present-day mass ~10^{14.3-15.4}\,{\rm M_\odot}. We follow the main progenitors of these clusters over the past ~13 billion years (since z\lesssim7) and find that, according to TNG-Cluster, the cool ICM mass increases with redshift at fixed cluster mass, implying that this cooler past of the ICM is due to more than just halo growth. The cool cluster gas at z\lesssim0.5 is mostly located in and around satellite galaxies, while at z\gtrsim2 cool gas can also accrete via filaments from the intergalactic medium. Lower-mass and higher-redshift clusters are more susceptible to cooling. The cool ICM mass correlates with the number of gaseous satellites and inversely with the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass. The average number of gaseous satellites decreases since z=2, correlating with the decline in the cool ICM mass over cosmic time, suggesting a link between the two. Concurrently, kinetic SMBH feedback shifts the ICM temperature distribution, decreasing the cool ICM mass inside-out. At z\approx0.5, the predicted \ion{Mg}{ii} column densities are in the ballpark of recent observations, where satellites and other halos contribute significantly to the total \ion{Mg}{ii} column density. Suggestively, a non-negligible amount of the ICM cool gas forms stars in-situ at early times, reaching ~10^{2}\,{\rm M_\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}} and an H\alpha surface brightness of ~10^{-17}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,arcsec^{-2}} at z\approx2, detectable with Euclid and JWST.

In this Letter, we investigate the turbulence and energy injection in the extended nebulae surrounding two luminous obscured quasars, WISEA J100211.29+013706.7 (z=1.5933) and SDSS J165202.64+172852.3 (z=2.9489). Utilizing high-resolution data from the NIRSpec IFU onboard the James Webb Space Telescope, we analyze the velocity fields of line-emitting gas in and around these quasars and construct the second-order velocity structure functions (VSFs) to quantify turbulent motions across different spatial scales. Our findings reveal a notable flattening in the VSFs from \approx\!3 kpc up to a scale of 10--20 kpc, suggesting that energy injection predominantly occurs at a scale \lesssim10 kpc, likely powered by quasar outflows and jet-driven bubbles. The extended spatial range of flat VSFs may also indicate the presence of multiple energy injection sources at these scales. For J1652, the turbulent energy in the host interstellar medium (ISM) is significantly higher than in tidally stripped gas, consistent with the expectation of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activities stirring up the host ISM. Compared to the VSFs observed on spatial scales of 10--50 kpc around lower-redshift UV-bright quasars, these obscured quasars exhibit higher turbulent energies in their immediate surroundings, implying different turbulence drivers between the ISM and halo-scale gas. Future studies with an expanded sample are essential to elucidate further the extent and the pivotal role of AGNs in shaping the gas kinematics of host galaxies and beyond.

&lt;p&gt;
We present the first spectroscopic confirmation of a dust-obscured dwarf galaxy, CEERS-14821. The analysis is performed combining JWST NIRCam broad-band photometry and NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopic data. From the detection of multiple rest-frame optical lines, we derive that CEERS-14821 is located at z=4.883\pm0.003. Moreover, from a secure detection of the H_{\alpha} and H_{\beta} we derived that the galaxy has a dust extinction ranging from Av=2.2 to Av=3.3, depending on the assumed reddening law. This value is extremely large given that we estimated a low stellar mass around log(M/Mo)=8.0-8.2. Moreover, using different metallicity tracers, we verify that the galaxy is also metal-rich, with 12+log(O/H)&amp;gt;8.3. This is well above the expectation from both the mass-metallicity relation and the fundamental mass-metalliticy relation. CEERS-14821 is going through a burst of star formation, there are no indications of a strong contribution from an active galactic nuclei (f(AGN)&amp;lt;0.5 with respect to the total dust luminosity). Based on the rest-frame optical images, this source has a size compatible with galaxies of similar stellar mass and redshift. Finally, with the current data, it seems that there are galaxies closely interacting with CEERS-14821.

We present results of cosmological zoom-in simulations of a massive protocluster down to redshift z\approx4 (when the halo mass is \approx10^{13} M_\odot) using the SWIFT code and the EAGLE galaxy formation model, focusing on supermassive black hole (BH) physics. The BH was seeded with a mass of 10^4 M_\odot at redshift z\approx17. We compare the base model that uses an Eddington limit on the BH accretion rate and thermal isotropic feedback by the AGN, with one where super-Eddington accretion is allowed, as well as two other models with BH spin and jets. In the base model, the BH grows at the Eddington limit from z=9 to z=5.5, when it becomes massive enough to halt its own and its host galaxy's growth through feedback. We find that allowing super-Eddington accretion leads to drastic differences, with the BH going through an intense but short super-Eddington growth burst around z\approx7.5, during which it increases its mass by orders of magnitude, before feedback stops further growth (of both the BH and the galaxy). By z\approx4 the galaxy is only half as massive in the super-Eddington cases, and an order of magnitude more extended, with the half-mass radius reaching values of a few physical kpc instead of a few hundred pc. The BH masses in our simulations are consistent with the intrinsic BH mass-stellar mass relation inferred from high-redshift observations by JWST. This shows that galaxy formation models using the \LambdaCDM cosmology are capable of reproducing the observed massive BHs at high redshift. Allowing jets, either at super- or sub-Eddington rates, has little impact on the host galaxy properties, but leads to lower BH masses as a consequence of higher feedback efficiencies.

We use James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) medium-resolution spectrometer (MRS) observations of 3C 293 (UGC 8782), CGCG 012-070 and NGC 3884 to investigate the origin of the H_2 emission. These three nearby Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) hosts are known to present H_2 emission excess relative to star-forming galaxies, as traced by the H_2 S(3)/PAH_{\rm 11.3&amp;mu; m} line ratio. We define the kinematically disturbed region (KDR) by the AGN and the virially dominated region (VDR) based on the H_2 line widths, using the W{\rm 80} parameter. From the correlations between W{\rm 80} and H_2 S(3)/PAH{\rm 11.3&amp;mu; m}, as well as the higher H2 S(5)/H2 S(3) and [Fe II]{\rm 5.34 &amp;mu; m}/PAH{\rm 11.3&amp;mu; m} ratios and flatter power-law temperature distributions observed in the KDR, we conclude that the H_2 emission in the KDR is primarily driven by shock-heated gas. For 3C 293, the KDR is co-spatial with the radio core, indicating that the origin of the shocks is the interaction of the radio jet with the interstellar medium, which is also responsible for the observed molecular and ionized gas outflows in this source. The other galaxies are weak radio sources; however, due to the lack of high-resolution radio images, we cannot rule out low-power jets as the origin of the shock-heated H_2. Our results indicate that the excess H_2 emission excess is associated to shock heating of the gas, generated by outflows or by the interaction of the radio jet with the ambient gas.

We present a detailed analysis of JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam observations of ZF-UDS-7329, a massive, quiescent galaxy at redshift z=3.2, which has been put forward to challenge cosmology and galaxy formation physics. We study on the impact of different star formation history (SFH) priors, stellar libraries, metallicity, and initial mass function assumptions. Our results show that ZF-UDS-7329, with a formed stellar mass of M_{\star} \approx 10^{11.4}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot} (surviving mass M_{\star\mathrm{,surv}} \approx 10^{11.2}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}) and a specific star-formation rate of \mathrm{sSFR} \approx 0.03 Gyr^{-1}, formed efficiently in the first billion years of the Universe. In agreement with previous work, we find that the spectrum is consistent with mass-weighted stellar ages of 1.3-1.8 Gyr, depending on the SFH prior used. A physically motivated rising SFH prior makes the formation history of ZF-UDS-7329 compatible with stellar mass and star-formation rate estimates of z&amp;gt;6 galaxies. Using NIRCam imaging, we identify a colour gradient indicative of an old, quiescent bulge and a younger disc component, as expected from a complex formation history. The inferred SFH is consistent a high stellar fraction of f_{\star}=M_{\star}/(f_b \cdot M_{\rm h}) \approx 100&amp;percnt; at z=7-12, implying an extremely high integrated star-formation efficiency. However, when considering cosmic variance and possible mergers as expected in over-dense environments -- as traced by ZF-UDS-7329 -- the stellar fractions could be reduced to f_{\star} \approx 50&amp;percnt;, which is more consistent with galaxy formation models and the stellar-to-halo mass relation at lower redshifts. We conclude that ZF-UDS-7329 forms extremely efficient in the early universe, but does not necessitate unseen galaxies at higher redshifts since the inferred SFR of ancestors are consistent with those seen in z&amp;gt;6 galaxies.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered an abundance of z&amp;gt;10 galaxies bright in the ultraviolet (UV) that has challenged traditional theoretical models at high redshifts. Recently, various new models have emerged to address this discrepancy by refining their description of star formation. Here we investigate whether modifications to the stellar initial mass function (IMF) alone can reproduce the z&amp;gt;10 UV luminosity functions (UV LFs) when the star formation rate is used as a proxy for the fraction of massive stars. We incorporate an Evolving IMF into the {\sc astraeus} galaxy evolution and reionisation simulation framework, which becomes increasingly top-heavy as the gas density in a galaxy rises above a given threshold. Our implementation accounts for the IMF's effects on supernova (SN) feedback, metal enrichment, and the UV and ionising emissivities. For this Evolving IMF model, we find that (i) the maximum UV luminosity enhancement is twice as large in massive galaxies (\Delta M_\mathrm{UV}~eq2.6) than those where star formation is strongly limited by SN feedback (\Delta M_\mathrm{UV}~eq1.3); (ii) it successfully reproduces the observed UV LFs at z=5-15; (iii) galaxies with top-heavy IMFs exhibit the highest star formation rates, driven by their location in local density peaks, which facilitates higher gas accretion rates; (iv) the 1\sigma variances in the UV luminosity are only slightly higher compared to when assuming a Salpeter IMF, but the 2\sigma variances are significantly increased by a factor of 1.4-2 boosting the abundance of UV-bright galaxies at z&amp;gt;10; (v) reionisation begins earlier with more extended large ionised regions and fewer smaller ones during its initial stages, though these differences diminish at lower redshifts, leading to a similar end of reionisation at z~eq5.6.}

Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered massive galaxies at high redshifts, with their abundance significantly surpassing expectations. This finding poses a substantial challenge to both galaxy formation models and our understanding of cosmology. Additionally, discrepancies between the Hubble parameter inferred from high-redshift cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations and those derived from low-redshift distance ladder methods have led to what is known as the ``Hubble tension''. Among the most promising solutions to this tension are Early Dark Energy (EDE) models. In this study, we employ an axion-like EDE model in conjunction with a universal Salpeter initial mass function to fit the luminosity function derived from JWST data, as well as other cosmological probes, including the CMB, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and the SH0ES local distance ladder. Our findings indicate that JWST observations favor a high energy fraction of EDE, f_\text{EDE} ~ 0.2 \pm 0.03 , and a high Hubble constant value of H_0 ~ 74.6 \pm 1.2 km/s/Mpc, even in the absence of SH0ES data. This suggests that EDE not only addresses the H_0 tension but also provides a compelling explanation for the observed abundance of massive galaxies identified by JWST.

&lt;p&gt;
The scenario of feedback-free starbursts (FFB), which predicts excessively bright galaxies at cosmic dawn as observed using JWST, may provide a natural setting for black hole (BH) growth. This involves the formation of intermediate-mass seed BHs and their runaway mergers into super-massive BHs with high BH-to-stellar mass ratios and low AGN luminosities. We present a scenario of merger-driven BH growth in FFB galaxies and study its feasibility. BH seeds form within the building blocks of the FFB galaxies, namely, thousands of compact star clusters, each starbursting in a free-fall time of a few Myr before the onset of stellar and supernova feedback. The BH seeds form by rapid core collapse in the FFB clusters, in a few free-fall times, sped up by the migration of massive stars due to the young, broad stellar mass function and stimulated by a `gravo-gyro' instability due to internal cluster rotation and flattening. BHs of 10^4 M_\odot are expected in 10^6 M_\odot FFB clusters within sub-kpc galactic disks at z ~ 10. The BHs then migrate to the galaxy center by dynamical friction, hastened by the compact FFB stellar galactic disk configuration. Efficient mergers of the BH seeds will produce 10^{6-8} M_\odot BHs with a BH-to-stellar mass ratio ~ 0.01 by z ~ 4-7, as observed. The growth of the central BH by mergers can overcome the bottleneck introduced by gravitational wave recoils if the BHs inspiral within a relatively cold disk or if the escape velocity from the galaxy is boosted by a wet compaction event. Such events, common in massive galaxies at high redshifts, can also help by speeding up the inward BH migration and by providing central gas to assist with the final parsec problem. The cold disk version of the FFB scenario provides a feasible route for the formation of supermassive BHs.

The H{\alpha} nebular emission line is an optimal tracer for recent star formation in galaxies. With the advent of JWST, this line has recently become observable at z&amp;gt;3 for the first time. We present a catalog of 1013 H{\alpha} emitters at 3.7&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6.7 in the GOODS fields obtained from a blind search in JWST NIRCam/grism data. We make use of the FRESCO survey's 124 arcmin^2 of observations in GOODS-North and GOODS-South with the F444W filter, probing H{\alpha} at 4.9&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6.7; and the CONGRESS survey's 62 arcmin^2 in GOODS-North with F356W, probing H{\alpha} at 3.8&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;5.1. We find an overdensity with 97 sources at z~4.4 in GOODS-N and confirm previously reported overdensities at z~5.2 in GOODS-N and at z~5.4 and z~5.9 in GOODS-S. We compute the observed H{\alpha} luminosity functions (LFs) in three bins centered at z~4.45, 5.30, and 6.15, which are the first such measurements at z&amp;gt;3 obtained based purely on spectroscopic data, robustly tracing galaxy star formation rates (SFRs) beyond the peak of the cosmic star formation history. We compare our results with theoretical predictions from three different simulations and find good agreement at z~4-6. The UV LFs of this spectroscopically-confirmed sample are in good agreement with pre-JWST measurements obtained with photometrically-selected objects. Finally, we derive SFR functions and integrate these to compute the evolution of the cosmic star-formation rate densities across z~4-6, finding values in good agreement with recent UV estimates from Lyman-break galaxies, which imply a continuous decrease in SFR density by a factor of 3x over z~4 to z~6. Our work shows the power of NIRCam grism observations to efficiently provide new tests for early galaxy formation models based on emission line statistics.

Previous as well as recent observations by ISO, Spitzer, AKARI, SOFIA, JWST etc. have revealed various characteristics of mid-infrared emission bands between 3-20 micron. Subsequently, several forms of organics including Polycylic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)/PAH-like molecules are proposed as carriers for these bands. Deuterated PAH (PAD) is one such substituted PAH, which is proposed as a potential candidate carrier for weak emission bands at 4.4 and 4.65 micron, detected towards few astronomical targets and are characteristics of aromatic and aliphatic C-D stretching modes in a PAD molecule, respectively. However, the 4.4 micron band is not widely detected. In order to validate PADs as carriers for mid-infrared emission bands, an additional alternative tool is crucial. If PAHs are deuterated, they should also possess an inherent signature from the C-D out-of-plane (C-Doop) vibrations, which are at the longer wavelength side. In this report, features due to C-Doop modes in PAHs bearing a single to multiple deuterium atoms are reported by performing quantum-chemical calculations. This paper reports that some of the C-Doop vibrations appear at the 14-19 micron range. Also, the strength of C-Doop modes is not proportional to the D/H ratio in PAHs. In addition, a moderate change in the spectra of deuterated PAHs is observed from that of the undeuterated counterparts, as deuteration would alternate the adjacency class of the C-H bonds and the symmetry of the molecule. We discuss the efficiency and usefulness of these bands to constrain the form of PAHs emitting mid-infrared emission bands.

The removal of angular momentum from protostellar systems drives accretion onto the central star and may drive the dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Winds and jets can contribute to removing angular momentum from the disk, though the dominant process remain unclear. To date, observational studies of resolved disk winds have mostly targeted highly inclined disks. We report the detection of extended H2 and [Ne II] emission toward the young stellar object SY Cha with the JWST Mid-InfraRed Instrument Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI-MRS). This is one of the first polychromatic detections of extended H2 toward a moderately inclined, i=51.1 degrees, Class II source. We measure the semi-opening angle of the H2 emission as well as build a rotation diagram to determine the H2 excitation temperature and abundance. We find a wide semi-opening angle, high temperature, and low column density for the H2 emission, all of which are characteristic of a disk wind. We derive a molecular wind mass loss rate of 3+-2e-9 Msun/yr, which is high compared to the previously derived stellar accretion rate of 6.6e-10 Msun/yr. This suggests either that the stellar accretion and the disk wind are driven by different mechanisms or that accretion onto the star is highly variable. These observations demonstrate MIRI-MRS's utility in expanding studies of resolved disk winds beyond edge-on sources.

&lt;p&gt;
We investigate the star formation-AGN connection in the Seyfert 1 NGC 7469 using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) mid-infrared spectroscopic integral field unit (IFU) data. We use the IFU data to generate maps of different emission lines present in the spectrum, such as the star formation (SF) tracer [Ne II] 12.81{&amp;mu;}m, and the AGN tracer [Ne V] 14.32{&amp;mu;}m. We can separate the AGN- and SF-dominated regions using spatially resolved mid-infrared diagnostic diagrams, and further investigate the ionization sources powering each region by constructing photoionization models. We find that the previously detected eastern wind populates an intermediary region of the diagrams, between our star-forming and AGN points. Although it is possible that the star-forming ring may inherently not be uniform, this wind also coincides with a reduction in the [Ne II] emission in the ring, which suggests that the ionization cone intersects the ring in this direction.

&lt;p&gt;
The radial gradient of gas-phase metallicity is a powerful probe of the chemical and structural evolution of star-forming galaxies, closely tied to disk formation and gas kinematics in the early universe. We present spatially resolved chemical and dynamical properties for a sample of 25 galaxies at 0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 1.7 from the \msasd survey. These innovative observations provide 3D spectroscopy of galaxies at a spatial resolution approaching JWST's diffraction limit and a high spectral resolution of R~eq2700. The metallicity gradients measured in our galaxy sample range from -0.03 to 0.02 dex~kpc^{-1}. Most galaxies exhibit negative or flat radial gradients, indicating lower metallicity in the outskirts or uniform metallicity throughout the entire galaxy. We confirm a tight relationship between stellar mass and metallicity gradient at z~1 with small intrinsic scatter of 0.02 dex~kpc^{-1}. Our results indicate that metallicity gradients become increasingly negative as stellar mass increases, likely because the more massive galaxies tend to be more ``disky". This relationship is consistent with the predictions from cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations with strong stellar feedback. This work presents the effort to harness the multiplexing capability of JWST NIRSpec/MSA in slit-stepping mode to map the chemical and kinematic profiles of high-redshift galaxies in large samples and at high spatial and spectral resolution.

&lt;p&gt;
We use the inferred evolution of Lyman-\alpha luminosities of galaxies in the redshift range of z ~ 9-16 from the {James \ Webb \ Space \ Telescope} (JWST) data to predict the power spectrum of Loeb-Rybicki haloes formed by the scattering of Lyman-\alpha photons from neutral hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium expanding with the Hubble flow, until they Doppler shift out of resonance and escape towards the observer. This leads to the formation of the so-called Loeb-Rybicki intergalactic haloes, which are expected to be prominent even before the epoch of reionization. We find excellent prospects for a statistical detection of the intensity mapping signal from the clustering of these haloes, with current and future experiments such as the JWST, SPHEREx and CDIM. We also describe the detectability of the signal in cross-correlation with the 21-cm emission from the neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium at these redshifts. We find that the cross-correlation signal should be detectable at a significance of a few to a few tens of standard deviations out to z ~ 13 and marginally out to z ~ 16, using the above experiments in combination with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA)-LOW and its pathfinder, the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA).

Over the last decade, the Atacama Large Millimeter Array has revealed massive, dusty star-forming galaxies at z\gtrsim5, and the James Webb Space Telescope is primed to uncover even more information about them. These observations need dust evolution theory to provide context and are excellent benchmarks to test this theory. Here, we investigate the evolution of galactic dust budget at cosmic dawn using a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations of moderately massive, high-redshift (M_{\rm star}\gtrsim10^9 M_{\odot}; z\gtrsim5) galaxies from the FIRE project, the highest resolution (m_{\rm b} \approx 7100\, M_{\odot}) of such simulations to date. Our simulations incorporate a dust evolution model that accounts for the dominant sources of dust production, growth, and destruction and follows the evolution of specific dust species, allowing it to replicate a wide range of present-day observations. We find, similar to other theoretical works, that dust growth via gas-dust accretion is the dominant producer of dust mass for these massive, z\gtrsim 5 galaxies. However, our fiducial model produces M_{\rm dust} that fall {\gtrsim}1 dex below observations at any given M_{\rm star} (typical uncertainties are {~}1 dex), which we attribute to reduced accretion efficiencies caused by a combination of low galactic metallicities and extremely bursty star formation. Modest enhancements (i.e., within observational/theoretical uncertainties) to accretion and SNe II dust creation raise M_{\rm dust} by {\lesssim}1 dex, but this still falls below observations which assume T_{\rm dust}~25 K. One possibility is that inferred dust masses for z\gtrsim4 galaxies are overestimated, and recent observational/analytical works that find T_{\rm dust}~50 K along with metallicity constraints tentatively support this.

We present new free-form and hybrid mass reconstructions of the galaxy cluster lens MACS J0416.1-2403 at z=0.396 using the lens inversion method GRALE. The reconstructions use 237 spectroscopically confirmed multiple images from Bergamini et. al. 2023 as the main input. Our primary model reconstructs images to a positional accuracy of 0.191", thus representing one of the most precise reconstructions of this lens to date. Our models find broad agreement with previous reconstructions, and identify two ~ 10^{12} M_{\odot} light-unaffiliated substructures. We focus on two highly magnified arcs: Spock and Mothra. Our model features a unique critical curve structure around the Spock arc with 2 crossings. This structure enables sufficient magnification across this arc to potentially explain the large number of transients as microlensing events of supergiant stars. Additionally, we develop a model of the millilens substructure expected to be magnifying Mothra, which may be a binary pair of supergiants with &amp;mu; ~ 6000. This model accounts for flexibility in the millilens position while preserving the observed flux and minimizing image position displacements along the Mothra arc. We constrain the millilens mass and core radius to \lesssim 10^6 M_{\odot} and \lesssim 17 pc, respectively, which would render it one of the smallest and most compact substructures constrained by lensing. If the millilens is dominated by wave dark matter, the axion mass is constrained to be \lesssim 3.0 \times 10^{-21} eV. Further monitoring of this lens with JWST will uncover more transients, permitting tighter constraints on the structure surrounding these two arcs.

&lt;p&gt;
The stellar structures of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) undergo significant size growth during their mass assembly and must pass through a compaction phase as they evolve into quiescent galaxies (QGs). To shed light on the mechanisms behind this structural evolution, we study the morphology of the star-forming components of 665 SFGs at 0&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;2.5 measured using JWST/MIRI observation and compare them with the morphology of their stellar components taken from the literature. The stellar and star-forming components of most SFGs (66%) have extended disk-like structures that are aligned with each other and are of the same size. The star-forming components of these galaxies follow a mass-size relation, similar to that followed by their stellar components. At the highest mass, the optical S\'ersic index of these SFGs increases to 2.5, suggesting the presence of a dominant stellar bulge. Because their star-forming components remain disk-like, these bulges cannot have formed by secular in-situ growth. We identify a second population of galaxies lying below the MIR mass-size relation, with compact star-forming components embedded in extended stellar components (EC galaxy). These galaxies are overall rare (15%) but become more dominant (30%) at high mass (&amp;gt;10^{10.5}M_\odot). The compact star-forming components of these galaxies are also concentrated and slightly spheroidal, suggesting that this compaction phase can build dense bulge in-situ. Finally, we identify a third population of SFGs (19%), with both compact stellar and star-forming components. The density of their stellar cores resemble those of QGs and are compatible with being the descendants of EC galaxy. Overall, the structural evolution of SFGs is mainly dominated by a secular inside-out growth, which can, however, be interrupted by violent compaction phase(s) that can build dominant stellar bulges like those in massive SFGs or QGs.

JWST is revolutionizing our view of the early Universe by pushing the boundaries of detectable galaxies and black holes in redshift (upward) and mass (downward). The Little Red Dots (LRDs), detected by several surveys at z &amp;gt; 4, present a significant interpretational challenge, as their Spectral Energy Distributions (SED) can mimic both AGN and stellar population templates. This study analyzes 19 LRDs from the JADES survey, utilizing NIRCam and MIRI photometry. By performing SED fitting across a vast parameter space, we explore a broad range of AGN fractions, defined as the ratio of the monochromatic luminosities (AGN, galaxy, and dust) over a specified wavelength range, 0.4 - 0.7 &amp;mu; m rest-frame. We find that 17 of the 19 LRDs investigated are consistent with having significant AGN contributions, with best-fitting AGN fractions ranging between 20% and 70%, while one galaxy shows a low AGN contribution (2%) and another appears to be purely star-forming. Moreover, assuming these LRDs do indeed host AGN, we can place limits on their black hole masses using the inferred AGN bolometric luminosities and adopting the Eddington limit. We find that, independent of the specific AGN fraction adopted, the LRDs' black holes are significantly overmassive relative to their host galaxies -- by ~ 1 dex, and up to ~ 4 dex in the most extreme cases -- compared to the local M_{\bullet} - M_{\star} relation. The presence of overmassive black holes in the high-z Universe may provide the strongest evidence yet of heavy black hole seeding occurring during the cosmic dark ages.

Recent JWST observations have uncovered an unexpectedly large population of massive quiescent galaxies at z&amp;gt;3. Using the cosmological simulations IllustrisTNG and ASTRID, we identify analogous galaxies and investigate their abundance, formation, quenching mechanisms, and post-quenching evolution for stellar masses 9.5 &amp;lt; \log_{10}{(M_\star/{\rm M}_\odot)} &amp;lt; 12. We apply three different quenching definitions and find that both simulations significantly underestimate the comoving number density of quenched massive galaxies at z \gtrsim 3 compared to JWST observations by up to ~ 2 dex. In both simulations, the high-z quenched massive galaxies often host overmassive central black holes above the local M_{BH}-M_\star relation, implying that AGN feedback is key in quenching galaxies in the early Universe. The typical quenching timescales for these galaxies are ~ 200-600 Myr. IllustrisTNG primarily employs AGN kinetic feedback, while ASTRID relies on AGN thermal feedback at z &amp;gt; 2.3, which is less effective and has a longer quenching timescale. Although these simulations differ in many aspects, making a direct comparison challenging, our findings suggest the need for improved physical models of AGN feedback in galaxy formation simulations. At lower stellar masses, the quenched galaxies have denser local environments than the star-forming galaxies, suggesting that environmental quenching helps quench less massive galaxies. We also study the post-quenching evolution of the high-z massive quiescent galaxies and find that many experience subsequent reactivation of star formation, evolving into primary progenitors of z=0 brightest cluster galaxies.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has spectroscopically confirmed numerous galaxies at z &amp;gt; 10. While weak rest-ultraviolet emission lines have only been seen in a handful of sources, the stronger rest-optical emission lines are highly diagnostic and accessible at mid-infrared wavelengths with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) of JWST. We report the photometric detection of the distant spectroscopically confirmed galaxy JADES-GS-z14-0 at z = 14.32^{+0.08}_{-0.20} with MIRI at 7.7\ &amp;mu;\mathrm{m}. The most plausible solution for the stellar population properties is that this galaxy contains half a billion solar masses in stars with a strong burst of star formation in the most recent few million years. For this model, at least one-third of the flux at 7.7\ &amp;mu;\mathrm{m} comes from the rest-optical emission lines \mathrm{H}\beta and/or \mathrm{[OIII]}\lambda\lambda4959,5007. The inferred properties of JADES-GS-z14-0 suggest rapid mass assembly and metal enrichment during the earliest phases of galaxy formation. This work demonstrates the unique power of mid-infrared observations in understanding galaxies at the redshift frontier.

We conduct a first comprehensive study of the Luminosity Function (LF) using a non-parametric approach. We use Gaussian Process to fit available luminosity data between redshifts z ~ 2-8. Our free-form LF in the non-parametric approach rules out the conventional Schechter function model to describe the abundance-magnitude relation at redshifts z=3 and 4. Hints of deviation from the Schechter function are also noticed at redshifts 2, 7 and 8 at lower statistical significance. Significant deviation starts for brighter ionizing sources at M_{\rm UV} \lesssim -21. The UV luminosity density data at different redshifts are then derived by integrating the LFs obtained from both methods with a truncation magnitude of -17. In our analysis, we also include the first 90 arcmin^2 JWST/NIRCam data at z ~ 9-12. Since at larger magnitudes, we do not find major deviations from the Schechter function, the integrated luminosity density differs marginally between the two methods. Finally, we obtain the history of reionization from a joint analysis of UV luminosity density data along with the ionization fraction data and Planck observation of Cosmic Microwave Background. The history of reionization is not affected by the deviation of LFs from Schechter function at lower magnitudes. We derive reionization optical depth to be \tau_{\rm re}=0.0494^{+0.0007}_{-0.0006} and the duration between 10&amp;percnt; and 90&amp;percnt; completion of ionization process is found to be \Delta z~ 1.627^{+0.059}_{-0.071}.

JWST is providing constraints on the history of reionization owing to its ability to detect faint galaxies at z\gg6. Modeling this history requires understanding both the ionizing photon production rate (\xi_{\rm ion}) and the fraction of those photons that escape into the intergalactic medium (f_{\rm esc}). Observational estimates of these quantities generally rely on spectroscopy for which large samples with well-defined selection functions are limited. To overcome this challenge, we present and release an implicit likelihood inference pipeline, PHOTONIOn, trained on mock photometry to predict the escaped ionizing luminosity of individual galaxies (\dot{N}_{\rm ion}) based on photometric magnitudes and redshifts. We show that PHOTONIOn is able to reliably infer \dot{N}_{\rm ion} from photometry. This is in contrast to traditional SED-fitting approaches which rely on f_{\rm esc} prescriptions that often over-predict \dot{N}_{\rm ion} for LyC-dim galaxies, even when given access to spectroscopic data. We have deployed PHOTONIOn on a sample of 4,559 high-redshift galaxies from the JADES Deep survey, finding gentle redshift evolutions of \log_{10}(\dot{N}_{\rm ion}) = (0.08\pm0.01)z + (51.60\pm0.06) and \log_{10}(f_{\rm esc}\xi_{\rm ion}) = (0.07\pm0.01)z + (24.12\pm0.07). Late-time values for the ionizing photon production rate density are consistent with theoretical models and observations. We measure the evolution of the IGM ionized fraction to find that observed populations of star-forming galaxies are capable of driving reionization in GOODS-S to completion by z~ 5.3 without the need for AGN or other exotic sources, consistent with other studies of the same field. The 20&amp;percnt; of UV-brightest galaxies (M_{\rm UV}&amp;lt;-18.5) reionize 35&amp;percnt; of the survey volume, demonstrating that UV faint LyC emitters are crucial for reionization.

&lt;p&gt;
We study of the role of galaxy-galaxy interactions and disk instabilities in producing starburst activity in galaxies out to z = 4. For this, we use a sample of 387 galaxies with robust total star formation rate measurements from Herschel, gas masses from ALMA, stellar masses and redshifts from multi-band photometry, and JWST/NIRCam rest-frame optical imaging. Using mass-controlled samples, we find an increased fraction of interacting galaxies in the starburst regime at all redshifts out to z = 4. This increase correlates with star formation efficiency (SFE), but not with gas fraction. However, the correlation is weak (and only significant out to z = 2), which could be explained by the short duration of SFE increase during interaction. In addition, we find that isolated disk galaxies make up a significant fraction of the starburst population. The fraction of such galaxies with star-forming clumps ("clumpy disks") is significantly increased compared to the main-sequence disk population. Furthermore, this fraction directly correlates with SFE. This is direct observational evidence for a long-term increase of SFE maintained due to disk instabilities, contributing to the majority of starburst galaxies in our sample and hence to substantial mass growth in these systems. This result could also be of importance for explaining the growth of the most massive galaxies at z &amp;gt; 6.

We present constraints on the spacetime variation of the fine-structure constant \alpha at redshifts 2.5\le z&amp;lt;9.5 using JWST emission-line galaxies. The galaxy sample consists of 621 high-quality spectra with strong and narrow [O III] \lambda\lambda4959,5007 doublet emission lines from 578 galaxies, including 232 spectra at z&amp;gt;5. The [O III] doublet lines are arguably the best emission lines to probe the variation in \alpha. We divide our sample into six subsamples based on redshift and calculate the relative variation \Delta\alpha/\alpha for the individual subsamples. The calculated \Delta\alpha/\alpha values are consistent with zero within 1\sigma at all redshifts, suggesting no time variation in \alpha above a level of (1-2) \times10^{-4} (1\sigma) in the past 13.2 billion years. When the whole sample is combined, the constraint is improved to be \Delta\alpha/\alpha = (0.2\pm0.7) \times10^{-4}. We further test the spatial variation in \alpha using four subsamples of galaxies in four different directions on the sky. The measured \Delta\alpha/\alpha values are consistent with zero at a 1\sigma level of ~ 2\times10^{-4}. While the constraints in this work are not as stringent as those from lower-redshift quasar absorption lines in previous studies, this work uses an independent tracer and provides the first constraints on \Delta\alpha/\alpha at the highest redshifts. With the growing number of emission-line galaxies from JWST, we expect to achieve stronger constraints in the future.

Strong gravitational magnifications enable to detect faint background sources, resolve their internal structures, and even identify individual stars in distant galaxies. Highly magnified individual stars allow various applications, including studies of stellar populations in distant galaxies and constraining dark matter structures in the lensing plane. However, these applications have been hampered by the small number of individual stars observed, as typically one or a few stars are identified from each distant galaxy. Here, we report the discovery of more than 40 microlensed stars in a single galaxy behind Abell 370 at redshift of 0.725 when the Universe was half of its current age (dubbed ``the Dragon arc''), using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations with the time-domain technique. These events are found near the expected lensing critical curves, suggesting that these are magnified stars that appear as transients from intracluster stellar microlenses. Through multi-wavelength photometry, we constrain stellar types and find that many of them are consistent with red giants/supergiants magnified by factors of hundreds. This finding reveals an unprecedented high occurrence of microlensing events in the Dragon arc, and proves that {\it JWST}'s time-domain observations open up the possibility of conducting statistical studies of high-redshift stars.

Superradiance provides a unique opportunity for investigating dark sectors as well as primordial black holes, which themselves are candidates for dark matter over a wide mass range. Using axion-like particles as an example, we show that line signals emerging from a superradiated axion cloud combined with black hole Hawking radiation in extragalactic and galactic halos, along with microlensing observations lead to complementary constraints on parameter space combinations including the axion-photon coupling, axion mass, black hole mass, and its dark matter fraction, f_{\rm PBH}. For the asteroid mass range ~10^{16}-10^{22}~{\rm g}, where primordial black holes can provide the totality of dark matter, we demonstrate that ongoing and upcoming observations such as SXI, JWST, and AMEGO-X will be sensitive to possible line and continuum signals, respectively, providing probes of previously inaccessible regions of f_{\rm PBH} parameter space. Further complementarity from a stochastic gravitational-wave background emerging from the black hole formation mechanism is also considered.

We study the reionization of the Universe due to haloes that host galaxies undergoing bursts of star formation. By comparing the recent results from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation EAGLE at z\ge 6, we find that bursty galaxies have specific star formation rate, sSFR &amp;gt;10^{-2} Myr^{-1}, and magnitude, M_{\rm UV}\leq -17. Most of them reside in haloes of mass ~ 10^9 M_\odot and some in more massive haloes. We then construct the models of escape fraction and find that a skewed Gaussian function with a flat tail towards the high mass end best describes the mean dependence of escape fraction on halo mass, considering the haloes hosting bursty galaxies as the primary drivers of reionization. We implement the models of escape fraction in the code 21cmFAST to study the progress of reionization and derive the evolution of the mean ionized fraction that agrees well with observations. We also calculate the brightness temperature, spin temperature, and kinetic temperature and further study the spatial fluctuations in these quantities to gain insights into the progress of reionization. We compute the 21 cm power spectrum and predict a peak in power at 180 MHz corresponding to redshift, z\approx 6.8, that is testable by the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Our findings suggest that the Universe was reionized by the haloes of \gtrsim 10^{9} M_\odot.

The exceptional spectra of the most luminous z&amp;gt;10 sources observed so far have challenged our understanding of early galaxy evolution, requiring a new observational benchmark for meaningful interpretation. As such, we construct spectroscopic templates representative of high-redshift, star-forming populations, using 482 confirmed sources at z=5.0-12.9 with JWST/NIRSpec prism observations, and report on their average properties. We find z=5-11 galaxies are dominated by blue UV continuum slopes (\beta=-2.3 to -2.7) and reduced Balmer indices, characteristic of dust-poor and young systems, with a shift towards bluer slopes and younger ages with redshift. The evolution is mirrored by ubiquitous CIII] detections across all redshifts (rest-frame equivalent widths of =5-14 \r{A}), which increase in strength towards early times. Rest-frame optical lines reveal elevated ratios (O32=7-31, R23=5-8, and Ne3O2=1-2) and subsolar metallicities (log O/H=7.3-7.9), typical of ionization conditions and metallicities rarely observed in z~0 populations. Within our sample, we identify 57 Ly\alpha emitters, which we stack and compare to a matched sample of nonemitters. The former are characterized by more extreme ionizing conditions with enhanced CIII], CIV, and HeII+[OIII] line emission, younger stellar populations from Balmer jumps, and a more pristine interstellar medium seen through bluer UV slopes and elevated rest-frame optical line ratios. The novel comparison illustrates important intrinsic differences between the two populations, with implications for Ly\alpha visibility. The spectral templates derived here represent a new observational benchmark with which to interpret high-redshift sources, lifting our constraints on their global properties to unprecedented heights and extending out to the earliest of cosmic times.

We utilize deep JWST NIRCam observations for the first direct constraints on the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function (GSMF) at z&amp;gt;10. Our EPOCHS v1 sample includes 1120 galaxy candidates at 6.5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;13.5 taken from a consistent reduction and analysis of publicly available deep JWST NIRCam data covering the PEARLS, CEERS, GLASS, JADES GOOD-S, NGDEEP, and SMACS0723 surveys, totalling 187 arcmin^2. We investigate the impact of SED fitting methods, assumed star formation histories (SFH), dust laws, and priors on galaxy masses and the resultant GSMF. Whilst our fiducial GSMF agrees with the literature at z&amp;lt;13.5, we find that the assumed SFH model has a large impact on the GSMF and stellar mass density (SMD), finding a 0.75~dex increase in the SMD at z=10.5 between a flexible non-parametric and standard parametric SFH. Overall, we find a flatter SMD evolution at z \geq 9 than some studies predict, suggesting a rapid buildup of stellar mass in the early Universe. We find no incompatibility between our results and those of standard cosmological models, as suggested previously, although the most massive galaxies may require a high star formation efficiency. We find that the "Little Red Dot" galaxies dominate the z=7 GSMF at high-masses, necessitating a better understanding of the relative contributions of AGN and stellar emission. We show that assuming a theoretically motivated top-heavy IMF reduces stellar mass by 0.5~dex without affecting fit quality, but our results remain consistent with existing cosmological models with a standard IMF.

&lt;p&gt;
Recent studies based on JWST data reveals that the observed number density of massive galaxies in the early Universe appears to be higher than model predictions, which may pose a serious problem to the \lcdm ~cosmology. A major limitation in many previous studies is the large uncertainty in estimating \mstar due to the lack of constraints in the rest-frame near-infrared part of the spectral energy distribution, which is critical to determining \mstar accurately. Here we use multiwavelength data from a large {\it JWST}/MIRI survey in the PRIMER program to perform a systematic analysis of massive galaxies at z ~ 3-8, leveraging photometric constraints at rest-frame \gtrsim 1 &amp;mu;m. We find a significant reduction in the number and mass densities of massive galaxies at z &amp;gt; 5 compared to earlier results that did not use the MIRI photometry. Within the standard \LambdaCDM cosmology, our results require a moderate increase in the baryon-to-star conversion efficiency (\epsilon) towards higher redshifts and higher \mstar. For the most massive galaxies at z~ 8, the required \epsilon is ~ 0.3, in comparison to \epsilon ~ 0.14 for typical low-redshift galaxies. Our findings are consistent with models assuming suppressed stellar feedback due to the high gas density and the associated short free-fall time expected for massive halos at high redshifts.

The JWST discovery of ``little red dots'' (LRDs) is reshaping our picture of the early Universe, yet the physical mechanisms driving their compact size and UV-optical colors remain elusive. Here we report an unusually bright LRD (z=3.1) observed as part of the RUBIES program. This LRD exhibits broad emission lines (FWHM ~4000km/s), a blue UV continuum, a clear Balmer break and a red continuum sampled out to rest 4 &amp;mu;m with MIRI. We develop a new joint galaxy and AGN model within the Prospector Bayesian inference framework and perform spectrophotometric modeling using NIRCam, MIRI, and NIRSpec/Prism observations. Our fiducial model reveals a M_*~ 10^9M_\odot galaxy alongside a dust-reddened AGN driving the optical emission. Explaining the rest-frame optical color as a reddened AGN requires A_{\rm v}\gtrsim3, suggesting that a great majority of the accretion disk energy is re-radiated as dust emission. Yet despite clear AGN signatures, we find a surprising lack of hot torus emission, which implies that either the dust emission in this object must be cold, or the red continuum must instead be driven by a massive, evolved stellar population of the host galaxy -- seemingly inconsistent with the high EW broad lines (H\alpha EW ~800&amp;#8491;). The widths and luminosities of Pa\beta, Pa\delta, Pa\gamma, and H\alpha imply a modest black hole mass of M_{\rm BH}~10^8M_\odot. Additionally, we identify a narrow blue-shifted HeI absorption in G395M spectra, signaling an ionized outflow with kinetic energy up to ~1&amp;percnt; the luminosity of the AGN. The low redshift of RUBIES-BLAGN-1 combined with the depth and richness of the JWST imaging and spectroscopic observations provide a unique opportunity to build a physical model for these so-far mysterious LRDs, which may prove to be a crucial phase in the early formation of massive galaxies and their supermassive black holes.

With the wavelength coverage, sensitivity, and high spatial resolution of JWST, it is now possible to peer through the dust attenuation to probe the rest-frame near infrared (NIR) and stellar structures of extremely dusty galaxies at cosmic noon (z~1-3). In this paper we leverage the combined ALMA and JWST/HST coverage in Abell 2744 to study the multiwavelength (0.5-4.4{&amp;mu;}m) structures of 11 sub-millimeter (sub-mm) detected galaxies at z~0.9-3.5 that are fainter than bright "classical" sub-mm galaxies (SMGs); 7 of which are detected in deep X-ray data. While these objects reveal a diversity of structures and sizes, all are smaller and more concentrated towards longer wavelengths. Of the X-ray-detected objects, only two show evidence for appreciable AGN flux contributions (at {\gtrsim}2{&amp;mu;}m). Excluding the two AGN-dominated objects, the smaller long wavelength sizes indicate that their rest-frame NIR light profiles, inferred to trace their stellar mass profiles, are more compact than their optical profiles. The sub-mm detections and visible dust lanes suggest centrally-concentrated dust is a key driver of the observed color gradients. Further, we find that more concentrated galaxies tend to have lower size ratios (rest-frame NIR to optical); this suggests that the galaxies with the most compact light distributions also have the most concentrated dust. The 1.2mm flux densities and size ratios of these 9 objects suggest that both total dust quantity and geometry impact these galaxies' multiwavelength structures. Upcoming higher resolution 1.2mm ALMA imaging will facilitate joint spatially-resolved analysis and will directly test the dust distributions within this representative sub-mm population.

We study the co-evolution of dark matter halos, galaxies and supermassive black holes using an empirical galaxy evolution model from z=0 -- 10. We demonstrate that by connecting dark matter structure evolution with simple empirical prescriptions for baryonic processes, we are able to faithfully reproduce key observations in the relation between galaxies and their supermassive black holes. By assuming a physically-motivated, direct relationship between the galaxy and supermassive black hole properties to the mass of their host halo, we construct expressions for the galaxy stellar mass function, galaxy UV luminosity function, active black hole mass function and quasar bolometric luminosity function. We calibrate the baryonic prescriptions using a fully Bayesian approach in order to reproduce observed population statistics. The obtained parametrizations are then used to study the relation between galaxy and black hole properties, as well as their evolution with redshift. The galaxy stellar mass -- UV luminosity relation, black hole mass -- stellar mass relation, black hole mass -- AGN luminosity relation, and redshift evolution of these quantities obtained from the model are qualitatively consistent with observations. Based on these results, we present upper limits on the expected number of sources for z=5 up to z=15 for scheduled JWST and \textit{Euclid} surveys, thus showcasing that empirical models can offer qualitative as well as quantitative prediction in a fast, easy and flexible manner that complements more computationally expensive approaches.

Dual-phase xenon time projection chamber (TPC) detectors offer heightened sensitivities for dark matter detection across a spectrum of particle masses. To broaden their capability to low-mass dark matter interactions, we investigated the light and charge responses of liquid xenon (LXe) to sub-keV nuclear recoils. Using neutron events from a pulsed Adelphi Deuterium-Deuterium neutron generator, an in situ calibration was conducted on the LUX detector. We demonstrate direct measurements of light and charge yields down to 0.45 keV and 0.27 keV, respectively, both approaching single quanta production, the physical limit of LXe detectors. These results hold significant implications for the future of dual-phase xenon TPCs in detecting low-mass dark matter via nuclear recoils.

Aims. We analyze whether the effects of secular perturbations, originating from a substellar companion, on the dust dynamics in a debris disk can be investigated with spatially resolved observations. Methods. We numerically simulated the collisional evolution of narrow and eccentric cold planetesimal belts around a star of spectral type A3V that are secularly perturbed by a companion that orbits either closer to or farther from the star than the belt. Based on the resulting spatial dust distributions, we simulated spatially resolved maps of their surface brightness in the K, N, and Q bands and at wavelengths of 70&amp;mu;m and 1300&amp;mu;m. Results. Assuming a nearby debris disk seen face-on, we find that the brightness distribution varies significantly with observing wavelength, for example between the N and Q band. This can be explained by the varying relative contribution of the emission of the smallest grains near the blowout limit. The orbits of both the small grains that form the halo and the large grains close to the parent belt precess due to the secular perturbations induced by a companion orbiting inward of the belt. The halo, being composed of older grains, trails the belt. The magnitude of the trailing decreases with increasing perturber mass and hence with increasing strength of the perturbation, a trend we recovered in synthetic maps of surface brightness by fitting ellipses to lines of constant brightness. Systems with an outer perturber do not show a uniform halo precession since the orbits of small grains are strongly altered. We identified features of the brightness distributions suitable for distinguishing between systems with a potentially detectable inner or outer perturber, especially with a combined observation with JWST/MIRI in the Q band tracing small grain emission and with ALMA at mm wavelengths tracing the position of the parent planetesimal belt.
