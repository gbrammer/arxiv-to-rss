We present the first characterization of the Gunn-Peterson trough in high-redshift galaxies using public JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy. This enables us to derive the first galaxy-based IGM opacity measurements at the end of reionisation. Using galaxy spectra has several advantages over quasar spectra: it enables measurements of the IGM opacity in any extragalactic field over a continuous redshift range 4≲ z≲ 7, as well as measurements of the intrinsic Lyman-&amp;beta; opacity. Our novel constraints are in good agreement with state-of-the-art ground-based quasar Lyman-&amp;alpha; forest observations, and will become competitive as the number of JWST z&amp;gt;5 galaxy spectra rapidly increases. We also provide the first constraints on the uncontaminated Lyman-&amp;beta; opacity at 5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6. Finally, we demonstrate the power of JWST to connect the ionisation state of the IGM to the sources of reionisation in a single extragalactic field. We show that a previously reported galaxy overdensity and an excess of Lyman-&amp;alpha; emitters detected with JWST in GOODS-South at z=5.8-5.9 coincides with an anomalously low IGM opacity to Lyman-&amp;alpha; at this redshift. The local photo-ionisation rate excess can be fully accounted for by the cumulative ionising output of M_UV≲ -10 galaxies in the overdensity, provided they have log_10&amp;langle;  &amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt;  f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt; /  [erg^-1 Hz]&amp;rangle; = 24.7 (or equivalently log_10 &amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt;  /  [erg^-1 Hz]=25.4 and f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt;=20&amp;percnt;). Overall, this breakthrough offers a new way to connect the galaxy large-scale structure to the state of the IGM, potentially enabling us to precisely identify the sources of reionisation.

&lt;p&gt;
Deuteration of hydrocarbon material, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), has been proposed to account for the low gas-phase abundances of D in the interstellar medium. JWST spectra of four star-forming regions in M51 show an emission feature, with central wavelength ~4.647&amp;mu;m and FWHM 0.0265&amp;mu;m, corresponding to the C-D stretching mode in aliphatic hydrocarbons. The emitting aliphatic material is estimated to have (D/H)_aliph≈ 0.17±0.02 &amp;ndash; a factor ~10^4 enrichment relative to the overall interstellar medium (ISM). On ~50 pc scales, deuteration levels toward four H II regions in M51 are 2-3 times higher than in the Orion Bar photodissociation region (PDR), with implications for the processes responsible for the formation and evolution of hydrocarbon nanoparticles, including PAHs. The deuteration of the aliphatic material is found to anticorrelate with helium ionization in the associated H II, suggesting that harsh FUV radiation may act to lower the deuteration of aliphatics in PDRs near massive stars. No evidence is found for deuteration of aromatic material, with (D/H)_arom ≲ 0.016: deuteration of the aliphatic material exceeds that of the aromatic material by at least a factor 10. The observed levels of deuteration may account for the depletion of D observed in the Galactic interstellar medium. If so, the 4.65&amp;mu;m feature may be detectable in absorption.

&lt;p&gt;
Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) regulate the evolution of their host galaxies through powerful outflows and multi-phase feedback. This process plays a crucial role in shaping SMBH-galaxy co-evolution across cosmic time, but direct evidence linking nuclear winds to large-scale cold gas outflows, particularly in high-redshift quasars, has remained elusive. Here we present statistical evidence of a connection between nuclear winds and large-scale cold gas outflows in quasars at z ~ 5.5. Using stacked [C II] 158 &amp;mu;m emission profiles from ALMA observations, which trace galactic-scale neutral gas, we compare broad absorption line (BAL) quasars &amp;ndash; tracing parsec- to sub-kiloparsec-scale nuclear winds &amp;ndash; with non-BAL quasars. The BAL stack reveals a significant (S/N=4.45) broad component in the [C II] emission, indicating high-velocity neutral gas outflows with a velocity offset of &amp;Delta; v_b = -2.1 × 10^2   km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and a full width at half maximum of 1.18 × 10^3   km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, while the non-BAL stack shows no such feature. We estimate that a few percent up to one-quarter of the BAL wind energy is transferred to neutral gas on kiloparsec scales. These findings provide direct observational evidence that nuclear winds couple with galactic-scale neutral gas flows, supporting multi-phase AGN feedback models. This mechanism may contribute to explaining the diversity of M_BH/M_* ratios observed in some luminous AGN recently observed by JWST, compared to the Magorrian relation.

&lt;p&gt;
Context: Dust grains are key components of the interstellar medium and play a central role in star formation, acting as catalysts for chemical reactions and as building blocks of planets. Extinction curves are essential for characterizing dust properties, but mid-infrared (MIR) extinction remains poorly constrained in protostellar environments. Gas-phase line ratios from embedded protostellar jets provide a spatially resolved method for probing extinction through protostellar envelopes, complementing background starlight approaches. Aims: We aim to derive MIR extinction curves along sightlines toward a protostellar jet embedded in an envelope and assess whether they differ from those in dense molecular clouds. Methods: We analyze JWST NIRSpec IFU and MIRI MRS observations of four positions along the blue-shifted TMC1A jet. We extract observed [Fe II] line intensities and model intrinsic ratios using the Cloudy spectral synthesis code across a range of electron densities and temperatures. By comparing observed near-IR (NIR) and MIR line ratios to Cloudy predictions, we infer the relative extinction between NIR and MIR wavelengths. Results: Electron densities (ne) derived from NIR [Fe II] lines range from ~5 x 10^4 to ~5 x 10^3 cm^-3 at scales &amp;lt;~350 AU. MIR extinction values show stronger reddening than the empirical dark cloud curve from McClure (2009) at similar ne and temperatures (~10^3 to 10^4 K). If MIR emission arises from cooler, lower-density gas, extinction curves remain consistent with background starlight measurements. Conclusions: This method enables spatially resolved MIR extinction curves in embedded protostellar systems. Results suggest either a change in dust size distribution (e.g., from grain growth) or that MIR emission originates from cooler, less dense regions than NIR emission. (Abstract shortened for arXiv.

We present a comprehensive analysis of the MIRI Extremely Red Object Virgil, a Lyman-&amp;alpha; emitter at z&lt;sub&gt;spec&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.6379 ± 0.0035 with the photometric properties of a Little Red Dot. Leveraging new JWST/MIRI imaging from the MIDIS and PAHSPECS programs, we confirm Virgil's extraordinary nature among galaxies in JADES/GOODS-South, exhibiting a strikingly red NIRCam-to-MIRI color (F444W - F1500W = 2.84±0.04~mag). Deep NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy from the OASIS program offers key insights into the host galaxy, revealing properties of an average star-forming galaxy during Cosmic Reionization, such as a subsolar metallicity, low-to-moderate dust content, and a relatively high ionization parameter and electron temperature. By estimating the star formation rate of Virgil from UV and H&amp;alpha;, we find evidence that the galaxy is either entering or fading out of a bursty episode. Although line-ratio diagnostics employed at high-z would classify Virgil as an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), this classification becomes ambiguous once redshift evolution is considered. Nonetheless, Virgil occupies the same parameter space as recently confirmed AGNs at similar redshifts. The new deep MIRI data at 15~&amp;mu;m reinforce the AGN nature of Virgil, as inferred from multiple spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes. Virgil's rising infrared SED and UV excess resemble those of Dust-Obscured Galaxies (DOGs) studied with Spitzer at Cosmic Noon, particularly blue-excess HotDOGs. Our results highlight the need for a multi-wavelength approach incorporating MIRI to uncover such extreme sources at z≳6 and to shed light on the interplay between galaxy evolution and early black hole growth during Cosmic Reionization.

The standard model of cosmology has provided a good phenomenological description of a wide range of observations both at astrophysical and cosmological scales for several decades. This concordance model is constructed by a universal cosmological constant and supported by a matter sector described by the standard model of particle physics and a cold dark matter contribution, as well as very early-time inflationary physics, and underpinned by gravitation through general relativity. There have always been open questions about the soundness of the foundations of the standard model. However, recent years have shown that there may also be questions from the observational sector with the emergence of differences between certain cosmological probes. In this White Paper, we identify the key objectives that need to be addressed over the coming decade together with the core science projects that aim to meet these challenges. These discordances primarily rest on the divergence in the measurement of core cosmological parameters with varying levels of statistical confidence. These possible statistical tensions may be partially accounted for by systematics in various measurements or cosmological probes but there is also a growing indication of potential new physics beyond the standard model. After reviewing the principal probes used in the measurement of cosmological parameters, as well as potential systematics, we discuss the most promising array of potential new physics that may be observable in upcoming surveys. We also discuss the growing set of novel data analysis approaches that go beyond traditional methods to test physical models. [Abridged]

Type-2 quasars (QSO2s) are active galactic nuclei (AGN) seen through a significant amount of dust and gas that obscures the central supermassive black hole and the broad line region. Here we present new mid-infrared spectra of the central kiloparsec of five optically-selected QSO2s at redshift z~0.1 obtained with JWST/MIRI/MRS. These QSO2s belong to the QSOFEED sample and they have log Lbol=45.5-46.0 erg/s, global SFRs that place them above the main sequence, and practically identical optical spectral shape and [OIII] luminosity, but their nuclear mid-infrared spectra exhibit an unexpected diversity of both continua and features. They show: 1) 9.7 micron silicate features going from emission (strength of S9.7=0.5) to relatively strong absorption (S9.7=-1.0) and 18 and 23 micron silicates either in emission or flat. In addition, two of the QSO2s show absorption bands of CO, H2O, and aliphatic grains, indicating different levels of nuclear obscuration across the sample. 2) [NeV]/[NeII] ratios ranging from 0.1 to 2.1 and [NeIII]/[NeII] from 1.0 to 3.5, indicating different coronal line and ionizing continuum strengths. 3) Warm molecular gas masses of 1-4x10^7 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and warm-to-cold gas mass ratios of 1-2%, with molecular gas excitation likely due to jet-induced shocks in J1430+1339, and to UV heating and/or turbulence in J1509+0434. 4) PAH emission features with equivalent widths ranging from &amp;lt;0.002 to 0.075 micron, from which we measure a larger contribution from neutral molecules (PAH 11.3/6.2=1.3-3.4) and SFRs&amp;lt;3-7 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;/yr. This unprecedented dataset allowed us to start exploring the role of various AGN and galaxy properties including ionizing continuum, obscuration, electron density, and jet-ISM interactions on some of the spectral differences listed above, but larger samples are now required to fully understand the diversity of QSO2s' nuclear mid-infrared spectra.

&lt;p&gt;
In this work an analysis of the intracluster light (ICL) in the galaxy cluster SMACS J0723.3-7327 (hereafter, SMACS J0723) using JWST/NIRCam deep imaging in six filters (F090W to F444W) is presented. The images were processed for low surface brightness (LSB) science, with additional correction for instrumental scattering in the short-wavelength channels, and analysed using wavelet-based decomposition. The ICL, brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), and satellite galaxies were extracted and modelled, with 2D maps for each component. ICL and ICL+BCG fractions, computed across all filters within a 400 kpc radius, exhibit a flat trend with wavelength, averaging 28% and 34%, respectively. Flux ratios between the BCG and the next brightest members (M_12, M_13 and M_14) also display minimal wavelength dependence. These results indicate that SMACS J0723 is a dynamically evolved cluster with a dominant BCG and well-developed ICL. Five prominent ICL substructures are analysed, contributing to 10-12% of the total ICL+BCG flux budget, slightly exceeding simulation predictions. Their short dynamical timescales suggest an instantaneous ICL injection rate of several 10^3 L&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1, consistent with active dynamical assembly. These findings support a scenario where SMACS J0723's ICL growth is currently driven by galaxy mergers involving the BCG and other bright satellites, rather than by the accretion of pre-processed ICL from a recent cluster merger. However, extrapolating the current injection rate to the cluster's lifetime indicates that additional mechanisms are required to match the growth observed in other clusters over cosmic times.

&lt;p&gt;
We investigate the intrinsic and observational properties of z≳ 6 galaxies hosting coalescing massive black holes (MBHs) that gives rise to gravitational waves (GWs) detectable with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We adopt a zoom-in cosmological hydrodynamical simulation of galaxy formation and black hole (BH) co-evolution, zoomed-in on a M_h ~ 10^12~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; dark matter halo at z = 6, which hosts a fast accreting super-massive black hole (SMBH) and a star-forming galaxy. Following the SMBH formation backward in time, we identify the merging events that concurred to its formation and we pick up the ones that are detectable with LISA. Among these LISA detectable events (LDEs), we select those that, based on their intrinsic properties are expected to be bright in one or more electromagnetic (EM) bands. We post-process these events with dust radiative transfer calculations to make predictions about their spectral energy distributions and continuum maps in the JWST to ALMA wavelength range. We compare the spectra arising from galaxies hosting the merging MBHs with those arising from AGN powered by single accreting BHs. We find that it will be impossible to identify an LDE from the continuum SEDs because of the absence of specific imprints from the merging MBHs. We also compute the profile of the H_&amp;alpha; line arising from LDEs, considering the contribution from their star-forming regions and the accreting MBHs. We find that the presence of two accreting MBHs would be difficult to infer even if both MBHs accrete at super-Eddington rates. We conclude that the combined detection of GW and EM signals from z≳ 6 MBHs is challenging not only because of the poor sky-localization provided by LISA, but also because the loudest GW emitters are not massive enough to leave significant signatures in the emission lines arising from the broad line region.

&lt;p&gt;
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is challenging our understanding of the nature of the very first galaxies in the Universe, having discovered a surprising abundance of very massive galaxies in early cosmic epochs. By applying a model of primeval dust, we estimate the far-infrared (FIR)-continuum luminosities for galaxies of different masses at redshifts z≳7. In particular, we predict observed fluxes for different available bands (3-10) of the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-mm Array (ALMA), considering typical conservative values expected for the properties of first galaxies (e.g., gas-phase metallicities, dust-to-metal ratio, star formation efficiency). As expected, FIR fluxes increase with stellar mass for all ALMA bands, but with a steeper slope for bands 9 and 10. Encouragingly, first galaxies are affected by a strong negative-K correction, in such a way that sources with similar properties are brighter in bands 3-8 at higher redshifts. Such behavior is stronger for bands 6-7. Although the trends for bands 9-10 are not clear, the highest fluxes for such bands are reached towards extreme z≳ 15. Counterintuitively, our results suggest that JWST sources with similar masses and dust properties would be more easily detectable with ALMA if they are located at higher z.

We investigate the capabilities of the mid-infrared instrument (MIRI) of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to advance our knowledge of AGN dust using the spectral fitting technique on an AGN collection of 21 nearby (z&amp;lt;0.05) AGN (7 type-1 and 14 type-2) observations obtained with the medium resolution spectroscopy (MRS) mode. This collection includes publicly available AGN and data from the collaboration of Galactic Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS). We developed a tool named MRSPSFisol that decomposes MRS cubes into point-like and extended contributions. We found statistically good fits for 12 targets with current AGN dust models. The model that provides good fits (chi2/dof&amp;lt;2) for these 12 targets assumes a combination of clumpy and smooth distribution of dust in a flare-disk geometry where the dust grain size is a free parameter. Still, two and one AGN statistically prefer the disk+wind and the classical clumpy torus model, respectively. However, the currently available models fail to reproduce 40% of the targets, likely due to the extreme silicate features not well reproduced by the models and signatures of water-ice and aliphatic hydrocarbon absorption features in most targets. New models exploring, for instance, new chemistry, are needed to explain the complexity of AGN dust continuum emission observed by JWST.

We present deep JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging of Ion1, a previously confirmed Lyman Continuum (LyC)-emitting galaxy at z&lt;sub&gt;spec&lt;/sub&gt;=3.794. Together with existing HST imaging, these new observations from the JADES program enable a joint analysis of Ion1's LyC, rest-frame UV, stellar, and dust emission with unprecedented detail. We report the first detection of dust emission at rest-frame ~3 &amp;mu;m in a high-redshift LyC-emitting galaxy using MIRI/F1500W. Our analysis suggests a porous distribution of dust in Ion1, with regions exhibiting evidence of dust deficit coinciding both with LyC-emitting regions and with the peak of H&amp;alpha; emission. Furthermore, multi-band NIRCam imaging reveals a strong FUV-to-optical color gradient, where LyC-emitting regions appear significantly bluer than the rest of Ion1. Spatially resolved SED fitting confirms that this color gradient is primarily driven by spatially varying dust attenuation. Together, these findings suggest that Ion1's LyC emission originates from a compact star-forming complex near its stellar-light centroid, where stellar feedback carves out low HI column density channels, facilitating LyC escape. However, only a fraction of these LyC photons - specifically those along sightlines with minimal HI obscuration - ultimately escape and reach observers. This work underscores the critical role of dust and neutral gas geometry in shaping LyC escape in galaxies at high redshifts. Anisotropic LyC escape may be a common feature in the early Universe, which must be properly incorporated to constrain the Epoch of Reionization.

Giant bulgeless disk galaxies, theoretically expected to be rare in the early Universe, have been confirmed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to exist as early as 2 billion years after the Big Bang. These morphologically extreme systems offer valuable insights into the physics of disk formation and the interplay between galaxies and their dark-matter halos. Using cosmological simulations, we identify analogs of such galaxies with stellar masses around 10^11 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and half-light radii up to 6 kpc at z ~ 3 and characterize the factors that contribute to their formation. These galaxies form in young cosmic knots, populating host halos of high spin, low concentration, and spherical shapes. They feature dynamically coherent circum-galactic medium, as well as gas-rich, coherent mergers, which preserve their disk morphology and drive their large sizes. Interestingly, all the simulated giant disks harbor a compact, aligned inner disk, marginally resolvable in JWST images with a S\'ersic index near unity. These findings highlight the environmental and structural conditions necessary for forming and sustaining giant bulgeless disks and provide a theoretical framework for interpreting JWST observations of extreme disk morphologies in the early Universe.

The interstellar medium (ISM) consists of a diversity of structures across a range of spatial scales, intimately tied to galactic evolution. In this work, Fourier analysis is used to characterize the spatial structures of dust and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the ISM of PHANGS-JWST galaxies, observed in the four photometric mid-infrared (MIR) filters from F770W to F2100W (i.e., 7.7 to 21&amp;mu;m)). We quantify the abundance of structure on different spatial scales using the power-law slope, &amp;alpha;, of the spatial power spectra. The distribution of &amp;alpha; across all length scales differs significantly between filters, with steeper slopes for PAH-dominated filters (&amp;alpha;_F770W = 2.19^+0.16_-0.15, &amp;alpha;_F1130W = 1.88^+0.25_-0.37) and shallower for the dust-continuum (&amp;alpha;_F1000W = 1.48^+0.33_-0.47, &amp;alpha;_F2100W = 0.94^+0.23_-0.28). The distribution of &amp;alpha; across galaxies is narrower for PAH-dominated than for thermal dust-dominated bands, highlighting that PAHs trace photo-dissociation regions dominated by similar physical processes, whereas dust structures are an integrated property over the diverse evolutionary histories of their host galaxies. Unlike dust structures, PAH-sensitive bands display a break in the power spectrum: below a characteristic scale, &amp;ell;_0=160pc^+110pc_-50pc, PAH structures are suppressed.

We release a spectroscopic redshift catalogue of sources in the Abell 2744 cluster field, derived from JWST/NIRISS observations taken as part of the GLASS-JWST Early Release Science programme. We describe the data reduction, contamination modelling and source detection, as well as the data quality assessment, redshift determination and validation. The catalogue consists of 354 secure and 134 tentative redshifts, of which 245 are new spectroscopic redshifts, spanning a range 0.1 ≤ z ≤ 8.2. These include 17 galaxies at the cluster redshift, one galaxy at z ≈ 8, and a triply-imaged galaxy at z = 2.653 ± 0.002. Comparing against galaxies with existing spectroscopic redshifts z&lt;sub&gt;spec&lt;/sub&gt;, we find a small offset of &amp;Delta; z = (z&lt;sub&gt;spec&lt;/sub&gt; - z_NIRISS )/(1 + z&lt;sub&gt;spec&lt;/sub&gt; ) = (1.3 ± 1.6) × 10^-3. We also release a forced extraction tool "pygrife" and a visualisation tool "pygcg" to the community, to aid with the reduction and classification of grism data. This catalogue will enable future studies of the spatially-resolved properties of galaxies throughout cosmic noon, including dust attenuation and star formation. As the first exploitation of the catalogue, we discuss the spectroscopic confirmation of multiple image systems, and the identification of multiple overdensities at 1 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 2.7.

Observations of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshifts challenge standard seeding scenarios. We examine a dissipative self-interacting dark matter (dSIDM) model in which gravothermal collapse leads to the formation of massive BH seeds ab initio. We utilize a semi-analytical framework to predict properties of the dSIDM-seeded SMBH population. Billion solar mass quasars are reproduced along with low-mass faint active galactic nuclei (known as little red dots) with SMBH-to-galaxy stellar mass ratios consistent with recent James Webb Space Telescope observations. To match the abundance of the observed bright quasars, a percent-level duty-cycle is suggested, implying a large population of dormant SMBHs. The gravitational wave (GW) signals from mergers of these massive SMBHs can be detected by LISA while remaining within the NANOGrav constraints on the GW background. These results provide testable signatures of DM-driven SMBH formation, offering a pathway to probe hidden-sector physics through SMBH and GW observables.

Dense filaments are believed to be representative of the initial conditions of star formation in molecular clouds. We have used the MIRI instrument on JWST to image the massive filament NGC6334M at d~1.3 kpc with unprecedented resolution and dynamic range at 7.7 and 25.5 microns. Our observations reveal the fine structure of the filament in absorption against mid-infrared background emission. From the absorption data, we derive high-resolution column density maps and perform a detailed analysis of the filament structure. We find a median filament width of 0.12+/-0.02 pc at both wavelengths, resolved by almost two orders of magnitude by MIRI, and consistent with the typical half-power width of Herschel filaments in nearby (d&amp;lt;0.5 kpc) clouds. The JWST data also reveal the presence of a quasi-periodic series of side filaments with a similar projected spacing of 0.125+/-0.015 pc. Combining our JWST results with Spitzer and APEX/Herschel data, we perform a study of cloud structure over four orders of magnitude in linear scale. A convergence test shows that our width estimates for NGC6334M are robust and reflect the presence of a true characteristic scale. While there is evidence of a Kolmogorov-like spectrum of small-scale fluctuations down the 1.6x10^-3 pc resolution of the JWST observations, we identify a break in the power spectrum of column density fluctuations at a scale ~0.1-0.4 pc comparable to the width of NGC6334M and its side filaments. This characteristic scale ~0.1pc has important implications for the origin of the star formation efficiency in dense gas and the IMF.

&lt;p&gt;
The Lyman-break technique has been used to successfully identify high-redshift candidates in broad-band photometric data in the rest-frame optical and NIR using the dropout technique. We pioneer the application of this technique to new wavelength regimes, and search for dropouts in combined ALMA and JWST data. We find a candidate that is undetected in NIRCam imaging including and blueward of the F444W filter, but clearly identified in ALMA band 3. Assuming this is a Lyman-break candidate, we measure a redshift in the range 40 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 21 380. This is the highest redshift galaxy candidate discovered to date, and is in significant tension with current and future predictions from cosmological simulations, with implications for galaxy evolution in the (very) early Universe.

&lt;p&gt;
Mesoscale structures can often be described as fractional dimensional across a wide range of scales. We consider a &amp;gamma; dimensional measure embedded in an N dimensional space and discuss how to determine its dimension, both in N dimensions and projected into D dimensions. It is a highly non-trivial problem to decode the original geometry from lower dimensional projection of a high-dimensional measure. The projections are space-feeling, the popular box-counting techniques do not apply, and the Fourier methods are contaminated by aliasing effects. In the present paper we demonstrate that under the "Copernican hypothesis'' that we are not observing objects from a special direction, projection in a wavelet basis is remarkably simple: the wavelet power spectrum of a projected &amp;gamma; dimensional measure is P_j &amp;prop; 2^-j&amp;gamma;. This holds regardless of the embedded dimension, N, and the projected dimension, D. This approach could have potentially broad applications in data sciences where a typically sparse matrix encodes lower dimensional information embedded in an extremely high dimensional field and often measured in projection to a low dimensional space. Here, we apply this method to JWST and Chandra observations of the nearby supernova Cas A. We find that the emissions can be represented by projections of mesoscale substructures with fractal dimensions varying from &amp;gamma; = 1.7 for the warm CO layer observed by JWST, up to &amp;gamma; = 2.5 for the hot X-ray emitting gas layer in the supernova remnant. The resulting power law indicates that the emission is coming from a fractal dimensional mesoscale structure likely produced by magneto-hydrodynamical instabilities in the expanding supernova shell.

&lt;p&gt;
JWST reveals numerous high-z galaxies and Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs), suggesting that stars and SMBH seeds formation at z ≳ 10 may be more efficient than previously derived. One popular SMBH seed scenario is the Direct Collapse Black Holes (DCBHs) formed in pristine atomic-cooling halos irradiated by nearby galaxies. Therefore, the efficient star formation likely facilitates the formation of DCBH. We calculate the first critical k_H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-k_H^- curves for DCBH formation under the influence of X-ray radiation using the one-zone model. We then build the UV luminosity function consistent with JWST observations and incorporate it into the model that calculates the DCBH-triggering probability. We confirm that enhanced star formation promotes the DCBH formation. However, the DCBH abundance n_DCBH is significantly influenced by the X-ray radiation that is also related to star formation. Since the 21 cm global spectrum is also X-ray dependent, the 21 cm absorption depth &amp;delta; T_b^trough at Cosmic Dawn encodes the DCBH abundance information. We provide a tentative trend in the n_DCBH - &amp;delta; T^trough_b relation, which could be a useful guide. In our fiducial model, if &amp;delta; T_b^trough≳ -100 mK, then the DCBH is rather rare; if -150~mK ≲ &amp;delta; T_b^trough≲ -100 mK, n_DCBH ~ O(10^-2-10^-3) cMpc^-3 (comoving Mpc^-3), consistent with the HST/JWST observed SMBHs abundance at z≳ 6; if &amp;delta; T_b^trough≲ -150 mK, n_DCBH can largely exceed O(10^-2) cMpc^-3. The 21 cm global spectrum observations will help to constrain the DCBH abundance.

We present the analysis of the multi-phase gas properties in the Seyfert II galaxy NGC 424, using spatially resolved spectroscopic data from JWST/MIRI, part of the Mid-InfraRed Activity of Circumnuclear Line Emission (MIRACLE) program, as well as VLT/MUSE and ALMA. We trace the properties of the multi-phase medium, from cold and warm molecular gas to hot ionised gas, using emission lines such as CO(2-1), H2 S(1), [OIII]5007, [NeIII]15, and [NeV]14. These lines reveal the intricate interplay between the different gas phases within the circumnuclear region, spanning approximately 1.4x1.4 kpc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a resolution of 10 pc. Exploiting the multi-wavelength and multi-scale observations of gas emission we model the galaxy disc rotation curve from scales of a few parsec up to 5 kpc from the nucleus and infer a dynamical mass of 1.09±0.08x10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; with a disc scale radius of 0.48±0.02 kpc. We detect a compact ionised outflow with velocities up to 10^3 km/s, traced by the [OIII], [NeIII], and [NeV] transitions, with no evidence of cold or warm molecular outflows. We suggest that the ionised outflow might be able to inject a significant amount of energy into the circumnuclear region, potentially hindering the formation of a molecular wind, as the molecular gas is observed to be denser and less diffuse. The combined multi-band observations also reveal, in all gas phases, a strong enhancement of the gas velocity dispersion directed along the galaxy minor axis, perpendicular to the high-velocity ionised outflow, and extending up to 1 kpc from the nucleus. Our findings suggest that the outflow might play a key role in such enhancement by injecting energy into the host disc and perturbing the ambient material.

&lt;p&gt;
We report an extremely tight, linear relation between H&amp;alpha; and [O III] line fluxes in logarithm, discovered using a large sample of low and mid-resolution spectra (totaling 563) obtained by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec instrument in three widely separated extragalactic fields. While a certain correlation between H&amp;alpha; and [O III] is expected for star forming galaxies, such a log-linear and tight (dispersion of ~0.1 dex) and trend is hard to explain because dust reddening would skew any intrinsic relation between the two. Furthermore, another surprising finding emerges from investigating the dust reddening properties of these galaxies. We find that the classic method of using the Balmer decrements under the standard Case B assumption does not work: a high fraction (~40&amp;percnt;) of our objects have H&amp;alpha;/H&amp;beta; line ratios even smaller than the canonical Case B ratio of 2.86. Such a high fraction of non-Case B Balmer decrements is also present in other JWST and ground-based spectroscopic studies, but the universal applicability of the Case B assumption was not questioned until recently. The mysterious H&amp;alpha;&amp;ndash;[O III] correlation and the high fraction of non-Case B Balmer decrements, which may or may not be related, should be further investigated to put our spectral analysis onto a more solid footing.

Motivated by JWST observations of dense, clumpy and clustered high redshift star formation, we simulate the hierarchical assembly of nine M_cl=10^6 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; star clusters using the BIFROST N-body code. Our low metallicity models (0.01Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) with post-Newtonian equations of motion for black holes include evolving populations of single, binary and triple stars. Massive stars grow by stellar collisions and collapse into intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) up to M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt;~6200 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, stellar multiplicity boosting the IMBH masses by a factor of 2&amp;ndash;3. The IMBHs tidally disrupt (TDE) ~50 stars in 10 Myr with peak TDE rates of \Gamma~10^-5 yr^-1 per cluster. These IMBHs are natural seeds for supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and the hierarchical assembly frequently leads to &amp;gt;2 SMBH seeds per cluster and their rapid mergers (t&amp;lt;10 Myr). We propose that a gravitational wave (GW) driven merger of IMBHs with 1000 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; ≲ M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt; ≲ 10000 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; with comparable masses is a characteristic GW fingerprint of SMBH seed formation at redshifts z&amp;gt;10, and IMBH formation in similar environments at lower redshifts. Massive star clusters provide a unique environment for the early Universe GW studies for the next-generation GW observatories including the Einstein Telescope and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.

&lt;p&gt;
We have not yet observed the epoch at which disc galaxies emerge in the Universe. While high-z measurements of large-scale features such as bars and spiral arms trace the evolution of disc galaxies, such methods cannot directly quantify featureless discs in the early Universe. Here we identify a substantial population of apparently featureless disc galaxies in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey by combining quantitative visual morphologies of ~ 7,000 galaxies from the Galaxy Zoo JWST CEERS project with a public catalogue of expert visual and parametric morphologies. While the highest-redshift featured disc we identify is at z&lt;sub&gt;phot&lt;/sub&gt;=5.5, the highest-redshift featureless disc we identify is at z&lt;sub&gt;phot&lt;/sub&gt;=7.4. The distribution of S\'ersic indices for these featureless systems suggests that they truly are dynamically cold: disc-dominated systems have existed since at least z~ 7.4. We place upper limits on the featureless disc fraction as a function of redshift, and show that up to 75&amp;percnt; of discs are featureless at 3.0&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;7.4. This is a conservative limit assuming all galaxies in the sample truly lack features. With further consideration of redshift effects and observational constraints, we find the featureless disc fraction in CEERS imaging at these redshifts is more likely ~29-38&amp;percnt;. We hypothesise that the apparent lack of features in a third of high-redshift discs is due to a higher gas fraction in the early Universe, which allows the discs to be resistant to buckling and instabilities.

The Bullet Cluster (1E 0657-56) is a key astrophysical laboratory for studying dark matter, galaxy cluster mergers, and shock propagation in extreme environments. Using new JWST imaging, we present the highest-resolution mass reconstruction to date, combining 146 strong lensing constraints from 37 systems with high-density (398 sources arcmin^-2) weak lensing data, without assuming that light traces mass. The main cluster's mass distribution is highly elongated (NW-SE) and consists of at least three subclumps aligned with the brightest cluster galaxies. The subcluster is more compact but elongated along the E-W direction, with a single dominant peak. We also detect a possible mass and ICL trail extending from the subcluster's eastern side toward the main cluster. Notably, these detailed features are closely traced by the intracluster light, with a modified Hausdorff distance of 19.80 ± 12.46 kpc. Together with multi-wavelength data, the complex mass distribution suggests that the merger history of the Bullet Cluster may be more complex than previous binary cluster merger scenarios.

Recent studies of gas kinematics at high redshift have reported disky systems which appear to challenge models of galaxy formation, but it is unclear whether they are representative of the underlying galaxy population. We present the first statistical sample of spatially resolved ionised gas kinematics at high redshift, comprised of 272 H&amp;alpha; emitters in GOODS-S and GOODS-N at redshifts z≈3.9-6.5, observed with JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopy and imaging from JADES, FRESCO and CONGRESS. The sample probes two orders of magnitude in stellar mass (log (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;[M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;])≈8-10) and star formation rate (SFR≈0.3-100\thinspace M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;/yr), and is representative down to log(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;[M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;])≈ 9. Using a novel inference tool, ttgeko, we model the grism data to measure morphological and kinematic properties of the ionised gas, as probed by H&amp;alpha;. Our results are consistent with a decrease of the rotational support v/&amp;sigma;_0 and increase of the velocity dispersion &amp;sigma;_0 with redshift, with &amp;sigma;_0≈100 km/s and v/&amp;sigma;_0≈1-2 at z≈3.9-6.5. We study the relations between &amp;sigma;_0, and v/&amp;sigma;_0, and different star formation tracers and find a large scatter and diversity, with the strongest correlations between &amp;sigma;_0 and SFR and SFR surface density. The fraction of rotationally supported systems (v/&amp;sigma;_0&amp;gt;1) slightly increases with cosmic time, from (36±6)&amp;percnt; to (41±6)&amp;percnt; from z~ 5.5 to z~ 4.5, for galaxies with masses 9&amp;lt;log(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;[M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;])&amp;lt;10. Overall, disks do not dominate the turbulent high-redshift galaxy population in the mass range probed by this work. When placed in the context of studies up to cosmic noon, our results are consistent with a significant increase of disk-like systems with cosmic time.

How radial flows shape galaxy structure and evolution remains an open question. Internal drivers of such flows, such as bars and spiral arms, known to mediate gas flows in the local Universe, are now observable at high redshift thanks to JWST's unobscured view. We investigate the morphology of massive star-forming galaxies at 0.8 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 1.3 and 2.0 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 2.5, epochs marking the peak and decline of cosmic star formation, both well-covered by kinematic surveys. Using JWST/NIRCam imaging, we visually classify 1,451 galaxies, identify non-axisymmetric features, count the number of spiral arms, analyze non-parametric morphological indicators and study the dynamical support of the sample covered by kinematics (10% of the sample) as measured via v/&amp;sigma;. Disk galaxies dominate the sample (82%), with 48% exhibiting spiral structure and 11% hosting bars. Both fractions decline with redshift, consistent with previous studies. The proportion of two- and three-armed spirals remains largely unchanged across redshift, with roughly two-thirds showing two arms and one-third showing three arms in both bins. Notably, we find a higher incidence of three-armed spirals than reported in the local Universe, suggesting a mild evolution in spiral arm multiplicity. Non-parametric morphological metrics strongly correlate with stellar mass but show no significant redshift evolution. Finally, kinematic analysis reveals a strong correlation between disk morphology and rotational support, with most disks exhibiting v/&amp;sigma; &amp;gt; 3 and median values of v/&amp;sigma; &amp;gt; 7 for spirals and v/&amp;sigma; &amp;gt; 5 for barred galaxies. This study establishes a population-wide framework for linking galaxy morphology and dynamics at cosmic noon, providing a key reference for future studies on the role of detailed structural features in galaxy evolution.

Galaxy clusters in the local Universe are dominated by massive quiescent galaxies with old ages, formed at high redshifts. It is debated whether their quenching is driven by internal processes or environmental effects, which has been challenging due to the lack of observations during their peak formation epoch. Here we report clear evidence from ALMA of extended and elongated gas tails in nine galaxies in a forming cluster at z = 2.51. The distinct gas distribution compared to the stellar emission probed by JWST, which is rather isolated without signatures of mergers or interactions, provides evidence of ram-pressure stripping (RPS). This represents the most distant confirmed case of RPS, highlighting the critical role of environmental effects in gas removal at high redshifts, an often overlooked quenching pathway.

&lt;p&gt;
The Flashlights program with the Hubble Space Telescope imaged the six Hubble Frontier Fields galaxy clusters in two epochs and detected twenty transients. These are primarily expected to be caustic-crossing events (CCEs) where bright stars in distant lensed galaxies, typically at redshift z≈1&amp;ndash;3, get temporarily magnified close to cluster caustics. Since CCEs are generally biased toward more massive and luminous stars, they offer a unique route for probing the high end of the stellar mass function. We take advantage of the Flashlights event statistics to place preliminary constraints on the stellar initial mass function (IMF) around cosmic noon. The photometry (along with spectral information) of lensed arcs is used to infer their various stellar properties, and stellar synthesis models are used to evolve a recent stellar population in them. We estimate the microlens surface density near each arc and, together with existing lens models and simple formalism for CCEs, calculate the expected rate for a given IMF. We find that, on average, a Salpeter-like IMF (&amp;alpha;=2.35) underpredicts the number of observed CCEs by a factor of ~0.7, and a top-heavy IMF (&amp;alpha;=1.00) overpredicts by a factor of ~1.7, suggesting that the average IMF slope may lie somewhere in between. However, given the large uncertainties associated with estimating the stellar populations, these results are strongly model-dependent. Nevertheless, we introduce a useful framework for constraining the IMF using CCEs. Observations with JWST are already yielding many more CCEs and will soon enable more stringent constraints on the IMF at a range of redshifts.

&lt;p&gt;
In the current era of JWST, we continue to uncover a wealth of information about the Universe deep into the Epoch of Reionization. In this work, we run a suite of simulations using the code 21cmSPACE, to explore the astrophysical properties of galaxies in the early Universe, and their impact on high-redshift observables. We use multi-wavelength observational data including the global 21-cm signal and power spectrum limits from SARAS~3 and HERA respectively, present-day diffuse X-ray and radio backgrounds, and UV luminosity functions (UVLFs) from HST and JWST in the range z=6-14.5 to derive our constraints. We constrain a flexible model of halo-mass and redshift dependent star-formation efficiency (SFE), defined as the gas fraction converted into stars, and find that it is best described by little to no redshift evolution at z≈6-10 and rapid evolution at z≈10-15. We derive Bayesian functional posterior distributions for the SFE across this redshift range, inferring that a halo of mass M_h=10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; has an efficiency of 2-3&amp;percnt; at z≲10, 12&amp;percnt; at z=12 and 26&amp;percnt; at z=15. We also find, through synergy between SARAS~3 and UVLFs, that the minimum circular velocity for star-formation in halos is V_c = 16.9^+25.7_-9.5 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; or equivalently log_10(M_crit/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) = 8.29^+1.21_-1.08 at z=6. Alongside these star-formation constraints, we find the X-ray and radio efficiencies of early galaxies to be f_X = 0.5^+6.3_-0.3 and f_r ≲ 11.7 respectively, improving upon existing works that do not use UVLF data. Our results demonstrate the critical role of UVLFs in constraining the early Universe, and its synergies with 21-cm observations, alongside other multi-wavelength observational datasets.

&lt;p&gt;
We present the survey design and initial results from the Parallel Ionizing Emissivity (PIE) survey. PIE is a large HST survey designed to detect Lyman continuum (LyC) emitting galaxies at 3.1&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;3.5 and stack the images of galaxies at these redshifts in order to measure average LyC escape fractions as a function of galaxy properties. PIE has imaged 37 independent fields in three filters (F336W, F625W and F814W), of which 18 are observed with a fourth band (F475W) from the accompanying PIE+ program. We use photometric colors to select candidate Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) at 3.1&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;3.5, which can be followed-up using ground-based spectrographs to confirm their redshifts. Unlike previous surveys, our use of many independent fields allows us to remove any biases caused by correlated absorption in the IGM. In this paper, we describe the survey design, photometric measurements, and the use of mock galaxy samples to optimize our color selection. We find that a 3-filter selection allows us to select a galaxy sample of which ≈90&amp;percnt; are LBGs and over 30&amp;percnt; lie in the 3.1&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;3.5 range for which we can detect uncontaminated LyC emission in F336W. We also use mock IGM sightlines to measure the expected transmission of the IGM, which will allow us to determine escape fractions from our stacked galaxies. We find ≈1000 galaxies within our selection window, and predict that this includes ≈80 LyC-emitting galaxies and ≈350 that we can use in stacking. Finally, we present our first ground-based spectra, including a plausible LyC emitter at z=3.067.

We present 850 &amp;mu;m polarized continuum observations carried out with the POL-2 polarimeter mounted on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) towards NGC 7023 located in the Cepheus Flare region. NGC 7023 is a reflection nebula powered by a Herbig Ae Be star HD 200775 and also identified as a hub in the hub-filament cloud, LDN 1172/1174. We detect submillimetre emission well towards the northern (identified as C1) and the eastern region of the reflection nebula. We investigated the polarization structure and the magnetic field (B-field) morphology, which is found to be curved and follows the clump morphology. The comparison of the B-field morphology at the clump scales (~0.02 pc) with that of the envelope (~0.5 pc) suggests that the field lines are not preserved from envelope to clump scales, implying that an external factor may be responsible for disturbing the B-field structure. We estimated a magnetic field strength of 179±50 &amp;mu;G in the starless core, 121±34 &amp;mu;G in the protostellar core with a class I source and 150±42 &amp;mu;G in the protostellar core with a class II source using the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H^+ (1-0) line observed with 13.7 m single dish radio telescope at Taeduk Radio Astronomy Observatory (TRAO). The stability analysis using these B-field strengths gives magnetically sub-critical values, while the magnetic, gravitational, and outflow kinetic energies are roughly balanced. We also suggest that the reordering of the magnetic field lines could be due to the interaction with the already evolved high-velocity outflow gas around the central star, which hints at the presence of outflow feedback.

We present a detailed 3D photoionization model of the planetary nebula NGC 3132, constrained by the latest observations. Using the MOCASSIN code, the model incorporates integrated and spatially resolved spectroscopy, velocity-resolved line profiles, emission line maps, and photometry, including recent high-quality data from MUSE (VLT) and JWST among others. Based on new data from the SAMFP instrument at SOAR, the three-dimensional density structure of the nebula was obtained by assuming homologous expansion of the surrounding nebular gas. The final fitted model successfully reproduces all key observational constraints available, particularly in terms of the detailed emission line integrated fluxes and ionization structures across different ionic stages. The results of the model show that the progenitor star had a mass of (2.7 ± 0.2)M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and is surrounded by a He poor shell of dust and gas. The abundances of He, C, N, O, and S determined by the model show that the nebula has C/O=(2.02 ± 0.28) and N/O=(0.39 ± 0.38) consistent with the progenitor mass found.

[Abridged] SFGs are the dominant population in the faint radio sky, corresponding to flux densities at 1.4 GHz &amp;lt; 0.1 mJy. A panchromatic approach is essential for selecting SFGs in the radio band and understanding star formation processes over cosmic time. Semi-empirical models are valuable tools to effectively study galaxy formation and evolution, relying on minimal assumptions and exploiting empirical relations between galaxy properties and enabling us to take full advantage of the recent progress in radio and optical/near-infrared (NIR) observations. In this paper, we develop the Semi-EMPirical model for Extragalactic Radio emission (SEMPER) to predict radio luminosity functions and number counts at 1.4 GHz and 150 MHz for SFGs. SEMPER is based on state-of-the-art empirical relations and combines the redshift-dependent galaxy stellar mass functions obtained from the recent COSMOS2020 catalogue, which exploits deep near-infrared observations, with up-to-date observed scaling relations, such as the galaxy main sequence and the mass-dependent far-infrared/radio correlation across cosmic time. Our luminosity functions are compared with recent observational determinations from several radio telescopes, along with previous semi-empirical models and simulations. Our semi-empirical model successfully reproduces the observed luminosity functions at 1.4 GHz and 150 MHz up to z~ 5 and the most recent number count statistics from radio observations in the LoTSS deep fields. Our model, based on galaxies selected in the NIR, naturally predicts the presence of radio-selected massive and/or dust-obscured galaxies already in place at high redshift (z≳3.5), as suggested by recent results from JWST. Our predictions offer an excellent benchmark for upcoming updates from JWST and future ultra-deep radio surveys planned with the SKA and its precursors.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that challenge existing black hole (BH) formation models. These newly observed BHs are overmassive compared to the host galaxies and have an unexpectedly high abundance. Their exact origin remains elusive. The primary goal of this work is to investigate the formation of massive BH seeds in dense Population III (Pop III) star clusters. Using a cosmological simulation of Pop III cluster formation, we present models for the assembly and subsequent evolution of these clusters. The models account for background gas potential, stellar collisions and associated mass loss, gas accretion, stellar growth, their initial mass function (IMF), and subsequent star formation. We conduct N-body simulations of these models over a span of 2 million years. Our results show that BHs of &amp;gt; 400 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; are formed in all cases, reaching up to ~ 5000 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; under optimistic yet reasonable conditions and potentially exceeding 10^4 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; provided that high accretion rates of 10^-3 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1 onto the stars can be sustained. We conclude that massive BHs can be formed in Pop III stellar clusters and are likely to remain within their host clusters. These BHs may experience further growth as they sink into the galaxy's potential well. This formation channel should be given further consideration in models of galaxy formation and BH demographics.

As the only moon in the solar system with a thick atmosphere, Titan is a compelling and enigmatic world containing a complex organic haze. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules are believed to play an essential role in the formation of Titan's aerosols and haze layers. The existence of PAHs in Titan's upper atmosphere has been revealed by the detection of the 3.28-micron emission band with Cassini's Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS). However, there is little knowledge about the identity, composition, size and abundance of PAH molecules in Titan's atmosphere. Due to its unprecedented sensitivity and spectral coverage and resolution, the advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) could possibly enable a full characterization of the chemical makeups of Titan's aerosols. In particular, with a much better spectral resolution than Cassini's VIMS, JWST's Near Infrared Spectrograph (and Mid Infrared Instrument) could enable the spectral bands to be better resolved, potentially providing crucial information about which PAHs are really present in Titan's upper atmosphere. To facilitate JWST to search for and identify Titan's PAH molecules, we are performing a systematic study of the photophysics of PAHs in Titan's upper atmosphere. As a pilot study, here we report the infrared emission spectra of vibrationally excited cyanonapthalenes and their ions which are composed of two fused benzene rings and one nitrile (-CN) group. The calculated emission spectra will help JWST to quantitatively determine or place an upper limit on the abundances of cyanonapthalenes in Titan's upper atmosphere.

Almost all globular clusters (GCs) contain multiple populations consisting of stars with varying helium and light-element abundances. These populations include first-population stars, which exhibit similar chemical compositions to halo-field stars with comparable [Fe/H], and second-population stars, characterized by enhanced He and N abundances along with reduced levels of O and C. Nowadays, one of the most intriguing open questions about GCs pertains to the formation and evolution of their multiple populations. Recent works based on N-body simulations of GCs show that the fractions and characteristics of binary stars can serve as dynamic indicators of the formation period of multiple-population in GCs and their subsequent dynamical evolution. Nevertheless, the incidence of binaries among multiple populations is still poorly studied. Moreover, the few available observational studies are focused only on the bright stars of a few GCs. In this work, we use deep images of the GC 47 Tucanae collected with the JWST and HST to investigate the incidence of binaries among multiple populations of M-dwarfs and bright main-sequence stars. To reach this objective, we use UV, optical, and near infrared filters to construct photometric diagrams that allow us to disentangle binary systems and multiple populations. Moreover, we compared these observations with a large sample of simulated binaries. In the cluster central regions, the incidence of binaries among first-population stars is only slightly higher than that of second-population stars. In contrast, in the external regions, the majority (&amp;gt;85%) of the studied binaries are composed of first population stars. Results are consistent with the GC formation scenarios where the second-population stars originate in the cluster's central region, forming a compact and dense stellar group within a more extended system of first-population stars

We present the MIRI EGS Galaxy and AGN (MEGA) survey, a four band MIRI survey with 25 pointing in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) extragalactic field. Three of the pointings utilized only the three reddest bands (F1000W, F1500W, F2100W) while the remainder of the pointings also add a blue filter (F770W). MEGA builds upon the existing observations in the EGS field by providing MIRI imaging for 68.9% of CEERS NIRCam imaging, filling a cruciality gap in order to understand galaxy evolution by observing the obscured Universe. Here, we present the technical design, data reduction, photometric catalog creation, the first data release, and science drivers of the MEGA survey. Our data reduction starts with the standard JWST calibration pipeline, but adds additional warm pixel masking and custom background subtraction steps to improve the quality of the final science image. We estimate the image depth of the reduced mosaics and present new galaxy number counts in four MIRI bands.

As JWST uncovers increasingly strong evidence that metal-poor, massive stars in early galaxies dominated reionization, observational constraints on the properties of such stars are more relevant than ever before. However, spectra of individual O- and B-type stars are rare at the relevant metallicities (≲ 0.2 Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;), leaving models of stellar evolution and ionizing flux poorly constrained by data in this regime. We present new medium-resolution (R~ 4000) Keck/DEIMOS optical spectra of 17 OB stars in the local low-metallicity (0.12 Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) dwarf galaxy NGC 3109. We assign spectral types to the stars and present new criteria for selecting O stars using optical and NUV photometry from Hubble Space Telescope imaging. We fit the spectra and photometry with grids of stellar atmosphere models to measure stellar temperatures, surface gravities, luminosities, radii, and masses. We find evidence of strong mass loss via radiation-driven stellar winds in two O stars, one of which is the hottest, youngest, and most massive star confirmed in the host galaxy to date. Though its spectrum does not meet conventional Wolf-Rayet spectral classification criteria, this metal-poor O If star produces strong He II 4686 emission and its evolutionary status is ambiguous. This work nearly doubles the number of OB stars with measured parameters in NGC 3109, including ten stars with no previously reported parameters, four with no published spectroscopy, and four binary candidates. This large sample of OB stellar parameters provides a new observational testbed to constrain the stellar astrophysics that drove cosmic reionization and influenced the evolution of the earliest galaxies.

The presence of nine candidate galaxies at z=17 and z=25 discovered by the itJames Webb Space Telescope in relatively small sky areas, if confirmed, is virtually impossible to reconcile with current galaxy formation model predictions. We show here that the implied UV luminosity density can be produced by a population of primordial black holes (PBH) of mass M_PBH = 10^4-5   M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; residing in low-mass halos (M_h ≈ 10^7   M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;), and accreting at a moderate fraction of the Eddington luminosity, &amp;lambda;_E ≃ 0.36. These sources precede the first significant episodes of cosmic star formation. At later times, as star formation is ignited, PBH emission becomes comparable or subdominant with respect to the galactic one. Such a PBH+galaxy scenario reconciles the evolution of the UV LF from z=25 to z=11. If ultra-early sources are purely powered by accretion, this strongly disfavours seed production mechanisms requiring the presence of stars (massive/Pop III stars or clusters) or their UV radiation (direct collapse BHs), leaving PBH as the only alternative solution available so far. Alternative explanations, such as isolated, large clusters (≈ 10^7   M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) of massive (m&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; =10^3 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) of Pop III are marginally viable, but require extreme and unlikely conditions, that can be probed via UV/FIR emission lines or gravitational waves.

The PHANGS project is assembling a comprehensive, multi-wavelength dataset of nearby (~5-20 Mpc), massive star-forming galaxies to enable multi-phase, multi-scale investigations into the processes that drive star formation and galaxy evolution. To date, large survey programs have provided molecular gas (CO) cubes with ALMA, optical IFU spectroscopy with VLT/MUSE, high-resolution NUV&amp;ndash;optical imaging in five broad-band filters with HST, and infrared imaging in NIRCAM+MIRI filters with JWST. Here, we present PHANGS-HST-Halpha, which has obtained high-resolution (~2-10 pc), narrow-band imaging in the F658N or F657N filters with the HST/WFC3 camera of the warm ionized gas in the first 19 nearby galaxies observed in common by all four of the PHANGS large programs. We summarize our data reduction process, with a detailed discussion of the production of flux-calibrated, Milky Way extinction corrected, continuum-subtracted Halpha maps. PHANGS-MUSE IFU spectroscopy data are used to background subtract the HST-Halpha maps, and to determine the [NII] correction factors for each galaxy. We describe our public data products and highlight a few key science cases enabled by the PHANGS-HST-Halpha observations.

Brown dwarfs are failed stars with very low mass (13 to 75 M_J), and an effective temperature lower than 2500 K. Thus, they play a key role in understanding the gap in the mass function between stars and planets. However, due to their faint nature, previous searches are inevitably limited to the solar neighbourhood (20 pc). To improve our knowledge of the low mass part of the initial stellar mass function and the star formation history of the Milky Way, it is crucial to find more distant brown dwarfs. Using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) COSMOS-Web data, this study seeks to enhance our comprehension of the physical characteristics of brown dwarfs situated at a distance of kpc scale. The exceptional sensitivity of the JWST enables the detection of brown dwarfs that are up to 100 times more distant than those discovered in the earlier all-sky infrared surveys. The large area coverage of the JWST COSMOS-Web survey allows us to find more distant brown dwarfs than earlier JWST studies with smaller area coverages. To capture prominent water absorption features around 2.7 &amp;mu;m, we apply two colour criteria, F115W-F277W+1&amp;lt;F277W-F444W and F277W-F444W&amp;gt;0.9. We then select point sources by CLASS_STAR, FLUX_RADIUS, and SPREAD_MODEL criteria. Faint sources are visually checked to exclude possibly extended sources. We conduct SED fitting and MCMC simulations to determine their physical properties and associated uncertainties. Our search reveals 25 T-dwarf and 2 Y-dwarf candidates, more than any previous JWST brown dwarf searches. They are located from 0.3 kpc to 4 kpc away from the Earth. The cumulative number count of our brown dwarf candidates is consistent with the prediction from a standard double exponential model. Three of our brown dwarf candidates were detected by HST, with transverse velocities 12±5 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, 12±4 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, and 17±6 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Over ten mid-infrared (mid-IR) and X-ray models are currently attempting to describe the nuclear obscuring material of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), but many questions remain unresolved. This study aims to determine the physical parameters of the obscuring material in nearby AGNs and explore their relationship with nuclear activity. We selected 24 nearby Seyfert AGNs with X-ray luminosities ranging from 10^41 to 10^44 erg/s, using NuSTAR and Spitzer spectra. Our team fitted the spectra using a simultaneous fitting technique. Then, we compared the resulting parameters with AGN properties, such as bolometric luminosity, accretion rate, and black hole mass. Our analysis shows that dust and gas share a similar structure in most AGNs. Approximately 70% of the sample favors a combination of the X-ray UXclumpy model with the Clumpy and two-phases models at IR wavelengths. We found that linking the half-opening angle and torus angular width parameters from X-ray and mid-IR models helps constrain other parameters and break degeneracies. The study reveals that Sy1 galaxies are characterized by low covering factors, half-opening angles, and column densities but high Eddington rates. In contrast, Sy2 galaxies display higher covering factors and column densities, with a broader range of half-opening angles. We also observed that the distribution of obscuring material is closer to the nucleus in intermediate-luminosity sources, while it is more extended in more luminous AGNs. Our findings reinforce the connection between the properties of gas-dust material within 10 pc and AGN activity. Applying this methodology to a larger sample and incorporating data from facilities such as JWST and XRISM will be crucial in further refining these results.

JWST observations, when combined with HST data, promise to improve age estimates of star clusters in nearby spiral galaxies. However, feedback from young cluster stars pushes out the natal gas and dust, making cluster formation and evolution a challenge to model. Here, we use JWST + HST observations of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 628 to produce spectral energy distribution (SED) templates of compact star clusters spanning 275 nm through 21 &amp;mu;m. These preliminary SEDs capture the cluster stars and associated gas and dust within radii of 0.12" to 0.67" (corresponding to 6 to 33 pc at the distance of NGC 628). One important finding is that the SEDs of 1, 2, 3, and 4 Myr clusters can be differentiated in the infrared. Another is that in 80-90% of the cases we study, the PAH and H_alpha emission track one another, with the dust responsible for the 3.3 &amp;mu;m PAH emission largely removed by 4 Myr, consistent with pre-supernova stellar feedback acting quickly on the surrounding gas and dust. Nearly-embedded cluster candidates have infrared SEDs which are quite similar to optically visible 1 to 3 Myr clusters. In nearly all cases we find there is a young star cluster within a few tenths of an arcsec (10 - 30 pc) of the nearly embedded cluster, suggesting the formation of the cluster was triggered by its presence. The resulting age estimates from the empirical templates are compatible both with dynamical estimates based on CO superbubble expansion velocities, and the TODDLERS models which track spherical evolution of homogeneous gas clouds around young stellar clusters.

&lt;p&gt;
We investigate the impact of massive primordial black holes (PBHs; m_BH~ 10^6~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) on the star formation and first galaxy assembly process using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations from z = 1100 to z ~ 9. We find that PBH accretion is self-regulated by feedback, suppressing mass growth unless feedback is weak. PBHs accelerate structure formation by seeding dark matter halos and gravitationally attracting gas, but strong feedback can delay cooling and suppress star formation. In addition, the presence of baryon-dark matter streaming creates an offset between the PBH location and the peaks induced in gas density, promoting earlier and more efficient star formation compared to standard &amp;Lambda;CDM. By z ~ 10, PBH-seeded galaxies form dense star clusters, with PBH-to-stellar mass ratios comparable to observed high-z AGN like UHZ-1. Our results support PBHs as viable SMBH seeds but do not exclude alternative scenarios. We emphasize that PBH-seeding provides a natural explanation for some of the newly-discovered overmassive SMBHs at high redshift, in particular those with extreme ratios of BH-to-dynamical (virial) mass that challenge standard formation channels. Future studies with ultra-deep JWST surveys, the Roman Space Telescope, and radio surveys with facilities such as SKA and HERA will be critical in distinguishing PBH-driven SMBH growth from other pathways.

We leverage JWST's superb resolution to derive strong lensing mass maps of 14 clusters, spanning a redshift range of z~0.25 - 1.06 and a mass range of M_500~2-12 × 10^14M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, from the Strong LensIng and Cluster Evolution (SLICE) JWST program. These clusters represent a small subsample of the first clusters observed in the SLICE program that are chosen based on the detection of new multiple image constraints in the SLICE-JWST NIRCam/F150W2 and F322W2 imaging. These constraints include new lensed dusty galaxies and new substructures in previously identified lensed background galaxies. Four clusters have never been modeled before. For the remaining 10 clusters, we present updated models based on JWST and HST imaging and, where available, ground-based spectroscopy. We model the global mass profile for each cluster and report the mass enclosed within 200 and 500 kpc. We report the number of new systems identified in the JWST imaging, which in one cluster is as high as 19 new systems. The addition of new lensing systems and constraints from substructure clumps in lensed galaxies improves the ability of strong lensing models to accurately reproduce the interior mass distribution of each cluster. We also report the discovery of a candidate transient in a lensed image of the galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0516-5755. All lens models and their associated products are available for download at the Strong Lensing Cluster Atlas Data Base, which is hosted at Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille.

Understanding the coevolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies requires tracing their growth over time. Mass measurements of distant black holes have been limited to active nuclei and commonly rely on spatially unresolved observations, leading to large uncertainties. Accurate masses can be determined by resolving the kinematics of stars within the sphere of influence, which has heretofore been possible only in the local universe. Using JWST, we have measured the mass M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt;=6.0^+2.1_-1.7×10^9 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; of an inactive black hole in a gravitationally lensed quiescent galaxy at redshift z=1.95, along with detailed host properties. Comparisons to local galaxies suggest that the correlation between M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt; and bulge mass has evolved substantially, whereas the correlation with stellar velocity dispersion may have been in place for 10 Gyr.

Recent optical surveys have found a rare population of low-z (z ~ 0.01 - 0.06) extreme star-forming galaxies (xSFGs) that are the most metal-poor galaxies with strong emission lines, extremely high specific star-formation rate and low stellar mass. Using the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, it was found that xSFGs are strong Ly&amp;alpha; emitters. Their Ly&amp;alpha; properties indirectly suggest that they are also strong Ly continuum (LyC) leakers. This along with several other global properties makes them similar to the recently found z &amp;gt; 6 reionization-era star-forming (SF) galaxies using the James Webb Space Telescope. Here we aim to study the radio spectral energy distribution (radio-SED) of 8 xSFGs to understand mechanisms behind the extreme nature of SF in these galaxies, particularly their high ionisation state and possible strong LyC leakage. We present new radio continuum (RC) observations using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at Band-5 (1060 - 1460 MHz) together with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at S- (2-4 GHz), C- (4-8 GHz), X- (8-12 GHz) and Ku- (12-18 GHz) bands and archival LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) survey data between 120-168 MHz for a few sources. The radio-SED of xSFGs is flat between 6-15 GHz and shows a strong evidence for a turnover at lower frequencies in the range of 2-10 GHz. They can be well described using a thermally dominated radio spectra with a free-free absorption component with a high emission measure. Thus the SF complexes in these galaxies are extremely young (pre-SNe stage; below ~ 5 Myrs) and the ISM is very dense suggesting a dominance of young massive star clusters. This can explain several extreme star-forming properties, along with the potential leakage of a significant amount of LyC photons in metal-poor extreme starburst galaxies. (abridged)

&lt;p&gt;
The origin of the rest-optical emission of compact, red, high-redshift sources known as `little red dots' (LRDs) poses a major puzzle. If interpreted as starlight, it would imply that LRDs would constitute the densest stellar systems in the Universe. However, alternative models suggest active galactic nuclei (AGN) may instead power the rest-optical continuum. Here, we present JWST/NIRSpec, NIRCam and MIRI observations from the RUBIES and PRIMER programs of The Cliff: a bright LRD at z=3.55 with an exceptional Balmer break, twice as strong as that of any high-redshift source previously observed. The spectra also reveal broad Hydrogen (H&amp;alpha; FWHM~1500km/s) and He I emission, but no significant metal lines. We demonstrate that massive evolved stellar populations cannot explain the observed spectrum, even when considering unusually steep and strong dust attenuation, or reasonable variations in the initial mass function. Moreover, the formally best-fit stellar mass and compact size (M_*~10^10.5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, r_e~40 pc) would imply densities at which near-monthly stellar collisions might lead to significant X-ray emission. We argue that the Balmer break, emission lines, and H&amp;alpha; absorption line are instead most plausibly explained by a `black hole star' (BH*) scenario, in which dense gas surrounds a powerful ionising source. In contrast to recently proposed BH* models of dust-reddened AGN, we show that spectral fits in the rest UV to near-infrared favour an intrinsically redder continuum over strong dust reddening. This may point to a super-Eddington accreting massive black hole or, possibly, the presence of (super)massive stars in a nuclear star cluster. The Cliff is the clearest evidence to date that at least some LRDs are not ultra-dense, massive galaxies, and are instead powered by a central ionising source embedded in dense, absorbing gas.

&lt;p&gt;
JWST has uncovered large numbers of compact galaxies at high redshift with broad hydrogen/helium lines. These include the enigmatic population known as "little red dots" (LRDs). Their nature is debated, but they are thought to be powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) or intense star formation. They exhibit unusual properties for SMBHs, such as black holes that are overmassive for their host galaxies and extremely weak X-ray and radio emission. Using the highest-quality JWST spectra, we show here that the lines are broadened by electron scattering with a narrow intrinsic line core. The data require high electron column densities and compact sizes (light days), which, when coupled with their high luminosities can only be explained by SMBH accretion. The narrow intrinsic cores of the lines imply upper limits on the black hole masses of 10^5-7 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, two orders of magnitude lower than previous estimates. These are among the lowest mass SMBHs known at high redshift and suggest that this is a population of young, rapidly growing SMBHs. They are enshrouded in a dense cocoon of ionized gas, probably related to their youth, from which they are accreting close to the Eddington limit. Reprocessed nebular emission from the dense cocoon dominates the optical spectrum, explaining most LRD spectral characteristics and helping to suppress radio and X-ray emission.

We report the discovery of a galaxy proto-cluster candidate (dubbed MACS0416-OD-z8p5) at a spectroscopic redshift of z~8.47, dating back to ~550Myr after the Big Bang. The observations are part of the JWST Cycle-3 treasury program, Slitless Areal Pure-Parallel HIgh-Redshift Emission Survey (SAPPHIRES) with NIRCam-grism. Using wide field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) obtained in the MACS0416 parallel field, we robustly confirm nine galaxies at z&lt;sub&gt;spec&lt;/sub&gt;~8.47 via emission line detections of [OIII]5008A (with &amp;gt;5 &amp;sigma;) and tentatively confirm one additional galaxy (at ~3 &amp;sigma;). This discovery represents the highest-redshift, spectroscopically confirmed galaxy over-density known to date, which is ~6&amp;ndash;8 times more dense than the average volume density of galaxies at the same redshift. Furthermore, a galaxy hosting a low-mass active galactic nucleus ("Little-Red-Dot'') is found as a member, suggesting an early emergence of active, massive black holes and feedback between these black holes and their surrounding environments. We also discuss the spatial structures connecting the galaxy over-density to nearby massive star-forming galaxies (separated by ~ 5pMpc, including MACS0416-Y1 and MACS0416-JD. This finding of a massive dark matter halo hosting a galaxy over-density at z~8.5 is surprising given that our survey covered only a small, random field (16.5 arcmin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) as part of a pure parallel observation. The comparison with cosmological simulations shows that the likelihood of finding such a large-scale structure is &amp;lt;5 &amp;percnt; under the current galaxy formation scenario and the observed survey volume. Our results demonstrate the power of WFSS observations to build a complete line-emitter sample and suggest an important role for over-densities in enhancing galaxy formation by funneling large-scale gas supplies into small cosmological volumes.

We present the early data release (EDR) of SAPPHIRES, a JWST Cycle-3 Treasury imaging and spectroscopic survey using the powerful NIRCam wide-field slitless spectroscopic (WFSS) mode in pure parallel. SAPPHIRES will obtain NIRCam imaging and WFSS data in many cosmological deep fields totaling a telescope charged time of 709 hours (557-hour exposures). In this EDR, we present NIRCam imaging and WFSS data obtained in parallel to the Frontier Field galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1-2403, which are attached to primary observations JWST-GO-4750. With a total dual-channel exposure time of 47.2 hours, we obtain deep NIRCam imaging in 13 bands at 0.6&amp;ndash;5.0 micron and deep WFSS at 3.1-5.0 micron through the F356W and F444W filters with grisms in orthogonal dispersion directions. We release reduced NIRCam images, photometric catalogs of 22107 sources and WFSS spectra of 1060 sources with confirmed redshifts (z≃0-8.5). Preliminary value-added catalogs including photometric redshifts, spectroscopic redshifts and physical properties (mass, star-formation rate, etc.) are also made available. We also characterize the data quality and demonstrate scientific applications, including (1) galaxy candidates at the redshift frontier (z≳10), (2) the ionized gas kinematics of a galaxy reconstructed from R~1500 grism spectra at orthogonal dispersion directions, (3) massive emission-line galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) around the Epoch of Reionization.

We report the discovery of a remarkably large and luminous line-emitting nebula extending on either side of the Balmer-break galaxy JADES-GS-518794 at z=5.89, detected with JADES JWST/NIRCam imaging in [O III]&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;4959,5007 and H&amp;alpha; and spectroscopically confirmed with NIRCam/WFSS thanks to the pure-parallel SAPPHIRES programme. The end-to-end velocity offset is &amp;Delta; v=830±130 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Nebulae with such large size and high luminosity (25-pkpc diameter, L[O III] = 1.2× 10^10 L&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) are routinely observed around bright quasars, unlike JADES-GS-518794. With a stellar mass of 10^10.1 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, this galaxy is at the knee of the mass function at z=6. Its star-formation rate declined for some time (10-100 Myr prior to observation), followed by a recent (10 Myr) upturn. This system is part of a candidate large-scale galaxy overdensity, with an excess of Balmer-break galaxies compared to the field (3 &amp;sigma;). We discuss the possible origin of this nebula as material from a merger or gas expelled by an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The symmetry of the nebula, its bubble-like morphology, kinematics, high luminosity, and the extremely high equivalent width of [OIII] together favour the AGN interpretation. Intriguingly, there may be a physical connection between the presence of such a large, luminous nebula and the possible metamorphosis of the central galaxy towards quenching.

We present a sample of six F200W and three F277W dropout sources identified as 16&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;25 galaxy candidates based on the deepest JWST/NIRCam data to date, provided by the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) and the Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public survey (NGDEEP), reaching 5&amp;sigma; depths of ~31.5 mag (AB) at ≥2 &amp;mu;m. We estimate ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions and densities at z~17 and z~25. We find that the number density of galaxies with absolute magnitudes -19&amp;lt;M_UV&amp;lt;-18 (AB) at z~17 (z~25) is a factor of 4 (25) smaller than at z~12; a similar evolution is observed for the luminosity density. Compared to state-of-the-art galaxy simulations, we find the need for an enhanced UV-photon production at z=17-25 in M_DM=10^8.5-9.5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; dark matter halos, maybe provided by an increase in the star formation efficiency at early times and/or by intense bursts fed by very low metallicity or primordial gas. There are few robust theoretical predictions for the evolution of galaxies above z~20 in the literature, however, the continuing rapid drop in the halo mass function suggests more rapid evolution than we observe if photon production efficiencies remained constant. Our z&amp;gt;16 galaxy candidates present mass-weighted ages around 30 Myr, and attenuations A(V)&amp;lt;0.1 mag. Their average stellar mass is M_\bigstar~10^7 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, implying a star formation efficiency (stellar-to-baryon mass fraction) around 10%. We find three galaxies with very blue UV spectral slopes (&amp;beta;~-3) compatible with low metallicity or Pop III and young (≲10 Myr) stars and/or high escape fractions of ionizing photons, the rest presenting slopes &amp;beta;~-2.5 similar to z=10-12 samples.

Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have revealed a population of sources with a compact morphology and a `v-shaped' continuum, namely blue at rest-frame &amp;lambda;&amp;lt;4000A and red at longer wavelengths. The nature of these sources, called `little red dots' (LRDs), is still debated, since it is unclear if they host active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their number seems to drastically drop at z&amp;lt;4. We utilise the 63 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; covered by the quick Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) to extend the search for LRDs to brighter magnitudes and to lower z than what has been possible with JWST to have a broader view of the evolution of this peculiar galaxy population. The selection is done by fitting the available photometric data (Euclid, Spitzer/IRAC, and ground-based griz data) with two power laws, to retrieve the rest-frame optical and UV slopes consistently over a large redshift range (i.e, z&amp;lt;7.6). We exclude extended objects and possible line emitters, and perform a visual inspection to remove imaging artefacts. The final selection includes 3341 LRD candidates from z=0.33 to z=3.6, with 29 detected in IRAC. Their rest-frame UV luminosity function, in contrast with previous JWST studies, shows that the number density of LRD candidates increases from high-z down to z=1.5-2.5 and decreases at even lower z. Less evolution is apparent focusing on the subsample of more robust LRD candidates having IRAC detections, which is affected by low statistics and limited by the IRAC resolution. The comparison with previous quasar UV luminosity functions shows that LRDs are not the dominant AGN population at z&amp;lt;4. Follow-up studies of these LRD candidates are key to confirm their nature, probe their physical properties and check for their compatibility with JWST sources, since the different spatial resolution and wavelength coverage of Euclid and JWST could select different samples of compact sources.

Our understanding of cosmic star-formation at z&amp;gt;3 used to largely rely on rest-frame UV observations. However, these observations overlook dusty and massive sources, resulting in an incomplete census of early star-forming galaxies. Recently, infrared data from Spitzer and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed a hidden population at z~3-6 with extreme red colours. Taking advantage of the overlap between imaging in the Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs), covering ~ 60 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and ancillary Spitzer observations, we identified 27000 extremely red objects with H_E-IRAC2&amp;gt;2.25 (dubbed HIEROs) down to a 10&amp;sigma; completeness magnitude limit of IRAC2 = 22.5 AB. After a visual inspection to discard artefacts and objects with troubling photometry, we ended up with a final sample of 3900 candidates. We retrieved the physical parameter estimates for these objects from the SED-fitting tool CIGALE. Our results confirm that HIERO galaxies may populate the high-mass end of the stellar mass function at z&amp;gt;3, with some reaching extreme stellar masses (M_*&amp;gt;10^11M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) and exhibiting high dust attenuation (A_V&amp;gt;3). However, we consider stellar mass estimates unreliable for z&amp;gt;3.5, favouring a lower-z solution. The challenges faced by SED-fitting tools in characterising these objects highlight the need for further studies, incorporating shorter-wavelength and spectroscopic data. Euclid spectra will help resolve degeneracies and better constrain the physical properties of the brightest galaxies. Given the extreme nature of this population, characterising these sources is crucial for understanding galaxy evolution. This work demonstrates Euclid's potential to provide statistical samples of rare, massive, dust-obscured galaxies at z&amp;gt;3, which will be prime targets for JWST, ALMA, and ELT.

&lt;p&gt;
Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have identified an abundant population of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) already in place during the first few hundred million years of cosmic history. Most of them appear overmassive relative to the stellar mass in their host systems, challenging models of early black hole seeding and growth. Multiple pathways exist to explain their formation, including heavy seeds formed from direct collapse/supermassive stars or sustained super-Eddington accretion onto light stellar remnant seeds. We use the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH to predict the emerging SMBH mass function under physically motivated models for both light and heavy seed formation, to be compared with upcoming ultra-deep JWST surveys. We find that both pathways can reproduce observations at z~5-6, but have distinct features at higher redshifts of z~10. Specifically, JWST observations have the potential to constrain the fraction of efficiently accreting (super-Eddington) SMBHs, as well as the existence and prevalence of heavy seeds, in particular through ultra-deep observations of blank fields and/or gravitational lensing surveys. Such observations will provide key insights to understand the process of SMBH formation and evolution during the emergence of the first galaxies. We further emphasize the great promise of possible SMBH detections at z≳ 15 with future JWST observations to break the degeneracy between light- and heavy-seed models.

James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has opened up a new chapter in infrared astronomy. Besides the discovery and a deeper understanding of various astrophysical sources, JWST can also uncover the non-gravitational nature of dark matter (DM). If DM is QCD axion or an eV-scale Axion-like particle (ALP), it can decay into two photons in the infrared band. This will produce a distinct line signature in the spectroscopic observations made by JWST. Using the latest NIRSpec IFU spectroscopic observations from JWST, we put the strongest bound on the photon coupling for QCD axion/ ALP DM in the mass range between 0.47 and 2.55 eV. In particular, we are able to probe a new mass range for ALP DM between ~ 0.47 eV to 0.78 eV beyond what can be probed by globular cluster observations. We constrain well-motivated and UV complete models of QCD axion and ALP DM, including predictions from some models derived from string theory and/ or various Grand Unification scenarios. Future JWST observations of DM-rich systems with a better understanding of the astrophysical and instrumental backgrounds can thus enable us to potentially discover QCD axion and ALP DM.

&lt;p&gt;
We develop a theoretical framework to provide observational constraints on the early Universe galaxy-halo connection by combining measurements of the UV luminosity function (UVLF) and galaxy clustering via the 2-point correlation function (2PCF). We implemented this framework in the FRESCO and CONGRESS JWST NIRCam/grism surveys by measuring the 2PCF of spectroscopically selected samples of H&amp;alpha; and [OIII] emitters at 3.8&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;9 in 124 arcmin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in GOODS-N and GOODS-S. By fitting the 2PCF and UVLF at 3.8&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;9 we inferred that the H&amp;alpha; and [OIII] samples at &amp;langle; z &amp;rangle; ~4.3, 5.4 and 7.3 reside in halos of masses of log(M_h/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) = 11.5, 11.2, 11.0 respectively, while their galaxy bias increases with redshift with values of b_g = 4.0, 5.0, 7.6. These halos do not represent extreme overdense environments at these epochs. We constrain the instantaneous star formation efficiency (SFE), defined as the ratio of the star formation rate over the baryonic accretion rate as a function of halo mass. The SFE rises with halo mass, peaks at ~20&amp;percnt; at M_h ~ 3 × 10^11  M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, and declines at higher halo masses. The SFE-M_h shows only a mild evolution with redshift with tentative indications that low mass halos decrease but the high mass halos increase in efficiency with redshift. The scatter in the M_UV-M_h relation, quantified by &amp;sigma;_UV, implies stochasticity in the UV luminosities of ~ 0.7 mag, relatively constant with z. Extrapolating our model to z&amp;gt;9 shows that a constant SFE-M_h fixed at z=8 cannot reproduce the observed UVLF and neither high maximum SFE nor high stochasticity alone can explain the high abundances of luminous galaxies seen by JWST. Extending the analysis of the UVLF and 2PCF to z&amp;gt;9 measured from wider surveys will be crucial in breaking degeneracies.

&lt;p&gt;
Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) have long been considered to contribute significantly to the cosmic dust budget. New dust cools quickly and is therefore detectable at mid-infrared (mid-IR) wavelengths. However, before the era of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), direct observational evidence for dust condensation was found in only a handful of nearby CCSNe, and dust masses (~10^-2-10^-3 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, generally limited to &amp;lt;5 yr and to &amp;gt;500K temperatures) have been 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller than either theoretical predictions or dust amounts found by far-IR/submm observations of Galactic SN remnants and in the very nearby SN 1987A. The combined angular resolution and mid-IR sensitivity of JWST finally allow us to reveal hidden cool (~100-200K) dust reservoirs in extragalactic SNe beyond SN 1987A. Our team received JWST/MIRI time for studying a larger sample of CCSNe to fill the currently existing gap in their dust formation histories. The first observed target of this program is the well-known Type IIb SN~1993J appeared in M81. We generated its spectral energy distribution (SED) from the current JWST/MIRI F770W, F1000W, F1500W, and F2100W fluxes. We fit single- and two-component silicate and carbonaceous dust models to the SED. We found that SN 1993J still contains a significant amount (~0.01 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) of dust ~30 yr after explosion. Comparing these results to those of the analysis of earlier Spitzer Space Telescope data, we see a similar amount of dust now that was detected ~15-20 yr ago, but at a lower temperature. We also find residual background emission near the SN site (after point-spread-function subtraction on the JWST/MIRI images) that may plausibly be attributed to an IR echo from more distant interstellar dust grains heated by the SN shock-breakout luminosity or ongoing star formation in the local environment.

&lt;p&gt;
We present a study of giant molecular cloud (GMC) properties in the Andromeda galaxy (M31) using CO(3-2) data from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) in selected regions across the disc and in the nuclear ring, and comparing them with CO(1-0) observations from the IRAM 30m telescope in the same regions. We find that GMCs in the centre of M31 generally exhibit larger velocity dispersions (&amp;sigma;) and sizes (R) compared to those in the disc, while their average surface density (&amp;Sigma;) and turbulent pressure (P_turb) are lower. This low turbulent pressure in the central region is primarily due to the low density of molecular gas. The estimated GMC properties depend on the choice of CO transitions. Compared to CO(1-0), CO(3-2) exhibits smaller velocity dispersion and equivalent radius but higher surface density. These differences highlight the distinct physical conditions probed by different molecular gas tracers. We estimate the virial parameter &amp;alpha;_vir&amp;prop; &amp;sigma;^2 R/&amp;Sigma; and find that most molecular clouds exhibit high values (&amp;alpha;_vir ~ 4-6) for both CO transitions, indicating that they are unbound. Furthermore, clouds in the nuclear ring display even larger &amp;alpha;_vir values of ≲ 100, suggesting that they may be highly dynamic, short-lived structures, although they could potentially achieve equilibrium under the external pressure exerted by the surrounding interstellar medium.

We present distances to ten supernova (SN) host galaxies determined via the red giant branch tip (TRGB) using JWST/NIRCAM and the F115W, F356W, and F444W bandpasses. Our analysis, including photometric catalog cleaning, adoption of disk light profiles, TRGB color slope estimation, and a novel technique for identifying the infrared TRGB, was conducted blinded. The new F115W TRGB distances agree well with our previously derived HST TRGB distances, differing by only 1 percent on average and 4 percent on a per-galaxy basis. The color-corrected F115W TRGB is therefore equally precise a method of distance measurement as, and offers unique advantages over, its color-insensitive, I-band counterpart. Using these distances, we update the absolute calibrations of eleven calibrator SNe, yielding 68.4 &amp;lt; H0 &amp;lt; 69.6 km/s/Mpc depending on which of four sets of SN magnitudes are used. We expand the sample of calibrator SNe to 24 by combining with HST TRGB distances. Doing so increases our H0 estimate based on the Carnegie Supernova Project II (CSP-II) by 0.8 km/s/Mpc (1.4 sigma) demonstrating that our JWST H0 based on 11 SNe is not significantly biased toward lower values. In contrast, the Pantheon+ calibration shifts higher by +2 km/s/Mpc (3.1 sigma), a significantly larger increase than seen in both the CSP and the Pantheon team's own SuperCal analysis. More JWST observations of the TRGB as well as independent analyses of low-redshift SNe are needed to continue unraveling the true nature of the Hubble Tension.

We introduce a python package called ECHO21 for generating global 21-cm signal from the dark ages through cosmic dawn to the end of reionization. Because of its analytical-prescription-based foundation, ECHO21 generates a single model in O(1) s. The code can generate a large set of signals, ideal for building emulators and performing astrophysical or cosmological inference from a given 21-cm dataset. The code is MPI parallel with reasonable scalability and thus, can be run on high-performance computers. We offer six astrophysical parameters that control the Lyman-&amp;alpha; emissivity, X-ray emissivity, emissivity of ionizing photons, and star formation rate. A critical component of 21-cm modelling, but ignored by majority of public codes, that we include is the Ly&amp;alpha; heating. For a certain range of astrophysical parameters, the Ly&amp;alpha; heating could even dominate the X-ray heating. In addition to astrophysical parameters, in ECHO21 it is just as easy to vary the standard cosmological parameters which makes it possible to combine constraints from 21-cm observations and other cosmological probes. Further, we offer two models of star formation rate; a physically-motivated and an empirically-motivated. Since the latter is directly inferred by HST/JWST observations, it makes ECHO21 an appropriate tool to build synergies between 21-cm observations and galaxy surveys. With a number of 21-cm experiments soon to provide cosmic dawn 21-cm data, ECHO21 is a handy package for making quick but sufficiently realistic astrophysical inferences.

&lt;p&gt;
JWST spectroscopy has revealed a population of compact objects at redshifts z=2-9 with `v'-shaped spectral energy distributions, broad permitted lines, and, often, hydrogen Balmer absorption. Among these `Little Red Dots' (LRDs), Abell2744-QSO1 at z=7.04 has been confirmed to have time-variable equivalent width (EW) in its broad emission lines, confirming its AGN nature. We extend the analysis of NIRSpec/IFS data from the BlackTHUNDER survey to the H&amp;alpha; line. The broad-line profile in Abell2744-QSO1 is manifestly non-Gaussian, requiring at least two Gaussian components with full width at half maximum FWHM=450±50 and 1800±100 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Crucially, we also detect a narrow-line Gaussian component, and strong H&amp;alpha; absorption (EW relative to the continuum ≈ 30^+15_-9 A), confirming a connection between the strong Balmer break and line absorption. The absorber is at rest with respect to broad H&amp;alpha;, suggesting that the gas cannot be interpreted as an inflow or outflow, forming instead a long-lived structure. Its velocity dispersion is &amp;sigma;_abs = 100±10 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, consistent with the value inferred from the analysis of the Balmer break. Based on H&amp;alpha;, we infer a black hole mass of log(M_BH/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;)=6.3-6.7, 0.9-1.3 dex smaller than previous estimates based on H&amp;beta;. The Eddington ratio is 0.7-1.6. Combining the high signal-to-noise ratio of the narrow H&amp;alpha; line with the spectral resolution R=3,700 of the G395H grating, we infer a narrow-line dispersion &amp;sigma;_n = 22^+5_-6 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, which places a stringent constraint on the black-hole-to-dynamical-mass ratio of this system to be M_BH/M_dyn&amp;gt;0.02-0.4. If M_BH is near the low-mass end of our estimates, the SMBH would be accreting at a super-Eddington rate. Alternatively, at the high-M_BH end, there would be minimal room for a host galaxy.

&lt;p&gt;
I present the first constraints on QCD axion dark matter using measurements from the James Webb Space Telescope. By utilizing publicly available MIRI and NIRSpec blank-sky observations, originally collected for sky subtraction purposes, I derive strong limits on the axion-photon coupling constant g_a &amp;gamma; &amp;gamma; in the mass range 0.1-4 eV. These constraints improve upon previous studies by more than two orders of magnitude for a range of masses. This analysis underscores the potential of blank-sky observations as a powerful tool for constraining dark matter models and demonstrates how astrophysical missions can be repurposed for particle physics research.

We derive Fe-abundance ratios of 6 galaxies at z=9-12 with -22&amp;lt;M_UV&amp;lt;-19 whose JWST/NIRSpec spectra achieve very high signal-to-noise ratios, SNR=40-230, at the rest-frame UV wavelength. We fit stellar synthesis model spectra to these JWST spectra, carefully masking out nebular emission, interstellar absorption, and non-iron stellar absorption lines, and obtain Fe-abundance ratios of [Fe/H]=-2-0 for 4 galaxies and upper limits of [Fe/H]~-1 for 2 galaxies. We compare these [Fe/H] values with the oxygen abundances of these galaxies (7.2&amp;lt;12+log(O/H)&amp;lt;7.9) in the same manner as previous studies of low-z galaxies, and derive oxygen-to-iron abundance ratios [O/Fe]. We find that majority of (4 out of 6) galaxies are consistent with iron-poor abundance ratios ([O/Fe]≳0) while that 2 out of 6 galaxies, GS-z11-0 and GN-z11, show Fe enhancements ([O/Fe]&amp;lt;0), especially GS-z11-0 (z=11.12) with a Fe enhancement ([O/Fe]=-0.91_-0.42^+0.35) beyond the solar-abundance ratio at ~3&amp;sigma;. Because, unlike GS-z11-0, GN-z11 (z=10.60) may be an AGN, we constrain [O/Fe] via FeII emission under the assumption of AGN and confirm that the Fe enhancement is consistent even in the case of AGN. While [O/Fe] values of the majority of the galaxies are explained by the chemical enrichment of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), the Fe enhancements of GS-z11-0 and GN-z11 are puzzling. We develop chemical evolution models, and find that the iron enhancements against oxygen in GS-z11-0 and GN-z11 can be explained by 1) pair-instability supernovae/bright hypernovae with little contribution of CCSNe or 2) Type-Ia supernovae with short delay time (~30-50 Myr) with a top-light initial mass function.

High-redshift little red dots (LRDs) detected with the James Webb Space Telescope are considered the cores of emerging galaxies. For the first time, we compare LRDs in M_bh-M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; diagrams with an array of z=0 galaxy-morphology-dependent scaling relations, along with the M_bh-M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;,nsc relation for nuclear star clusters. The M_bh-M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;,sph relations for spheroidal stellar systems are characterised by a nearly parallel set of quasi-quadratic (or steeper) distributions that are known to trace the `punctuated equilibrium' of galaxies, reflecting their stepwise growth in black hole mass and merger-built bulge/spheroid mass. We show that LRDs are not equivalent to nuclear star clusters, with the latter having higher M_bh/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; ratios. However, the least massive LRDs exhibit similar M_bh and M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;,gal values as ultracompact dwarf (UCD) galaxies. We show that the LRDs span the M_bh-M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;,gal diagram from UCD galaxies to primaeval lenticular galaxies. In contrast, spiral galaxies and the subset of major-merger-built early-type galaxies define offset relations. Additionally, we observe that low-z galaxies with active galactic nuclei align with the steep black hole scaling relations for disc galaxies defined by primarily inactive galaxies with directly measured black hole masses. Collectively, this highlights the benefits of considering galaxy morphology, which reflects their accretion and merger history, to understand the coevolution of galaxies and their black holes.

While about 20 Type II supernova progenitors have been identified using optical data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), direct detection of type Ib/Ic supernova (SN Ib/Ic) progenitors remains challenging due to their faint optical brightness and highly obscured environments. This study aims to investigate the detection limits and advantages of near-infrared (near-IR) observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (NGRST) for the detection of SN Ib/Ic progenitors. The spectral energy distributions of SN Ib/Ic progenitor models with various masses, chemical compositions, and mass-loss rates are calculated with the non-LTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN. We then assess the detectability of SN Ib/Ic progenitors using near-IR filters from the JWST and the NGRST, comparing the results to the capabilities of the HST. Our analysis indicates that near-IR observations significantly outperform the HST in detecting SN Ib/Ic progenitors when considering the effect of extinction. Near-IR magnitudes also provide better constraints on the mass-loss rates of progenitors because of the free-free emission from the wind matter. Additionally, near-IR magnitudes and color-color diagrams are effective in distinguishing SN Ib/Ic progenitors from possible companion and/or background objects. This study suggests that the JWST and the NGRST can play a crucial role in advancing our understanding of SN Ib/Ic progenitors by improving detectability and offering better constraints on progenitor properties. We emphasize that observations with exposure times exceeding 1 hour would be needed to detect typical SNe Ib/Ic progenitors at distances greater than 10 Mpc.

We re-analysed ALMA observations of the [OIII]&amp;lambda;88&amp;mu;m emission line in JADES-GS-z14.0, so far the most distant spectroscopically confirmed galaxy at z=14.18. Our analysis shows a tentative detection of a velocity gradient of [OIII]&amp;lambda;88&amp;mu;m using three independent tests: 1) construction of moment maps; 2) extraction of integrated spectra from a grid of apertures; and 3) spectro-astrometry in both the image and uv planes. We performed kinematical fitting using the KinMS code and estimated a dynamical mass of log_10(M_dyn/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;)= 9.4^+0.8_-0.4, with the bulk of the uncertainties due to the degeneracy between dynamical mass and inclination. We measure an upper limit on the velocity dispersion (&amp;sigma;_v) of &amp;lt;40~ km/s~which results in an estimate of V_rot/&amp;sigma;&amp;gt; 2.5. This result, if confirmed with higher-resolution observations, would imply that kinematically cold discs are already in place at z~14. Comparison with mock observations from the SERRA cosmological simulations confirms that even low-resolution observations are capable of detecting a velocity gradient in z&amp;gt;10 galaxies as compact as JADES-GS-z14.0. This work shows that deeper ALMA or JWST/NIRSpec IFS observations with high spatial resolution will be able to estimate an accurate dynamical mass for JADES-GS-z14.0, providing an upper limit to the stellar mass of this over-luminous galaxy.

We use archival JWST/NIRCam images in the F115W, F150W, and F200W filters to measure the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) magnitudes across the disk of the late-type spiral galaxy NGC 628. In this exploratory study, we demonstrate how the metallicity-dependence of TRGB magnitudes in the near-infrared (NIR) filters can be exploited by making use of the theoretical isochrones to determine metallicities of the fossil 10 Gyr old population over kiloparsec scales without being affected by the age-metallicity-reddening degeneracy. We obtain a smooth metallicity gradient that decreases from Z=0.003 in the central regions to Z=0.002 in the external parts, with a typical error on Z of 0.0002. The extinction variation across the disk caused by the diffuse interstellar dust is spiky with a median value of A_V=0.12 mag. We propose that the large bubbles in the disks of galaxies offer dust-free lines of sight for measuring the TRGB magnitudes, and hence the distance to galaxies, to an accuracy that is as good as that of the halo populations. Using the Phantom Void, we obtain a TRGB distance modulus of 29.81±0.05(stat)±0.06(sys) mag for NGC 628, which agrees well with the most recent PNLF measurement of 29.89^+0.06_-0.09 for this galaxy.

&lt;p&gt;
Cosmic reionization of HI leaves enduring relics in the post-reionization intergalactic medium, potentially influencing the Lyman-&amp;alpha; (Ly&amp;alpha;) forest down to redshifts as low as z ≈ 2, which is the so-called ''memory of reionization'' effect. Here, we re-analyze the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from Ly&amp;alpha; absorption and quasar correlations using data from the extended Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) Data Release 16 (DR16), incorporating for the first time the memory of reionization in the Ly&amp;alpha; forest. Three distinct scenarios of reionization timeline are considered in our analyses. We find that the recovered BAO parameters (&amp;alpha;_\parallel, &amp;alpha;_\perp) remain consistent with the original eBOSS DR16 analysis. However, models incorporating reionization relics provide a better fit to the data, with a tantalizing preference for early reionization, consistent with recent findings from the James Webb Space Telescope. Furthermore, the inclusion of reionization relics significantly impacts the non-BAO parameters. For instance, we report deviations of up to 3&amp;sigma; in the Ly&amp;alpha; redshift-space distortion parameter and ~7&amp;sigma; in the linear Ly&amp;alpha; bias for the late reionization scenario. Our findings suggest that the eBOSS Ly&amp;alpha; data is more accurately described by models that incorporate a broadband enhancement to the Ly&amp;alpha; forest power spectrum, highlighting the importance of accounting for reionization relics in cosmological analyses.

The strongly lensed Supernova (SN) Encore at a redshift of z = 1.949, discovered behind the galaxy cluster MACS J0138-2155 at z=0.336, provides a rare opportunity for time-delay cosmography and studies of the SN host galaxy, where previously another SN, called SN Requiem, had appeared. To enable these studies, we combine new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging, archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, and new Very Large Telescope (VLT) spectroscopic data to construct state-of-the-art lens mass models that are composed of cluster dark-matter (DM) halos and galaxies. We determine the photometric and structural parameters of the galaxies across six JWST and five HST filters. We use the color-magnitude and color-color relations of spectroscopically-confirmed cluster members to select additional cluster members, identifying a total of 84 galaxies belonging to the galaxy cluster. We construct seven different mass models using a variety of DM halo mass profiles, and explore both multi-plane and approximate single-plane lens models. As constraints, we use the observed positions of 23 multiple images from eight multiply lensed sources at four distinct spectroscopic redshifts. In addition, we use stellar velocity dispersion measurements to obtain priors on the galaxy mass distributions. We find that six of the seven models fit well to the observed image positions. Mass models with cored-isothermal DM profiles fit well to the observations, whereas the mass model with a Navarro-Frenk-White cluster DM profile has an image-position &amp;chi;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; value that is four times higher. We build our ultimate model by combining four multi-lens-plane mass models and predict the image positions and magnifications of SN Encore and SN Requiem. Our work lays the foundation for building state-of-the-art mass models of the cluster for future cosmological analysis and SN host galaxy studies.

&lt;p&gt;
In the most precise distance ladder determination of H_0, the observed near-infrared (NIR) fluxes of Cepheids are corrected for dust, assuming that the extinction law in large, star-forming spiral hosts of Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) is similar to the Milky Way's average value of R_V ≈ 3.1. Intriguingly, studies of SNe Ia often point to lower values for their hosts (R_V ~ 2). Ambiguities related to R_V may limit future efforts to measure H_0 beyond ~ 1&amp;percnt; precision. To better resolve extragalactic extinction laws, we directly measure the wavelength-dependent absorption of background galaxies seen in HST and JWST images (0.5&amp;ndash;2.7 &amp;mu;m). We take the following steps: (i) subtract foreground stars to measure accurate photometry of background galaxies with a tool, ttSPHOT; (ii) measure their redshifts and spectroscopic features with Keck/DEIMOS; (iii) determine their intrinsic spectral energy distributions from the empirical templates which match the absorption lines and breaks in observed spectroscopic features, and (iv) measure R_V by fitting the extinction model to the difference between the template and the observed SEDs. The above steps are tested with artificial datasets to insure they accurately recover the input R_V. We apply this set of steps to a first case, NGC 5584, a SN Ia host and a calibrator of the Hubble constant. The estimated value of R_V for NGC 5584, R_V=3.59^+0.99_-0.62(stat)±0.19(syst), is consistent with the MW-like extinction law, and it is ≳ 3.5&amp;sigma; away from R_V=2 as favored by SN Ia. If additional hosts show similar results, it would suggest that SN Ia extinction may not be solely due to mean interstellar dust. We are now undertaking a statistical study of 5-10 SH0ES hosts to determine the distribution of host extinction laws.

&lt;p&gt;
The point-spread function of the integral-field unit (IFU) mode of the JWST's NIRSpec is heavily under-sampled, creating resampling noise seen as low-frequency sinusoidal-like artifacts, or "wiggles". These artifacts in the data are not corrected in the JWST data pipeline, and significantly impact the science that can be achieved at a single-pixel level. We present WICKED (WIggle Corrector Kit for NIRSpEc Data), a tool designed to empirically remove wiggles. WICKED uses the Fast Fourier Transform to identify wiggle-affected spaxels across the data cube. Spectra are modeled with a mix of integrated aperture and annular templates, a power-law, and a second-degree polynomial. The method works across all medium- and high-resolution NIRSpec gratings: F070LP, F100LP, F170LP, and F290LP. WICKED can recover the true overall spectral shape up to a factor of 3.5x better compared to uncorrected spectra. It recovers the equivalent width of absorption lines within 5% of the true value-~3x better than uncorrected spectra and ~2x better than other methods. WICKED significantly improves kinematic measurements, recovering the line-of-sight velocity (LOSV) within 1% of the true value &amp;ndash; more than 100x better than uncorrected spectra at S/N ~40. As a case study, we applied WICKED to G235H/F170LP IFU data of the elliptical galaxy NGC5128, finding good agreement with previous studies. In wiggle-affected regions, the uncorrected spectrum showed stellar LOSV and velocity dispersion differences compared to the WICKED-cleaned spectrum, of ~17x and ~36x larger than the estimated uncertainties, respectively. Wiggles in NIRSpec IFU data can introduce severe biases in spectral shape, line measurements, and kinematics to values larger than the typical uncertainties. WICKED provides a robust, user-friendly solution, enabling precise single-pixel studies and maximizing JWST's potential.

&lt;p&gt;
We present a new parametric strong lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster MACS J0138.0-2155 at z = 0.336, the first known to show two multiply-imaged supernova (SN) siblings, SN Requiem and SN Encore at z= 1.949. We exploit HST and JWST multiband imaging in synergy with new MUSE spectroscopy to develop an improved lens mass model. We include 84 cluster members (of which ~60% are spectroscopically confirmed) and two perturber galaxies along the line of sight. Our observables consist of 23 spectroscopically confirmed multiple images from 8 background sources, spanning a fairly wide redshift range, from 0.767 to 3.420. To accurately characterise the sub-halo mass component, we calibrate the Faber-Jackson scaling relation based on the stellar kinematics of 14 bright cluster galaxies. We build several lens models, with different cluster total mass parametrisations, to assess the statistical and systematic uncertainties on the predicted values of the position and magnification of the observed and future multiple images of SN Requiem and SN Encore. Our reference best-fit lens model reproduces the observed positions of the multiple images with a root-mean-square offset of 0".36, and the multiple image positions of the SNe and their host galaxy with a remarkable mean precision of only 0".05. We measure a projected total mass of M(&amp;lt;60~ kpc) = 2.89_-0.03^+0.04 × 10^13 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, consistent with that independently derived from the Chandra X-ray analysis. We demonstrate the reliability of the new lens model by reconstructing the extended surface-brightness distribution of the multiple images of the host galaxy. The discrepancy between our model-predicted magnification values with those from previous studies, critical for understanding the intrinsic properties of the SNe and their host galaxy, underscores the need to combine cutting-edge observations with detailed lens modelling.

We compare forecasts for the abundance and properties of strong gravitational lenses in the COSMOS-Web survey, a 0.54 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; survey of the COSMOS field using the NIRCam and MIRI instruments aboard JWST, with the first catalogue of strong lens candidates identified in the observed NIRCam data, COWLS. We modify the lenspop package to produce a forecast for strong lensing in COSMOS-Web. We add a new mock galaxy catalogue to use as the source population, as well as the COSMOS-Web survey specifications, including the transmission data for the four NIRCam filters used. We forecast 107 strong lenses can be detected in COSMOS-Web across all bands, assuming complete subtraction of the lens galaxy light. The majority of the lenses are forecast to have small Einstein radii (&amp;theta;_E &amp;lt; 1 arcsecond) and lie at redshifts between 0 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt;2, whilst the source redshift distribution peaks at z~ 3 and has a long tail extending up to z ~ 11, unambiguously showing that strong lensing in JWST can probe the entirety of the epoch of reionisation. We compare our forecast with the distributions of Einstein radii, lens photometric redshifts, and lens and source magnitudes in the observed lenses, finding that whilst the forecast and observed Einstein radii distributions match, the redshifts and magnitudes do not. The observed lens redshift distribution peaks at a slightly lower redshift than the forecast one, whilst the lens magnitudes are systematically brighter in the observed data than in the forecast. Assuming the validity of the lenspop forecast, this finding motivates further inspection of the COWLS data to search for the as-yet undiscovered population of faint, high-redshift lenses.

We model the formation of star clusters in a dwarf galaxy progenitor during the first 700 Myr of cosmic history using a cosmological radiation-hydrodynamic simulation with a realistic sub-grid star formation efficiency (SFE) model, derived from AU-scale radiation-MHD simulations of molecular clouds with varying mass, density, and metallicity. Using this model for cloud-scale SFEs, the galaxy forms stars stochastically, assembling most of its 10^6~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; in stars by redshift z=8 through two star-forming bursts (SFBs), each lasting ~10~Myr, separated by 80~Myr of quiescence. Clouds reach SFEs up to 80&amp;percnt; during the first SFB, forming bound star clusters (densities ~10^2-4 ~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;\:pc^-2, radii ≲ 3~pc) resembling those observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in strongly lensed galaxies. Star clusters follow a flat power-law mass function with slope \Gamma ~ -0.4. The most massive star clusters (10^4-5 ~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) grow through mergers and have metallicity spreads of 0.05 - 0.1 dex that roughly scale with mass. The second SFB forms loosely bound star clusters with higher metallicities: -1.95 &amp;lt; log(Z/Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;lt; -1.50 at lower SFEs (2 - 20&amp;percnt;). At z ~ 8.7, a nuclear star cluster (NSC) is seeded, growing 83&amp;percnt; of its mass ( 2.4 × 10^5 ~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, 20&amp;percnt; of the galaxy's stellar mass) through mergers with pre-existing clusters and the rest through in-situ star formation. The early formation of NSCs has interesting implications for seeding supermassive black holes and the population of "little red dots" recently discovered by JWST at z ≳ 5.

Measurements of the ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) can probe the sources of the extragalactic ionizing background. We provide new measurements of the ionizing emissivity of galaxies using measurements of the ionizing background and ionizing photon mean free path from high-redshift quasar spectra at 2.5 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 6. Unlike most prior works, we account for radiative-transfer effects and possible neutral islands from the tail of reionization at z &amp;gt; 5. We combine our results with measurements of the UV luminosity function to constrain the average escaping ionizing efficiency of galaxies, &amp;langle; f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rangle;_L_UV. Assuming galaxies with M_UV &amp;lt; -11 emit ionizing photons, we find log (&amp;langle; f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rangle;_L_UV/erg^-1Hz) = 24.47_-0.17^+0.09 and 24.75_-0.28^+0.15 at z=5 and 6, and 1&amp;sigma; upper limits of 24.48 and 24.31 at z = 2.5 and 4, respectively. We also estimate the population-averaged f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt; using measurements of intrinsic ionizing efficiency from JWST. We find &amp;langle; f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rangle; = 0.126_-0.041^+0.034 and 0.224_-0.108^+0.098 at z=5 and 6, and 1&amp;sigma; upper limits of f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt; 0.138 and 0.096 at z=2.5 and 4, respectively, for M_UV &amp;lt; -11. Our findings are consistent with prior measurements of f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt; ≲ 10&amp;percnt; at z ≤ 4, but indicate a factor of several increase between z = 4 and 6. The steepness of this evolution is sensitive to the highly uncertain mean free path and ionizing background intensity at z&amp;gt;5. Lastly, we find 1.10^+0.21_-0.39 photons per H atom are emitted into the IGM between z=6 and =5.3. This is ≈ 4× more than needed to complete the last 20&amp;percnt; of reionization absent recombinations, suggesting that reionization's end was likely absorption-dominated.

We present the COSMOS-Web Lens Survey (COWLS), a sample of over 100 strong lens candidates from the 0.54 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; COSMOS-Web survey, discovered using exquisite James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging across four wavebands. Following two rounds of visual inspection, over 100 candidates were ranked as `high confidence' or `likely' by at least 50&amp;percnt; of inspectors. The COWLS sample has several notable properties: (i) magnified source galaxies spanning redshifts z ~ 0.1 to z ~ 9, which therefore extend into the epoch of reionisation; (ii) the highest-redshift lens galaxies known, pushing galaxy density profile evolution studies beyond z ~ 2; (iii) all lenses are distributed within a contiguous 0.54 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; region, allowing for joint strong and weak lensing analyses; and (iv) a subset exhibits lensed source emission ray-traced near the lens galaxy centers, enabling studies of supermassive black holes and dust absorption. A key innovation of our approach is the use of lens modelling to aid in identifying lenses that may otherwise be missed. This paper is accompanied by the first COWLS public release, providing JWST NIRCam imaging in four bands, lens models, pixelized source reconstructions and lens redshift estimates : https://github.com/Jammy2211/COWLS_COSMOS_Web_Lens_Survey

In the merger-driven galaxy evolution scenario, the central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in dust obscured galaxies grow rapidly. Interestingly, a recent work \citepsuh24 on a dust-obscured galaxy, LID-568 at z=3.965, has shown that its SMBH is growing extremely fast at about 40 times of the Eddington-limited accretion rate (i.e., super-Eddington accretion). However, the heavy dust extinction of the host galaxy could affect the result if not corrected properly. Here, we analyze James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec/IFU and MIRI spectra of LID-568. By measuring its bolometric luminosity (L_bol) and BH mass (M_BH) using an extinction-free estimator based on mid-infrared spectra, we obtain L_bol = 10^46.83±0.07 erg s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and M_BH = 10^8.43±0.15 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. The measured Eddington ratio (&amp;lambda;_Edd) is 1.97±0.88, consistent with the accretion rate at the Eddington limit; in other words, not in super-Eddington in a significant manner. This result underscores challenges and the importance of carefully considering dust extinction when analyzing the BH growth in dust-obscured quasars.

We use the deep NIRCam and MIRI imaging from the JWST PRIMER survey to study the properties of (sub)mm sources detected by ALMA in the centre of the COSMOS field, with the aim of better constraining the history of dust-enshrouded star formation. The wealth of ALMA data in this field enabled us to isolate a robust sample of 128 (sub)mm sources within the 175 sq. arcmin of the PRIMER COSMOS survey footprint, spanning two decades in (sub)mm flux density. The JWST imaging is deep/red enough to reveal secure galaxy counterparts for all of these sources. Moreover, 52% of the galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts, enabling us to refine the photo-zs for the remaining galaxies. Armed with this robust redshift information, we calculate the star-formation rates (SFR) and stellar masses of all 128 ALMA-detected galaxies, and place them in the context of other galaxies in the field. We find that the vast majority of star formation is dust-enshrouded in the ALMA-detected galaxies, with SFR ranging from ~1000 down to ~20 solar masses per year. We also find that virtually all (126/128) have high stellar masses, at all redshifts, with log(M/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;gt; 10. The unusually high quality of our sample enables us to make a robust estimate of the contribution of the ALMA-detected galaxies to cosmic star-formation rate density from z = 2 out to z = 7. Finally, to correct for the fact that the deep ALMA pointings cover &amp;lt; 20% of the PRIMER COSMOS area, we use our knowledge of all other massive galaxies in the field to produce a completeness-corrected estimate of dust-enshrouded star-formation rate density over cosmic time. This confirms that UV-visible star formation dominates at z &amp;gt; 4, but also indicates that dust-enshrouded star formation likely still made a significant contribution at higher redshifts: extrapolation of our results suggest a ~20% contribution at z = 8, and potentially still ~5% at z = 10.

Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations have revealed a peculiar class of galaxies at redshifts z ≳ 6, characterized by extremely high central stellar densities and overmassive central supermassive black holes (SMBHs), "little red dots" (LRDs). A critical question remains: If LRDs were common at high redshifts, how would they evolve into local elliptical galaxies with significantly lower central densities? To address this, we performed direct N-body simulations of LRD mergers, focusing on the coevolution of host galaxies and central SMBHs. We track the complete evolution of SMBH binaries into the three-body hardening and gravitational-wave (GW) emission phase. Our results demonstrate that during galaxy mergers, the central SMBHs can eject a substantial amount of mass from the galactic core via the three-body slingshot effect, leading to a decrease in central stellar surface density by an order of magnitude. Additionally, GW recoil can further contribute in making the galaxy centers less dense and more in alignment with low-redshift quiescent galaxies. This transformation occurs on a relatively short timescale of a few ~100 Myr, implying that LRDs can evolve into lower-redshift elliptical galaxies by z&amp;lt;4. The timescales for our SMBH mergers vary between 100 Myr and 800 Myr, depending on the initial orbital parameters of the merging galaxies and the mass ratio of the SMBHs. Our findings provide a plausible mechanism for the transformation of LRDs into elliptical galaxies while highlighting the efficiency of SMBH mergers in such high-density environments, which plays a crucial role in SMBH growth.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has transformed our understanding of early galaxy formation, providing an unprecedented view of the first billion years of cosmic history. These observations offer a crucial opportunity to probe the interplay between galaxy formation and reionization, placing stringent constraints on theoretical models. In this work, we build upon our previously developed semi-analytical framework that self-consistently models the evolving UV luminosity function (UVLF) of galaxies and the global reionization history while incorporating the effects of radiative feedback. Comparing our predictions with JWST and HST data, we identify a fundamental tension: models that match the UVLF fail to reproduce the observed evolution of galaxy clustering (bias) with redshift, and vice versa. To resolve this, we introduce a mass-dependent duty cycle linked to star formation duration. This duty cycle approaches unity at z &amp;gt; 11, requiring either enhanced UV radiation production or increased star formation efficiency to match the JWST UVLFs, while declining towards lower redshifts (5 &amp;lt; z ≤ 9) to remain consistent with the bias measurements. Reconciling theory with observations requires that the characteristic star formation timescale increases from ≈ 80 Myr at z ≈ 6 to ≈ 120 Myr at z ≈ 8. Finally, our extended model, assuming a halo mass-independent escape fraction of ≈ 12&amp;percnt;, produces a reionization history consistent with current constraints. These findings underscore the importance of jointly constraining high-redshift galaxy models using both UVLF and bias statistics to accurately interpret JWST data and refine our understanding of early cosmic evolution.

The spatial correlation between galaxies and the Ly&amp;alpha; forest provides insights into how galaxies reionized the Universe. Here, we present initial results on the spatial cross-correlation between [OIII] emitters and Ly&amp;alpha; forest at 5.4&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6.5 from the JWST ASPIRE NIRCam/F356W Grism Spectroscopic Survey in z&amp;gt;6.5 QSO fields. Using data from five QSO fields, we find 2&amp;sigma; evidence for excess Ly&amp;alpha; forest transmission at ~20-40 cMpc around [OIII] emitters at z=5.86, indicating that [OIII] emitters reside within a highly ionized IGM. At smaller scales, the Ly&amp;alpha; forest is preferentially absorbed, suggesting gas overdensities around [OIII] emitters. Comparing with models including THESAN simulations, we interpret the observed cross-correlation as evidence for significant large-scale fluctuations of the IGM and the late end of reionization at z&amp;lt;6, characterized by ionized bubbles over 50 cMpc around [OIII] emitters. The required UV background necessitates an unseen population of faint galaxies around the [OIII] emitters. Furthermore, we find that the number of observed [OIII] emitters near individual transmission spikes is insufficient to sustain reionization in their surroundings, even assuming all [OIII] emitters harbour AGN with 100 % LyC escape fractions. Despite broad agreement, a careful analysis of ASPIRE and THESAN, using the observed host halo mass from the clustering of [OIII] emitters, suggests that the simulations underpredict the observed excess IGM transmission around [OIII] emitters, challenging our model of reionization. Potential solutions include larger ionized bubbles at z&amp;lt;6, more enhanced large-scale UV background or temperature fluctuations of the IGM, and possibly a patchy early onset of reionization at z&amp;gt;10. Current observational errors are dominated by cosmic variance, meaning future analyses of more QSO fields from JWST will improve the results.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has observed massive galaxies at high redshifts, which implies an earlier epoch of reionization (EoR) compared with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) results. In this paper, based on ttPlanck 2020 (NPIPE release), ttACT DR4 and ttSPT-3G data, if assumed a Harrison-Zel'dovich (HZ) primordial power spectrum in the standard cosmological model, we discover that the redshift or optical depth of reionization is larger than the case of a power-law (PL) primordial power spectrum. In HZ- &amp;Lambda; CDM model, the redshift of reionization is z_reio = 9.11 ± 0.61 , which is consistent with the JWST result that z_reio ≈ 8.9 . Moreover, the cosmological tensions, i.e. Hubble (H_0) tension and S_8 tension are alleviated in HZ- &amp;Lambda; CDM case. The Hubble constant is H_0 = 70.38 ± 0.35   km/s/Mpc and the structure growth parameter is S_8 = 0.7645± 0.0094 in HZ- &amp;Lambda; CDM model. We also consider two extensions of &amp;Lambda; CDM, including &amp;Lambda; CDM + A_L and &amp;Lambda; CDM + &amp;Omega;_k models. But the extensions of &amp;Lambda; CDM with a HZ spectrum meet more serious CMB anomalies, i.e. lensing anomaly and spatial curvature anomaly as compared with the extensions of &amp;Lambda; CDM with a PL spectrum. We discuss that these two CMB anomalies may come from the degeneracy of cosmological parameters.

&lt;p&gt;
Recently, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has found early galaxies producing photons from more efficient ionization than previously assumed. This may suggest a reionization process with a larger reionization optical depth, &amp;tau;_reio, in some mild disagreement with that inferred from measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB). Intriguingly, the CMB would prefer larger values of &amp;tau;_reio, more consistent with the recent JWST hint, if the large-scale measurements (i.e. &amp;ell; &amp;lt;30) of E-mode polarization are removed. In addition, &amp;tau;_reio has an indirect correlation with today's Hubble constant H_0 in &amp;Lambda;CDM. Motivated by these interesting observations, we investigate and reveal the underlying mechanism for this correlation, using the CMB dataset without the low-&amp;ell; polarization data as a proxy for a potential cosmology with a larger &amp;tau;_reio. We further explore how this correlation may impact the Hubble tension between early and late universe measurements of H_0, in &amp;Lambda;CDM as well as two proposals to alleviate the Hubble tension: the dark radiation (DR) and early dark energy (EDE) models. We find that the Hubble tension gets further reduced mildly for almost all cases due to the larger &amp;tau;_reio and its positive correlation with H_0, with either the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data before those from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) or the DESI data.

The James Webb Space Telescope has detected massive black holes (BHs) with masses of ~ 10^6-8~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; within the first billion years of the universe. One of the remarkable findings is the identification of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs), a unique class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with distinct characteristics representing a key phase in the formation and growth of early BHs. Here, we analyze the occurrence rate of LRDs, which emerge around redshifts z ~ 6-8 and sharply decline at z &amp;lt; 4. We find that this trend follows a log-normal distribution, commonly observed in phenomena driven by stochastic and random factors. We propose a hypothesis that the first one or two AGN events associated with newly-formed seed BHs are observed as LRDs and their unique features fade in the subsequent episodes. This naturally explains the cosmic evolution of AGN abundance over 0 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 5, which follows &amp;prop; (1+z)^-5/2 due to the cumulative effect of recurring AGN activity. The unique characteristics of LRDs are likely linked to the dense gas environments around the seed BHs, which create strong absorption features in the broad-line emission and enable super-Eddington accretion bursts, ultimately yielding the observed overmassive nature of BHs compared to the local relationship.

We acquired 450 &amp;mu;m and 850 &amp;mu;m dust continuum polarization observations toward the inner region of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) as part of the B-Fields In Star-Forming Region Observations (BISTRO) survey using the POL-2 polarimeter on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. These observations encompassed three dense structures: the 20 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; cloud (20MC), 50 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; cloud (50MC), and circumnuclear disk (CND). Our aim is to investigate the magnetic field morphology and strength in the inner region of the CMZ using polarized dust continuum and the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. The magnetic field morphology is highly ordered in all three dense regions. The plane-of-sky magnetic field strengths are ~1 mG for the 20MC and the 50MC, and ~2 mG for the CND. We compare the energy contributions of turbulence, gravity, and thermal motion with that of the magnetic field using the plasma &amp;beta;, mass-to-flux ratio, and Alfv\'en Mach number. The outcomes reveal the magnetic field stands out as the predominant factor within the inner region of the CMZ. The dominance of the magnetic field may explain the low star-forming rate in the CMZ. We further investigate the dust grain alignment efficiency by exploring the relationship between polarization fraction and total intensity. The results suggest that dust grains are well aligned with the magnetic fields.

&lt;p&gt;
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are key contributors to interstellar aromatic infrared (IR) bands. However, current spectral databases for IR emission analysis are limited by the omission of vibrational anharmonicity and temperature effects, primarily because of the high computational cost of conventional quantum chemical calculations (QCCs). In this work, we present a machine learning-based molecular dynamics (MLMD) approach that efficiently computes anharmonic IR spectra while incorporating temperature effects. MLMD achieves predictive accuracy comparable to that of QCCs but with significantly reduced computational cost, scaling linearly with the number of atoms in the system. We applied MLMD to calculate the anharmonic spectra of 1704 PAHs in the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database with up to 216 carbon atoms, demonstrating its capability for high-throughput spectral calculations of large molecular systems. Our results highlight MLMD's potential to enable the development of extensive molecular spectral datasets, enhancing data-driven analyses of astronomical IR spectra, particularly in anticipation of upcoming data from the James Webb Space Telescope.

We explore the evolution of galaxy sizes at high redshift (3 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 13) using the high-resolution THESAN-ZOOM radiation-hydrodynamics simulations, focusing on the mass range of 10^6 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;ast;&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. Our analysis reveals that galaxy size growth is tightly coupled to bursty star formation. Galaxies above the star-forming main sequence experience rapid central compaction during starbursts, followed by inside-out quenching and spatially extended star formation that leads to expansion, causing oscillatory behavior around the size-mass relation. Notably, we find a positive intrinsic size-mass relation at high redshift, consistent with observations but in tension with large-volume simulations. We attribute this discrepancy to the bursty star formation captured by our multi-phase interstellar medium framework, but missing from simulations using the effective equation-of-state approach with hydrodynamically decoupled feedback. We also find that the normalization of the size-mass relation follows a double power law as a function of redshift, with a break at z≈6, because the majority of galaxies at z &amp;gt; 6 show rising star-formation histories, and therefore are in a compaction phase. We demonstrate that H&amp;alpha; emission is systematically extended relative to the UV continuum by a median factor of 1.7, consistent with recent JWST studies. However, in contrast to previous interpretations that link extended H&amp;alpha; sizes to inside-out growth, we find that Lyman-continuum (LyC) emission is spatially disconnected from H&amp;alpha;. Instead, a simple Str\"omgren sphere argument reproduces observed trends, suggesting that extreme LyC production during central starbursts is the primary driver of extended nebular emission.

Recent JWST observations have uncovered high-redshift galaxies characterized by multiple star-forming clumps, many of which appear to be undergoing mergers. Such mergers are powerful drivers of galaxy evolution, triggering intense star formation that accelerates the formation of massive quiescent galaxies. Mergers can also expel and redistribute the metal-enriched gas from galaxies into their circum-galactic medium (CGM), regulating the chemical component of their environments and creating channels of ionized gas through which ionizing radiation escapes. Here, we report a merger of at least five galaxies, dubbed JWST's Quintet (JQ), at redshift 6.7, discovered in the JWST GOODS-South field. This system resides in a small area ~4.5''×4.5'' (24.6×24.6 pkpc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), containing over 17 galaxy-size clumps with a total stellar mass of 10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. The JQ system has a total star formation rate of 240-270 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1, placing it ~1 dex above the median star formation rate-mass main sequence at this epoch. The high mass and star formation rate of the JQ galaxies are sufficient to produce massive, inactive galaxies identified at later times, by redshift 4, suggesting this may be a progenitor event for such systems. We detect a large \foiii+H&amp;beta; emitting gaseous halo surrounding and connecting four galaxies in the JQ, consistent with the interaction between them. This indicates that the CGM of JQ is already enriched by the heavy elements generated from the galaxies through merger-induced tidal stripping or galactic outflows. Our findings offer a plausible evolutionary pathway for the formation of massive quiescent galaxies observed at lower redshifts and provide direct evidence for the metal enrichment of their environments through galaxy mergers, just 800 Myr after the Big Bang.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at redshifts of z≳ 4-7, many of which host accreting massive black holes (BHs) with BH-to-galaxy mass (M_BH/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;) ratios exceeding the local values by more than an order of magnitude. The origin of these overmassive BHs remains unclear but requires potential contributions from heavy seeds and/or episodes of super-Eddington accretion. We present a growth model coupled with dark matter halo assembly to explore the evolution of the M_BH/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; ratio under different seeding and feedback scenarios. Given the gas inflow rates in protogalaxies, BHs grow episodically at moderate super-Eddington rates and the mass ratio increases early on, despite significant mass loss through feedback. Regardless of seeding mechanisms, the mass ratio converges to a universal value ~ 0.1-0.3, set by the balance between gas feeding and star formation efficiency in the nucleus. This behavior defines an attractor in the M_BH-M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; diagram, where overmassive BHs grow more slowly than their hosts, while undermassive seeds experience rapid growth before aligning with the attractor. We derive an analytical expression for the universal mass ratio, linking it to feedback strength and halo growth. The convergence of evolutionary tracks erases seeding information from the mass ratio by z~ 4-6. Detecting BHs with ~ 10^5-6~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; at higher redshifts that deviate from convergence trend would provide key diagnostics of their birth conditions.

We measure H&amp;alpha; luminosity functions (LFs) at redshifts z ~ 4.5 and 6.3 using the JWST MAGNIF (Medium-band Astrophysics with the Grism of NIRCam In Frontier fields) survey. MAGNIF obtained NIRCam grism spectra with the F360M and F480M filters in four Frontier Fields. We identify 248 H&amp;alpha; emitters based on the grism spectra and photometric redshifts from combined HST and JWST imaging data. The numbers of the H&amp;alpha; emitters show a large field-to-field variation, highlighting the necessity of multiple fields to mitigate cosmic variance. We calculate both observed and dust-corrected H&amp;alpha; LFs in the two redshift bins. Thanks to the gravitational lensing, the measured H&amp;alpha; LFs span three orders of magnitude in luminosity, and the faint-end luminosity reaches L_H&amp;alpha; ~ 10^40.3 erg s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; at z ~ 4.5 and 10^41.5 erg s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; at z ~ 6.3, corresponding to star-formation rates (SFRs) of ~ 0.1 and 1.7 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1. We conclude no or weak redshift evolution of the faint-end slope of H&amp;alpha; LF across z≃0.4-6.3, and the comparison with the faint-end slopes of UV LF indicates stochastic star formation history among low-mass H&amp;alpha; emitters. The derived cosmic SFR densities are 0.058^+0.008_-0.006  M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1 Mpc^-3 at z ~ 4.5 and 0.025^+0.009_-0.007  M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1 Mpc^-3 at z ~ 6.3. These are approximately 2.2 times higher than previous estimates based on dust-corrected UV LFs, but consistent with recent measurements from infrared surveys. We discuss uncertainties in the H&amp;alpha; LF measurements, including those propagate from the lens models, cosmic variance, and AGN contribution.

The metallicity of galaxies, and its variation with galactocentric radius, provides key insights into the formation histories of galaxies and the physical processes driving their evolution. In this work, we analyze the radial metallicity gradients of star forming galaxies in the EAGLE, Illustris, IllustrisTNG, and SIMBA cosmological simulations across a broad mass (10^8.0M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;≤ M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; ≲10^12.0M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) and redshift (0≤ z≤8) range. We find that all simulations predict strong negative (i.e., radially decreasing) metallicity gradients at early cosmic times, likely due to their similar treatments of relatively smooth stellar feedback allowing for sustained inside-out growth. The strongest redshift evolution occurs in galaxies with stellar masses of 10^10.0-10^11.0M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, while galaxies with stellar masses &amp;lt; 10^10M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;gt;10^11M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; exhibit weaker redshift evolution. Our results of negative gradients at high-redshift contrast with the many positive and flat gradients in the 1&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;4 observational literature. At z&amp;gt;6, the negative gradients observed with JWST and ALMA are flatter than those in simulations, albeit with closer agreement than at lower redshift. Overall, we suggest that these smooth stellar feedback galaxy simulations may not sufficiently mix their metal content, and that either stronger stellar feedback or additional subgrid turbulent metal diffusion models may be required to better reproduce observed metallicity gradients.

Population III (Pop III) stars are the first stars in the Universe, forming from pristine, metal-free gas and marking the end of the cosmic dark ages. Their formation rate is expected to sharply decline after redshift z ≈ 15 due to metal enrichment from previous generations of stars. In this paper, we analyze 14 zoom-in simulations from the THESAN-ZOOM project, which evolves different haloes from the THESAN-1 cosmological box down to redshift z=3. The high mass resolution of up to 142 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; per cell in the gas phase combined with a multiphase model of the interstellar medium (ISM), radiative transfer including Lyman-Werner radiation, dust physics, and a non-equilibrium chemistry network that tracks molecular hydrogen, allows for a realistic but still approximate description of Pop III star formation in pristine gas. Our results show that Pop III stars continue to form in low-mass haloes ranging from 10^6 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; to 10^9 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; until the end of reionization at around z=5. At this stage, photoevaporation suppresses further star formation in these minihaloes, which subsequently merge into larger central haloes. Hence, the remnants of Pop III stars primarily reside in the satellite galaxies of larger haloes at lower redshifts. While direct detection of Pop III stars remains elusive, these results hint that lingering primordial star formation could leave observable imprints or indirectly affect the properties of high-redshift galaxies. Explicit Pop III feedback and specialized initial mass function modelling within the THESAN-ZOOM framework would further help interpreting emerging constraints from the James Webb Space Telescope.

The ratio between the stellar mass of a galaxy, M_*, and that of its central supermassive black hole (SMBH), M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt;, the "Magorrian'' relationship, traces their coevolution. JWST observations have suggested significant evolution in M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt;/M_* relative to local scaling relationships both in low-mass galaxies and in quasars at z ≥ 4. We test this possibility by (1) determining the preferred M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt;/M_* scaling relation among those proposed locally; and (2) providing uniform host galaxy stellar mass estimates. These steps reduce the prominence of the reported evolution. We then apply Monte Carlo simulations to account for observational biases. We still find a significant increase over the local scaling relation in M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt;/M_* for z ≥ 4 SMBHs in very low-mass galaxies (log(M_*/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;lt;10). However, similarly high values of M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt;/M_* are also found in low mass galaxies at z ~ 0.5 to 3 that may be common at cosmic noon. Nonetheless, galaxies with similar behavior are rare locally and not accounted for in the local scaling relations. In contrast, z ~ 6 quasars can have M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt;/M_* well above the local relation value, but they can be explained as extreme cases still within the scaling relation for their higher mass host galaxies. Black holes in some of them and in the low-mass systems may be undergoing very high accretion episodes that result in high M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt;/M_* but that will be followed by quiescent periods when growth of the host drives the systems toward more typical M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt;/M_* values.

The cosmic star formation history (CSFH) and cosmic active galactic nuclei (AGN) luminosity history (CAGNH) are self consistently presented at z = 5.5-13.5. This is achieved by analyzing galaxies detected by the James Webb Space Telescope from ≈ 400   arcmin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; fields from the PEARLS, CEERS, NGDEEP, JADES and PRIMER surveys. In particular, the combination of spectral energy distribution fitting codes, EAZY and ProSpect, are employed to estimate the photometric redshifts and astrophysical quantities of 3947 distant galaxies, from which we compute the stellar mass, star formation rate and AGN luminosity distribution functions in four redshift bins. Integrating the distribution functions, we find that the CAGNH tentatively rises by ≈ 2.2 dex over z = 5.5-13.5 compared to ≈ 1.8 dex for the CSFH, indicating that the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) tends to outpace the assembly of stellar mass. We connect our results of the CSFH and CAGNH at z=5.5-13.5 to that from z= 0-5 to determine the summary of ≳ 13 Gyr of star formation and AGN activity, from the very onset of galaxy formation to the present day.

We present subarcsecond-resolution ALMA mosaics of the Orion Bar PDR in [CI] 609um, C2H (4-3), and C18O (3-2) emission lines complemented by JWST images of H2 and aromatic infrared band (AIB) emission. The rim of the Bar shows very corrugated structures made of small-scale H2 dissociation fronts (DFs). The [CI] 609 um emission peaks very close (~0.002 pc) to the main H2-emitting DFs, suggesting the presence of gas density gradients. These DFs are also bright and remarkably similar in C2H emission, which traces "hydrocarbon radical peaks" characterized by very high C2H abundances, reaching up to several x10^-7. The high abundance of C2H and of related hydrocarbon radicals, such as CH3, CH2, and CH, can be attributed to gas-phase reactions driven by elevated temperatures, the presence of C+ and C, and the reactivity of FUV-pumped H2. The hydrocarbon radical peaks roughly coincide with maxima of the 3.4/3.3 um AIB intensity ratio, a proxy for the aliphatic-to-aromatic content of PAHs. This implies that the conditions triggering the formation of simple hydrocarbons also favor the formation (and survival) of PAHs with aliphatic side groups, potentially via the contribution of bottom-up processes in which abundant hydrocarbon radicals react in situ with PAHs. Ahead of the DFs, in the atomic PDR zone (where [H]&amp;gt;&amp;gt;[H2]), the AIB emission is the brightest, but small PAHs and carbonaceous grains undergo photo-processing due to the stronger FUV field. Our detection of trace amounts of C2H in this zone may result from the photoerosion of these species. This study provides a spatially resolved view of the chemical stratification of key carbon carriers in a PDR. Overall, both bottom-up and top-down processes appear to link simple hydrocarbon molecules with PAHs in molecular clouds; however, the exact chemical pathways and their relative contributions remain to be quantified.

While molecular outflows have been studied in details with radio interferometry, observations of the hotter gas in protostellar outflows at a comparable physical scale is often challenging. Combined with ALMA, JWST allows us to investigate the cold and hot gas with unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity. We present a detailed comparison between the gas distributions probed with ALMA and JWST in the primary outflow of IRAS 15398-3359. At 2000 au scale, the southwestern outflow shows four shell structures in 5&amp;ndash;10 micron continuum, whereas the submillimeter H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO emission traces two of the four shells closest to the protostar. Submillimeter emission from CS, CCH, c-C_3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and CH_3OH shows the same two shells, and the ^12CO emission covers most of the outflow region. SO and SiO only trace a condensation at the edge of the shell closest to the protostar. None of these lines observed with ALMA show the outermost shell. At 500 au scale, we find hot H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas inside the outflow cavity with JWST. The derived temperature of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is 1147±198 K within a 0\farcs5 aperture at the protostar. The foreground mass column density of dust is (1.4&amp;ndash;2.0)×10^-3 g\cdotcm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (A_v = 47&amp;ndash;66 mag) in the outflow, using the dust model from Weingartner &amp; Draine (2001). We also find an 8&amp;deg; difference between the directions toward the [Fe II] knot and the outermost shell in the MIRI image, which may be interpreted as the precession of the [Fe II] jet. The dynamical timescale of the [Fe II] knot is 10 yrs, suggesting a current event.

There is vast evidence from observations of multiple stellar populations (MPs) in globular clusters (GCs). To explore the issue theoretically, this work considers two subsolar metallicities, two ages, and two initial abundance patterns: a first population of standard &amp;alpha;-enhanced metal mixture stars and a second stellar population displaying C-N and Na-O anticorrelations chemical abundance patterns, along with an enhanced helium fraction. Analysing the predictions for these extreme compositions, we provide insights into the observability of not-resolved MPs into individual stars of GCs. We use colours and spectrophotometric indices measurable with modern facilities (e.g. Euclid, LSST, DES, JWST).

X-rays provide a robust method in identifying AGN. However, in the high-redshift Universe, their space density is relatively low, and, in combination with the small areas covered by X-ray surveys, the selected AGN are poorly sampled. Deep optical/infrared data are essential for locating counterparts and determining redshifts. In this work, we leverage the XMM-Newton 4XMM-DR11 serendipitous catalogue alongside the extensive optical Dark Energy Survey and the near-infrared VISTA Hemisphere Survey (VHS) to select one of the largest high-z X-ray AGN samples to date. Our analysis focuses on the overlapping area of these surveys, covering about 185 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In addition, we aspire to compare the properties of the X-ray AGN with the optically-selected QSOs. For sources without spectroscopic data (80%), we estimated the photometric redshifts using both SED fitting and machine-learning algorithms. Among the 65,000 X-ray sources in the 4XMM-DES-VHS area, we ended up with 833 z&amp;gt;3.5 AGN (11% having spec-z information) with high reliability and a fraction of outliers &amp;eta;&amp;lt;10%. The sample completeness is 90%, driven by the depth of DES data. Only 10% of the X-ray selected AGN are also optical QSOs and vice versa. Our findings indicate an observed absorbed fraction (log N_H~[cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;] ≥ 23) of 20-40% for the X-ray AGN, significantly higher than that of optical QSOs. X-ray AGN exhibit fainter observed optical magnitudes and brighter mid-IR magnitudes than optical QSOs. Their median rest-frame SED shapes differ notably with optical QSOs being dominated by AGN emission in the UV-optical wavelengths. While the median SEDs of X-ray AGN suggest extinction in the UV-optical range, individual sources exhibit a wide range of spectral shapes, indicating significant diversity within the population. This analysis supports that X-ray and optically-selected AGN represent distinct and complementary populations.

&lt;p&gt;
The gas-phase abundances of deuterium (D) in the local interstellar medium (ISM) exhibit considerable regional variations. Particularly, in some regions the gas-phase D abundances are substantially lower than the primordial D abundance generated in the Big Bang, after subtracting the astration reduction caused by the Galactic chemical evolution. Deuterated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules have been suggested as a potential reservoir of the D atoms missing from the gas-phase. Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope's Near Infrared Spectrograph have revealed the widespread of deuterated PAHs in the Orion Bar through their aliphatic C&amp;ndash;D emission at 4.65 &amp;mu; m and possibly aromatic C&amp;ndash;D emission at 4.4 &amp;mu; m as well. To examine the viability of deuterated PAHs as the D reservoir, we model the infrared (IR) emission spectra of small PAH molecules containing various aromatic and aliphatic D atoms in the Orion Bar. We find that small deuterated PAHs exhibit a noticeable emission band at 4.4 or 4.65 &amp;mu; m even if they contain only one aromatic or aliphatic D atom. We derive N_D,ali/N_H≈3.4&amp;percnt;, the deuteration degree of PAHs measured as the number of aliphatic D atoms (relative to H), from the observed intensity ratios of the 4.65 &amp;mu; m band to the 3.3 &amp;mu; m aromatic C&amp;ndash;H band. The deuteration degree for aromatically-deuterated PAHs is less certain as C&amp;ndash;N stretch also contributes to the observed emission around 4.4 &amp;mu; m. If we attribute it exclusively to aromatic C&amp;ndash;D, we derive an upper limit of ≈14&amp;percnt; on the deuteration degree, which is capable of accounting for an appreciable fraction of the missing D budget.

&lt;p&gt;
We report the discovery of an intriguing, low-mass galaxy-scale strong-lens system in the SMACS J0723.3-7327 galaxy cluster. By modeling James Webb Space Telescope imaging and Very Large Telescope Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer spectroscopic data, we find that the lens is cluster member galaxy at z=0.397 with an Einstein radius of 0&amp;prime;&amp;prime;.424 ± 0&amp;prime;&amp;prime;.012, stellar mass of M_* = (3.3 ± 0.8) × 10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, half-light radius of ~ 1 kpc, and central stellar velocity dispersion of 140 ± 6 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. This lens galaxy is one of the few strong lens galaxies known to date that have stellar mass as low as M_* ~ 10^10.5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, offering an exceptional opportunity to peek into the population of low-mass galaxies that has largely remained unexplored in the context of strong-lensing studies. This strong lens system can also assist in assessing the systematic uncertainty in the lens modeling of cluster member galaxies.

&lt;p&gt;
Luminous broad H&amp;alpha; emission and red rest-optical SEDs are the hallmark of compact Little Red Dots (LRDs), implying highly attenuated dusty starbursts and/or obscured active galactic nuclei. However, the lack of observed FIR emission has proved difficult to reconcile with the implied attenuated luminosity in these models. Here, we utilize deep new ALMA imaging, new and existing JWST/MIRI imaging, and archival Spitzer/Herschel imaging of two of the rest-optically brightest LRDs (z=3.1 and z=4.47) to place the strongest constraints on the IR luminosity in LRDs to date. The detections at &amp;lambda;_rest=1-4  &amp;mu;m imply flat slopes in the rest-IR, ruling out a contribution from hot (T≳500 K) dust. Similarly, FIR non-detections rule out any appreciable cold (T≲75 K) dust component. Assuming energy balance, these observations are inconsistent with the typical FIR dust emission of dusty starbursts and quasar torii, which usually show a mixture of cold and hot dust. Additionally, our [C_II] non-detections rule out typical dusty starbursts. We compute empirical maximum IR SEDs and find that both LRDs must have log(L_IR/L&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) ≲ 12.2 at the 3&amp;sigma; level. These limits are in tension with the predictions of rest-optical spectrophotometric fits, be they galaxy only, AGN only, or composite. It is unlikely that LRDs are highly dust-reddened intrinsically blue sources with a dust temperature distribution that conspires to avoid current observing facilities. Rather, we favor an intrinsically redder LRD SED model that alleviates the need for strong dust attenuation.

&lt;p&gt;
Outflows are a key element in the baryon cycle of galaxies, and their properties provide a fundamental test for our models of how star formation quenches in galaxies. Here we report the detection of outflowing gas in two recently quenched, massive (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;~10^10.2M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) galaxies at z=4.106 (NS_274) and z=7.276 (RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7) observed with JWST/NIRSpec. The outflows are traced by blue-shifted MgII absorption lines, and in the case of the z=4.1 system, also by FeII and NaI features. The spectra of the two sources are similar to those of local post-starburst galaxies, showing deep Balmer features and minimal star formation on 10 Myr timescales as traced by the lack of bright emission lines, also suggesting the absence of a strong and radiatively efficient AGN. The galaxies' SFHs are consistent with an abrupt quenching of star formation, which continued at rates of ~15 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;/yr averaged over 100 Myr timescales. Dedicated millimeter observations of NS_274 constrain its dust obscured SFR to &amp;lt;12 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;/yr. Under simple geometrical assumptions, we derive mass loading factors ≲1 and ~50 for the z=4.1 and z=7.3 systems, respectively, and similarly different energies carried by the outflows. Supernovae feedback can account for the mass and energy of the outflow in NS_274. However, the low mass loading factor and average gas velocity suggest that the observed outflow is unlikely to be the reason behind its quenching. SF-related processes seem to be insufficient to explain the extreme mass outflow rate of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7, which would require an additional ejective mechanism such as an undetected AGN. Finally, the average outflow velocities per unit M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;, SFR, or its surface area are consistent with those of lower-redshift post-starburst galaxies, suggesting that outflows in rapidly quenched galaxies might occur similarly across cosmic time.

&lt;p&gt;
JWST is detecting an excess of high-redshift (z≳ 10), bright galaxies challenging most theoretical predictions. To address this issue, we investigate the impact of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) on the halo mass function and UV luminosity function (LF) of super-early galaxies. We explore two key effects: (i) the enhancement of massive halos abundance due to the compact nature and spatial distribution of PBHs, and (ii) the luminosity boost, characterized by the Eddington ratio &amp;lambda;_E, due to Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) powered by matter accretion onto PBHs. We build an effective model, calibrated using data at lower redshifts (z≈ 4-9), to derive the evolution of the LF including the additional PBH contribution. Via Bayesian analysis, we find that: (a) Although a small fraction (log f_PBH ≈ -5.42) of massive (log M_PBH / M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 8.37), non-emitting (&amp;lambda;_E=0) PBHs can explain the galaxy excess via the halo abundance enhancement, this solution is excluded by CMB &amp;mu;-distortion constraints on monochromatic PBHs. (b) If PBHs power an AGN emitting at super-Eddington luminosity (&amp;lambda;_E ≈ 10), the observed LF can be reproduced by a PBH population with characteristic mass log M_PBH / M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 3.69 constituting a tiny (log f_PBH ≈ -8.16) fraction of the cosmic dark matter content. In the AGN scenario, about 75% of the observed galaxies with M_UV=-21 at z=11 should host a PBH-powered AGN and typically reside in low mass halos, M_h = 10^8-9 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. These predictions can be tested with available and forthcoming JWST spectroscopic data. We note that our analysis considers a lognormal PBH mass function and compares its parameters with monochromatic limits on PBH abundance. Further work is required to relax such limitations.

&lt;p&gt;
Little Red Dots (LRDs) are compact, point-like sources characterized by their red color and broad Balmer lines, which have been debated to be either dominated by active galactic nuclei (AGN) or dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). Here we report two LRDs (ID9094 and ID2756) at z&lt;sub&gt;spec&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;7, recently discovered in the JWST FRESCO GOODS-North field. Both satisfy the "v-shape" colors and compactness criteria for LRDs and are identified as Type-I AGN candidates based on their broad H&amp;beta; emission lines (full width at half maximum: 2276±492 km/s for ID9094 and 1069±239 km/s for ID2756) and narrow [OI] lines (~ 300-400 km/s). To investigate their nature, we conduct deep NOEMA follow-up observations targeting the [CII] 158&amp;mu; m emission line and the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We do not detect [CII] or 1.3 mm continuum emission for either source. Notably, in the scenario that the two LRDs were DSFGs, we would expect significant detections: &amp;gt;16&amp;sigma; for [CII] and &amp;gt;3&amp;sigma; for the 1.3 mm continuum of ID9094, and &amp;gt;5&amp;sigma; for [CII] of ID2756. Using the 3&amp;sigma; upper limits of [CII] and 1.3 mm, we perform two analyses: (1) UV-to-FIR spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with and without AGN components, and (2) comparison of their properties with the L_[CII]-SFR_tot empirical relation. Both analyses indicate that LRDs favor the presence of AGN to explain their observed properties. Our results highlight the importance of far-infrared observations for studying LRDs, a regime that remains largely unexplored.

&lt;p&gt;
Recent JWST observations hint at unexpectedly intense cosmic star-formation in the early Universe, often attributed to enhanced star-formation efficiencies (SFEs). Here, we analyze the SFE in THESAN-ZOOM, a novel zoom-in radiation-hydrodynamic simulation campaign of high-redshift (z ≳ 3) galaxies employing a state-of-the-art galaxy formation model resolving the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM). The halo-scale SFE (&amp;epsilon;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;ast;&lt;/sup&gt;_halo) - the fraction of baryons accreted by a halo that are converted to stars - follows a double power-law dependence on halo mass, with a mild redshift evolution above M_halo ≳ 10^9.5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. The power-law slope is roughly 1/3 at large halo masses, consistent with expectations when gas outflows are momentum-driven. At lower masses, the slope is roughly 2/3 and is more aligned with the energy-driven outflow scenario. &amp;epsilon;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;ast;&lt;/sup&gt;_halo is a factor of 2-3 larger than commonly assumed in empirical galaxy-formation models at M_halo ≲ 10^11 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. On galactic (kpc) scales, the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation of neutral gas is universal in THESAN-ZOOM, following &amp;Sigma;_SFR &amp;prop; &amp;Sigma;_gas^2, indicative of a turbulent energy balance in the ISM maintained by stellar feedback. The rise of &amp;epsilon;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;ast;&lt;/sup&gt;_halo with halo mass can be traced primarily to increasing gas surface densities in massive galaxies, while the underlying KS relation and neutral, star-forming gas fraction remain unchanged. Although the increase in &amp;epsilon;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;ast;&lt;/sup&gt;_halo with redshift is relatively modest, it is sufficient to explain the large observed number density of UV-bright galaxies at z ≳ 12. However, reproducing the brightest sources at M_UV ≲ -21 may require extrapolating the SFE beyond the halo mass range directly covered by THESAN-ZOOM.

&lt;p&gt;
We report the spectroscopic confirmation of a merging pair of massive quiescent galaxies at z=3.44. Using JWST observations, we confirm that the two galaxies lie at a projected separation of 4.5 kpc with a velocity offset of ~ 680  km  s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (&amp;delta;_z ~ 0.01). The pair resides in the core of a known rich overdensity of galaxies, dubbed the "Cosmic Vine". For both pair members, modeling of the Spectral Energy Distributions and faint rest-frame optical emission lines indicate high stellar masses (log(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;)~10.9) and suppressed star formation (log(sSFR/yr^-1)&amp;lt;-10), more than an order of magnitude below the level of the star formation main sequence at this redshift. We then explore the Illustris-TNG simulation and the GAEA and SHARK semi-analytical models to examine whether they produce a pair of massive quiescent galaxies akin to that of the Cosmic Vine. While all models produce close pairs of massive quiescent galaxies at 2&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;4 with comparable separations and velocity offsets, their predicted number densities are 10-80 times lower than our observational constraint. This discrepancy cannot be fully explained by coarse time sampling in these models or the general challenge of forming early massive quiescent galaxies in simulations. Given that &amp;gt;90&amp;percnt; of simulated pairs in the models that we analyzed merge by z=0, our findings suggest that our observed pair will likely coalesce into a single massive galaxy. The merger, occurring in the dense core of a large-scale structure, might represent a critical event in the formation of a brightest cluster galaxy and the morphological transformation of high-redshift disky quiescent galaxies into early-type ellipticals.

We present a sample of 146 high-redshift (z&amp;gt;7.5) galaxies from the CANUCS/Technicolor surveys, showcasing photometry in every wide- and medium-band NIRCam filter in addition to ancillary HST data sampling 0.4-5 &amp;mu; m (22 JWST bands out of 29 bands total). Additionally, 48 (33&amp;percnt;) galaxies in our sample meet criteria to be classified as extreme emission line galaxies, 15 (10&amp;percnt;) of which are completely missed by typical dropout selections due to faint UV emission. By fitting the SEDs covering the rest-frame UV to optical at z &amp;gt; 7.5, we investigate the dust obscuration properties, giving an unbiased view of dust buildup in high-redshift galaxies free from spectroscopic follow-up selection effects. Dust attenuation correlates with stellar mass, but more strongly with star formation rate. We find typical galaxies at z&amp;gt;7.5 have ~ 25 &amp;percnt; of their star formation obscured. However, since galaxies with higher star formation rates suffer more attenuation, ~ 50 &amp;percnt; of the total star formation rate density at 7.5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;9 is obscured. The obscured fraction drops to ~ 35 &amp;percnt; in our 9&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;12 bin, possibly due to substantial dust grain growth in the interstellar medium not having time to occur. Extrapolating the decline in dust obscuration of galaxies to higher redshifts, we infer that dust obscuration should approach zero at z &amp;gt; 15, implying that epoch as when dust first forms in bright galaxies.

Recent JWST observations towards Westerlund 1 revealed extensive nebular emission associated with the cluster. Given the age of the region and proximity of that material to massive stars it cannot be primordial star forming gas and the origin is uncertain. We aim to determine whether the nebular emission in Westerlund 1 could be due to ablation flows from Red Supergiant (RSG) stars embedded in the cluster wind driven by the Wolf-Rayet stars in the cluster core. We also aim to explore the efficiency of mass-loading for the RSG wind in this scenario. We use 3D hydrodynamic simulations with the scpion code to study the interaction between the cluster and RSG winds. We compare with the JWST observations by generating synthetic dust-emission maps. We find that the ablation flow morphology is consistent with the observations towards Westerlund 1, with clumps and instabilities. Synthetic observations at 11 &amp;mu;m predict fluxes in the ablation flow of ~1000-6000 MJy ster^-1 which is consistent with the unsaturated components of the JWST F1130W observations in the vicinity of the red supergiants in the region. This good agreement is achieved without any consideration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which have a known 11.3 &amp;mu;m feature that appears in the F1130W band. This suggests that the ablation flow is PAH depleted. Ablation of RSG winds can explain the observed nebulosity in Westerlund 1, at least in the vicinity of the RSGs. Further observations are encouraged to enable detailed studies of these interactions.

Stellar-mass isolated black holes (IsoBHs) wandering in interstellar medium (ISM) are expected to be abundant in our Galaxy. Recently, an IsoBH, OGLE-2011-BLG-0462, was unambiguously discovered using astrometric microlensing. We examine prospects for detecting electromagnetic signatures from an accretion flow surrounding the IsoBH. The accretion rate onto the IsoBH should be highly sub-Eddington, which leads to formation of a hot accretion flow. In this paper, we evaluate the detectability of electromagnetic signals from the hot accretion flows in two accretion states: magnetically arrested disk (MAD) and classical radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs). For the MAD scenario, we find that the optical, infrared, and X-ray signals can be detectable by the current best facilities, such as HST, JWST, and Chandra, if the IsoBH is in a warm neutral medium. In contrast, for the classical RIAF scenario, the optical and X-ray emissions are weaker than MAD scenario, leading to unobservable signals for a typical parameter set. Future follow-up observations of OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 will provide a good test for theories of accretion processes.

JWST has revealed a population of broad-line active galactic nuclei at z&amp;gt;4 with remarkably red colors, so-called "Little Red Dots." Ubiquitous Balmer breaks suggest that they harbor old stellar populations in massive, compact host galaxies. We present ALMA observations of three LRDs at z=3.10, 4.46, and 7.04, targeting molecular and neutral gas via CO(7-6) and [CI](2-1), respectively. We do not detect CO in any target, placing conservative limits on the host molecular gas mass ≲ 1-5×10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. We report the tentative (4.9&amp;sigma;) detection of the [CI](2-1) line in A2744-45924 (z=4.46), one of the brightest known LRDs. The [CI] line is narrow (FWHM ~ 80 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), implying a dynamical mass ≲ 10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, adopting conservative limits for the galaxy size. The dynamical mass limit is significantly lower than expected from the local M_BH-M_dyn relation, and is an order of magnitude below the stellar mass derived from SED fitting, potentially supporting a non-stellar origin of the Balmer break. These results, while tentative, paint a picture of LRDs that is markedly different than typical high-z quasars, which live in massive, gas-rich, and actively star-forming host galaxies.

&lt;p&gt;
A unique galaxy at z = 2.2, zC406690, has a striking clumpy large-scale ring structure that persists from rest UV to near-infrared, yet has an ordered rotation and lies on the star-formation main sequence. We combine new JWST/NIRCam and ALMA band 4 observations, together with previous VLT/SINFONI integral field spectroscopy and HST imaging to re-examine its nature. The high-resolution H&amp;alpha; kinematics are best fitted if the mass is distributed within a ring with total mass M_ring = 2 × 10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and radius R_ring = 4.6 kpc, together with a central undetected mass component (e.g., a "bulge") with a dynamical mass of M_bulge = 8 × 10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. We also consider a purely flux emitting ring superposed over a faint exponential disk, or a highly "cuspy" dark matter halo, both disfavored against a massive ring model. The low-resolution CO(4-3) line and 142GHz continuum emission imply a total molecular and dust gas masses of M_mol,gas = 7.1 × 10^10M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and M_dust = 3 × 10^8 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; over the entire galaxy, giving a dust-to-mass ratio of 0.7%. We estimate that roughly half the gas and dust mass lie inside the ring, and that ~ 10&amp;percnt; of the total dust is in a foreground screen that attenuates the stellar light of the bulge in the rest-UV to near-infrared. Sensitive high-resolution ALMA observations will be essential to confirm this scenario and study the gas and dust distribution.

Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed massive galaxies at very high redshift (z≃ 7-15). The question of whether the existence of such galaxies is expected in the corresponding JWST surveys has received a lot of attention, though the answer straddles areas of cosmology and complex astrophysical details of high-redshift galaxy formation. The growth rate of density fluctuations determines the amplitude of overdensities that collapse to form galaxies. Late-time modifications of growth, combined with measurements at both z~ 1 from large-scale structure and z~ 1000 from the cosmic microwave background, affect the predictions for the abundance of first galaxies in the universe. In this paper, we point out that the late-time growth rate of structure affects the statistical significance of high-redshift, high-mass objects very weakly. Consequently, if the existence and abundance of these objects are confirmed to be unexpected, the variations in the late-time growth history are unlikely to explain these anomalies.

The integral-field unit mode of the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec+IFU) mounted on the James Webb Space Telescope has now enabled kinematic studies of smaller and less massive compact stellar systems in which to search for central massive black holes (BHs) than ever before. We present here the first such detection using NIRSpec+IFU in its highest resolution (R~2700) mode. We report a 3&amp;sigma; detection of a central black hole with mass  M_BH=2.2±1.1×10^6 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; in UCD736 orbiting within the Virgo galaxy cluster based on Schwarzschild's modeling of the 1D kinematic profile. The presence of such a massive BH strongly argues against a globular cluster origin of this UCD, and rather suggests a tidally stripped formation route from a former ≳10^9 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; dwarf galaxy host. Two other methods produce results consistent with Schwarzschild's modelling, but can only provide upper-limits on  M_BH. This represents the detection of a BH in the most compact (r_h≈15 pc) stellar system to date, with a  M_BH corresponding to ~9 percent of the system's stellar mass, roughly in line with previously reported UCD BH detections and comparable to the BH detected in the compact elliptical galaxy NGC4486B.

We present the first follow-up with JWST of radio-selected NIRfaint galaxies as part of the COSMOS-Web survey. By selecting galaxies detected at radio frequencies (S_3 GHz&amp;gt;11.5 &amp;mu;Jy; i.e. S/N&amp;gt;5) and with faint counterparts at NIR wavelengths (F150W&amp;gt;26.1 mag), we collect a sample of 127 likely dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). We estimate their physical properties through SED fitting, compute the first radio luminosity function for these types of sources, and their contribution to the total cosmic star formation rate density. Our analysis confirms that these sources represent a population of highly dust-obscured (&amp;langle; A_v &amp;rangle; ~3.5 mag), massive (&amp;langle; M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rangle; ~10^10.8 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) and star-forming galaxies (&amp;langle; SFR &amp;rangle;~300 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1) located at &amp;langle; z &amp;rangle;~3.6, representing the high-redshift tail of the full distribution of radio sources. Our results also indicate that these galaxies could dominate the bright end of the radio luminosity function and reach a total contribution to the cosmic star formation rate density equal to that estimated only considering NIR-bright sources at z~4.5. Finally, our analysis further confirms that the radio selection can be employed to collect statistically significant samples of DSFGs, representing a complementary alternative to the other selections based on JWST colors or detection at FIR/(sub)mm wavelengths.

Gravitational time delays offer unique, independent measurements of the Hubble constant, H_0. Precise measurements of H_0 stand as one of the most pressing challenges in modern cosmology, and to do so with time delays requires precise lens models. While much work has focused on streamlining the modeling process to keep pace with the erumpent discovery of strongly-lensed systems, a critical step toward reducing uncertainty in H_0 comes from increasing the precision of individual lens models themselves. In this work, we demonstrate that the unprecedented imaging capabilities of JWST make this goal attainable. We present the first lens model for time-delay cosmography derived from JWST data, applied to the quadruply-imaged quasar WFI2033&amp;ndash;4723. While the primary source of systematic uncertainty in time-delay cosmography is currently the mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD), the sensitivity of models to this MSD varies on how the point spread function (PSF) errors are mitigated. As the PSF is also the primary source of uncertainty in lens modeling, we focus on a comparison of different PSF modeling methods. Within the context of power-law models, we recover results in agreement with previous Hubble Space Telescope (HST)-based models, but with better precision of key lensing parameters through implementation of new PSF modeling techniques. Despite the record-holding precision of this system's HST modeling, we achieve an additional 22% increase in precision of the Fermat potential difference, directly reducing uncertainties of cosmological inference. These results would produce a 3% (1&amp;sigma; of the modeling error) shift of H_0 towards a higher value for this lens, keeping all else constant. This work substantiates the groundbreaking potential of JWST for time-delay cosmography and lays the groundwork for modeling systems previously too faint to provide meaningful constraints on H_0.

We develop a sample of 234 dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) from the A2744 and GOODS-S fields using JWST/NIRCam-selected galaxies as priors for SCUBA-2 measurements. This provides a large number of galaxies both above an 850 &amp;mu;m flux of 2 mJy (47 bright DSFGs) and below (187 faint DSFGs). It represents the largest sample of individually identified (i.e., not stacked) faint DSFGs to date. We identify a tight negative correlation between redshift and both F444W and F150W flux, suggesting that the observed NIR flux may be an effective way of selecting high-redshift DSFGs. We study the physical properties of the DSFGs through spectral energy distribution fitting and morphological analysis. Other than the lower star formation rates (SFRs) and total infrared luminosities in the faint DSFGs, the two populations have similar properties. The stellar masses do not appear to be strongly dependent on either the SFRs or the submillimeter flux. These results suggest that the faint DSFGs are drawn from the same population of galaxies as the bright DSFGs. We find a lower merger fraction (~21%) relative to previous HST-based studies.

While NGC 1514 is an elliptical, but complex, planetary nebula at optical wavelengths, it was discovered to have a pair of infrared-bright, axisymmetric rings contained within its faint outer shell during the course of the WISE all-sky survey. We have obtained JWST mid-infrared imaging and spectroscopy of the nebula through the use of simultaneous observations with the MIRI Imager and Medium Resolution Spectrometer, selecting the F770W, F1280W, and F2550W filters to match each of the MRS's three grating positions. These observations show that the rings are clearly resolved and relatively distinct structures, with both filamentary and clumpy detail throughout. There is also cloud-like material that has a turbulent appearance in the interior of the rings, particularly at the longest wavelengths, and faint ejecta-like structures just outside the ring boundaries. Despite their brightness, the emission from the rings within the three imager passbands is shown to be dominated by thermal emission from very small grains, not line emission from atomic hydrogen or forbidden atomic lines, shocked molecular hydrogen, or PAHs. The doppler velocities derived from the two brightest emission lines in the rings, however, suggest that the material from which the rings were formed was ejected during an early period of very heavy mass loss from the PN progenitor, then shaped by asymmetrical fast winds from the central binary pair.

We present JWST NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy observations of the z=5.89 quasar NDWFS J1425+3254 from 0.6-5.3 microns, covering the rest-frame ultraviolet and optical at spectral resolution R~100. The quasar has a black hole mass of M_BH=(1.4\substack+3.1\\-1.0)×10^9 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and an Eddington ratio L_Bol/L_Edd=0.3\substack+0.6\\-0.2, as implied from the broad Balmer H&amp;alpha; and H&amp;beta; lines. We find that the quasar host has significant ongoing obscured star formation, as well as a quasar-driven outflow with velocity 6050\substack+460\\-630 km/s, possibly one of the most extreme outflows in the early Universe. The data also reveals that two companion galaxies are merging with the quasar host. The north-eastern companion galaxy is relatively old and very massive, with luminosity-weighted stellar age 65\substack+9\\-4 Myr, stellar mass (3.6\substack+0.6\\-0.3)×10^11 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, and SFR &amp;lt; (16.1±1.9) M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;/yr. A bridge of gas connects this companion galaxy and the host, confirming their ongoing interaction. A second merger is occurring between the quasar host and a much younger companion galaxy to the south, with stellar age 6.7±1.8 Myr, stellar mass (1.9±0.4)×10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, and SFR &amp;lt; (93\substack+17\\-16) M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;/yr. There is also another galaxy in the field that is likely in the foreground at z=1.135, that could be gravitationally lensing the quasar with magnification 1&amp;lt;&amp;mu;&amp;lt;2, and so &amp;lt;0.75 mag. Overall, the system is a "train-wreck" merger of three galaxies, with star formation and extreme quasar activity that were likely triggered by these ongoing interactions.

While the number of detected molecules, particularly complex organic molecules, in the solid-state in astrophysical environments is still rather limited, laboratory experiments and astrochemical models predict many potential candidates. Detection of molecules in protoplanetary disks provides a bridge between the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium and the chemistry of planets and their atmospheres. The excellent spectral sensitivity, broad wavelength coverage and high spatial resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allows for making progress in exploring chemical compositions of various astrophysical environments including planet-forming disks. They are a prerequisite for probing the disk content by means of sensitive absorption studies. In this paper, we present initial results of the JWST Cycle 1 GO program 1741 on d216-0939, a highly inclined TTauri disk located in the outskirts of the Orion Nebula Cluster. We utilise the NIRSpec and MIRI integral field unit spectrographs to cover its spectrum from 1.7 to 28~&amp;mu;m. In the d216-0939 disk, we give assignments of the composition of silicate grains. We unambiguously detect solid-state features of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ^13CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO, OCN^-, and tentatively OCS; species that had been detected recently also in other circumstellar disks. For the first time in disks, we provide unique detections of ices carrying NH_4^+ and the complex organic molecule ammonium carbamate (NH_4^+NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;COO^-). The latter detections speak for a very efficient NH_3 chemistry in the disk. We also show the very important role of scattering in the analysis of observational spectra of highly inclined disks.

The cosmic 21-cm signal promises to revolutionize studies of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Radio interferometers are aiming for a preliminary, low signal-to-noise (S/N) detection of the 21-cm power spectrum. Cross-correlating 21-cm with galaxies will be especially useful in these efforts, providing both a sanity check for initial 21-cm detection claims and potentially increasing the S/N due to uncorrelated residual systematics. Here we self-consistently simulate large-scale (1 Gpc) galaxy and 21-cm fields, computing their cross-power spectra for various choices of instruments as well as survey properties. We use 1080h observations with SKA-low AA* and HERA-350 as our benchmark 21-cm observations. We create mock Lyman alpha narrow-band, slitless and slit spectroscopic surveys, using benchmarks from instruments such as Subaru HyperSupremeCam, Roman grism, VLT MOONS, ELT MOSAIC, and JWST NIRCam. We forecast the resulting S/N of the galaxy-21-cm cross power spectrum, varying the galaxy survey area, depth and level of 21-cm foreground contamination for each pair of instruments. We find that the highest S/N is achievable through slitless, wide-area spectroscopic surveys, with the proposed Roman HLS survey resulting in a 55&amp;sigma; detection of the cross power with 21-cm as observed with SKA-low AA* for our fiducial model. Narrow-band dropout surveys are unlikely to result in a detectable cross-power, due to their poor redshift localization. Slit spectroscopy can provide a high S/N detection of the cross power for SKA-low AA* observations. Specifically, the planned MOONRISE survey with MOONS on the VLT can result in a 3&amp;sigma; detection, while a survey of comparable observing time using MOSAIC on the ELT can result in a 4&amp;sigma; detection. Our results can be used to guide survey strategies, facilitating the detection of the galaxy-21-cm cross power spectrum.

&lt;p&gt;
Mergers play important roles in galaxy evolution at and beyond Cosmic Noon (z~3). They are found to be a trigger of active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity and a process for growing stellar mass and black hole mass. High-z radio galaxies (HzRGs=type-2 radio-loud AGN) are among the most massive galaxies known, and reside in dense environments on scales of tens of kiloparsecs to Megaparsecs. We present the first search for kpc-scale companions in a sample of four z~3.5 HzRGs, with many supporting datasets, using matched 0.2" resolution ALMA and JWST/NIRSpec integral field unit data. We discover a total of ~12 companion systems within ≲18 kpc across all four HzRG fields using two independent detection methods: peculiar [OIII]4959,5007 kinematics offset from the main (systemic) ionized gas component and [CII]158&amp;mu; m emitters. We examine the velocity fields of these companions and find evidence of disk rotation along with more complex motions. We estimate the dynamical masses of these nearby systems to be M_dyn~10^9-11 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, which may indicate a minor merger scenario. Our results indicate that these companions may be the trigger of the powerful radio-loud AGN. We discuss the roles of the discovered companion systems in galaxy evolution for these powerful jetted AGN and indicate that they may impede jet launch and deflect the jet.

&lt;p&gt;
We introduce the THESAN-ZOOM project, a comprehensive suite of high-resolution zoom-in simulations of 14 high-redshift (z&amp;gt;3) galaxies selected from the THESAN simulation volume. This sample encompasses a diverse range of halo masses, with M_halo ≈ 10^8 - 10^13~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; at z=3. At the highest-resolution, the simulations achieve a baryonic mass of 142~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and a gravitational softening length of 17~cpc. We employ a state-of-the-art multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) model that self-consistently includes stellar feedback, radiation fields, dust physics, and low-temperature cooling through a non-equilibrium thermochemical network. Our unique framework incorporates the impact of patchy reionization by adopting the large-scale radiation field topology from the parent THESAN simulation box rather than assuming a spatially uniform UV background. In total, THESAN-ZOOM comprises 60 simulations, including both fiducial runs and complementary variations designed to investigate the impact of numerical and physical parameters on galaxy properties. The fiducial simulation set reproduces a wealth of high-redshift observational data such as the stellar-to-halo-mass relation, the star-forming main sequence, the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, and the mass-metallicity relation. While our simulations slightly overestimate the abundance of low-mass and low-luminosity galaxies they agree well with observed stellar and UV luminosity functions at the higher mass end. Moreover, the star-formation rate density closely matches the observational estimates from z=3-14. These results indicate that the simulations effectively reproduce many of the essential characteristics of high-redshift galaxies, providing a realistic framework to interpret the exciting new observations from JWST.

&lt;p&gt;
Using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), we tentatively detect two molecular hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) fluorescent emission features in high-redshift galaxies at 2.3 and 3.1&amp;sigma;. These features consist of many blended emission lines that result from the de-excitation cascade of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules that have absorbed Lyman-Werner band photons. Our study targets galaxies at redshifts z ≥ 7 galaxies of the early Universe, as they host some of the most extreme conditions in terms of star formation, molecular gas content, and the possible presence of outflows driven by starbursts and active galactic nuclei. To enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission features in the rest-frame wavelength range of 155-191 nm, we stack JWST/NIRSpec spectra from z=7.0-13.4. These stacked spectra also exhibit atomic emission features, such as CIV emission with a P-Cygni profile, as well as CIII], OIII], and HeII. The presence of these features and the slightly blue-shifted fluorescent H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lines suggest active multiphase atomic and molecular outflows may be common at these redshifts. Our results suggest that it is possible to search for FUV fluorescent H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lines in high redshift galaxies using JWST, which would enable the characterization of interstellar radiation fields, densities, and temperatures in extreme photodissociation environments.

&lt;p&gt;
Lyman &amp;alpha; (Ly&amp;alpha;) emission is one of few observable features of galaxies that can trace the neutral hydrogen content in the Universe during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). To accomplish this we need an efficient way to survey for Ly&amp;alpha; emitters (LAEs) at redshifts beyond 7, requiring unbiased emission-line observations that are both sufficiently deep and wide to cover enough volume to detect them. Here we present results from PASSAGE &amp;ndash; a pure-parallel JWST/NIRISS slitless spectroscopic survey to detect Ly&amp;alpha; emitters deep into the EoR, without the bias of photometric preselection. We identify four LAEs at 7.5≤ z≤9.5 in four surveyed pointings, and estimate the luminosity function (LF). We find that the LF does show a marked decrease compared to post-reionization measurements, but the change is a factor of ≲ 10, which is less than expected from theoretical calculations and simulations, as well as observational expectations from the pre-JWST literature. Modeling of the IGM and expected \lya profiles implies these galaxies reside in ionized bubbles of ≳ 2 physical Mpc. We also report that in the four fields we detect 3,1,0,0 LAEs, which could indicate strong field-to-field variation in the LAE distribution, consistent with a patchy HI distribution at z~8. We compare the recovered LAE number counts with expectations from simulations and discuss the potential implications for reionization and its morphology.

JWST provides a view of the Universe never seen before, and specifically fine details of galaxies in deep space. JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) is a deep field survey, providing unprecedentedly detailed view of galaxies in the early Universe. The field is also in relatively close proximity to the Galactic pole. Analysis of spiral galaxies by their direction of rotation in JADES shows that the number of galaxies in that field that rotate in the opposite direction relative to the Milky Way galaxy is ~50% higher than the number of galaxies that rotate in the same direction relative to the Milky Way. The analysis is done using a computer-aided quantitative method, but the difference is so extreme that it can be noticed and inspected even by the unaided human eye. These observations are in excellent agreement with deep fields taken at around the same footprint by HST and JWST. The reason for the difference may be related to the structure of the early Universe, but it can also be related to the physics of galaxy rotation and the internal structure of galaxies. In that case the observation can provide possible explanations to other puzzling anomalies such as the Ho tension and the observation of massive mature galaxies at very high redshifts.

Mapping the small-scale structure of the universe through gravitational lensing is a promising tool for probing the particle nature of dark matter. Curved Arc Basis (CAB) has been proposed as a local lensing formalism in galaxy clusters, with the potential to detect low-mass dark matter substructure. In this work, we analyze the cluster lens Abell S1063 in search of dark matter substructure with the CAB formalism, using multi-band imaging data from JWST. We use two different source modeling methods: shapelets and pixel-based source reconstruction based on Delaunay triangulation. We find that source modeling systematics from shapelets result in a disagreement between Curved Arc Basis parameters measured from different filters. Source modeling with Delaunay significantly alleviates this systematic, as seen in the improvement in agreement across filters. We also find that inadequate complexity in source modeling can result in convincing spurious detections of dark matter substructure from strong gravitational lenses, as seen by our &amp;Delta; BIC &amp;gt; 20 measurement of a M ~ 10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; subhalo with shapelets, a spurious detection that is not reproduced with Delaunay source modeling. We demonstrate that multi-band analysis with different JWST filters is key for disentangling source and lens model systematics from dark matter substructure detections.

Context. Dense filaments/feathers are kpc-scale dusty features present in nearby main sequence galaxies. Distinct from the spiral arms, filaments constitute a major portion of dense gas concentration. They are expected to play an important role in star formation and are known to harbour star-forming regions and H II regions. Aims. We explore the origin of filaments/feathers in disc galaxies via global gravitational instability. Methods. We conduct a parameter study using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of isolated disc galaxies that are isothermal, self-gravitating and initialised in equilibrium. Our galaxies are uniquely characterised by two dimensionless parameters, the Toomre Q and the rotational Mach number, M_c = v_c/c_s (ratio of circular velocity to sound speed). We carry out simulations covering a wide range in both. Results. We find that galaxies with Q = 1 form filaments within a single rotation, while galaxies with Q ≥ 2 do not. These filaments are kpc long and are semi-regularly spaced along the azimuth. Their morphology, density contrast and formation timescale vary with M_c, with filament spacing and instability onset time both inversely proportional to M_c and the density contrast increasing with M_c. However, their growth rates in all Q = 1 galaxies are ~ 0.5~&amp;Omega;, where &amp;Omega; is the angular frequency. We compare the filament spacing in our simulations with the ones from JWST/MIRI and HST observations of nearby galaxies and find them in agreement. Conclusions. Our study suggests that self-gravity and rotation are sufficient to form filaments, even in the absence of spiral arms or magnetic fields. Their morphologies are primarily determined by M_c, which parametrises the importance of thermal versus rotational support.

Utilizing deep NIRCam/WFSS data from JWST's FRESCO program, we spectroscopically survey the 3.3 &amp;mu; m aromatic and 3.4 &amp;mu; m aliphatic C&amp;ndash;H stretching emission bands of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules in galaxies at redshifts z~0.2&amp;ndash;0.5. Unlike pre-JWST studies, largely limited to infrared (IR)-bright galaxies (L_IR≳10^11~L&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) at z≲0.1, we probe 200 galaxies down to L_IR~10^8.5&amp;ndash;10^10~L&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; well beyond the local Universe. The 3.3 &amp;mu; m emission is detected at ≥3-&amp;sigma; in 88 out of 187 galaxies, correlating tightly with galaxy IR luminosity and star formation rate (SFR) and confirming the 3.3 &amp;mu; m PAH as a viable SFR tracer. Despite a large scatter, the 3.3 &amp;mu; m-to-IR luminosity ratio (L_3.3/L_IR) exhibits a strong metallicity dependence with a drop of L_3.3/L_IR by a factor of ≳10 at 12+log(O/H)~8.4&amp;ndash;8.5 towards lower metallicities. The 3.4 &amp;mu; m emission is detected in 37 out of 159 galaxies, with the 3.4 &amp;mu; m-to-3.3 &amp;mu; m luminosity ratio (L_3.4/L_3.3) spanning from ~0.05 to ~0.58 (median ~0.19), corresponding to PAH aliphatic fractions of ~0.78%&amp;ndash;8.3% (median ~2.9%) in terms of fractional carbon atoms in aliphatic units. While L_3.4/L_3.3 does not depend significantly on redshift, stellar mass, metallicity, or galaxy morphology, it does decrease with various SFR tracers, suggesting that ultraviolet photons in active star-forming regions may strip aliphatic sidegroups from PAH molecules. Our study showcases the unique power of JWST's NIRCam/WFSS to systematically map PAH aromatic and aliphatic content in statistically significant, less-biased galaxy samples, providing critical insights into PAH chemistry and its connection to galaxy properties.

We identify galaxies hosting ionised-gas high-velocity outflows from the complete sample of medium resolution (R1000) JWST/NIRSpec MSA spectroscopy taken as part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). From a total sample of 1087 [OIII]5007 emitters we identify 40 galaxies with a blue-side broadened [OIII]5007 line at z=2.5-9. Of these, 34 are strong outflow candidates whilst 6 sources have broadening potentially driven by rotating clumps. Our outflow candidate sample is mainly composed of star-forming galaxies, including ~65% starbursts, which span the stellar mass range log10(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;)=7.5-11.0. It also includes two candidate type-2 active galactic nuclei (AGN) and a 'little red dot' (LRD). We report a median outflow velocity of 531(+146)(-159) km/s and an overall incidence rate of 3.4%. These values are significantly higher and lower respectively than recent similar works, which we accredit to the limiting resolution of the R1000 spectroscopy and a stricter outflow selection criterion. We find no correlation between the outflow velocity and the galaxy stellar mass or star-formation rate. The median ratio between outflow velocity and escape velocity is 0.77(+0.36)(-0.32), indicating that most outflows cannot escape the galaxy gravitational potentials. We do find an anti-correlation between mass loading factor and stellar mass up to M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; ~(10^10)M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, with most lowest stellar-mass M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;(10^9)M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; galaxies reaching values well above unity, as is the case for local starburst galaxies.

We report the first detections of [Ne V] 14.3 &amp;mu;m and [Ne VI] 7.7 &amp;mu;m at high confidence (S/N≥6) in the nuclear region of the nearby spiral galaxy M83. Emission line maps of these high ionization lines show several compact structures. Specifically, the [Ne VI] emission is located at 140 pc from the optical nucleus and appears as a point source of size ≲18 pc (FWHM =&amp;lt;0.8"). We investigate the possible source of this extreme emission through comparison with photoionization models and ancillary data. We find that photoionization models of fast radiative shocks are able to reproduce the observed high excitation emission line fluxes only for the lowest preshock density available in the library, n =0.01 cm^-3. Additionally, tailored active galactic nuclei (AGN) photoionization models assuming a two-zone structure are compatible with the observed high ionization fluxes. Our simple AGN model shows that the emission at the location of the [Ne VI] source can be the result of a cloud being ionized by the radiation cone of an AGN. We stress, however, that to definitively confirm an AGN as the main source of the observed emission, more complex modeling accounting for different geometries is required. Previously known as a purely starburst system, these new findings of the nuclear region of M83 will require a reassessment of its nature and of objects similar to it, particularly now that we have access to the unparalleled infrared sensitivity and spatial resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has opened a window on many new puzzles in the early Universe, including a population of high-redshift star clusters with extremely high stellar surface density, suggesting unique star formation conditions in the Universe's early evolution. We study the formation and evolution of these first star clusters and galaxies using an AREPO cosmological simulation box designed to resolve the intricate environments of the smallest halos hosting Population III star clusters at z ≥ 12. Our approach, which prioritizes baryonic structure identification through a friends-of-friends algorithm, provides new insights into early star cluster formation and delivers predictions directly relevant to observations. We investigate the dynamical properties of these first star clusters and use numerical and analytical methods to understand the populations of virialized and non-virialized systems. Our findings indicate that high-z star clusters in a feedback-free regime can achieve extreme surface densities, consistent with the systems detected by JWST. These results imply that JWST may have the opportunity to uncover stellar systems at high redshift whose dynamical state preserves evidence of the hierarchical structure formation process.

JWST has made several surprising discoveries, underscored by the `too early' appearance of well-formed galaxies and supermassive black holes. It recently also uncovered a compact galaxy (JWST-ER1g) associated with a complete Einstein ring (JWST-ER1r) at photometric redshift z_l=1.94^+0.13_-0.17, produced by a lensed galaxy at z_s=2.98^+0.42_-0.47. In two independent studies, this system (M_lens~ 6.5× 10^11M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) has yielded different conclusions concerning whether or not it requires an unexpected contribution of mass from sources other than stars and fiducial dark matter. The different redshift inferred by these two analysis for the lensed galaxy appears to be the culprit. In this paper, we examine the impact of the background cosmology on our interpretation of the JWST data. We compare the measured characteristics of JWST-ER1 in flat-&amp;Lambda;CDM with those emerging in the context of R_h=ct. We show that, unlike the latter model's mitigation of the tension created by JWST's other discoveries, neither cosmology is favored by this particular Einstein ring. The disparity is common to both models, leaving open the question of whether a new type of mass, or a modified initial mass function, may be present in this source.

We analyze JWST NIRSpec+MIRI/MRS observations of the infrared (IR) Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) features in the central regions (~0.26'' at 6 micron; ~50-440 pc depending on the source) of local luminous IR galaxies. In this work, we examine the effect of nuclear obscuration on the PAH features of deeply obscured nuclei, predominantly found in local luminous IR galaxies, and we compare these nuclei with "normal'' star-forming regions. We extend previous work to include shorter wavelength PAH ratios now available with the NIRSpec+MIRI/MRS spectral range. We introduce a new diagnostic diagram for selecting deeply obscured nuclei based on the 3.3 and 6.2 micron PAH features and/or mid-IR continuum ratios at ~3 and 5 micron. We find that the PAH equivalent width (EW) ratio of the brightest PAH features at shorter wavelengths (at 3.3 and 6.2 micron) is impacted by nuclear obscuration. Although the sample of luminous IR galaxies used in this analysis is relatively small, we find that sources exhibiting a high silicate absorption feature cluster tightly in a specific region of the diagram, whereas star-forming regions experiencing lower extinction levels occupy a different area in the diagram. This demonstrates the potential of this technique to identify buried nuclei. To leverage the excellent sensitivity of the MIRI imager onboard JWST, we extend our method of identifying deeply obscured nuclei at higher redshifts using a selection of MIRI filters. Specifically, the combination of various MIRI JWST filters enables the identification of buried sources beyond the local Universe and up to z~3, where other commonly used obscuration tracers such as the 9.7 micron silicate band, are out of the spectral range of MRS. Our results pave the way for identifying distant deeply obscured nuclei with JWST.

The TRGB-SBF Project team is developing an independent distance ladder using a geometrical calibration of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) method in elliptical galaxies that can in turn be used to set the surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) distance scale independent of Cepheid variables and Type Ia supernovae. In this paper, we use JWST TRGB distances calibrated using the megamaser galaxy NGC 4258 to determine a new Cepheid-independent SBF zero point for HST. This new calibration, along with improved optical color measurements from PanSTARRS and DECam, gives an updated value of the Hubble-Lemaitre constant H_0 = 73.8 ± 0.7 ± 2.3 km/s/Mpc that is virtually identical to the previously published result based on SBF distances calibrated using Cepheids (Blakeslee et al. 2021, arxiv:2101.02221). Future improvements in the geometrical calibration of TRGB and additions to the HST SBF survey will further reduce the random and systematic uncertainties on H_0 measured using the extensive HST WFC3/IR SBF dataset. JWST observations of the Coma cluster will soon establish a foundation for the SBF calibration that will extend to much larger distances than is possible with HST.

Precise tracking of the growth in galaxy size and the evolution of merger fractions with redshift is vital for understanding the formation history of submillimeter galaxies (SMGs). This study investigates these evolutions over a broad redshift range (1 &amp;lt; z ≲ 6), using a sample of 222 SMGs with a median redshift of z = 2.61^+0.89_-0.82 identified by ALMA and JCMT, enhanced by the advanced imaging capabilities of the JWST/NIRCam and MIRI. We find significant evolution in effective radii (R_e) in rest-frame V-band (R_e &amp;prop; (1 + z)^-0.87 ± 0.08) and near-infrared (NIR) band (R_e &amp;prop; (1 + z)^-0.88 ± 0.11), with the NIR size evolution resembling that of massive star-forming galaxies at lower redshift. Visual inspections reveal a major merger fraction of 24.3 ± 3.7&amp;percnt; and an interaction fraction of up to 48.4 ± 11.1&amp;percnt;. The major merger fraction exhibits an increase from 14.7±9.1&amp;percnt; at z = 1 to 26.6± 8.4&amp;percnt; at z = 3, after which it remains approximately constant across the redshift range 3 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 6. In contrast, the interaction fraction remains relatively stable across the range 2 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 5. Our results indicate that late-stage major mergers are not the primary formation mechanism for SMGs at z&amp;lt;3, while interactions appear to play a significant role across the broader redshift range of 1&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6. Additionally, HST-based major merger identifications may overestimate the true fraction by a factor of 1.7 at z ~ 2. These findings highlight the varying roles of mergers and interactions in driving the formation of massive, dusty star-forming galaxies across different redshifts.

As part of the VESTIGE survey, we used H&amp;alpha; images to select ETGs that show no signs of ongoing star formation. We combined VESTIGE with images from Astrosat/UVIT, GALEX and CFHT from the NGVS to analyse radial spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the FUV to the NIR. The UV emission in these galaxies is likely due to old, low mass stars in post main sequence (PMS) phases, the UV upturn. We fit the radial SEDs with novel SP models that include an old, hot stellar component of PMS stars with various temperatures and energetics. This way, we explore the main stellar parameters responsible for UV upturn stars irregardless of their evolutionary path. Standard models are not able to reproduce the galaxies' central FUV emission (SMA/R_eff≲1), while the new models well characterise it through PMS stars with temperatures T≳25000 K. All galaxies are old (mass-weighted ages ≳10 Gyr) and the most massive M49 and M87 are supersolar within SMA/R_eff≲0.2. Overall, we found flat age gradients (&amp;nabla;Log(Age)~ -0.04 - 0 dex) and shallow metallicity gradients (&amp;nabla;Log(Z)&amp;lt;-0.2 dex), except for M87 (&amp;nabla;Log(Z_M87)≃-0.45 dex). Our results show that these ETGs formed with timescales &amp;tau;≲1500 Myr, having assembled between ~40-90&amp;percnt; of their stellar mass at z~5. This is consistent with recent JWST observations of quiescent massive galaxies at high-z, which are likely the ancestors of the largest ETGs in the nearby Universe. The derived flat/shallow gradients indicate that major mergers might have contributed to the formation and evolution of these galaxies.

Cold and cool gas (T ≤ 10^4 K) in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and its interaction with galaxies remain poorly understood. Simulations predict that cold gas flows into galaxies through cosmic filaments, determining the disk formation and galaxy evolution. The cold gas accretion modes in the CGM and their dependence on dark matter halo mass and redshift remain puzzling. Resolving the kiloparsec-scale kinematics and dynamics of cold gas interacting with the disk, dust, and metals in different environments is particularly lacking at z &amp;gt; 2. Here we report two disturbed cold gas structures traced by ultra-strong MgII absorbers (rest-frame equivalent width Wr &amp;gt; 2 &amp;#8491;) exhibiting high kinematic velocities (&amp;gt; 500 km/s) and their environments at z ~ 4.9 and z ~ 2.6. Observations were conducted with VLT/MUSE, JWST/NIRCam, and ALMA to detect Lya and nebular emission lines, as well as dust continuum emission in the vicinity of these two absorbing gas structures. We identify two Lya emitters associated with a strong MgII absorber pair separated by ~1000 km/s at z~ 4.87. The pair exhibits relative differences in metallicity, dust content, and ionization states, suggesting internal metal and dust exchange within the ultra-large cold gas structure. For the strong MgII absorber at z = 2.5652, we detect a dusty star-forming galaxy at a projected distance of D = 38 kpc. This galaxy exhibits prominent HeI, [SIII], and Paschen&amp;gamma; lines, along with significant dust continuum. It has a star formation rate of ~ 121 +/- 33 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;/yr and likely harbors a rotating disk. These findings tentatively suggest that cold gas at high redshifts plays a critical role in driving disk formation and actively participates in the transfer of metals and dust within the overdense regions of the CGM.

&lt;p&gt;
Supernova may be the dominant channel by which dust grains accumulate in galaxies during the first Gyr of cosmic time as formation channels important for lower redshift galaxies, e.g., AGB stars and grain growth, may not have had sufficient time to take over. Supernovae (SNe) produce fewer small grains, leading to a flatter attenuation law. In this work, we fit observations of 138 spectroscopically confirmed z&amp;gt;6 galaxies adopting standard spectral energy distribution modeling assumptions and compare standard attenuation law prescriptions to that of supernova-produced dust alone. Compared to SMC dust, SNe attenuation yields up to 0.5 mag higher A_V, and 0.4 dex larger stellar masses. SNe dust attenuation also finds better fits to the rest-frame UV photometry with lower &amp;chi;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;_UV. This allows the observed UV luminosities taken from the models to be fainter by 0.2 dex on average. The systematically fainter rest-frame UV luminosities for fixed observed photometry could help resolve current tension between the ionizing photon production implied by JWST observations and the redshift evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction. Given these systematic effects and the physical constraint of cosmic time itself, pure supernova dust attenuation laws should be a standard consideration in fitting to the spectral energy distributions of z&amp;gt;6 galaxies.

We measure radial stellar age gradients in the relatively isolated gas-rich dwarf irregular WLM, combining JWST NIRCam and NIRISS imaging with six archival Hubble fields over semi-major axis equivalent distances of 0≲R_SMA≲4 kpc (≲3R_hl). Fitting lifetime star formation histories (SFHs) to resolved color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), radial age gradients are quantified using &amp;tau;_90 and &amp;tau;_50, the lookback times to form 90&amp;percnt; and 50&amp;percnt; of the cumulative stellar mass. We find that globally, the outskirts of WLM are older on average, with (&amp;delta;&amp;tau;_90, &amp;delta;&amp;tau;_50)/&amp;delta;R_SMA=(0.82^+0.10_-0.10, 1.60^+0.23_-0.22) Gyr/kpc (stat.), in good agreement with simulations. However, we also detect an azimuthal dependence of radial stellar age gradients, finding that stars on the leading edge of WLM (relative to its proper motion) are both younger and have a flatter age gradient compared to the trailing edge. This difference persists over 0.6≲R_SMA≲3.2 kpc (~0.5-2.5R_hl) and lookback times up to ~8 Gyr, and is robust to assumed stellar evolutionary model. Our results are consistent with star formation triggered by ram pressure stripping from a circumgalactic and/or intergalactic medium, suggested by recent HI observations. If confirmed, processes typifying dense environments, such as ram pressure stripping, may be more relevant to the evolution of isolated galaxies than previously thought.

We investigate early galaxy evolution by modeling self-consistently their radially-resolved evolution of gas, stars, heavy elements, and dust content. Our model successfully reproduces various observed properties of JWST-identified galaxies at z &amp;gt; 5, including sizes, stellar masses, star formation rates (SFR), metallicities, and dust-to-stellar mass ratios. We show that the star formation efficiency (SFE), f&lt;sub&gt;&amp;ast;&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;equiv; SFR/(f_b M&amp;#775;_h), is regulated by the global equilibrium between cosmological gas inflows, star formation, and gas outflows. Our model predicts f&lt;sub&gt;&amp;ast;&lt;/sub&gt; ≲ 20~&amp;percnt; for galaxies with halo masses of M_h ~ 10^11-12  M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; down to z = 5, allowing them to reach intrinsic UV magnitudes of M_UV ≲ -22~mag; when dust attenuation is ignored, the predicted UV luminosity function (LF) at z ~ 12 agrees well with observations. However, our model also suggests that these galaxies would be heavily obscured by dust, with high optical depths at 1500~&amp;#8491;~of &amp;tau;_1500 ≳ 10, causing the dust-attenuated UV LF to fall significantly below the observed one. This discrepancy highlights the need for mechanisms that mitigate strong dust attenuation, such as dust evacuation from star-forming regions and/or preferential production of large dust grains. Further exploration of these processes is essential for understanding the early stages of galaxy evolution.

We present the magnetic field in the dense material of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way, traced in 850 &amp;mu;m polarized dust emission as part of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) B-fields In STar-forming Region Observations (BISTRO) Survey. We observe a highly ordered magnetic field across the CMZ between Sgr B2 and Sgr C, which is strongly preferentially aligned with the orbital gas flows within the clouds of the CMZ. We find that the observed relative orientations are non-random at a &amp;gt;99% confidence level and are consistent with models in which the magnetic field vectors are aligned within 30^o to the gas flows in 3D. The deviations from aligned magnetic fields are most prominent at positive Galactic longitudes, where the CMZ clouds are more massive, denser, and more actively forming stars. Our observed strongly preferentially parallel magnetic field morphology leads us to hypothesize that in the absence of star formation, the magnetic field in the CMZ is entrained in the orbital gas flows around Sgr A^*, while gravitational collapse and feedback in star-forming regions can locally reorder the field. This magnetic field behavior is similar to that observed in the CMZ of the nuclear starburst galaxy NGC 253. This suggests that despite its current low star formation rate, the CMZ of the Milky Way is analogous to those of more distant, actively star-forming, galaxies.

The Athena mission entered a redefinition phase in July 2022, driven by the imperative to reduce the mission cost at completion for the European Space Agency below an acceptable target, while maintaining the flagship nature of its science return. This notably called for a complete redesign of the X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) cryogenic architecture towards a simpler active cooling chain. Passive cooling via successive radiative panels at spacecraft level is now used to provide a 50 K thermal environment to an X-IFU owned cryostat. 4.5 K cooling is achieved via a single remote active cryocooler unit, while a multi-stage Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator ensures heat lift down to the 50 mK required by the detectors. Amidst these changes, the core concept of the readout chain remains robust, employing Transition Edge Sensor microcalorimeters and a SQUID-based Time-Division Multiplexing scheme. Noteworthy is the introduction of a slower pixel. This enables an increase in the multiplexing factor (from 34 to 48) without compromising the instrument energy resolution, hence keeping significant system margins to the new 4 eV resolution requirement. This allows reducing the number of channels by more than a factor two, and thus the resource demands on the system, while keeping a 4' field of view (compared to 5' before). In this article, we will give an overview of this new architecture, before detailing its anticipated performances. Finally, we will present the new X-IFU schedule, with its short term focus on demonstration activities towards a mission adoption in early 2027.

We present an analysis of the rest-frame optical spectra of 22 [OIII]&amp;lambda;4363 detected galaxies in the redshift range 1.65 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 7.92 (with &amp;langle; z &amp;rangle; = 4.05) from JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution observations taken as part of the EXCELS survey. To supplement these high-redshift sources, we also consider a sample of 782 local [OIII]&amp;lambda;4363 detected galaxies from the DESI Early Data Release. Our analysis demonstrates that many strong-line calibrations are biased in the early Universe due to the systematic evolution in ionization conditions with redshift. However, the recently introduced \widehatR calibration mostly removes the dependence on ionization state and can be considered a largely redshift-independent calibration. In a similar spirit, we introduce a new strong-line diagnostic, \widehatRNe, which can be used to robustly estimate metallicities when the [OIII]&amp;lambda;5007 is redshifted out of the wavelength range of JWST/NIRSpec at z &amp;gt; 9.5. We also show that strong-line diagnostics using the [NII]&amp;lambda;6584 emission line are likely to be biased at high-redshift due to a moderate enhancement in the average N/O abundance ratios (at fixed O/H) in these sources. Finally, we discuss the location of our new [OIII]&amp;lambda;4363 detected galaxies at z ≃ 4 on the mass-metallicity plane and investigate the redshift evolution of the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR). We find tentative evidence for an increasing deviation from the FMR at z &amp;gt; 4 which might indicate fundamental differences in the baryon cycle at these redshifts. However, more data are required as our high-redshift constraints are still based on a relatively small sample of galaxies and the significance of the deviation is strongly dependent on the assumed form of the fundamental metallicity relation.

New, ultra-deep medium-width photometric coverage with JWST's NIRCam instrument provides the potential for much improved photo-z reliability at high redshifts. In this study, we conduct a systematic analysis of the JADES Origins Field, which contains 14 broad- and medium-width near-infrared bands, to assess the benefits of medium band photometry on high-z sample completeness and contamination rates. Using imaging with depths of AB mag 29.8-30.35, we conduct an experiment to observe how high-z selections differ when images are artificially degraded or bands are removed. In parallel, the same experiments are conducted on simulated catalogues from the JAGUAR semi-analytic model to examine if the behaviour from observations can be replicated. We find sample completeness is high (80&amp;percnt;+) and contamination low (&amp;lt;4&amp;percnt;) when in the 10&amp;sigma;+ regime, even without the use of any medium-width bands. The addition of medium-width bands leads to notable increases in completeness (~10&amp;percnt;) but multiple bands are required to improve contamination rates due to the small redshift ranges over which they probe strong emission lines. Incidents of Balmer-Lyman degeneracy increase in the 5-7&amp;sigma; regime and this can be replicated in both simulated catalogues and degraded real data. We measure the faint-end of the UV LF at 8.5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;13.5, finding high number densities that agree with previous JWST observations. Overall, medium bands are effective at increasing completeness and reducing contamination, but investment in achieving at least comparable depths in the blue (&amp;lt;1.5&amp;mu;m) as achieved in the red is also found to be key to fully reducing contamination from high-z samples.

&lt;p&gt;
We present full 3-28 micron JWST MIRI/MRS and NIRSpec/IFU spectra of the western nucleus of Arp 220, the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxy. This nucleus has long been suggested to possibly host an embedded Compton-thick AGN. Millimeter observations of the dust continuum suggest the presence of a distinct 20 pc core with a dust temperature of T_d ≳ 500~K, in addition to a 100 pc circumnuclear starburst disk. However, unambiguously identifying the nature of this core is challenging, due to the immense obscuration, the nuclear starburst activity, and the nearby eastern nucleus. With the JWST integral field spectrographs, we can, for the first time, separate the two nuclei across this full wavelength range, revealing a wealth of molecular absorption features towards the western nucleus. We analyse the rovibrational bands detected at 4-22 micron, deriving column densities and rotational temperatures for 10 distinct species. Optically thick features of C_2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, HCN and HNC suggest that this molecular gas is hidden behind a curtain of cooler dust, and indicate that the column densities of C_2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and HCN are an order of magnitude higher than previously derived from Spitzer observations. We identify a warm HCN component with rotational temperature T_rot = 330~K, which we associate with radiative excitation by the hot inner nucleus. We propose a geometry where the detected molecular gas is located in the inner regions of the starburst disk, directly surrounding the hot 20 parsec core. The chemical footprint of the western nucleus is reminiscent of that of hot cores, with additional evidence for shocks. No evidence for the presence of an AGN in the form of X-ray-driven chemistry or extreme excitation is found.

&lt;p&gt;
(Abridged) JWST observations have measured the ice composition toward two highly-extinguished field stars in the Chamaeleon I cloud. The observed extinction excess on the long-wavelength side of the H2O ice band at 3 micron has been attributed to a mixture of CH3OH with ammonia hydrates, which suggests that CH3OH ice could have formed in a water-rich environment with little CO depletion. Laboratory experiments and quantum chemical calculations suggest that CH3OH could form via the grain surface reactions CH3+OH and/or C+H2O in water-rich ices. However, no dedicated chemical modelling has been carried out thus far to test their efficiency and dependence on the astrochemical code employed. We model the ice chemistry in the Chamaeleon I cloud using a set of astrochemical codes (MAGICKAL, MONACO, Nautilus, UCLCHEM, and KMC simulations) to test the effects of the different code architectures and of the assumed ice chemistry. Our models show that the JWST ice observations are better reproduced for gas densities &amp;gt;1e5 cm-3 and collapse times &amp;gt;1e5 yr. CH3OH ice forms predominantly (&amp;gt;99%) via CO hydrogenation. The contribution of reactions CH3+OH and C+H2O, is negligible. The CO2 ice may form either via CO+OH or CO+O depending on the code. However, KMC simulations reveal that both mechanisms are efficient despite the low rate constant of the CO+O surface reaction. CH4 is largely underproduced for all codes except for UCLCHEM, for which a higher amount of atomic C is available during the initial translucent cloud phase. Large differences in the ice abundances are found at Tdust&amp;lt;12 K between diffusive and non-diffusive chemistry codes. This is due to the fact that non-diffusive chemistry takes over diffusive chemistry at such low Tdust. This could explain the rather constant ice chemical composition found in Chamaeleon I and other dense cores despite the different visual extinctions probed.

We leverage JWST data from the COSMOS-Web Survey in order to provide updated measurements on the auto-power spectrum of the now resolved Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) and its coherence with the unresolved soft Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB) observed by Chandra at z &amp;gt; 6. Maps of the CIB in the F277W and F444W NIRCam filters are constructed with sources fainter than AB mag = 25 and cross-correlated with the CXB in the [0.5-2] keV band. We find that on scales between 1 and 1000'' the CIB-CXB cross-power in both NIRCam filters is statistically significant with signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) of 4.80 and 6.20 respectively from redshifts 0 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 13. In our high-z (6 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 13) interval we find coherence in both filters with a S/N of 7.32 and 5.39 respectively. These results suggest that there are X-ray emitting galaxies resolved by JWST, including star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We fit the large-scale biasing of the IR sources producing the CIB as a function of z with results consistent with prior measurements and place constraints on the CXB flux and biasing at low- and high-z. The CXB flux measurements presented in this study suggest that approximately 94% of the [0.5-2] keV CXB is resolved, and this value is consistent within 2&amp;sigma; with the complete resolution of the [0.5-2] keV CXB.

To date, gas phase observations of sulphur in dense interstellar environments have only constrained the molecular carriers of 1% of its predicted cosmic abundance. An additional 5% is known to be locked up in molecular solids in dense clouds, leaving the main reservoir of depleted sulphur in the solid phase unknown. The spectral resolution and sensitivity of the JWST could make a substantial difference in detecting part of this missing sulphur, with its wavelength coverage that includes vibrational absorption features of the S-carriers H2S, OCS, SO2, CS2, SO, CS, and S8. The aim of this study is to determine whether these molecules may be viable candidates for detection. We carried out new laboratory measurements of the IR absorption spectra of CS2 and S8 to update the IR band strength of the most intense CS2 absorption feature at 6.8 &amp;mu;m, as well as to determine that of S8 at 20.3 &amp;mu;m for the first time. These data, along with values previously reported in the literature, allow us to evaluate which S-bearing species could be potentially detected with JWST in interstellar ices. Taking the literature abundances of the major ice species determined by previous IR observations towards starless cores, LYSOs and MYSOs, we generated simulated IR spectra using the characteristics of the instruments on the JWST. Thus, we have been able to establish a case study for three stages of the star formation process. We conclude that the detection of S-bearing molecules remains challenging. Despite these obstacles, the detection of H2S and potentially SO2 should be possible in regions with favourable physical and chemical conditions. In contrast, S8 would remain undetected. Although the sensitivity of JWST is insufficient to determine the sulphur budget in the solid state, the detection of an additional icy sulphur compound (H2S, SO2) would enable us to elevate our knowledge of sulphur chemistry.

We homogeneously investigate the morphological properties of 169 galaxies at z~10-16 with deep JWST NIRCam images employing our established techniques of GALFIT modeling and uncertainty evaluation (systematics+statistics). We obtain effective radii r_e ranging 20-500 pc, with a distribution significantly broader than the scatter made by the uncertainties. We find that the r_e distribution is well described by a log-normal distribution with a mean of r_e=133^+13_-12 pc and a standard deviation of &amp;sigma;_lnr_e = 0.52 ± 0.08. The standard deviation is comparable to that of local galaxies, indicating no significant evolution over z~ 0-10. We estimate the virial radius r_vir from the stellar masses via the star-formation main sequence and stellar-to-halo mass relation, obtaining a stellar-to-halo size ratio r_e/r_vir = 0.015^+0.015_-0.005, which is comparable to those of star-forming galaxies in the local and low-z Universe. Our results of 1) the log-normal r_e distribution, 2) the standard deviation value, and 3) a mean radial profile consistent with an exponential profile (n=1.3±0.6) suggest that galaxies at z~10-16 generally follow the classical galaxy disk formation scenario with a specific disk angular momentum fraction of j_d / m_d ~ 0.5-1. Interestingly, we identify two remarkable outliers GN-z11 (z&lt;sub&gt;spec&lt;/sub&gt;=10.60) and GHZ2 (z&lt;sub&gt;spec&lt;/sub&gt;=12.34) with r_e=55^+5_-6 pc and 39±11 pc, respectively, that may not be explained by disk structures but by AGN or compact star-forming galaxies merging underway in short periods of time, as reproduced in numerical simulations.

Rare Poisson processes (PP) during cosmic inflation can lead to signatures that are localized in position space and are not well captured by the standard two- or higher-point correlation functions of primordial density perturbations. As an example, PP can lead to localized overdense regions that are far denser than the ones produced through standard inflationary fluctuations. As a result, such overdense regions collapse earlier than expected based on the standard &amp;Lambda;CDM model and would host anomalously high-redshift galaxies. We describe some general aspects of such PP and consider a particular realization in the context of inflationary particle production. We then show that the masses and redshifts of the resulting galaxies can lie in a range discoverable by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and future surveys, while being consistent with existing constraints on the matter power spectrum and UV luminosity functions at lower redshifts.

In the centers of many galaxy clusters, the hot (~10^7 K) intracluster medium (ICM) can become dense enough that it should cool on short timescales. However, the low measured star formation rates in massive central galaxies and absence of soft X-ray lines from cooling gas suggest that most of this gas never cools - this is known as the "cooling flow problem." The latest observations suggest that black hole jets are maintaining the vast majority of gas at high temperatures. A cooling flow has yet to be fully mapped through all gas phases in any galaxy cluster. Here, we present new observations of the Phoenix cluster using the James Webb Space Telescope to map the [Ne VI] &amp;lambda;7.652&amp;mu;m emission line, allowing us to probe gas at 10^5.5 K on large scales. These data show extended [Ne VI] emission cospatial with (i) the cooling peak in the ICM, (ii) the coolest gas phases, and (iii) sites of active star formation. Taken together, these imply a recent episode of rapid cooling, causing a short-lived spike in the cooling rate which we estimate to be 5,000-23,000 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1. These data provide the first large-scale map of gas at temperatures between 10^5-10^6 K in a cluster core, and highlight the critical role that black hole feedback plays in not only regulating but also promoting cooling.

The methylidyne cation (CH^+) and the methyl cation (CH_3^+) are building blocks of organic molecules, yet their coupled formation and excitation mechanisms remain mainly unprobed. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its high spatial resolution and good spectral resolution, provides unique access to the detection of these molecules. Our goal is to use the first detection of CH^+ and CH_3^+ rovibrational emission in the Orion Bar and in the protoplanetary disk d203-506, irradiated by the Trapezium cluster, to probe their formation and excitation mechanisms and constrain the physico-chemical conditions. We use spectro-imaging acquired using both the NIRSpec and MIRI-MRS instruments to study the CH^+ and CH_3^+ spatial distribution at very small scales, and compare it to excited H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission. CH^+ and CH_3^+ emissions originate from the same region as highly excited H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Our comparison between the Bar and d203-506 reveals that both CH^+ and CH_3^+ excitation and/or formation are highly dependent on gas density. The excitation temperature of the observed CH^+ and CH_3^+ rovibrational lines is around T ~ 1500 K in the Bar and T ~ 800 K in d203-506. Moreover, the column densities derived from the rovibrational emission are less than 0.1 % of the total known (CH^+) and expected (CH_3^+) column densities. These results show that CH^+ and CH_3^+ level populations strongly deviate from ETL. CH^+ rovibrational emission can be explained by chemical formation pumping with excited H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via C^+ + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;^* = CH^+ + H. These results support a gas phase formation pathway of CH^+ and CH_3^+ via successive hydrogen abstraction reactions. However, we do not find any evidence of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;^+ emission in the JWST spectrum. Finally, observed CH^+ intensities coupled with chemical formation pumping model provide a diagnostic tool to trace the local density.

First detected in 1965, the mysterious ultraviolet (UV) extinction bump at 2175 Angstrom is the most prominent spectroscopic feature superimposed on the interstellar extinction curve. Its carrier remains unidentified over the past six decades ever since its first detection, although many candidate materials have been proposed. Widely seen in the interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way as well as several nearby galaxies, this bump was recently also detected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at the cosmic dawn in JADES-GS-z6-0, a distant galaxy at redshift z~6.71, corresponding to a cosmic age of just 800 million years after the Big Bang. Differing from that of the known Galactic and extragalactic interstellar sightlines which always peak at ~2175 Angstrom, the bump seen at z~6.71 in JADES-GS-z6-0 peaks at an appreciably longer wavelength of ~2263 Angstrom and is the narrowest among all known Galactic and extragalactic extinction bumps. Here we show that the combined electronic absorption spectra quantum-chemically computed for a number of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules closely reproduce the bump detected by JWST in JADES-GS-z6-0. This suggests that PAH molecules have already been pervasive in the Universe at an epoch when asymptotic giant branch stars have not yet evolved to make dust.

The enigmatic ultraviolet (UV) extinction bump at 2175 Angstrom, the strongest spectroscopic absorption feature superimposed on the interstellar extinction curve, has recently been detected at the cosmic dawn by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in JADES-GS-z6-0, a distant galaxy at redshift z=6.71, corresponding to a cosmic age of just 800 million years after the Big Bang. Although small graphite grains have historically long been suggested as the carrier of the 2175 Angstrom extinction bump and graphite grains are expected to have already been pervasive in the early Universe, in this work we demonstrate that small graphite grains are not responsible for the UV extinction bump seen at the cosmic dawn in JADES-GS-z6-0, as the extinction bump arising from small graphite grains is too broad and peaks at wavelengths that are too short to be consistent with what is seen in JADES-GS-z6-0.

Recently, Freedman et al. (2024) report agreement of distances derived from the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) and the J-Region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) at the 1&amp;percnt; level for both nearby galaxies with ground-based imaging (0.5-4 Mpc) as well distant galaxies with JWST imaging (7-23 Mpc). Here we compare the same ground-based JAGB distances to uniformly reduced space-based optical TRGB distances from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We uncover a significant offset between these two distance scales of &amp;Delta;&amp;mu; = 0.17 ± 0.04 (stat) ± 0.06 (sys) mag (9&amp;percnt; in distance), with the HST TRGB distances being further. Inspections of the HST color-magnitude diagrams make a compelling case that the issue lies in the underlying JAGB distances. The source of the disagreement may lie with the lower resolution or photometric calibration of the ground-based near-infrared data, a contrast to the general agreement found between JWST JAGB and other space-based, second-rung distance indicators (Cepheids, Miras, TRGB) presented within Riess et al. (2024). High-resolution, near-infrared observations from an ongoing HST program will enable the simultaneous measurement of Cepheid, JAGB, and TRGB distances in four of these nearby galaxies and allow us to investigate whether the discrepancy noted here is due to ground-based observational systematics, or something intrinsic to the JAGB method relevant for this particular sample. A resolution of this discrepancy is required if the JAGB is to be used to determine a highly precise local value of the Hubble constant.

JWST observations have uncovered a new population of red, compact objects at high redshifts dubbed 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs), which typically show broad emission lines and are thought to be dusty Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Some of their other features, however, challenge the AGN explanation, such as prominent Balmer breaks and extremely faint or even missing metal high-ionization lines, X-ray, or radio emission, including in deep stacks. Time variability is a unique test of AGN activity. Here, we exploit the z=7.045 multiply-imaged LRD A2744-QSO1, which offers a unique test of variability due to lensing-induced time delays between the three images spanning 22 yr (2.7 yr in the rest-frame), to investigate its photometric and spectroscopic variability. We find the equivalent widths (EWs) of the broad H&amp;alpha; and H&amp;beta; lines, which are independent of magnification and other systematics, to exhibit significant variations, up to 18±3 % for H&amp;alpha; and up to 22±8 % in H&amp;beta;, on a timescale of 875 d (2.4 yr) in the rest-frame. This suggests that A2744-QSO1 is indeed an AGN. We find no significant photometric variability beyond the limiting systematic uncertainties, so it currently cannot be determined whether the EW variations are due to line-flux or continuum variability. These results are consistent with a typical damped random walk (DRW) variability model for an AGN like A2744-QSO1 (M_BH=4×10^7 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) given the sparse sampling of the light-curve with the available data. Our results therefore support the AGN interpretation of this LRD, and highlight the need for further photometric and spectroscopic monitoring in order to build a detailed and reliable light-curve.

Nearby blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCDs) share similar properties with objects from the Epoch of Reionization revealed by JWST, in terms of low stellar mass, low metallicity and high specific star-formation rate. Thus, they represent ideal local laboratories for detailed multi-wavelength studies to understand their properties and the mechanisms shaping them. We report the first JWST MIRI/MRS observations of the BCD SBS 0335-052 E, analyzing MIR emission lines tracing different levels of ionization (e.g., [NeII], [SIV], [NeIII], [OIV], [NeV]) of the ionized gas. SBS 0335-052 E MIR emission is characterized by a bright point source, located in one of the youngest and most embedded stellar clusters (t~3 Myr, A_V~20), and underlying extended high-ionization emission (i.e., [OIV], [NeV]) from the surroundings of the older and less dusty stellar clusters (t&amp;lt; 20 Myr, A_V~8). From the comparison with state-of-the-art models, we can exclude shocks, X-ray binaries, and old stellar populations as the main sources of the high ionization. Interestingly, a 4-16% contribution of a ~10^5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; intermediate massive black hole (IMBH) is needed to justify the strong [NeV]/[NeII] and would be consistent with optical/UV line ratios from previous studies. However, even IMBH models cannot explain the strongest [OIV]/[NeIII]. Also, star-forming models (regardless of including X-ray binaries) struggle to reproduce even the lower ionization line ratios (e.g., [SIV]/[NeII]) typically observed in BCDs. Overall, while current models suggest the need to account for an accreting IMBH in this high-z analog, limitations still exist in predicting high-ionization emission lines (I.P. &amp;gt;54 eV) when modeling these low-metallicity environments, thus other sources of ionization cannot be fully ruled out.

Aims: The relative roles of the physical mechanisms involved in quenching galaxy star formation are still unclear. We tackle this fundamental problem with our cosmological semi-empirical model DECODE (Discrete statistical sEmi-empiriCal mODEl), designed to predict galaxy stellar mass assembly histories, from minimal input assumptions. Methods: Specifically, in this work the star formation history of each galaxy is calculated along its progenitor dark matter halo by assigning at each redshift a star formation rate extracted from a monotonic star formation rate-halo accretion rate (SFR-HAR) relation derived from abundance matching between the (observed) SFR function and the (numerically predicted) HAR function, a relation that is also predicted by the TNG100 simulation. SFRs are integrated across cosmic time to build up the mass of galaxies, which may halt their star formation following input physical quenching recipes. Results: In this work we test the popular halo quenching scenario and we find that: 1) the assumption of a monotonic relation between SFR and HAR allows to reproduce the number densities of the bulk of star-forming galaxies in the local Universe; 2) the halo quenching is sufficient to reproduce the statistics of the quenched galaxies and flat (steep) high-mass end of the SMHM relation (SMF); and 3) to align with the observed steep (flat) low-mass end of the SMHM (SMF) additional quenching processes in the least massive haloes are needed. Conclusions: DECODE is an invaluable tool and will pave the way to investigate the origin of newly observed high-redshift objects from the latest ongoing facilities such as JWST and Euclid.

We present first results from James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec), Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), and Keck Cosmic Webb Imager (KCWI) integral field spectroscopy of the powerful but highly obscured host-galaxy of the jetted radio source Cygnus A. We detect 169 infrared emission lines at 1.7&amp;ndash;27 micron and explore the kinematics and physical properties of the extended narrow-line region (NLR) in unprecedented detail. The density-stratified NLR appears to be shaped by the initial blow-out and ongoing interaction of the radio jet with the interstellar medium, creating a multi-phase bicone with a layered structure composed of molecular and ionized gas. The NLR spectrum, with strong coronal emission at kpc-scale, is well-modeled by AGN photoionization. We find evidence that the NLR is rotating around the radio axis, perhaps mediated by magnetic fields and driven by angular momentum transfer from the radio jet. The overall velocity field of the NLR is well described by 250 km/s outflow along biconical spiral flow lines, combining both rotation and outflow signatures. There is particularly bright [Fe II] 1.644 micron emission from a dense, high-velocity dispersion, photoionized clump of clouds found near the projected radio axis. Outflows of 600&amp;ndash;2000 km/s are found in bullets and streamers of ionized gas that may be ablated by the radio jet from these clouds, driving a local outflow rate of 40 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;/yr.

Hierarchical merging of galaxies plays an important role in galaxy formation and evolution. Mergers could trigger key evolutionary phases such as starburst activities and active accretion periods onto supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies. We aim to detect mergers and merger stages (pre- and post-mergers) across cosmic history and test whether it is better to detect mergers and their merger stages simultaneously or hierarchically. In addition, we want to test the impact of merger time relative to the coalescence of merging galaxies. First, we generated realistic mock JWST images of simulated galaxies selected from the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Then we trained deep learning (DL) models in the Zoobot Python package to classify galaxies into merging/non-merging galaxies and their merger stages. We used two different set-ups: (i) two-stage, in which we classify galaxies into mergers and non-mergers and then classify the mergers into pre-mergers and post-mergers, and (ii) one-stage, in which merger/non-merger and merger stages are classified simultaneously. We found that the one-stage classification set-up moderately outperforms the two-stage set-up, offering better overall accuracy and precision, particularly for the non-merger class. Pre-mergers can be classified with the highest precision in both set-ups, possibly due to the more recognisable merging features and the presence of merging companions. The image signal-to-noise ratio affects the performance of the DL classifiers, but not much after a certain threshold is crossed. Both precision and recall of the classifiers depend strongly on merger time, finding it more difficult to identify true mergers observed at stages that are more distant to coalescence. For pre-mergers, we recommend selecting mergers which will merge in the next 0.4 Gyrs, to achieve a good balance between precision and recall.

At cosmic dawn, the first stars and galaxies are believed to form from and be deeply embedded in clouds of dense, pristine gas. Here we present a study of the JWST/NIRSpec data of the most distant, spectroscopically confirmed galaxy observed to date, JADES-GS-z14-0 (GS-z14 for short), at z=14.179, combined with recent far-infrared measurements of the [OIII]-88&amp;mu;m and [CII]-158&amp;mu;m line transitions and underlying dust-continuum emission. Based on the observed prominent damped Lyman-&amp;alpha; (DLA) absorption profile, we determine a substantial neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) column density, log (N_HI / cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = 22.27^+0.08_-0.09, consistent with previous estimates though seemingly at odds with the dynamical and gas mass of the galaxy. Using various independent but complementary approaches, considering the implied neutral gas mass from the DLA measurement, the star-formation rate surface density, and the metal abundance, we demonstrate that the total gas mass of GS-z14 is of the order log (M_gas / M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) = 9.8± 0.3. This implies a substantial gas mass fraction, f_gas ≳ 0.9 and that the bulk of the interstellar medium (ISM) is in the form of HI. We show that the derived gas mass is fully consistent with the non-detection of [CII]-158&amp;mu;m, assuming an appropriate scaling to the neutral gas. The low dust-to-gas ratio, A_V/N_HI = (1.3± 0.6)× 10^-23 mag cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, derived in the line-of-sight through the DLA further indicates that the absorbing gas is more pristine than the central, star-forming regions probed by the [OIII]-88&amp;mu;m emission. These results highlight the implications for far-infrared line-detection searchers attainable with ALMA and demonstrate that the bright, relatively massive galaxy GS-z14 at z=14.179 is deeply embedded in a substantial, pristine HI gas reservoir dominating its baryonic matter content.

The selection of candidate high-redshift galaxies using the dropout technique targeting the Lyman-break signature sometimes results in very bright objects, which would be too luminous to be easily explained if they are indeed at the expected redshifts. Here we present a systematic study of very bright dropouts selected through successive bands of the NIRCam instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Using the public NIRCam data in four blank fields over 500~arcmin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 300 such objects were found. They have magnitudes in F356W &amp;lt;25.1~mag or &amp;lt;26.0~mag depending on the dropout passband, and the vast majority of them (&amp;gt;80&amp;percnt;) have very red F115W-F356W colors &amp;gt; 2.0~mag, which make them qualify as "extremely red objects'' (EROs). We focus on the 137 objects that also have mid-IR observations from the JWST MIRI instrument. The analysis of their spectral energy distributions shows that these very bright dropouts are dominated by low-redshift (z~ 1&amp;ndash;4) galaxies (≳ 67&amp;percnt;). However, a non-negligible fraction (≳ 7&amp;percnt;) could be at high redshifts. Seven of our objects have secure spectroscopic redshifts from the JWST NIRSpec identifications, and the results confirm this picture: while six are low-redshift galaxies at z≈ 3, one is a known galaxy at z=8.679 recovered in our sample. If more objects from our sample are confirmed to be at high redshifts, they could pose a severe challenge in explaining their properties, such as the extremely high star formation rates and stellar masses.

Synergies between the  James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST) and the  Chandra X-ray observatory have advanced the observational frontier by detecting a handful of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) beyond z ~ 10. In particular, the recent discovery of a candidate 8 × 10^7~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; black hole (BH) in the galaxy GHZ9 at z = 10.4 favors massive seed formation channels for these objects. Motivated by prospects for their detection in radio by recent studies, we estimate radio fluxes for GHZ9 and explore the possibility of their detection with the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) and next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA). We find that ngVLA should be able to detect radio emission from GHZ9 for integration times as short as 1 hr while SKA will require integration times of up to 100 hr. We also find that radio emission from the BH can be distinguished from that due to H II regions and supernovae in its host galaxy. The detection of a few hundred nJy radio signal at frequencies &amp;gt; 2 GHz will be a smoking gun for the presence of a BH in GHZ9.

The J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) is an overdensity of stars in the near-infrared, attributed to carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars, and recently used as a standard candle for measuring extragalactic distances and the Hubble constant. Using JWST in Cycle 2, we extend JAGB measurements to 6 hosts of 9 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) (NGC 2525, NGC 3147, NGC 3370, NGC 3447, NGC 5468, and NGC 5861), with two at D ~ 40 Mpc, all calibrated by the maser host NGC 4258. We investigate the effects of incompleteness and find that we are unable to recover a robust JAGB measurement in one of the two most distant hosts at R ~ 40 Mpc, NGC 3147. We compile all JWST JAGB observations in SNe Ia hosts, 15 galaxies hosting 18 SNe Ia, from the SH0ES and CCHP programs and employ all literature measures (mode, mean, median, model). We find no significant mean difference between these distances and those from HST Cepheids, -0.03±0.02 (stat) ± 0.05 (sys) mag. We find a difference of 0.11 ± 0.02 mag between JAGB mode measurements in the CCHP analyses of two fields in NGC 4258, a feature also seen in two SH0ES fields (see field-to-field variations in Li et al. 2024a), indicating significant field-to-field variation of JAGB measurements in NGC 4258 which produce a large absolute calibration uncertainty. Variations are also seen in the shape of the JAGB LF across galaxies so that different measures produce different values of the Hubble constant. We look for but do not (yet) find a standardizing relation between JAGB LF skew or color dependence and the apparent variation. Using the middle result of all JAGB measures to calibrate SNe Ia yields a Hubble constant of H_0 = 73.3 ± 1.4 (stat) ± 2.0 (sys) km/s/Mpc with the systematic dominated by apparent differences across NGC 4258 calibrating fields or their measures.

We present a MIRI-MRS spectrum of the high-inclination protoplanetary disk around the solar-mass (K0) star MY Lup, obtained as part of the JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey (JDISCS). The spectrum shows an unusually weak water emission spectrum for a disk around a star of its spectral type, but strong emission from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, HCN, and isotopologues of both molecules. This includes the first ever detection of C^18O^16O and H^13CN in an inner disk, as well as tentative detections of C^17O^16O and HC^15N. Slab modeling provides molecular temperatures, column densities and emitting areas of the detected molecules. The emitting molecular gas is cold compared to that of other observed protoplanetary disk spectra. We estimate the isotopologue ratios of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and HCN, albeit with significant uncertainty. We suggest that the unusual spectrum of MY Lup arises from a combination of inner disk clearing, which removes emission from warm water, and its nearly edge-on inclination, which enhances line-of-sight column densities, although unusual chemistry may also be required. MY Lup's spectrum highlights the potential to detect and measure trace isotopologues to study isotopic fractionation in protoplanetary disks; observations at higher spectral resolving power is needed to constrain the isotopologue ratios to greater precision.

With its peculiar appearance, I Zw 18 has long been considered a unique example of a young galaxy in the nearby Universe. In this paper, we summarize the observational history of this famous galaxy, discuss the controversies surrounding its evolutionary state, and present new insights gained from JWST/NIRCam observations. These recent findings shed light on one of the most intriguing mysteries in extragalactic astronomy.

We present analyses of a nitrogen-enriched star-forming galaxy, ID60001, at z=4.6928 based on JWST/NIRSpec MSA spectroscopy and NIRCam photometry. From rest-frame optical emission lines we derive the nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) abundance ratio of ID60001 to be log(N/O)=-0.76_-0.03^+0.03 ([N/O]=0.10_-0.03^+0.03), which is significantly elevated at the corresponding metallicity 12+log(O/H)=7.75_-0.01^+0.01 (Z/Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.12) compared to local counterparts. We discuss possible scenarios for elevated N/O abundance in ID60001, including pristine gas inflow, Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, and Oxygen depletion by Type II supernova winds. Based on the moderately broadened He\sc ii&amp;lambda;4686 emission line, galaxy morphology, and star-formation history, we conclude that the elevated N/O abundance of ID60001 is likely originated from massive (&amp;gt;25 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) WR stars that directly collapse into a black hole. We also stress the importance of reliable electron density measurements when deriving N/O abundance with rest-frame optical emission lines.

A distinct power-law break is apparent m_AB approximately 21 in the deep Near-Infrared PEARLS-JWST galaxy counts. The break becomes more pronounced at longer wavelengths, with the counts slope flattening smoothly with apparent magnitude in the shortest band used at 0.9 microns, trending towards an increasingly broken slope by the longest wavelength passband of JWST NIRCam, 4.4 microns. This behaviour is remarkably well predicted by the GALFORM semi-analytical model of galaxy formation. We use the model to diagnose the origin of this behaviour. We find that the features that are responsible for the break are: 1) the inherent break in the luminosity function; 2) the change in the volume element with redshift and 3) the redshift-dependent nature of the k-correction. We study the contribution to these effects by early and late-type galaxies, using as a proxy for morphology the bulge-to-total stellar mass ratio. We find that the way in which ellipticals populate the bright end of the luminosity function while spirals dominate the faint end is preserved in the galaxy number counts, with a characteristic stellar mass at the break of approximately 10^10 M_sun. We also find that the shape of the number counts is mainly driven by galaxies with relatively low redshift (z &amp;lt; 2) for the PEARLS observational limit of m_AB &amp;lt; 28. We give a comprehensive description of why the galaxy number counts in the near-infrared PEARLS-JWST observation look the way they do and which population of galaxies is dominant at each apparent magnitude.

The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope has revealed a wealth of new galaxies just a few hundred Myr after the Big Bang. Some of these galaxies exhibit unusual elemental abundances that are difficult to explain with stellar populations today. While Wolf-Rayet stars in multiple-burst populations, very massive or rapidly-rotating primordial stars, general relativistic explosions of metal-enriched supermassive stars, or the precursors of globular clusters can in principle account for the supersolar nitrogen to oxygen ratios in the galaxies GN-z11 and CEERS 1019, no known stars or supernovae can explain the far higher N/O ratio of 0.46 in GS 3073 at redshift z = 5.55. Here we show that the extreme nitrogen abundances in GS 3073 can be produced by 1000 - 10,000 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; primordial (Pop III) stars. We find that these are the only candidates that can account for its large N/O ratios and its C/O and Ne/O ratios. GS 3073 is thus the first conclusive evidence in the fossil abundance record of the existence of supermassive Pop III stars at cosmic Dawn.

The unprecedented sensitivity of the itJames Webb Space Telescope (itJWST) has revolutionized our understanding of the early universe. Among the most intriguing itJWST discoveries are red, very compact objects showing broad line emission features nicknamed as little red dots (LRDs). The discovery of LRDs has triggered great interest about their origin as either extremely starbursting galaxies or highly-obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN). Their exact nature still remains unknown. The goal of this work is to estimate the radio emission from LRDs and predict which radio surveys would detect them. To achieve these objectives, we employ the fundamental plane of black hole (BH) accretion to estimate radio emission from AGN and the stellar radio fluxes from their host galaxies. We assume a range of BH mass, X-ray luminosity (L_X) and star formation rate (SFR) to bracket the likely properties of LRDs. Our findings suggest that BH radio fluxes from LRDs are 10-100 times higher than the stellar fluxes from their host galaxies, depending on BH mass, L_X and SFR. The detection of a ~ 500 nJy signal above 2 GHz at z ≥ 5 or a ~ 2000 nJy flux at z = 3-4 would be a smoking gun for the presence of AGN provided that SFRs in the host galaxies are &amp;lt; 30~ M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; ~yr^-1. We find that LRDs are most likely radio quiet AGN otherwise would have been already detected in the current radio surveys. Our findings suggest that LRDs can be detected with the upcoming radio observatories such as ngVLA and SKA with integration times of 10-100 hrs, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;
Cosmic reionization represents the latest phase transition of the intergalactic medium (IGM) in the Universe. It has long been debated whether galaxies or active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are the major source of Lyman continuum (LyC) photons responsible for reionization. Previous observations slightly favored galaxies as the major ionizing source. However, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) recently discovered an unexpectedly high density of AGN candidates at high redshift, which has largely enhanced the influence of AGNs. Here we derive a definitive upper bound on the AGN contribution to reionization using the latest JWST data, and conclusively rule out AGNs as the dominant ionizing source during the epoch of reionization (EoR). We build a sample of objects (including galaxies and AGNs) in a specific redshift range between 7.15 and 7.75 that has a high completeness. Each object is then decomposed into a point-source component and an extended component in their rest-frame far-UV JWST images. Assuming all point-source components are AGNs, we obtain an absolute upper limit for the density of the AGN population. This fiducial AGN sample reaches an unprecedentedly low luminosity of M_UV ≈ -15 mag. Based on this sample, we find that AGNs can contribute at most one third of the LyC photons required to ionize the Universe in this redshift range. Our result implies that galaxies dominate the ionizing source during the EoR.

&lt;p&gt;
The phase space of stellar streams is proposed to detect dark substructure in the Milky Way through the perturbations created by passing subhalos - and thus is a powerful test of the cold dark matter paradigm and its alternatives. Using graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) data compression and simulation-based inference (SBI) on a simulated GD-1-like stream, we improve the constraint on the mass of a [10^8, 10^7, 10^6] M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; perturbing subhalo by factors of [11, 7, 3] with respect to the current state-of-the-art density power spectrum analysis. We find that the GCNN produces posteriors that are more accurate (better calibrated) than the power spectrum. We simulate the positions and velocities of stars in a GD-1-like stream and perturb the stream with subhalos of varying mass and velocity. Leveraging the feature encoding of the GCNN to compress the input phase space data, we then use SBI to estimate the joint posterior of the subhalo mass and velocity. We investigate how our results scale with the size of the GCNN, the coordinate system of the input and the effect of incomplete observations. Our results suggest that a survey with 10 × fewer stars (300 stars) with complete 6-D phase space data performs about as well as a deeper survey (3000 stars) with only 3-D data (photometry, spectroscopy). The stronger constraining power and more accurate posterior estimation motivate further development of GCNNs in combining future photometric, spectroscopic and astrometric stream observations.

We use JWST Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) observations from the the Cosmic Evolution Early Release survey (CEERS), GLASS-JWST ERS (GLASS), and JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) to measure rest-frame optical emission-line ratios of 90 galaxies at z&amp;gt;4. The stacked spectra of galaxies with and without a broad-line feature reveal a difference in the [OIII]&amp;lambda; 4363 and H&amp;gamma; ratios. This motivated our investigation of the [OIII]/H&amp;gamma; vs [NeIII]/[OII] diagram. We define two AGN/SF classification lines based on 1869 SDSS galaxies at z~0. After applying a redshift correction to the AGN/SF lines we find 76.8% of BLAGN continue to land in the AGN region of the diagnostic largely due to the [NeIII]/[OII] ratio. However, 40.2% of non-BLAGN land in the AGN region as well, this could be due to star forming galaxies having harder ionization of there are narrow line AGN which are not accounted for. This indicates the potential of the [NeIII]/[OII] ratio to continue classifying galaxies to z~6. We further inspect galaxies without broad emission lines in each region of [OIII]/H&amp;gamma; vs [NeIII]/[OII] diagram and found that they have slightly stronger CIII]&amp;lambda;1908 fluxes and equivalent width when landing in the BLAGN region. However, the cause of this higher ionization is unclear. Additionally, we find that BLAGN are characterized by a higher ionization (at constant electron temperature) compared to non-broad line galaxies.

Recent work with JWST has demonstrated its capability to identify and chemically characterize multiple populations in globular clusters down to the H-burning limit. In this study, we explore the kinematics of multiple populations in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae by combining data from JWST, HST, and Gaia. We analyzed velocity dispersion and anisotropy profiles from the cluster center out to ~10R_h. Our findings indicate that while 1G stars are isotropic, 2G stars are significantly radially anisotropic. These results align with the predictions of simulations of the dynamical evolution of clusters where 2G stars are initially more centrally concentrated than 1G stars. Furthermore, we subdivided the 2G population into two subpopulations: 2G_A and 2G_B, with the latter being more chemically extreme. We compared their dynamical profiles and found no significant differences. For the first time, we measured the degree of energy equipartition among the multiple populations of 47 Tucanae. Overall, within the analyzed radial range (~2-4R_h), both populations exhibit a low degree of energy equipartition. The most significant differences between 1G and 2G stars are observed in the tangential velocity component, where 2G stars are characterized by a stronger degree of energy equipartition than 1G stars. In the radial component, the behavior of 1G and 2G stars is more variable, with differences largely dependent on radius. Finally, our analysis reveals that the ratio of rotational velocity to velocity dispersion is larger for the 2G population, while 1G stars exhibit higher skewness in their tangential proper motions, providing further evidence of differences in the kinematic properties of the 1G and 2G populations.

Carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet binaries are a prominent source of carbonaceous dust that contribute to the dust budget of galaxies. The "textbook" example of an episodic dust producing WR binary, WR140 (HD193793), provides us with an ideal laboratory for investigating the dust physics and kinematics in an extreme environment. This study is among the first to utilize two separate JWST observations, from Cycle 1 ERS (July 2022) and Cycle 2 (Sept. 2023), to measure WR140's dust kinematics and confirm its morphology. To measure the proper motions and projected velocities of the dust shells, we performed a novel PSF subtraction to reduce the effects of the bright diffraction spikes and carefully aligned the Cycle 2 to the Cycle 1 images. At 7.7 &amp;mu;m, through the bright feature common to 16 dust shells (C1), we find an average dust shell proper motion of 390±29 mas yr^-1, which equates to a projected velocity of 2714±188 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; at a distance of 1.64 kpc. Our measured speeds are constant across all visible shells and consistent with previously reported dust expansion velocities. Our observations not only prove that these dusty shells are astrophysical (i.e., not associated with any PSF artifact) and originate from WR140, but also confirm the "clumpy" morphology of the dust shells, in which identifiable substructures within certain shells persist for at least 14 months from one cycle to the next. These results support the hypothesis that clumping in the wind collision region is required for dust production in WR binaries.

The field of high redshift galaxy formation has been revolutionised by JWST, which is yielding unprecedented insights on galaxy assembly at early times. Our key aim is to study the physical mechanisms that can explain the unexpected abundance of bright galaxies at z ≥ 11, as well as their metal enrichment and spectral properties. We also use recent data to determine the key sources of reionisation. To do so, we implement cold gas fractions and star formation efficiencies derived from the SPHINX20 high-resolution radiation-hydrodynamics simulation into DELPHI, a semi-analytic model that tracks the assembly of dark matter halos and their baryonic components from z ~ 4.5-40. In addition, we explore two different methodologies to boost galaxy luminosities at z ≥ 11: a stellar initial mass function (IMF) that becomes increasingly top-heavy with decreasing metallicity and increasing redshift (eIMF model), and star formation efficiencies that increase with increasing redshift (eSFE model). Our key findings are: (i) both the eIMF and eSFE models can explain the abundance of bright galaxies at z ≥ 11; (ii) dust attenuation plays an important role for the bright-end of the UV LF at z ≤ 11; (iii) the mass-metallicity relation is in place as early as z ~ 17 in all models although its slope is model-dependent; (iv) within the spread of both models and observations, all of our models are in good agreement with current estimates of &amp;beta; slopes at z ~ 5-17 and Balmer break strengths at z ~ 6-10; (v) in the eIMF model, galaxies at z≥12 or with M_UV≥-18 show values of  &amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt;  ~ 10^25.55~[Hz~erg^-1], twice larger than in other models; (vi) star formation in galaxies below 10^9 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; is the key driver of reionisation, providing the bulk (~ 85&amp;percnt;) of ionising photons down to its midpoint at z ~ 7.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revolutionizing our understanding of the Universe by unveiling faint, near-infrared dropouts previously beyond our reach, ranging from exceptionally dusty sources to galaxies up to redshift z ~ 14. In this paper, we identify F200W-dropout objects in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey which are absent from existing catalogs. Our selection method can effectively identify obscured low-mass (log M_* ≤ 9) objects at z ≤ 6, massive dust-rich sources up to z ~ 12, and ultra-high-redshift (z &amp;gt; 15) candidates. Primarily relying on NIRCam photometry from the latest CEERS data release and supplementing with Mid-Infrared/(sub-)mm data when available, our analysis pipeline combines multiple SED-fitting codes, star formation histories, and CosMix - a novel tool for astronomical stacking. Our work highlights three 2&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;3 dusty dwarf galaxies which have larger masses compared to the typical dusty dwarfs previously identified in CEERS. Additionally, we reveal five faint sources with significant probability of lying above z&amp;gt;15, with best-fit masses compatible with &amp;Lambda;CDM and a standard baryons-to-star conversion efficiency. Their bi-modal redshift probability distributions suggest they could also be z&amp;lt;1.5 dwarf galaxies with extreme dust extinction. We also identify a strong line emitter galaxy at z ~ 5 mimicking the near-infrared emission of a z ~ 13 galaxy. Our sample holds promising candidates for future follow-ups. Confirming ultra high-redshift galaxies or lower-z dusty dwarfs will offer valuable insights into early galaxy formation, evolution with their central black holes and the nature of dark matter, and/or cosmic dust production mechanisms in low-mass galaxies, and will help us to understand degeneracies and contamination in high-z object searches.

In response to recent observations from JWST and ALMA, we explore a new class of dynamically self-consistent models using our AGAMA/Ramses hydrodynamic N-body framework (Nexus) that mimics a plausible progenitor of the Milky Way over a wide range of disc gas fractions (f_gas = 0-100&amp;percnt;). The high gas surface densities encourage vigorous star formation, which in turn couples with the gas to drive turbulence. We show that this coupling through momentum recoil drives 'baryon sloshing,' i.e. a random walk of the baryonic potential minimum with respect to the centre of the total gravitational potential, &amp;Phi;_tot. The amplitude of the bulk motion depends on the strength of the feedback, which in turn is directly associated with f_gas. At its most extreme, when gas is the sole contributor to the disc potential (f_gas=100%), the amplitude of the walk can reach up to R≈ 5 kpc and  &amp;vert;  z &amp;vert;  ≈ 1 kpc within &amp;Phi;_tot(R,&amp;phi;,z). Consistent with observations, the disc dominates over dark matter (f_disc≳ 50%) within R_s=2.2 R_disc, where R_disc is the exponential disc scale length. For a lower f_disc and/or f_gas, the 3D sloshing amplitude and velocity are reduced. The combination of strong feedback (which unbinds the disc) and sloshing leads to the newly formed stars being dynamically heated and settling to a more spatially extended disc population. The 3D heating process is isotropic but its effects are more noticeable in  &amp;vert;  z &amp;vert;  due to the initial dynamical coldness of the star-forming disc. Such a disc has enhanced [&amp;alpha;/Fe] stellar abundances and a vertical (but no radial) gradient in stellar age and metallicity, both consistent with the Milky Way's thick stellar disc. Contrary to earlier claims, star formation in a stationary turbulent disc does not produce thick stellar discs.

We present a morphological analysis of ALMA and JWST NIRCam images of nine dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at zspec=3.09, all embedded within the cosmic web filaments at the SSA22 proto-cluster core. The ALMA 870um and 1.1mm images are obtained at spatial resolutions ranging from 0.5" to 0.05" (350 pc at z=3.09). The high-resolution images enable us to resolve inner structures traced by dust continuum, identifying compact dusty cores, clumps, and offset ridges within bars. Sersic profile fit was performed for both ALMA 870um and NIRCam F444W images at comparable resolutions (0.15"). The Sersic index measured for 870um, masking bright regions, indicates values close to unity, suggesting that dust emission arises from disks with superimposed compact core components. For the JWST F444W images (restframe 1um), the Sersic indices range between nF444W = 1-3, pointing to the coexistence of bulges and stellar disks in these DSFGs. A comparison of dust mass surface density, nF444W, and F200W-F444W color (restframe 0.5-1um) reveals diversity among the DSFGs, likely reflecting different evolutionary stages including some DSFGs with red cores, indicating ongoing rapid bulge growth phases heavily obscured by dust. The predominantly disk-like morphologies observed in most DSFGs in the proto-cluster core contrast sharply with early-type morphologies that dominate the highest density environment in the local universe. This suggests that we are witnessing the early formation of the morphology-density relation, as massive galaxies undergo rapid growth as late-type galaxies fueled by cosmic web gas filaments.

Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are a key component of galaxy evolution due to feedback on the host from its supermassive black hole. The morphology of warm, in- and outflowing dusty material can reveal the nature of the onset of feedback, AGN feeding, and the unified model of AGN. Here we use the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) to image the dense, obscuring disk and extended dusty outflow region of NGC 1068. In Fizeau imaging mode the LBTI synthesizes the equivalent resolution of a 22.8 m telescope. The 8.7 &amp;mu;m Fizeau images of NGC 1068 have an effective resolution of 47×90 mas (3.3×6.2 pc) in a 5" field of view after performing PSF deconvolution techniques described here. This is the only extragalactic source to be Fizeau imaged using the LBTI, and the images bridge the scales measured with the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI; 0.5-5 pc) and those of single telescopes such as JWST and Keck (&amp;gt;15 pc). The images detect and spatially resolve the low surface brightness mid-infrared (MIR) features in the AGN disk/wind region that are over-resolved by the VLTI. The images show strong correlation between MIR dust emission and near-infrared (NIR) emission of highly excited atomic lines observed by SINFONI. Such LBTI imaging is a precursor to infrared imaging using the upcoming generation of extremely large telescopes, with angular resolutions up to 6x better than JWST, the largest space telescope in orbit.

&lt;p&gt;
We perform an MMT/Hectospec redshift survey of the North Ecliptic Pole Wide (NEPW) field covering 5.4 square degrees, and use it to estimate the photometric redshifts for the sources without spectroscopic redshifts. By combining 2572 newly measured redshifts from our survey with existing data from the literature, we create a large sample of 4421 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the NEPW field. Using this sample, we estimate photometric redshifts of 77755 sources in the band-merged catalog of the NEPW field with a random forest model. The estimated photometric redshifts are generally consistent with the spectroscopic redshifts, with a dispersion of 0.028, an outlier fraction of 7.3%, and a bias of -0.01. We find that the standard deviation of the prediction from each decision tree in the random forest model can be used to infer the fraction of catastrophic outliers and the measurement uncertainties. We test various combinations of input observables, including colors and magnitude uncertainties, and find that the details of these various combinations do not change the prediction accuracy much. As a result, we provide a catalog of 77755 sources in the NEPW field, which includes both spectroscopic and photometric redshifts up to z~2. This dataset has significant legacy value for studies in the NEPW region, especially with upcoming space missions such as JWST, Euclid, and SPHEREx.

&lt;p&gt;
The recent detections of a large number of candidate active galactic nuclei at high redshift (i.e. z ≳ 4) has increased speculation that heavy seed massive black hole formation may be a required pathway. Here we re-implement the so-called Lyman-Werner (LW) channel model of Dijkstra et al. (2014) to calculate the expected number density of massive black holes formed through this channel. We further enhance this model by extracting information relevant to the model from the ttRenaissance simulation suite. ttRenaissance is a high-resolution suite of simulations ideally positioned to probe the high-z universe. Finally, we compare the LW-only channel against other models in the literature. We find that the LW-only channel results in a peak number density of massive black holes of approximately 10^-4  cMpc^-3 at z ~ 10. Given the growth requirements and the duty cycle of active galactic nuclei, this means that the LW-only is likely incompatible with recent JWST measurements and can, at most, be responsible for only a small subset of high-z active galactic nuclei. Other models from the literature seem therefore better positioned, at present, to explain the high frequency of massive black holes at high z.

&lt;p&gt;
We present a comprehensive study of the large-scale structure, jet and outflow morphology, and kinematics of the Class 0/I protostellar binary Ced 110 IRS4, using JWST NIRCam (F150W and F410M) and MIRI MRS observations from the JWST ERC program IceAge, along with ALMA data from the Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) program. NIRCam images, combined with ALMA continuum and CO data, reveal arc-like structures (~1100 au), suggesting a dense envelope around the protostars. We detect disk shadows from both protostars in F150W. The MIRI MRS IFU data reveal a jet from both protostars in multiple [Fe II] lines, [Ar II] 6.99 &amp;mu;m and [Ne II] 12.81 &amp;mu;m, marking the first detection of a jet from the system. The [Fe II] (5.34 &amp;mu;m) jet from Ced 110 IRS4A has a width of ≤ 51~au at the protostellar location, with a large opening angle of 23\arcdeg ± 4\arcdeg. After inclination correction, the jet velocity is 124 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, corresponding to a dynamical timescale of 25 years. The molecular H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; outflow displays a distinct morphology resembling two hemispheres placed back-to-back. The consistent H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission extent across transitions, differing from previous observations of protostellar outflows detected with JWST, suggests that MHD disk winds may not drive the observed outflow. We find that the upper limit to the width of the outflow at the protostellar location is 130 ± 10 au which is smaller than the disk diameter of 183.4 ± 0.4 au but much larger than the width of the [Fe II] jet.

&lt;p&gt;
Radiation pressure is a key mechanism by which stellar feedback disrupts molecular clouds and drives HII region expansion. This includes direct radiation pressure exerted by UV photons on dust grains, pressure associated with photoionization, and infrared (IR) radiation pressure on grains due to dust-reprocessed IR photons. We present a new method that combines high resolution mid-IR luminosities from JWST-MIRI, optical attenuation and nebular line measurements from VLT-MUSE, and HST H&amp;alpha;-based region sizes to estimate the strength of radiation pressure in ≈ 18,000 HII regions across 19 nearby star-forming galaxies. This is the most extensive and direct estimate of these terms beyond the Local Group to date. In the disks of galaxies, we find that the total reprocessed IR pressure is on average 5% of the direct UV radiation pressure. This fraction rises to 10% in galaxy centers. We expect reprocessed IR radiation pressure to dominate over UV radiation pressure in regions where L_F2100W/L_H&amp;alpha;^corr ≳ 75. Radiation pressure due to H ionizations is lower than pressure on dust in our sample, but appears likely to dominate the radiation pressure budget in dwarf galaxies similar to the Small Magellanic Cloud. The contribution from all radiation pressure terms appears to be subdominant compared to thermal pressure from ionized gas, reinforcing the view that radiation pressure is most important in compact, heavily embedded, and young regions.

&lt;p&gt;
Brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) lie deep within the largest gravitationally bound structures in existence. Though some cluster finding techniques identify the position of the BCG and use it as the cluster center, other techniques may not automatically include these coordinates. This can make studying BCGs in such surveys difficult, forcing researchers to either adopt oversimplified algorithms or perform cumbersome visual identification. For large surveys, there is a need for a fast and reliable way of obtaining BCG coordinates. We propose machine learning to accomplish this task and train a neural network to identify positions of candidate BCGs given no more information than multiband photometric images. We use both mock observations from The Three Hundred project and real ones from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and we quantify the performance. Training on simulations yields a squared correlation coefficient, R^2, between predictions and ground truth of R^2 ≈ 0.94 when testing on simulations, which decreases to R^2 ≈ 0.60 when testing on real data due to discrepancies between datasets. Limiting the application of this method to real clusters more representative of the training data, such those with a BCG r-band magnitude r_BCG ≤ 16.5, yields R^2 ≈ 0.99. The method performs well up to a redshift of at least z≈ 0.6. We find this technique to be a promising method to automate and accelerate the identification of BCGs in large datasets.

&lt;p&gt;
We introduce a prescription for estimating the flux of the 7.7 micron and 11.3 micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features from broadband JWST/MIRI images. Probing PAH flux with MIRI imaging data has advantages in field of view, spatial resolution, and sensitivity compared with MIRI spectral maps, but comparisons with spectra are needed to calibrate these flux estimations over a wide variety of environments. For 267 MIRI/MRS spectra from independent regions in the four luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) in the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS) early release science program, we derive synthetic filter photometry and directly compare estimated PAH fluxes to those measured from detailed spectral fits. We find that for probing PAH 7.7 micron, the best combination of filters is F560W, F770W, and either F1500W or F2100W, and the best for PAH 11.3 micron is F560W, F1000W, F1130W, and F1500W. The prescription with these combinations yields predicted flux densities that typically agree with values from spectral decomposition within ~7% and ~5% for PAH 7.7 and 11.3 micron, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;
We investigate the dust mass build-up and star formation efficiency of two galaxies at z&amp;gt;12, GHZ2 and GS-z14-0, by combining ALMA and JWST observations with an analytical model that assumes dust at thermal equilibrium. We obtained 3&amp;sigma; constraints on dust mass of log M_dust/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;5.0 and &amp;lt;5.3, respectively. These constraints are in tension with a high dust condensation efficiency in stellar ejecta but are consistent with models with a short metal accretion timescale at z&amp;gt;12. Given the young stellar ages of these galaxies (t_age~10 Myrs), dust grain growth via accretion may still be ineffective at this stage, though it likely works efficiently to produce significant dust in galaxies at z~7. The star formation efficiencies, defined as the SFR divided by molecular gas mass, reach ~10 Gyr^-1 in a 10 Myr timescale, aligning with the expected redshift evolution of `starburst' galaxies with efficiencies that are ~0.5&amp;ndash;1 dex higher than those in main-sequence galaxies. This starburst phase seems to be common in UV-bright galaxies at z&amp;gt;12 and is likely associated with the unique conditions of the early phases of galaxy formation, such as bursty star formation and/or negligible feedback from super-Eddington accretion. Direct observations of molecular gas tracers like [CII] will be crucial to further understanding the nature of bright galaxies at z&amp;gt;12.

&lt;p&gt;
We investigate the variability of the UV luminosity function (UVLF) at z &amp;gt; 5 using the SPICE suite of cosmological, radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, which include three distinct supernova (SN) feedback models: bursty-sn, smooth-sn, and hyper-sn. The bursty-sn model, driven by intense and episodic SN explosions, produces the highest fluctuations in the star formation rate (SFR). Conversely, the smooth-sn model, characterized by gentler SN feedback, results in minimal SFR variability. The hyper-sn model, featuring a more realistic prescription that incorporates hypernova (HN) explosions, exhibits intermediate variability, closely aligning with the smooth-sn trend at lower redshifts. These fluctuations in SFR significantly affect the M_UV - M_halo relation, a proxy for UVLF variability. Among the models, bursty-sn produces the highest UVLF variability, with a maximum value of 2.5. In contrast, the smooth-sn and hyper-sn models show substantially lower variability, with maximum values of 1.3 and 1.5, respectively. However, in all cases, UVLF variability strongly correlates with host halo mass, with lower-mass halos showing greater variability due to more effective SN feedback in their shallower gravitational wells. The bursty-sn model, though, results in higher amplitudes. Variability decreases in lower mass haloes with decreasing redshift for all feedback models. This study underscores the critical role of SN feedback in shaping the UVLF, and highlights the mass and redshift dependence of its variability, suggesting that UVLF variability may alleviate the bright galaxy tension observed by JWST at high redshifts.

Utilising JWST, ALMA and the VLA we present high angular resolution (0.06''- 0.42''), multi-wavelength (4 micron - 3cm) observations of the VLA 1623-2417 protostellar system to characterise the origin, morphology and, properties of the continuum emission. JWST observations at 4.4 micron reveal outflow cavities for VLA 1623 A and, for the first time, VLA 1623 B, as well as scattered light from the upper layers of the VLA 1623 W disk. We model the millimetre-centimetre spectral energy distributions to quantify the relative contributions of dust and ionised gas emission, calculate dust masses, and use spectral index maps to determine where optical depth hinders this analysis. In general, all objects appear to be optically thick down to ~90 GHz, show evidence for significant amounts (10's - 100's M_Earth) of large (&amp;gt;1 mm) dust grains, and are dominated by ionised gas emission for frequencies ≲15 GHz. In addition, we find evidence of unsettled millimetre dust in the inclined disk of VLA 1623 B possibly attributed to instabilities within the circumstellar disk, adding to the growing catalogue of unsettled Class 0/I disks. Our results represent some of the highest resolution observations possible with current instrumentation, particularly in the case of the VLA. However, our interpretation is still limited at low frequencies (≲22 GHz) and thus motivates the need for next-generation interferometers operating at centimetre wavelengths.

&lt;p&gt;
Stellar feedback is an essential step in the baryon cycle of galaxies, but it remains unconstrained beyond Cosmic Noon. We study the ionized gas kinematics, dynamical mass and gas-flow properties of a sample of 16 sub-L^&amp;sext; star-forming galaxies at 4≤ z≤7.6, using high-resolution JWST/NIRSpec observations. The emission lines are resolved, with velocity dispersions (&amp;sigma;_gas ~(km~s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)≃38-96) comparable to more massive galaxies at Cosmic Noon. From &amp;sigma;_gas and the galaxy size (r_e=400-960~pc), we estimate the dynamical mass to be log M_dyn/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;=9.25-10.25. Stellar-to-dynamical mass ratios are low (log M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M_dyn\in[-0.5,-2]) and decrease with increasing SFR surface density (&amp;Sigma;_SFR). We estimate the gas surface densities assuming a star-formation law, but the gas masses do not balance the baryon-to-dynamical mass ratios, which would require a decrease in the star-formation efficiency. We find evidence of ionized outflows in five out of the sixteen galaxies, based on the need of broad components to reproduce the emission-line wings. We only observe outflows from galaxies undergoing recent bursts of star formation SFR_10/SFR_100≥1, with elevated &amp;Sigma;_SFR and low M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M_dyn. This links high gas surface densities to increased outflow incidence and lower M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M_dyn. With moderate outflow velocities (v_flow ~(km~s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)=150-250) and mass outflow rates (M&amp;#775;_flow/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1=0.2-5), these high-redshift galaxies appear more efficient at removing baryons than low-redshift galaxies with similar M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;, showing mass loading-factors of M&amp;#775;_flow/SFR=0.04-0.4. For their given dynamical mass, the outflow velocities exceed the escape velocities, meaning that they may eventually enrich the Circumgalactic Medium.

We conduct the first systematic survey of a total of eleven optical coronal lines in the spectra of a large sample of low redshift (z &amp;lt; 0.8) Type 1 quasars observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that strong coronal line emission is rare in SDSS even in Type 1 quasars; only 885 out of 19,508 (4.5%) galaxies show at least one coronal line, with higher ionization potential lines (&amp;gt;100eV) being even rarer. The [Ne V] &amp;lambda;3426 line, which constitutes the majority of detections, is strongly correlated with the bolometric luminosity. These findings suggest that the optical coronal lines are significantly suppressed in the majority of local AGNs, possibly as a result of the presence of dust in the emitting regions. We find that the incidence of ionized outflows is significantly higher in coronal line emitters compared with non-coronal line emitters, possibly suggesting that dust destruction in outflows enhances coronal line emission in AGNs. Many coronal lines show line profiles that are broader than those of narrow lines, and are blue-shifted relative the lower ionization potential lines, suggesting outflows in the highly ionized gas. Given the limited number of detections, we do not find any statistically significant trends of detection statistics, or line ratios with black hole mass, Eddington ratio, or AGN bolometric luminosity. The catalog is publicly available and can provide a useful database of the coronal line properties of low redshift quasars that can be compared to the growing number of high-z AGNs discovered by JWST.

Globular clusters (GCs) are among the oldest and most luminous stellar systems in the Universe, offering unique insights into galaxy formation and evolution. While the physical processes behind their origin have long remained elusive, major theoretical and observational developments in the past decade have led to a new understanding of GCs as the natural outcome of high-pressure star formation in high-redshift galaxies. This review synthesizes recent advancements in our understanding of GC formation and aims to provide a comprehensive point of reference for leveraging the revolutionary capabilities of the current and upcoming generation of telescopes. The latest generation of GC models combine our understanding of their formation and destruction with advanced galaxy formation simulations. The next decade will provide the first-ever opportunity to test such models across their full evolutionary history, from GC formation at high redshift as seen with the James Webb Telescope, to snapshots of GC demographics at intermediate redshifts obtained with 30m-class telescopes, and eventually to the well-characterized GC populations observed at the present day. We identify the major questions that we should expect to address this way.

&lt;p&gt;
The bursty, time-variable nature of star formation in the first billion years, as revealed by JWST, drives phases of temporary quiescence in low-mass galaxies that quench after starbursts. These galaxies provide unique probes of the burstiness of early star formation and its underlying physical processes. Using the SERRA cosmological zoom-in simulations, we analyze over 200 galaxies with M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;10^9.5M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; at z~ 6-8, finding that most experience quiescent phases driven by stellar feedback, with minimal influence from environmental effects. The fraction of temporarily quiescent galaxies increases with decreasing mass and luminosity, representing the dominant population at M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;10^8M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and M_UV&amp;gt;-17. By forward modeling their spectral energy distributions, we show that they are faint (&amp;langle; M_UV&amp;rangle; = -15.6 for M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;=10^8M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;), have strong Balmer breaks (&amp;gt; 0.5) and no emission lines. Comparing our predicted fractions with JWST results, we find similar luminosity-dependent trends; however, the observed fractions of temporarily quiescent galaxies at M_UV~-20 to -19 are higher, suggesting that stronger feedback or additional mechanisms beyond supernovae may be at play. We propose searching for F200W drop-outs and satellites in the proximity (&amp;lt;5^&amp;Prime;) of massive (&amp;gt;10^10M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) galaxies as effective strategies to uncover the hidden majority of faint (M_UV&amp;gt;-17), temporarily quiescent systems, crucial for constraining early feedback processes in low-mass galaxies.

We present a study of new 7.7-11.3 &amp;mu;m data obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope Mid-InfraRed Instrument in the starburst galaxy M 82. In particular, we focus on the dependency of the integrated CO(1-0) line intensity on the MIRI-F770W and MIRI-F1130W filter intensities to investigate the correlation between CO content and the 7.7 and 11.3 &amp;mu;m features from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in M 82's outflows. To perform our analysis, we identify CO clouds using archival ^12CO(J=1-0) NOEMA moment 0 map within 2 kpc from the center of M 82, with sizes ranging between ~21 and 270 pc; then, we compute the CO-to-PAH relations for the 306 validated CO clouds. On average, the power-law slopes for the two relations in M 82 are lower than what is seen in local main-sequence spirals. In addition, there is a moderate correlation between I_CO(1-0)-I_7.7&amp;mu; m /I_11.3&amp;mu; m for most of the CO cloud groups analyzed in this work. Our results suggest that the extreme conditions in M 82 translate into CO not tracing the full budget of molecular gas in smaller clouds, perhaps as a consequence of photoionization and/or emission suppression of CO molecules due to hard radiation fields from the central starburst.

&lt;p&gt;
We analyze 23 spectroscopically confirmed Type-2 quasars (QSOs) selected from the WISE 22&amp;mu;m band in the SDSS Stripe 82 region, focusing on their multi-band photometry and spectral energy distributions (SEDs). These objects were selected to be IR-luminous (flux_W4 &amp;gt; 5mJy, i.e., 12.62 &amp;lt; W4 &amp;lt; 14.62  AB   magnitude), optically faint (r &amp;gt; 23) or with red color (r - W4 &amp;gt;8.38). Gemini/GNIRS observations were conducted for all 24 candidates, and 18/24 were also observed with Keck/LRIS. The observations confirm 23 to be real Type-2 QSOs in the redshift range 0.88 - 2.99 (12 are at z&amp;gt;2). We collect multi-band photometry and conduct SED fitting. The composite photometry probes the wavelength from 0.1&amp;mu;m to 10&amp;mu;m at the rest frame. The IR emission is dominated by dust torus implying an average torus luminosity for the sample of L_torus 10^46.84 erg/s. The origin of the rest-UV/optical light is not definitive, but we present three possible scenarios: scattered light, stellar emission, and the reddened accretion disk. Assuming an obscured:unobscured ratio of approximately 1:1, our targets have L_bol = 10^46.28 erg  s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; - 10^47.49 erg  s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and around SMBH masses 10^8.18 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; - 10^9.39 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, assuming they accreate at the Eddington limit. Compared to previous Type-2 AGN SEDs, our targets have a brighter dust torus and redder optical-IR color. By comparing the SED to the results from JWST `little red dots' (LRDs), we find that these IR-selected Type-2 QSOs have similar SED shapes to the LRDs. This pilot Type-2 QSO survey demonstrates that mid-IR selection is an efficient way to find luminous Type-2 QSOs at z&amp;gt;2. Finally, the composite photometry and Type-2 QSOs SED model generated by this sample provide a guide for finding more Type-2 QSOs at higher redshift.

&lt;p&gt;
The Lyman Alpha damping wing is seen in absorption against the spectra of high-redshift galaxies. Modeling of this wing is a way to measure the volume neutral hydrogen fraction of the Universe, as well as to measure the strength of HI absorption in the form of a damped Ly&amp;alpha; absorber (DLA). We use very high-quality ultraviolet spectra of low-z galaxies to create mock high-redshift, low-resolution spectra complete with a damping wing resulting from the IGM and HI absorption from local, dense gas to mimic current James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of the early universe. The simulated spectra are used to test the ability to recover the "true" values of the column density of the DLA (N_DLA) and the volume neutral hydrogen fraction (x_HI) of the IGM through modified stellar continuum fitting. We find that the ability to recover the true values of N_DLA and x_HI simultaneously is compromised by degeneracies between these two parameters, and the spectral shape itself at low-resolution (R~100). The root mean squared error between the recovered and true column density of the DLAs is on the order of 1 dex. This error somewhat decreases with improved resolution (R~1000), but systematically underestimates N_DLA when Ly&amp;alpha; emission is present in the mock spectra. The recovered values of x_HI are poorly constrained and do not improve substantially with the higher resolution. We recommend accounting for these sources of uncertainty and biases when using galaxies' Ly&amp;alpha; damping wings to measure the intergalactic neutral hydrogen fraction.

&lt;p&gt;
Recent observations from JWST have revealed an abundant population of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and so-called "Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) at 2≲ z ≲ 11, many of which are characterized by V-shaped UV-to-optical continua with turnovers around the Balmer limit. The physical nature of these LRDs is unclear, and it remains debated whether the peculiar spectral shape originates from AGN, compact galaxies, or both. We present the analysis of new NIRSpec-IFU data from the BlackTHUNDER JWST Large Programme and archival NIRSpec-MSA data of a lensed LRD at z=7.04. The spectra confirm the presence of a smooth Balmer break and a broad H&amp;beta; tracing the Broad Line Region (BLR) of an AGN. The small velocity dispersion of the H&amp;beta; narrow component indicates a small dynamical mass of the host galaxy of M_dyn&amp;lt;4 × 10^8~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, which implies that the stellar population cannot contribute more than 10% to the optical continuum. We show that the Balmer break can be well described by an AGN continuum absorbed by very dense (n_H~ 10^10~cm^-3) and nearly dust-free gas along our line-of-sight (possibly gas in the BLR or its surrounding). The same gas is expected to produce H&amp;beta; absorption, at a level consistent with a tentative detection (3&amp;sigma;) in the high-resolution spectrum. Such a non-stellar origin of the Balmer break may apply to other LRDs, and would alleviate the issue of extremely high stellar mass surface densities inferred in the case of a stellar interpretation of the Balmer break. We note that this is a rare case of a black hole that is overmassive relative to both the host galaxy stellar and dynamical masses. We finally report indications of variability and the first attempt of AGN reverberation mapping at such an early epoch.

&lt;p&gt;
X-ray observations of the optically selected z=6.025 QSO CFHQS J164121+375520 (hereafter J1641) revealed that its flux dropped by a factor ≳7 from 2018, when it was a bright and soft X-ray source, to 2021. Such a strong variability amplitude has not been observed before among z&amp;gt;6 QSOs, and the underlying physical mechanism was unclear. We carried out a new X-ray and rest-frame UV monitoring campaign of J1641 over 2022-2024. We detected J1641 with Chandra in the 2-7 keV band, while no significant emission is detected at softer X-ray energies, making J1641 an X-ray changing look QSO at z&amp;gt;6. Comparing with the 2018 epoch, the 0.5-2 keV flux dropped dramatically by a factor &amp;gt;20. We ascribe this behaviour to intervening, and still ongoing, obscuration by Compton-thick gas intercepting our line of sight between 2018 and 2021. The screening material could be an inner disk or a failed nuclear wind that increased their thickness. Another possibility is that we have witnessed an occultation event due to dust-free clouds located at sub-pc/pc scales, similar to those recently invoked to explain the remarkable X-ray weakness of AGN discovered by JWST. These interpretations are also consistent with the lack of strong variations of the QSO rest-frame UV lightcurve over the same period. Future monitoring of J1641 and the possible discovery of other X-ray changing look QSOs at z&amp;gt;6 will provide us with precious information about the physics of rapid supermassive black-hole growth at high redshift.

&lt;p&gt;
Context. The UVJ color-color diagram is a widely used diagnostic to separate star-forming and quiescent galaxies. Observational data from photometric surveys reveal a strong stellar mass trend, with higher-mass star-forming galaxies being systematically more dust-reddened. Aims. We analyze the UVJ diagram in the TNG100 cosmological simulation at cosmic noon (z≈2). Specifically, we focus on the trend between UVJ colors and mass which has not been reproduced in any cosmological simulation thus far. Methods. We applied the SKIRT dust radiative transfer code to the TNG100 simulation to generate rest-frame UVJ fluxes. These UVJ colors were then compared to observational data from several well-studied extragalactic fields from the CANDELS/3D-HST programs, augmented by recent JWST/NIRCam photometry. Results. Quiescent and low-mass (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;≲10^10.5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) galaxies at cosmic noon do not require significant levels of dust reddening, as opposed to massive (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;≳10^11 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) star-forming galaxies. An extensive range of possible dust models fall short of the required dust reddening in V-J color for massive star-forming galaxies, with the simulated galaxies being too blue by ≈0.9 mag. Conclusions. We find that only variations in the star-to-dust geometries of the simulated galaxies can yield V-J colors that are red enough to match the observations. A toy model with isolated dust screens around younger stellar populations (with ages below ~1 Gyr) can reproduce the observational data, while all conventional dust radiative transfer models (where the dust distribution follows the metals in the interstellar medium) fail to achieve the required V-J colors.

Detecting the first generation of stars, Population III (PopIII), has been a long-standing goal in astrophysics, yet they remain elusive even in the JWST era. Here we present a novel NIRCam-based selection method for PopIII galaxies, and carefully validate it through completeness and contamination simulations. We systematically search ~500 arcmin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; across JWST legacy fields for PopIII candidates, including GLIMPSE which, assisted by gravitational lensing, has produced JWST's deepest NIRCam imaging thus far. We discover one promising PopIII galaxy candidate (GLIMPSE-16043) at z=6.50^+0.03_-0.24, a moderately lensed galaxy (mu=2.9) with an intrinsic UV magnitude of M_UV=-15.89. It exhibits key PopIII features: strong H&amp;alpha; emission (rest-frame EW 2810±550&amp;#8491;); a Balmer jump; no dust (UV slope &amp;beta;=-2.34±0.36); and undetectable metal lines (e.g., [OIII]; [OIII]/H&amp;beta;&amp;lt;0.44) implying a gas-phase metallicity of Zgas/Zsun&amp;lt;0.5%. These properties indicate the presence of a nascent, metal-deficient young stellar population (&amp;lt;5Myr) with a stellar mass of ≃10^5M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. Intriguingly, this source deviates significantly from the extrapolated UV-metallicity relation derived from recent JWST observations at z=4-10, consistent with UV enhancement by a top-heavy PopIII initial mass function or the presence of an extremely metal-poor AGN. We also derive the first observational constraints on the PopIII UV luminosity function at z~6-7. The volume density of GLIMPSE-16043 (≈10^-4 cMpc^-3) is in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions, independently reinforcing its plausibility. This study demonstrates the power of our novel NIRCam method to finally reveal distant galaxies even more pristine than the Milky Way's most metal-poor satellites, thereby promising to bring us closer to the first generation of stars than we have ever been before.

We present an analysis of the rest-frame optical (&amp;lambda; ≃ 3100-5600  &amp;#8491;) spectrum of a log_10(M_*/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) = 8.6 star-forming galaxy at z=8.271 (EXCELS-63107) from JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution observations taken as part of the EXCELS survey. EXCELS-63107 is a compact object consistent with the size of local star-forming cluster complexes (r_e &amp;lt; 200   pc) and has an extremely steep UV continuum measured from JWST/NIRCam photometry (&amp;beta;=-3.3±0.3). The JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectrum of EXCELS-63107 is notable for its strong [OIII]&amp;lambda;4363 auroral-line emission relative to the [OIII]&amp;lambda;5007 forbidden line. Via a detailed emission-line and photoionization-modelling analysis, we find that the the observed properties of EXCELS-63107 are consistent with the presence of an ionizing source with an effective temperature of T_eff ≳ 80   000 K heating ionized gas with a density of n_e &amp;lt; 10^4   cm^-3 to a volume-averaged electron temperature of T_e ≃ 34   000 K. Crucially, we find that stellar population models assuming a standard IMF are not capable of producing the required heating. We determine an oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H)= 6.89^+0.26_-0.21 which is one of the lowest directly constrained oxygen abundances measured in any galaxy to date, and ≃ 10 × lower than is typical for z≃8 galaxies with the same stellar mass. The extremely low metallicity of EXCELS-63107 places it in a regime in which theoretical models expect a transition to a top-heavy IMF, and we speculate that a ≃ 10-30   × excess of M &amp;gt; 50   M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; stars is one plausible explanation for its observed properties. However, more exotic scenarios, such as Pop III star formation within a mildly enriched halo, are also consistent with the observations.

We investigate the behavior of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters (GCs) using photometric diagrams constructed with Euclid photometry. By employing synthetic spectra and isochrones that incorporate the chemical differences between first-population (1P) stars, resembling field stars, and second-population (2P) stars, enriched in helium and nitrogen but depleted in carbon and oxygen, we identify, from a theoretical perspective, the color-magnitude diagrams and the chromosome maps most effective at distinguishing these populations within GCs. Euclid photometry proves to be a powerful tool for identifying multiple populations among M-dwarfs, as 1P and 2P stars form distinct sequences in well-chosen photometric diagrams, driven by differences in the strength of oxygen-based molecular features, such as water vapor. To validate our theoretical findings, we analyzed Euclid photometry and astrometry of the GC NGC 6397, complemented by photometric and astrometric data from the Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope, enabling a comprehensive study of its stellar populations across a wide field of view. We find that the 1P constitutes about 30% of the M-dwarfs in NGC 6397, with the fraction of 1P stars remaining consistent across different stellar masses and throughout the entire field of view. 2P stars exhibit an [O/Fe] depletion of about 0.3 dex relative to 1P stars, and both populations display isotropic proper motions. This study represents the first comprehensive analysis of multiple populations among M-dwarfs across a wide field of view, demonstrating that Euclid photometry is a powerful instrument for investigating multiple populations in GCs.

&lt;p&gt;
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently conducted observations of massive galaxies at high redshifts, revealing a notable anomaly in their star formation efficiency (SFE). Motivated by the recent identification of three ~ 10^6M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; dark star candidates, we investigate whether dark stars can be the origin of the SFE excess. It turns out that the excess can be reproduced by a group of dark stars with M ≳ 10^3  M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, because of their domination in generating primary UV radiation in high-redshift galaxies. The genesis of these dark stars is attributed to the capture of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) within a mass range of tens of GeV to a few TeV. However, if the top-heavy initial mass function of dark stars holds up to ~ 10^5M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, the relic black holes stemming from their collapse would be too abundant to be consistent with the current observations of Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). We thus suggest that just a small fraction of SFE excess may be contributed by the very massive dark stars and the majority likely originated from other reasons such as the Population III stars in view of their rather similar UV radiation efficiencies.

The formation time scales of quiescent galaxies can be estimated in two different ways: by their star formation history and by their chemistry. Previously, the methods yielded conflicting results, especially when considering &amp;alpha;-enhanced objects. This is primarily due to the time resolution limitations of very old stellar populations, which prevent accurately constraining their star formation histories. We analysed the JWST observations of the extremely massive galaxy ZF-UDS-7329 at z~3.2 and show that the higher time resolution necessary to match the chemical formation time scales using stellar population synthesis can be achieved by studying galaxies at high redshift. We compare the massive galaxy to the well-known relic galaxy NGC~1277, arguing that ZF-UDS-7329 is an early Universe example of the cores of present-day massive elliptical galaxies or, if left untouched, a relic galaxy.

We present the statistical properties of Ly&amp;alpha; emission in 586 galaxies at z=4.5-14.2, observed by multiple JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy projects, including JADES, GLASS, CEERS, and GO/DDT programs. We obtain Ly&amp;alpha; equivalent width (EW), Ly&amp;alpha; escape fraction, and ionizing photon production efficiency measurements or upper limits for these galaxies, and confirm that the Ly&amp;alpha; emitting galaxy fraction decreases towards higher redshifts. We derive Ly&amp;alpha; luminosity functions from z~ 5 to z~ 10-14 with the observed Ly&amp;alpha; EW distributions and galaxy UV luminosity functions, and find a ~3 dex decrease in number density at L_Ly&amp;alpha;=10^42-10^43 erg s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; over the redshift range. Notably, this study presents the first constraints on the Ly&amp;alpha; luminosity function at z~ 8-14. We obtain the neutral hydrogen fractions of x_HI=0.17_-0.16^+0.23, 0.63_-0.28^+0.18, 0.79_-0.21^+0.13, and 0.88_-0.13^+0.11 at z~6, 7, 8-9, and 10-14, respectively, via comparisons of the reionization models developed by semi-numerical simulations with 21cmFAST explaining the observations of Ly&amp;alpha;, UV continuum, and Planck electron optical depth. The high x_HI values over z~ 7-14 suggest a late and sharp reionization, with the primary reionization process occurring at z~ 6-7. Such a late and sharp reionization is not easily explained by either a clumpy inter-galactic medium or sources of reionization in a classical faint-galaxy or a bright-galaxy/AGN scenario, unless a very high escape fraction or AGN duty cycle is assumed at z~ 6-7.

Transient astronomy in the early, high-redshift (z &amp;gt; 3) Universe is an unexplored regime that offers the possibility of probing the first stars and the Epoch of Reionization. During Cycles 1 and 2 of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program enabled one of the first searches for transients in deep images (~30 AB mag) over a relatively wide area (25 arcmin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). One transient, AT 2023adsv, was discovered with an F200W magnitude of 28.04 AB mag, and subsequent JWST observations revealed that the transient is a likely supernova (SN) in a host with z&lt;sub&gt;spec&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.613 +/- 0.001 and an inferred metallicity at the position of the SN of Z_* = 0.3 +/- 0.1 Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. At this redshift, the first detections in F115W and F150W show that AT 2023adsv had bright rest-frame ultraviolet flux at the time of discovery. The multi-band light curve of AT 2023adsv is best matched by a template of an SN IIP with a peak absolute magnitude of M_B ~ -18.3 AB mag. We find a good match to a 20 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; red supergiant progenitor star with an explosion energy of 2.0x10^51 ergs, likely higher than normally observed in the local Universe, but consistent with SNe IIP drawn from local, lower metallicity environments. AT 2023adsv is the most distant photometrically classified SN IIP yet discovered with a spectroscopic redshift measurement, and may represent a global shift in SNe IIP properties as a function of redshift.

&lt;p&gt;
The extended narrow line region (NLR) of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) provides a valuable laboratory for exploring the relationship between AGN and their host galaxies, often appearing as an "ionization cone" that can extend out to the very edge of the galaxy. We use new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam imaging to study the morphologies and sizes of NLRs traced by [O III] at cosmic noon (z~2-3). To determine NIRCam's ability to probe the properties of the NLR in cosmic noon galaxies, we present simulated images of AGN at z=2-3 created with archival data cubes from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) of nine nearby (z&amp;lt;0.05) AGN host galaxies with previously confirmed extended NLRs. Our simulated images show that NIRCam is able to resolve the morphologies of NLRs at z=2-3 with narrow- and medium-band observations. We then search for extended NLRs with NIRCam medium-band observations targeting the [O III]+H&amp;beta; emission in twenty-seven previously identified AGN at z=2.4-3.4 in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey South (GOODS-S) field. We detect six galaxies in our observed sample with [O III]+H&amp;beta; morphologies consistent with AGN ionization cones with characteristic NLR sizes of 1-2.5 kpc. Thanks to our simulated data, we can predict the effects of cosmological surface brightness dimming and instrument noise on the NLR size measurements at high redshift, which has the biasing effect of lowering the NLR size-AGN luminosity trend that is observed at low redshift by a factor of ~ 2.

We present a structural analysis of 521 galaxy candidates at 6.5 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 12.5, with SNR &amp;gt; 10&amp;sigma; in the F444W filter, taken from the EPOCHS v1 sample, consisting of uniformly reduced deep JWST NIRCam data, covering the CEERS, JADES GOOD-S, NGDEEP, SMACS0723, GLASS and PEARLS surveys. We use standard software to fit single S\'ersic models to each galaxy in the rest-frame optical and extract their parametric structural parameters (S\'ersic index, half-light radius and axis-ratio), and ttMorfometryka to measure their non-parametric concentration and asymmetry parameters. We find a wide range of sizes for these early galaxies, but with a strong galaxy-size mass correlation up to z ~ 12 such that galaxy sizes continue to get progressively smaller in the high-redshift regime, following R_e = 2.74 ± 0.49 ≤ft( 1 + z ) ^-0.79 ± 0.08 kpc. Using non-parametric methods we find that galaxy merger fractions, classified through asymmetry parameters, at these redshifts remain consistent with those in literature, maintaining a value of f_m ~ 0.12 ± 0.07 showing little dependence with redshift when combined with literature at z &amp;gt; 4. We find that galaxies which are smaller in size also appear rounder, with an excess of high axis-ratio objects. Finally, we artificially redshift a subsample of our objects to determine how robust the observational trends we see are, determining that observed trends are due to real evolutionary effects, rather than being a consequence of redshift effects.

Merger events are thought to be an important phase in the assembly of massive galaxies. At the same time, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) play a fundamental role in the evolution of their star formation histories. Both phenomena can be observed at work in NGC 6240, a local prototypical merger, classified as an UltraLuminous InfraRed Galaxy (ULIRG) thanks to its elevated infrared luminosity. Interestingly, NGC 6240 hosts two AGN separated by 1.5''(~ 735 pc), detected in both X-ray and radio band. Taking advantage of the unprecedented sensitivity and wavelength coverage provided by the Integral Field Unit (IFU) of the NIRSpec instrument onboard JWST, we observed the nuclear region of NGC 6240 in a FoV of 3.7'' x 3.7''(1.9 x 1.9 kpc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), to investigate gas kinematics and InterStellar Medium (ISM) properties with a high spatial resolution of ~ 0.1'' (or ~ 50 pc). We separated the different gas kinematic components through multi-Gaussian fitting and studied the excitation properties of the ISM from the NIR diagnostic diagram based on the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 1-0 S(1)/BrGamma and [Fe II]1.257micron/PaBeta lines ratios. We isolated the ionization cones of the two nuclei, and detected coronal lines emission from both of them. Using H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; line ratios, we found that the molecular hydrogen gas is excited mostly by thermal processes. We computed a hot molecular gas mass of 1.3 x 10^5 M_sun and an ionized gas mass in the range of 10^5 - 10^7 M_sun. We studied with unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity the kinematics of the molecular and ionized gas phases. We revealed the complex structure of the molecular gas and found a blueshifted outflow near the Southern nucleus, together with filaments connecting a highly redshifted H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cloud with the two nuclei. We speculate on the possible nature of this H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cloud and propose two possible scenarios: either outflowing gas, or a tidal cloud falling onto the nuclei.

We report the discovery of an ultra-massive grand-design red spiral galaxy, named Zh\'ul\'ong (Torch Dragon), at z&lt;sub&gt;phot&lt;/sub&gt; = 5.2^+0.3_-0.2 in the JWST PANORAMIC survey, identified as the most distant bulge+disk galaxy candidate with spiral arms known to date. Zh\'ul\'ong displays an extraordinary combination of properties: 1) a classical bulge centered in a large, face-on exponential stellar disk (half-light radius of R_e = 3.7 ± 0.1   kpc), with spiral arms extending across 19 kpc; 2) a clear transition from the red, quiescent core (F150W-F444W=3.1 mag) with high stellar mass surface density (log(&amp;Sigma; M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;   kpc^-2) = 9.91_-0.09^+0.11) to the star-forming outer regions, as revealed by spatially resolved SED analysis, which indicates significant inside-out galaxy growth; 3) an extremely high stellar mass at its redshift, with log (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;)=11.03_-0.08^+0.10 comparable to the Milky Way, and an implied baryon-to-star conversion efficiency (&amp;epsilon; ~ 0.3) that is 1.5 times higher than even the most efficient galaxies at later epochs; 4) despite an active disk, a relatively modest overall star formation rate (SFR =66_-46^+89 ~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;   yr^-1), which is &amp;gt;0.5 dex below the star formation main sequence at z ~ 5.2 and &amp;gt;10 times lower than ultra-massive dusty galaxies at z=5-6. Altogether, Zh\'ul\'ong shows that mature galaxies emerged much earlier than expected in the first billion years after the Big Bang through rapid galaxy formation and morphological evolution. Our finding offers key constraints for models of massive galaxy formation and the origin of spiral structures in the early universe.

The majority of most luminous quasars during the epoch of reionization accrete near or above the Eddington limit, marking the vigorous growth of primitive supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, their subsequent evolution and environmental impact remain poorly characterized. We present JWST/NIRSpec prism IFU observations of HSC J2239+0207, a low-luminosity quasar at z~6.25 likely in a late stage of mass assembly with an overmassive SMBH relative to its host galaxy. Using H&amp;beta; and H&amp;alpha; broad emission lines, we estimate an SMBH mass M_BH~3×10^8~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and confirm its sub-Eddington accretion at &amp;lambda;_Edd~0.4. Strong FeII emission and a proximity zone of typical size suggest a metal-rich, highly evolved system. In the far-UV, this quasar presents strong broad-absorption-line features, indicative of high-velocity winds (&amp;nu;~10^4~km/s). Meanwhile, minimal dust reddening is inferred from the quasar continuum and broad-line Balmer decrement, suggesting little dust along the polar direction. Most interestingly, we identify a gas companion ~5 kpc from the quasar with a high [OIII]/H&amp;beta; ratio (≳10), likely representing outflowing gas blown away by AGN feedback. These results highlight HSC J2239+0207 as a likely fading quasar in transition, providing rare insights into SMBH evolution, AGN feedback, and AGN-galaxy interactions in the early Universe.

Morphological classification of galaxies becomes increasingly challenging with redshift. We apply a hybrid supervised-unsupervised method to classify ~ 14,000 galaxies in the CANDELS fields at 0.2 ≤ z ≤ 2.4 into spheroid, disk, and irregular systems. Unlike previous works, our method is applied to redshift bins of width 0.2. Comparison between models applied to a wide redshift range versus bin-specific models reveals significant differences in galaxy morphology beyond z ≥ 1 and a consistent ~ 25&amp;percnt; disagreement. This suggests that using a single model across wide redshift ranges may introduce biases due to the large time intervals involved compared to galaxy evolution timescales. Using the FERENGI code to assess the impact of cosmological effects, we find that flux dimming and smaller angular scales may lead to the misclassification of up to 18&amp;percnt; of disk galaxies as spheroids or irregulars. Contrary to previous studies, we find an almost constant fraction of disks (~ 60&amp;percnt;) and spheroids (~ 30&amp;percnt;) across redshifts. We attribute discrepancies with earlier works, which suggest a decreasing fraction of disks beyond z ~ 1, to the biases introduced by visual classification. Our claim is further strengthened by the striking agreement to the results reported by Lee et al. (2024) using an objective, unsupervised method applied to James Webb Space Telescope data. Exploring mass dependence, we observe a ~ 40&amp;percnt; increase in the fraction of massive (M_stellar ≥ 10^10.5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) spheroids with decreasing redshift, well balanced with a decrease of ~ 20&amp;percnt; in the fraction of M_stellar ≥ 10^10.5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; disks, suggesting that merging massive disk galaxies may form spheroidal systems.

Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations have unveiled that the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) were in place at z ≥ 10, a few hundred Myrs after the Big Bang. These discoveries are providing strong constraints on the seeding of BHs and the nature of the first objects in the Universe. Here, we study the impact of the freeze-out electron fractions (f_e) at the end of the epoch of cosmic recombination on the formation of the first structures in the Universe. At f_e below the current fiducial cosmic values of ~ 10^-4, the baryonic collapse is delayed due to the lack of molecular hydrogen cooling until the host halo masses are increased by one to two orders of magnitude compared to the standard case and reach the atomic cooling limit. This results in an enhanced enclosed gas mass by more than an order of magnitude and higher inflow rates of up to 0.1~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;/yr. Such conditions are conducive to the formation of massive seed BHs with ~ 10^4 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. Our results reveal a new pathway for the formation of massive BH seeds which may naturally arise from free

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed an unexpectedly high abundance of UV luminous galaxies at redshifts z≳ 10, challenging `standard' galaxy formation models. This study investigates the role of rapidly rotating (massive) stars undergoing chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) in reconciling this potential tension. These stars are more compact, hotter, and exhibit enhanced UV emission. We find that the rest-frame UV luminosity of star-forming galaxies can be significantly enhanced by a factor of ~ 3-6 when CHE stars above a minimum initial mass of m&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;,\min^CHE~ 2-10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; account for more than half of the total stellar mass following a Salpeter initial mass function. As a result, the UV luminosity functions observed at z~ 12-16 can be reproduced with less extreme values of star formation efficiency and UV luminosity stochastic variability. Our results highlight the potential of CHE in explaining the UV-bright galaxy populations detected by JWST and call for future work to explore the broader astrophysical implications of CHE and its associated phenomena in the early universe, such as gamma-ray bursts, compact object binaries, and metal enrichment.

We use the star formation rate-stellar mass relation (SFR - M_ * ) of galaxies to measure their luminosity distances as well as estimate cosmological parameters. We compile a sample of 341 high-redshift galaxies at 5 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 14 and an additional 51 galaxies at 1.8 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 3.5 from the JWST observations, which can be used to investigate the correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass, and determine their cosmological distance. The relation SFR &amp;prop;  1pt (M_ * /M_ &amp;odot; )^&amp;gamma;  can be applied to check the nonlinear correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass M_ *  of galaxies and give their distance. Additionally, it also can be used to test if the SFR - M_ *  relation depends on redshift, and the data suggest that the SFR is positively correlated with stellar mass, the SFR - M_ *  relation of the high-redshift galaxies has a redshift dependence. Finally, we combine the galaxy sample with Type Ia supernova (SNIa) data from the Pantheon compilation to test the property of dark energy, specifically addressing whether its density deviates from the constant, and give the statistical analysis results.

Recent findings from photometric and spectroscopic JWST surveys have identified examples of high-redshift galaxies at z ≳ 10. These high-z galaxies appear to form much earlier and exhibit greater UV luminosity than predicted by theoretical work. In this study, our goal is to reproduce the brightness of these sources by simulating high-redshift galaxies with virial masses M_vir = 10^9 - 10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; at z &amp;gt; 10. To achieve this, we conduct cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations, modifying baryonic sub-grid physics, and post-process our simulation results to confirm the observability of our simulated galaxies. Specifically, we enhanced star formation activity in high-redshift galaxies by either increasing the star formation efficiency up to 100&amp;percnt; or adopting a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF). Our simulation results indicate that both increasing star formation efficiency and adopting a top-heavy IMF play crucial roles in boosting the UV luminosity of high-redshift galaxies, potentially exceeding the limiting magnitude of JWST surveys in earlier epochs. Especially, the episodic starburst resulting from enhanced star formation efficiency may explain the high-redshift galaxies observed by JWST, as it evacuates dust from star-forming regions, making the galaxies more observable. We demonstrate this correlation between star formation activity and dust mass evolution within the simulated galaxies. Also, adopting a top-heavy IMF could enhance observability due to an overabundance of massive stars, although it may also facilitate rapid metal enrichment. Using our simulation results, we derive several observables such as effective radius, UV slope, and emission line rates, which could serve as valuable theoretical estimates for comparison with existing spectroscopic results and forthcoming data from the JWST NIRSpec and MIRI instruments.

We present a catalog of 34 new candidate (13 high confidence) isolated, young stellar systems within the Virgo galaxy cluster identified through a citizen science search of public optical and ultraviolet imaging. "Blue blobs" are a class of blue, faint, isolated, extremely low stellar mass, and metal-rich star-forming clouds embedded in the hot intracluster medium of the Virgo cluster. Only six blue blobs were known previously and here we confirm an additional six of our candidates through velocity and metallicity measurements from follow-up optical spectroscopy on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET). Our 13 high confidence candidates (including the six confirmed) have properties consistent with prior known blue blobs and are inconsistent with being low-mass galaxies. Most candidates are concentrated in relatively dense regions, roughly following filamentary structures within the cluster, but avoiding its center. Three of our candidates are likely the stellar counterparts of known 'optically dark' clouds of neutral hydrogen in the cluster, while a further four are widely separated extensions to previously known blue blobs. The properties of our new candidates are consistent with previous conclusions that blue blobs likely originated from ram pressure stripping events, however, their locations in velocity&amp;ndash;projected cluster-centric radius phase-space imply that their parent galaxies are not on their first infall into the cluster. Through our ongoing follow-up program with HET we aim to confirm additional candidates, however, detailed understanding of the stellar populations and star formation histories of blue blobs will require JWST observations.

We report the discovery of two galaxy candidates at redshifts between 15.7&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;16.4 in JWST observations from the GLIMPSE survey. These robust sources were identified using a combination of Lyman-break selection and photometric redshift estimates. The ultra-deep NIRCam imaging from GLIMPSE, combined with the strong gravitational lensing of the Abell S1063 galaxy cluster, allows us to probe an intrinsically fainter population (down to M_UV =-17.0 mag) than previously achievable. These galaxies have absolute magnitudes ranging from M_UV = -17.0 to -17.2 mag, with blue (&amp;beta; ≃ -2.87) UV continuum slopes, consistent with young, dust-free stellar populations. The number density of these objects, log_10(&amp;phi;/[Mpc^-3 mag^-1])=-3.47^+0.13_-0.10 at M_UV=-17 is in clear tension with pre-JWST theoretical predictions, extending the over-abundance of galaxies from z~10 to z~ 17. These results, together with the scarcity of brighter galaxies in other public surveys, suggest a steep decline in the bright-end of the UV luminosity function at z ~ 16, implying efficient star formation and possibly a close connection to the halo mass function at these redshifts. Testing a variety of star formation histories suggests that these sources are plausible progenitors of the unusually UV-bright galaxies that JWST now routinely uncovers at z = 10-14. Overall, our results indicate that the luminosity distribution of the earliest star-forming galaxies could be shifting towards fainter luminosities, implying that future surveys of cosmic dawn will need to explore this faint luminosity regime.

We present a novel technique using Fourier series and Laguerre polynomials to represent morphological features of disc galaxies. To demonstrate the utility of this technique, we study the evolution of disc asymmetry in a sample of disc galaxies drawn from the Extended Groth Strip and imaged by the JWST Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey as well as archival HST observations. We measure disc asymmetry as the amplitude of the of the m = 1 Fourier harmonic for galaxies within redshift ranges of 1 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 4 relative to the amplitude of m = 0 harmonic. We show that when viewed in shorter rest frame wavelengths, disc galaxies have a higher asymmetry as the flux is dominated by star forming regions. We find generally low asymmetry at rest frame infrared wavelengths, where our metric tracks asymmetry in morphological features such as bars and spiral arms. We show that higher mass galaxies have lower asymmetry and vice versa. Higher asymmetry in lower mass galaxies comes from lower mass galaxies (typically) having higher star formation rates. We measure the relation between disc galaxy asymmetry and redshift and find no conclusive relationship between them. We demonstrate the utility of the Fourier-Laguerre technique for recovering physically informative asymmetry measurements as compared to rotational asymmetry measurements. We also release the software pipeline and quantitative analysis for each galaxy.

&lt;p&gt;
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is opening new frontiers of transient discovery and follow-up at high-redshift. Here we present the discovery of a spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernova (SN Ia; SN 2023aeax) at z=2.15 with JWST, including a NIRCam multi-band light curve. SN 2023aeax lands at the edge of traditional low-z cosmology cuts because of its blue color (peak rest-frame B-V~-0.3) but with a normal decline rate (&amp;Delta; m_15(B)~1.25), and applying a fiducial standardization with the BayeSN model we find the SN 2023aeax luminosity distance is in ~0.1&amp;sigma; agreement with &amp;Lambda;CDM. SN 2023aeax is only the second spectroscopically confirmed SN Ia in the dark matter-dominated Universe at z&amp;gt;2 (the other is SN 2023adsy), giving it rare leverage to constrain any potential evolution in SN Ia standardized luminosities. Similar to SN 2023adsy (B-V~0.8), SN 2023aeax has a fairly extreme (but opposite) color, which may be due to the small sample size or a secondary factor, such as host galaxy properties. Nevertheless, the SN 2023aeax spectrum is well-represented by normal low-z SN Ia spectra and we find no definitive evolution in SN Ia standardization with redshift. Still, the first two spectroscopically confirmed z&amp;gt;2 SNe Ia have peculiar colors and combine for a ~1&amp;sigma; distance slope relative to &amp;Lambda;CDM, though in agreement with recent SN Ia cosmological measurements.

We present an analysis of eight star-forming galaxies with &amp;langle; z &amp;rangle; = 4.0 from the JWST EXCELS survey for which we obtain robust chemical abundance estimates for the &amp;alpha;-elements O, Ne and Ar. The &amp;alpha;-elements are primarily produced via core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) which should result in &amp;alpha;-element abundance ratios that do not vary significantly across cosmic time. However, Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) models predict an excess production of Ar relative to O and Ne. The Ar/O abundance ratio can therefore be used as a tracer of the relative enrichment of CCSNe and SNe Ia in galaxies. Our sample significantly increases the number of sources with measurements of Ar/O at z &amp;gt; 2, and we find that our sample exhibits sub-solar Ar/O ratios on average, with Ar/O = 0.65 ± 0.10   (Ar/O)&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. In contrast, the average Ne/O abundance is fully consistent with the solar ratio, with Ne/O = 1.07 ± 0.12   (Ne/O)&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. Our results support a scenario in which Ar has not had time to build up in the interstellar medium of young high-redshift galaxies, which are dominated by CCSNe enrichment. We show that these abundance estimates are in good agreement with recent Milky Way chemical evolution models, and with Ar/O trends observed for planetary nebulae in the Andromeda galaxy. These results highlight the potential for using multiple element abundance ratios to constrain the chemical enrichment pathways of early galaxies with JWST.

We determine the spectroscopic properties of ~1000 ostensibly star-forming galaxies at redshifts (z=4-10) using prism spectroscopy from JWST/NIRSpec. With rest-wavelength coverage between Lya and [S II] in the optical, we stack spectra as a function of nebular conditions, and compare UV spectral properties with stellar age. This reveals UV lines of N III], N IV], C III], C IV, He II, and O III] in the average high-z galaxy. All UV lines are more intense in younger starbursts. We measure electron temperatures from the collisionally excited [O III] line ratios, finding Te=18000-22000 K for the O++ regions. We also detect a significant nebular Balmer Jump from which we estimate only Te=8000-13000 K. Accounting for typical temperature offsets between zones bearing doubly and singly ionized oxygen, these two temperatures remain discrepant by around 40%. We use the [O III] temperatures to estimate abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. We find that log(C/O) is consistently ~-1, with no evolution of C/O with metallicity or stellar age. The average spectra are mildly enhanced in Nitrogen, with higher N/O than low-z starbursts, but are less enhanced than samples of high-z galaxies with visible UV N III] and N IV]. Whatever processes produce the N-enhancement in the individual galaxies must also be ongoing, at lower levels, in the median galaxy in the early Universe. The strongest starbursts are a source of significant ionizing emission: ionizing photon production efficiencies reach 10^25.7 Hz/erg, and show multiple signatures of high Lyman continuum escape, including Mg II escape fractions nearing 100%, significant deficits in [S II] emission, high degrees of ionization, and blue UV colors.

&lt;p&gt;
JWST/MIRI images have been used to study the Fourier transform power spectra (PS) of two spiral galaxies, NGC 628 and NGC 5236, and two dwarfs, NGC 4449 and NGC 5068, at distances ranging from 4 to 10 Mpc. The PS slopes on scales larger than 200 pc range from -0.6 at 21 microns to -1.2 at 5.6 microns. These slopes for one-dimensional PS are consistent with the PS slopes observed elsewhere using HI and dust emission. They are likely related to turbulence, but they may also be viewed as a hierarchical distribution of objects having a size-luminosity relation and size distribution function. There is no evidence for a kink or steepening of the PS at some transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional turbulence on the scale of the disk thickness. This lack of a kink could be from large positional variations in the PS depending on two opposite effects: local bright sources that make the slope shallower and exponential galaxy profiles that make the slope steeper. The sources could also be confined to a layer of molecular clouds that is thinner than the HI or cool dust layers where PS kinks have been observed before. If the star formation layers observed in the mid-infrared here are too thin, then the PS kink could also be hidden in the broad tail of the JWST point spread function.

&lt;p&gt;
Galaxy mergers are a key driver of galaxy formation and evolution, including the triggering of AGN and star formation to a still unknown degree. We thus investigate the impact of galaxy mergers on star formation and AGN activity using a sample of 3,330 galaxies at z = [4.5, 8.5] from eight JWST fields (CEERS, JADES GOODS-S, NEP-TDF, NGDEEP, GLASS, El-Gordo, SMACS-0723, and MACS-0416), collectively covering an unmasked area of 189 arcmin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. We focuses on star formation rate (SFR) enhancement, AGN fraction, and AGN excess in major merger (&amp;mu; &amp;gt; 1/4) close-pair samples, defined by &amp;Delta; z &amp;lt; 0.3 and projected separations r_p &amp;lt; 100 kpc, compared to non-merger samples. We find that SFR enhancement occurs only at r_p &amp;lt; 20 kpc, with values of 0.25 ± 0.10 dex and 0.26 ± 0.11 dex above the non-merger medians for z = [4.5, 6.5] and z = [6.5, 8.5]. No other statistically significant enhancements in galaxy sSFR or stellar mass are observed at any projected separation or redshift bin. We also compare our observational results with predictions from the SC-SAM simulation and find no evidence of star formation enhancement in the simulations at any separation range. Finally, we examine the AGN fraction and AGN excess, finding that the fraction of AGNs in AGN-galaxy pairs, relative to the total AGN population, is 3.25^+1.50_-1.06 times greater than the fraction of galaxy pairs relative to the overall galaxy population at the same redshift. We find that nearly all AGNs have a companion within 100 kpc and observe an excess AGN fraction in close-pair samples compared to non-merger samples. This excess is found to be 1.26 ± 0.06 and 1.34 ± 0.06 for AGNs identified via the inferred BPT diagram and photometric SED selection, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;
We combine stellar mass functions and the recent first JWST-based galaxy&amp;ndash;black hole scaling relations at z=6 to for the first time compute the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass volume density at this epoch, and compare this to the integrated SMBH mass growth from the population of UV-luminous quasars at z&amp;gt;6. We show that even under very conservative assumptions almost all growth of supermassive black hole mass at z&amp;gt;6 does not take place in these UV-luminous quasars, but must occur in systems obscured through dust and/or with lower radiative efficiency than standard thin accretion disks. The `Soltan argument' is not fulfilled by the known population of bright quasars at z&amp;gt;6: the integrated SMBH mass growth inferred from these largely unobscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early Universe is by a factor ≥10 smaller than the total black hole mass volume density at z=6. This is valid under a large range of assumption about luminosity and mass functions as well as accretion modes, and is likely still at least a factor &amp;gt;2 smaller when accounting for the known obscuration fractions at this epoch. The resulting consequences are: &amp;gt;90%, possibly substantially more, of SMBH-buildup in the early Universe does not take place in luminous unobscured quasar phases, but has to occur in obscured systems, with dust absorbing most of the emitted UV&amp;ndash;visible AGN emission, potentially with accretion modes with super-Eddington specific accretion rates. This is consistent with short lifetime arguments for luminous quasar phases from quasar proximity zone studies and clustering. This would remove the empirical need for slow SMBH growth and hence exotic `high-mass seed' black holes at early cosmic time. It also predicts a large population of luminous but very obscured lower-mass quasars at z&amp;gt;6, possibly the JWST `Little Red Dots'.

We use JWST/NIRISS slitless spectroscopy from the Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public (NGDEEP) Survey to investigate the physical condition of star-forming galaxies at 1.7 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 3.4. At these redshifts, the deep NGDEEP NIRISS slitless spectroscopy covers the [O II]&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;3726,3729, [O III]&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;4959,5007, H&amp;beta; and H&amp;alpha; emission features for galaxies with stellar masses log(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;ast;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) ≳ 7, nearly a factor of a hundred lower than previous studies. We focus on the [O III]/[O II] (O_32) ratio which is primarily sensitive to the ionization state and with a secondary dependence on the gas-phase metallicity of the interstellar medium. We find significant (≳5&amp;sigma;) correlations between the O_32 ratio and galaxy properties as O_32 increases with decreasing stellar mass, decreasing star formation rate (SFR), increasing specific SFR (sSFR&amp;equiv; SFR/M_*), and increasing equivalent width (EW) of H&amp;beta; and H&amp;alpha;. These trends suggest a tight connection between the ionization parameter and these galaxy properties. Galaxies at z~2-3 exhibit a higher O_32 than local normal galaxies with the same stellar masses and SFRs, indicating that they have a higher ionization parameter and lower metallicity than local normal galaxies. In addition, we observe a mild evolutionary trend in the O_32 &amp;ndash; EW(H&amp;beta;) relation from z~0 to z≳5, where higher redshift galaxies show increased O_32 and EW, with possibly higher O_32 at fixed EW. We argue that both the enhanced recent star formation activity and the higher star formation surface density may contribute to the increase in O_32 and the ionization parameter.

&lt;p&gt;
We present a new analytical model for the attenuation to Epoch of Reionization (EoR) galaxies by proximate neutral hydrogen gas. Many galaxy spectra in the EoR taken by JWST have shown a flux deficit at wavelengths just redward of the Lyman break, and this has been regarded as resulting from Ly&amp;alpha; damping wing absorption by the increasing amount of neutral hydrogen in the line-of-sight. However, previous attenuation models for the intergalactic medium (IGM) commonly used in photometric redshift template-fitting codes assume that the Lyman break is rather sharp, which leads to systematic overestimation of photometric redshifts at z&amp;gt;7. In this letter, we build and empirically calibrate a new attenuation model that takes the increased Ly&amp;alpha; damping wing absorption into account. Our model consists of the canonical IGM absorption and an additional absorption component due to dense neutral hydrogen gas clouds proximate to the galaxy, and we derive the redshift evolution of HI column density of the proximate clouds by calibrating the model using CANUCS JWST observations. The resulting total transmission curve resolves the photometric redshift bias at z&amp;gt;7, an improvement that is robust to choice of template-fitting code, template set, and photometric catalog used. The new attenuation model can be easily implemented in existing template-fitting codes, and significantly improves the photometric redshift performance in the EoR.

&lt;p&gt;
The observed prevalence of galaxies exhibiting bursty star formation histories (SFHs) at z≳6 has created new challenges and opportunities for understanding their formation pathways. The degenerate effects of the efficiency and burstiness of star formation on the observed UV luminosity function are separable by galaxy clustering. However, quantifying the timescales of burstiness requires more than just the continuum UV measurements. Here we develop a flexible semi-analytic framework for modeling both the amplitude of star formation rate (SFR) variations and their temporal correlation, from which the luminosity function and clustering can be derived for SFR indicators tracing different characteristic timescales (e.g., UV continuum and H&amp;alpha; luminosities). Based on this framework, we study the prospect of using galaxy summary statistics to distinguish models where SFR fluctuations are prescribed by different power spectral density (PSD) forms. Using the Fisher matrix approach, we forecast the constraints on parameters in our PSD-based model that can be extracted from mock JWST observations of the UV and H&amp;alpha; luminosity functions and clustering bias factors at z~6. These constraints demonstrate the feasibility of constraining the burstiness of high-z galaxies solely from their one-point and two-point statistics and underscore the importance of combining tracers of both long-term and short-term SFR variations. Our flexible framework can be readily extended to characterize the SFH of high-redshift galaxies with a wider range of observational diagnostics.

&lt;p&gt;
We analyze two galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses, SPT0418-47 and SPT2147-50, using JWST NIRCam imaging across multiple filters. To account for angular complexity in the lens mass distribution, we introduce multipole perturbations with orders m=1, 3, 4. Our results show strong evidence for angular mass complexity in SPT2147, with multipole strengths of 0.3-1.7 &amp;percnt; for m=3, 4 and 2.4-9.5 &amp;percnt; for m=1, while SPT0418 shows no such preference. We also test lens models that include a dark matter substructure, finding a strong preference for a substructure in SPT2147-50 with a Bayes factor (log-evidence change) of ~ 60 when multipoles are not included. Including multipoles reduces the Bayes factor to ~ 11, still corresponding to a 5&amp;sigma; detection of a subhalo with an NFW mass of log_10(M_200/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) = 10.87\substack+0.53\ -0.71. While SPT2147-50 may represent the fourth detection of a dark matter substructure in a strong lens, further analysis is needed to confirm that the signal is not due to systematics associated with the lens mass model.

&lt;p&gt;
We present deep Subaru/FOCAS spectra for two extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) at z~ 1 with strong \sc[Oiii]&amp;lambda;5007 emission lines, exhibiting equivalent widths (EWs) of 2905^+946_-578 &amp;#8491; and 2000^+188_-159 &amp;#8491;, comparable to those of EELGs at high redshifts that are now routinely identified with JWST spectroscopy. Adding a similarly large \sc [Oiii] EW (2508^+1487_-689 &amp;#8491;) EELG found at z~ 2 in the JWST CEERS survey to our sample, we explore for the physical origins of the large \sc [Oiii] EWs of these three galaxies with the Subaru spectra and various public data including JWST/NIRSpec, NIRCam, and MIRI data. While there are no clear signatures of AGN identified by the optical line diagnostics, we find that two out of two galaxies covered by the MIRI data show strong near-infrared excess in the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) indicating obscured AGN. Because none of the three galaxies show clear broad H&amp;beta; lines, the upper limits on the flux ratios of broad-H&amp;beta; to \sc [Oiii] lines are small, ≲ 0.15 that are comparable with Seyfert 1.8-2.0 galaxies. We conduct ttCloudy modeling with the stellar and AGN incident spectra, allowing a wide range of parameters including metallicities and ionization parameters. We find that the large \sc [Oiii] EWs are not self-consistently reproduced by the spectra of stars or unobscured AGN, but obscured AGN that efficiently produces O^++ ionizing photons with weak nuclear and stellar continua that are consistent with the SED shapes.

&lt;p&gt;
The circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a vital role in galaxy evolution, however, studying the emission from CGM is challenging due to its low surface brightness and the complexities involved in interpreting resonant lines such as Ly&amp;alpha;. The near-infrared coverage, unprecedented sensitivity, and high spatial resolution of JWST enable us to study the optical strong lines associated with the extended Ly&amp;alpha; "nebulae" at redshifts of 2&amp;ndash;3. These lines serve as diagnostic tools to infer the physical conditions in the CGM gas reservoir of these systems. In deep medium-band images taken by the JWST, we serendipitously discovered the [O III] emission from the CGM around a massive interacting galaxy system at a redshift z~2.8, known to be embedded in a bright extended (100 kpc) Ly&amp;alpha; "nebula." This is the first time that the [O III] lines have been detected from a Ly&amp;alpha; "nebula." The JWST images reveal that the CGM gas actually resides in narrow (~ 2.5 kpc) filamentary structures with strong [O III] emission, tracing the same extent as the Ly&amp;alpha; emission. An analysis of the [O III] suggests that the emitting CGM is fully ionized and is energetically dominated by mechanical heating. We also find that the density and pressure are higher than those commonly predicted by simulations of the CGM. We conclude that the observed CGM emission originates from the gas expelled by the episodic feedback processes, cooling down and enriching the CGM, while traveling a distance of at least 60 kpc. These observations demonstrate how intensive feedback processes shape gas distribution and properties in the CGM around massive halos. While access to such deep, high-resolution imaging opens up a new discovery space for investigating the CGM, it also challenges numerical simulations with respect to explaining and reproducing the exquisitely complex structures revealed by the observations.

&lt;p&gt;
Accurately quantifying the ionizing photon production efficiency ( &amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt; ) of z&amp;gt;6 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is necessary to understand their contribution to reionization. We investigate the ionizing properties of N=279 SFGs selected at z=6.9-7.6 from the JWST Cycle-1 imaging programmes; PRIMER and JADES. We use BAGPIPES to consistently infer the equivalent widths of their [OIII]+H&amp;beta; emission lines (W_&amp;lambda;) and their physical properties. To supplement our high-redshift galaxies, we measure W_&amp;lambda; photometrically for a sample of N=253 z=3.2-3.6 SFGs selected from the VANDELS spectroscopic survey. Comparing these samples, we find a strong apparent redshift evolution in their median W_&amp;lambda;, increasing from W_&amp;lambda; =310±25 &amp;#8491; in VANDELS to W_&amp;lambda; =540±25 &amp;#8491; in our JWST-based sample. In the JWST sample at z&amp;gt;7, we find that W_&amp;lambda; correlates with both stellar mass and UV luminosity, with high-mass, M_ UV-faint galaxies producing systematically weaker emission lines. Moreover, we discover a departure from the standard log-normal shape of the W_&amp;lambda; distribution, characterised by a more pronounced tail at lower W_&amp;lambda;, consistent with increasingly bursty star formation. Using W_&amp;lambda; as a proxy for  &amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt; , and UV spectral slope as a proxy for LyC escape fraction (f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt;), we find a minority of galaxies with high  &amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt;  and f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt; (e.g., log( &amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt; /erg^-1Hz)~25.6 and f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt;~0.15). However, we find that the LyC photon budget at z&amp;gt;7 is dominated by galaxies with more moderate output, close to the sample median of log( &amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt; /erg^-1Hz)~25.3 and f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt;~0.05. This is consistent with estimates for the number of LyC photons required to power reionization at z&amp;gt;7, with no evidence for over or under-production.

We present results of cosmological zoom-in simulations of a massive protocluster down to redshift z≈4 (when the halo mass is ≈10^13 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) using the SWIFT code and the EAGLE galaxy formation model, focusing on supermassive black hole (BH) physics. The BH was seeded with a mass of 10^4 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; at redshift z≈17. We compare the base model that uses an Eddington limit on the BH accretion rate and thermal isotropic feedback by the AGN, with one where super-Eddington accretion is allowed, as well as two other models with BH spin and jets. In the base model, the BH grows at the Eddington limit from z=9 to z=5.5, when it becomes massive enough to halt its own and its host galaxy's growth through feedback. We find that allowing super-Eddington accretion leads to drastic differences, with the BH going through an intense but short super-Eddington growth burst around z≈7.5, during which it increases its mass by orders of magnitude, before feedback stops further growth (of both the BH and the galaxy). By z≈4 the galaxy is only half as massive in the super-Eddington cases, and an order of magnitude more extended, with the half-mass radius reaching values of a few physical kpc instead of a few hundred pc. The BH masses in our simulations are consistent with the intrinsic BH mass-stellar mass relation inferred from high-redshift observations by JWST. This shows that galaxy formation models using the &amp;Lambda;CDM cosmology are capable of reproducing the observed massive BHs at high redshift. Allowing jets, either at super- or sub-Eddington rates, has little impact on the host galaxy properties, but leads to lower BH masses as a consequence of higher feedback efficiencies.

We present a rest-frame optical, spatially resolved analysis of more than 100 H&amp;alpha; emitters (HAEs) at z~2.2 in the ZFOURGE-CDFS field using NIRCam imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). The ultra-deep, high-resolution data gives us maps of the resolved emission line regions of HAEs with stellar mass ranging from 10^8 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; to 10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. An [OIII] emission-line map of each HAE is created from the flux excess in the F150W filter, leading to the discovery of a population of kiloparsec-scale compact emission line regions ("Green Seeds") with high equivalent widths (EW). We obtain a sample of 128 Green Seeds from 68 HAEs with rest-frame EW_[OIII]&amp;gt;200&amp;#8491;. Moreover, 17 of them have extremely large EW_[OIII]&amp;gt;1000&amp;#8491;, suggesting the possible Lyman continuum (LyC) leakage from these emission line regions. Embedded within the host galaxy, many Green Seeds correspond to UV star-forming clumps and H\sc ii regions, indicating elevated starburst activity in them, with specific star formation rates (sSFR) several times higher than that of the host galaxy. Based on theoretical frameworks, Green Seeds are expected to be formed through gravitational disk instability and/or galaxy mergers. Considering the stellar masses of Green Seeds, we speculate that high-mass Green Seeds may migrate toward the galactic center to build the central bulge, while low-mass Green Seeds are easily disrupted and short-lived. Besides, we propose that some Green Seeds could be the progenitors of globular clusters or ultracompact dwarf galaxies observed in the local universe.

&lt;p&gt;
Recently, NIRSpec PRISM/CLEAR observations by JWST have begun providing rest-frame UV continuum measurements of galaxies at z≳7, revealing signatures of Ly&amp;alpha; damping-wing (DW) absorption by the intergalactic medium (IGM). We develop a methodology to constrain the global ionization fraction of the IGM (Q_HII) using low-resolution spectra, employing the random forest classification (RFC) method. We construct mock spectra using the simulated galaxies and the IGM from the Cosmic Dawn II simulation and train RFC models to estimate Q_HII at the redshift of the source and to detect the presence of a damped Ly&amp;alpha; absorber (DLA). We find that individual galaxy spectra with spectral bins between 1220 and 1270 &amp;#8491; and with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 20 can place tight constraints on Q_HII, provided the UV continuum is accurately modeled. This method is particularly effective for the early phase of reionization (Q_HII&amp;lt;50&amp;percnt;), when the IGM opacity is high in the DW. As a demonstration, we apply our model to existing NIRSpec PRISM/CLEAR spectra, placing upper bounds of Q_HII=59.6&amp;percnt;, 5.6&amp;percnt;, and 18.5&amp;percnt; at z=7.7,~9.4, and 10.6, respectively, with 68&amp;percnt; confidence, though several modeling uncertainties remain to be discussed. These constraints favor late-starting reionization models, where ≳ 80&amp;percnt; of the IGM is ionized after z=8. We conclude that high-SNR observations of carefully selected targets around z~7-9 can effectively constrain reionization models.

We use James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) medium-resolution spectrometer (MRS) observations of 3C 293 (UGC 8782), CGCG 012-070 and NGC 3884 to investigate the origin of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission. These three nearby Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) hosts are known to present H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission excess relative to star-forming galaxies, as traced by the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; S(3)/PAH_11.3&amp;mu; m line ratio. We define the kinematically disturbed region (KDR) by the AGN and the virially dominated region (VDR) based on the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; line widths, using the W80 parameter. From the correlations between W80 and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; S(3)/PAH11.3&amp;mu; m, as well as the higher H2 S(5)/H2 S(3) and [Fe II]5.34 &amp;mu; m/PAH11.3&amp;mu; m ratios and flatter power-law temperature distributions observed in the KDR, we conclude that the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission in the KDR is primarily driven by shock-heated gas. For 3C 293, the KDR is co-spatial with the radio core, indicating that the origin of the shocks is the interaction of the radio jet with the interstellar medium, which is also responsible for the observed molecular and ionized gas outflows in this source. The other galaxies are weak radio sources; however, due to the lack of high-resolution radio images, we cannot rule out low-power jets as the origin of the shock-heated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Our results indicate that the excess H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission excess is associated to shock heating of the gas, generated by outflows or by the interaction of the radio jet with the ambient gas.

&lt;p&gt;
JWST has revealed an abundance of compact, red objects at z≈5-8 dubbed "little red dots" (LRDs), whose SEDs display a faint blue UV continuum followed by a steep rise in the optical. Despite extensive study of their characteristic V-shaped SEDs, the nature of LRDs remains unknown. We present a new analysis of the NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum of A2744-QSO1, a triply imaged LRD at z=7.04 from the UNCOVER survey. The spectrum shows a strong Balmer break and broad Balmer emission lines, both of which are difficult to explain with models invoking exclusively AGN or stellar contributions. Our fiducial model decomposes the spectrum into a post-starburst galaxy dominating the UV-optical continuum and a reddened AGN being sub-dominant at all wavelength and contributing at ~20&amp;percnt; level. However, our most credible model infers a stellar mass of M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;≈ 4×10^9 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; within a radius of r_e&amp;lt;30 pc, driving its central density to the highest among observations to date. This high central density could be explained if A2744-QSO-1 is the early-forming core of a modern-day massive elliptical galaxy that later puffed up via the inside-out growth channel. The models also necessitate an unusually steep dust law to preserve the strong break strength, though this steepness may be explained by a deficit of large dust grains. It is also probable that these challenges reflect our ignorance of A2744-QSO1's true nature. Future variability and reverberation mapping studies could help disentangle the galaxy and AGN contribution to the continuum, and deeper redder observations could also unveil the dust properties in LRDs.

Combining Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array CO(2-1) mapping and JWST near- and mid-infrared imaging, we characterize the relationship between CO(2-1) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission at ~100 pc resolution in 70 nearby star-forming galaxies. Leveraging a new Cycle 2 JWST treasury program targeting nearby galaxies, we expand the sample size by more than an order of magnitude compared to previous ~100 pc resolution CO-PAH comparisons. Focusing on regions of galaxies where most of the gas is likely to be molecular, we find strong correlations between CO(2-1) and 3.3 um, 7.7 um, and 11.3 um PAH emission, estimated from JWST's F335M, F770W, and F1130W filters. We derive power law relations between CO(2-1) and PAH emission, which have indices in the range 0.8-1.3, implying relatively weak variations in the observed CO-to-PAH ratios across the regions that we study. We find that CO-to-PAH ratios and scaling relationships near HII regions are similar to those in diffuse sight lines. The main difference between the two types of regions is that sight lines near HII regions show higher intensities in all tracers. Galaxy centers, on the other hand, show higher overall intensities and enhanced CO-to-PAH ratios compared to galaxy disks. Individual galaxies show 0.19 dex scatter in the normalization of CO at fixed I_PAH, and this normalization anti-correlates with specific star formation rate (sSFR) and correlates with stellar mass. We provide a prescription that accounts for these galaxy-to-galaxy variations and represents our best current empirical predictor to estimate CO(2-1) intensity from PAH emission, which allows one to take advantage of JWST's excellent sensitivity and resolution to trace cold gas.

ASPIRE (A SPectroscopic survey of bIased halos in the Reionization Era) is a quasar legacy survey primarily using itJWST to target a sample of 25 z&amp;gt;6 quasars with NIRCam slitless spectroscopy and imaging. The first study in this series found evidence of a strong overdensity of galaxies around J0305-3150, a luminous quasar at z=6.61, within a single NIRCam pointing obtained in JWST Cycle 1. Here, we present the first results of a JWST Cycle 2 mosaic that covers 35 arcmin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with NIRCam imaging/WFSS of the same field to investigate the spatial extent of the putative protocluster. The F356W grism data targets [OIII]+H&amp;beta; at 5.3&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;7 and reveals a population of 124 line emitters down to a flux limit of 1.2×10^-18 erg s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Fifty-three of these galaxies lie at 6.5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6.8 spanning 10 cMpc on the sky, corresponding to an overdensity within a 2500 cMpc^3 volume of 12.5 ± 2.6, anchored by the quasar. Comparing to the [OIII] luminosity function from the Emission line galaxies and Intergalactic Gas in the Epoch of Reionization (EIGER) project, we find a dearth of faint [OIII] emitters at log(L/erg s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) &amp;lt; 42.3, which we suggest is consistent with either bursty star formation causing galaxies to scatter around the grism detection limit or modest suppression from quasar feedback. While we find a strong filamentary overdensity of [OIII] emitters consistent with a protocluster, we suggest that we could be insensitive to a population of older, more massive Lyman-break galaxies with weak nebular emission on scales &amp;gt;10 cMpc.

Among the remarkable strides made by JWST is the discovery of the earliest star clusters found to date. These have been proposed as early progenitors of globular clusters, which are known to come from the early stages of star formation in the Universe. This is an exciting development in modern astronomy, as it offers an opportunity to connect theoretical models of globular cluster formation to actual observations of these high-redshift structures. In this work, we aim to develop observational signatures of a star cluster formation route known as supersonically induced gas objects, which are dark matter-less gas clouds in the early Universe proposed as a potential origin of some globular clusters. For the first time, we follow the star formation process of these early Universe objects using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, including mechanical feedback. Our results suggest that the first dark matter-less star clusters are top-heavy, with a higher abundance of massive stars compared to today's clusters and extremely high stellar mass surface densities compared to the local Universe.

We present the formation histories of 19 massive (&amp;gt;3X10^10M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) quiescent (sSFR&amp;lt;0.15Gyr^-1) galaxy candidates at z~3.0-4.5 observed using JWST/NIRSpec. This completes the spectroscopic confirmation of the 24 K-selected quiescent galaxy sample from the ZFOURGE and 3DHST surveys (Schreiber et al. 2018a). Utilizing Prism 1-5&amp;mu; m spectroscopy, we confirm that all 12 sources that eluded confirmation by ground-based spectroscopy lie at z&amp;gt;3, resulting in a spectroscopically confirmed number density of ~1.4X10^-5Mpc^-3 between z~3-4. Rest-frame U-V vs V-J color selections show high effectiveness in identifying quiescent galaxies, with a purity of~90%. Our analysis shows that parametric star-formation histories (SFHs) from FAST++ and binned SFHs from Prospector on average yield consistent results, revealing diverse formation and quenching times. The oldest galaxy formed ~6X10^10M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; by z~10 and has been quiescent for over 1 Gyr at z~3.2. We detect two galaxies with ongoing star formation and six with active galactic nuclei (AGN). We demonstrate that the choice of stellar population models, stellar libraries, and nebular or AGN contributions does not significantly affect the derived average SFHs of the galaxies. We demonstrate that extending spectral fitting beyond the rest-frame optical regime reduces the inferred average star formation rates in the earliest time bins of the SFH reconstruction. The assumed SFH prior influences the star formation rate at early times, where spectral diagnostic power is limited. Simulated z~3 quiescent galaxies from IllustrisTNG, SHARK, and Magneticum broadly match the average SFHs of the observed sample but struggle to capture the full diversity, particularly at early stages. Our results emphasize the need for mechanisms that rapidly build stellar mass and quench star formation within the first billion years of the Universe.

Identifying active galactic nuclei (AGN) is extremely important for understanding galaxy evolution and its connection with the assembly of supermassive black holes (SMBH). With the advent of deep and high angular resolution imaging surveys such as those conducted with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), it is now possible to identify galaxies with a central point source out to the very early Universe. In this study, we develop a fast, accurate and precise method to identify galaxies which host AGNs and recover the intrinsic AGN contribution to the observed total light (f_AGN). We trained a deep learning (DL) based method Zoobot to estimate the fractional contribution of a central point source to the total light. Our training sample comprises realistic mock JWST images of simulated galaxies from the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We injected different amounts of the real JWST point spread function (PSF) models to represent galaxies with different levels of f_AGN. We analyse the performance of our method and compare it with results obtained from the traditional light profile fitting tool GALFIT. We find excellent performance of our DL method in recovering the injected AGN fraction f_AGN, both in terms of precision and accuracy. The mean difference between the predicted and true injected f_AGN is -0.002 and the overall root mean square error (RMSE) is 0.013. The relative absolute error (RAE) is 0.076 and the outlier (defined as predictions with RAE &amp;gt;20%) fraction is 6.5%. In comparison, using GALFIT on the same dataset, we achieve a mean difference of -0.02, RMSE of 0.12, RAE of 0.19 and outlier fraction of 19%. We applied our trained DL model to real JWST observations and found that 33% of X-ray-selected AGN and 15% of MIR-selected AGN are also identified as AGN using a cut at f_AGN &amp;gt; 0.1.

We present the properties of a massive, large, dusty, metal-rich, star-forming galaxy at z&lt;sub&gt;spec&lt;/sub&gt;=6.73. GOODSN-100182 was observed with JWST/NIRSpec as part of the AURORA survey, and is also covered by public multi-wavelength HST and JWST imaging. While the large stellar mass of GOODSN-100182 (~10^10 M_sun) was indicated prior to JWST, NIRCam rest-optical imaging now reveals the presence of an extended disk (r_eff~1.5 kpc). In addition, the NIRSpec R~1000 spectrum of GOODSN-100182 includes the detection of a large suite of rest-optical nebular emission lines ranging in wavelength from [OII]3727 up to [NII]6583. The ratios of Balmer lines suggest significant dust attenuation (E(B-V)_gas=0.40+0.10/-0.09), consistent with the red rest-UV slope inferred for GOODSN-100182 (beta=-0.50+/-0.09). The star-formation rate based on dust-corrected H-alpha emission is log(SFR(H-alpha)/ M_sun/yr)=2.02+0.13/-0.14, well above the z~7 star-forming main sequence in terms of specific SFR. Strikingly, the ratio of [NII]6583/H-alpha emission suggests almost solar metallicity, as does the ratio ([OIII]5007/H-beta)/([NII]6583/H-alpha) and the detection of the faint [FeII]4360 emission feature. Overall, the excitation and ionization properties of GOODSN-100182 more closely resemble those of typical star-forming galaxies at z~2-3 rather than z~7. Based on public spectroscopy of the GOODS-N field, we find that GOODSN-100182 resides within a significant galaxy overdensity, and is accompanied by a spectroscopically-confirmed neighbor galaxy. GOODSN-100182 demonstrates the existence of mature, chemically-enriched galaxies within the first billion years of cosmic time, whose properties must be explained by galaxy formation models.

We report the first successful ALMA follow-up observations of a secure z &amp;gt; 10 JWST-selected galaxy, by robustly detecting (6.6&amp;sigma;) the [OIII]_88&amp;mu; m  line in JADES-GS-z14-0 (hereafter GS-z14). The ALMA detection yields a spectroscopic redshift of z=14.1793±0.0007, and increases the precision on the prior redshift measurement of z=14.32_-0.20^+0.08 from NIRSpec by ≳180×. Moreover, the redshift is consistent with that previously determined from a tentative detection (3.6&amp;sigma;) of CIII]_1907,1909 (z=14.178±0.013), solidifying the redshift determination via multiple line detections. We measure a line luminosity of L_[OIII]88 = (2.1 ± 0.5)×10^8 L&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, placing GS-z14 at the lower end, but within the scatter of, the local L_[OIII]88-star formation rate relation. No dust continuum from GS-z14 is detected, suggesting an upper limit on the dust-to-stellar mass ratio of &amp;lt; 2 × 10^-3, consistent with dust production from supernovae with a yield y_d &amp;lt; 0.3 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. Combining a previous JWST/MIRI photometric measurement of the [OIII]&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;4959,5007\mathringA and H&amp;beta; lines with Cloudy models, we find GS-z14 to be surprisingly metal-enriched (Z~0.05 - 0.2 Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) a mere 300 Myr after the Big Bang. The detection of a bright oxygen line in GS-z14 thus reinforces the notion that galaxies in the early Universe undergo rapid evolution.

JADES-GS-z14-0 is the most distant spectroscopically confirmed galaxy yet, at z&amp;gt;14. With a UV magnitude of -20.81, it is one of the most luminous galaxies at cosmic dawn and its half-light radius of 260 pc means that stars dominate the observed UV emission. We report ALMA detection of [OIII]88&amp;mu;m line emission with a significance of 6.67&amp;sigma; and at a frequency of 223.524~GHz, corresponding to a redshift of 14.1796±0.0007, which is consistent with the candidate CIII] line detected in the NIRSpec spectrum. At this spectroscopic redshift, the Lyman-&amp;alpha; break identified with NIRSpec requires a damped Lyman-&amp;alpha; absorber with a column density of log(N_HI/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)=21.96. The total [OIII]88&amp;mu;m luminosity (log(L_[OIII]/L&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) = 8.3± 0.1) is fully consistent with the local L_[OIII]-SFR relation and indicating a gas-phase metallicity &amp;gt;0.1~Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. Using ttprospector SED modeling and combining the ALMA data with JWST observations, we find Z=0.17~Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and a non-zero escape fraction of ionizing photons (~11&amp;percnt;), which is necessary by the code to reproduce the UV spectrum. We measure an [O III]5007&amp;#8491;/[O III]88&amp;mu;m line flux ratio between 1 and 20, resulting in an upper limit to the electron density of roughly 700 cm^-3 assuming a single-cloud photoionization model. The [OIIII]88&amp;mu;m emission line is spectrally resolved, with a FWHM of 100 km/s, resulting in a dynamical mass of log(M_dyn/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) = 9.0±0.2. When compared to the stellar mass, this value represents a conservative upper limit on the gas mass fraction, which ranges from 50&amp;percnt; to 80&amp;percnt;, depending on the assumed star formation history. Past radiation-driven outflows may have cleared the galaxy from the gas, reducing the gas fraction and thus increasing the escape fraction of ionizing photons.

Massive black holes (BHs) grow by gas accretion and mergers, observable through electromagnetic (EM) and gravitational wave (GW) emission. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has detected faint active galactic nuclei (AGNs), revealing an abundant population of accreting BHs with masses of M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt;~ 10^6-8~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. This mass range overlaps with the detection scopes of space-based GW interferometers and approaches the upper bounds of the predicted mass of seed BHs. We model BH mass assembly in light of the new JWST findings to investigate their formation channels and predict merger events. Two types of seed BHs are considered: heavy seeds (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt;~ 10^2-5~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) formed in rare and overdense cosmic regions, and light seeds (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt;~ 10^1-3~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) formed as stellar remnants in less massive dark-matter halos. The BHs grow through episodic accretion and merger events, which we model by fitting the AGN luminosity function to observational data including JWST-identified AGNs at z~ 5. We find that heavy seeds alone struggle to explain quasars and faint JWST-selected AGNs simultaneously, requiring the more abundant light seeds. The observed merger rate of BHs from heavy seeds alone is limited to ≲ 10^-1~yr^-1 for major mergers at z≥5. However, the presence of light seeds increases the major merger rate by several orders of magnitude, which peaks at a total BH mass of M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt;≃ 2× 10^3~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; over 5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;10 at a rate of ~ 30~yr^-1. These events are detectable by future GW observatories such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Precise sky localization and distance measurement of those GW events, with solid angle and luminosity distance uncertainties &amp;Delta;&amp;Omega;&amp;Delta;log D_L≲ 10^-4~deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, will enable EM identification of mergers at z≥5 and multi-messenger follow-up observations.

&lt;p&gt;
We infer supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion rates and Eddington ratios as a function of SMBH/host galaxy mass and redshift with the empirical TRINITY model of dark matter halo&amp;ndash;galaxy&amp;ndash;SMBH connection. The galaxy&amp;ndash;SMBH mass and growth rate connection from TRINITY matches galaxy observables from 0&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;13 and SMBH observables from 0&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6.5. Key findings include: 1) the ratio between cosmic SMBH accretion rate and galaxy star formation rate stays constant at ~ 2× 10^-3 from z=0-4, and decreases by 2 orders of magnitude from z=4-10; 2) the average SMBH Eddington ratio &amp;eta; increases towards higher redshifts, nearly reaching &amp;eta;=1 at z~ 10; 3) at fixed redshift for z&amp;lt;3, SMBHs/galaxies with higher masses have lower &amp;eta;, consistent with AGN downsizing; 4) the average ratio of specific SMBH accretion rate (SBHAR) to average specific star formation rate (SSFR) is nearly mass-independent, with a value SBHAR/SSFR~ 1, which decreases slightly from z=10 to z=0; 5) similar to galaxies, SMBHs reach their peak efficiency to convert baryons into mass when host halos reach 10^12 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;; 6) given galaxy and SMBH growth histories from TRINITY, the local descendants of 1&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;11 overmassive JWST AGNs will remain outliers from the local SMBH mass&amp;ndash;galaxy mass relation. These findings combine to give a simple explanation for massive (10^9-10^10M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) quasars at z&amp;gt;6: at these redshifts, dark matter halos grow with an e-folding time of ~ 45 Myrs, driving similar growth rates in both galaxies and SMBHs.

&lt;p&gt;
This article revisits the interpretation of cosmic probes such as SNIa and BAO under a two-regions model of the universe. Standard cosmological analyses assume homogeneity, yet observations are predominantly conducted in overdense regions where matter is clustered, potentially biasing conclusions about cosmic expansion. We refine an existing two-regions framework that accounts for both overdense and underdense areas, demonstrating that the apparent acceleration of the universe, typically attributed to dark energy, can emerge as a consequence of observational bias rather than a fundamental cosmological constant. By applying this model to SNIa and BAO measurements, we show that inhomogeneities can affect redshift and distance estimates in a way that mimics cosmic acceleration. This interpretation provides a natural resolution to the coincidence problem and offers an alternative explanation for the observed tensions in Hubble constant measurements. Additionally, it may shed light on the unexpectedly early formation of galaxies observed by JWST. These findings challenge the necessity of dark energy and suggest that the observed acceleration may be an artefact of the spatial distribution of matter rather than a true universal phenomenon.

Previous as well as recent observations by ISO, Spitzer, AKARI, SOFIA, JWST etc. have revealed various characteristics of mid-infrared emission bands between 3-20 micron. Subsequently, several forms of organics including Polycylic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)/PAH-like molecules are proposed as carriers for these bands. Deuterated PAH (PAD) is one such substituted PAH, which is proposed as a potential candidate carrier for weak emission bands at 4.4 and 4.65 micron, detected towards few astronomical targets and are characteristics of aromatic and aliphatic C-D stretching modes in a PAD molecule, respectively. However, the 4.4 micron band is not widely detected. In order to validate PADs as carriers for mid-infrared emission bands, an additional alternative tool is crucial. If PAHs are deuterated, they should also possess an inherent signature from the C-D out-of-plane (C-Doop) vibrations, which are at the longer wavelength side. In this report, features due to C-Doop modes in PAHs bearing a single to multiple deuterium atoms are reported by performing quantum-chemical calculations. This paper reports that some of the C-Doop vibrations appear at the 14-19 micron range. Also, the strength of C-Doop modes is not proportional to the D/H ratio in PAHs. In addition, a moderate change in the spectra of deuterated PAHs is observed from that of the undeuterated counterparts, as deuteration would alternate the adjacency class of the C-H bonds and the symmetry of the molecule. We discuss the efficiency and usefulness of these bands to constrain the form of PAHs emitting mid-infrared emission bands.

&lt;p&gt; Kohei Inayoshi, Roberto Maiolino &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at high redshifts of z≳ 4-7, powered by accreting black holes (BHs) with masses of ~ 10^6-8~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. One remarkable distinction of these JWST-identified AGNs, compared to their low-redshift counterparts, is that at least ~ 20&amp;percnt; of them present H&amp;alpha; and/or H&amp;beta; absorption, which must be associated with extremely dense (≳ 10^9~cm^-3) gas in the broad-line region or its immediate surroundings. These Balmer absorption features unavoidably imply the presence of a Balmer break caused by the same dense gas. In this Letter, we quantitatively demonstrate that a Balmer break can form in AGN spectra without stellar components, when the accretion disk is heavily embedded in dense neutral gas clumps with densities of ~ 10^9-11~cm^-3, where hydrogen atoms are collisionally excited to the n=2 states and effectively absorb the AGN continuum at the bluer side of the Balmer limit. The non-stellar origin of a Balmer break offers a potential solution to the large stellar masses and densities inferred for little red dots (LRDs) when assuming that their continuum is primarily due to stellar light. Our calculations indicate that the observed Balmer absorption blueshifted by a few hundreds km~s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; suggests the presence of dense outflows in the nucleus at rates exceeding the Eddington value. Other spectral features such as higher equivalent widths of broad H&amp;alpha; emission and presence of OI lines observed in high-redshift AGNs including LRDs align with the predicted signatures of a dense super-Eddington accretion disk.

We present the Red Unknowns: Bright Infrared Extragalactic Survey (RUBIES), providing JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of red sources selected across ~150 arcmin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; from public JWST/NIRCam imaging in the UDS and EGS fields. RUBIES novel observing strategy offers a well-quantified selection function: the survey is optimised to reach high (&amp;gt;70%) completeness for bright and red (F150W-F444W&amp;gt;2) sources that are very rare. To place these rare sources in context, we simultaneously observe a reference sample of the 2&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;7 galaxy population, sampling sources at a rate that is inversely proportional to their number density in the 3D space of F444W magnitude, F150W-F444W colour, and photometric redshift. In total, RUBIES observes ~3000 targets across 1&amp;lt;z&lt;sub&gt;phot&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;10 with both the PRISM and G395M dispersers, and ~1500 targets at z&lt;sub&gt;phot&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;3 using only the G395M disperser. The RUBIES data reveal a highly diverse population of red sources that span a broad redshift range (z&lt;sub&gt;spec&lt;/sub&gt;~1-9), with photometric redshift scatter and outlier fraction that are 3 times higher than for similarly bright sources that are less red. This diversity is not apparent from the photometric SEDs. Only spectroscopy reveals that the SEDs encompass a mixture of galaxies with dust-obscured star formation, extreme line emission, a lack of star formation indicating early quenching, and luminous active galactic nuclei. As a first demonstration of our broader selection function we compare the stellar masses and rest-frame U-V colours of the red sources and our reference sample: red sources are typically more massive (M_*~10^10-11.5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) across all redshifts. However, we find that the most massive systems span a wide range in U-V colour. We describe our data reduction procedure and data quality, and publicly release the reduced RUBIES data and vetted spectroscopic redshifts of the first half of the survey through the DJA.

&lt;p&gt;
A successful theory of star formation should predict the number of objects as a function of their mass produced through star-forming events. Previous studies in star-forming regions and the solar neighborhood identify a mass function increasing from the hydrogen-burning limit down to about 10 M_J. Theory predicts a limit to the fragmentation process, providing a natural turnover in the mass function down to the opacity limit of turbulent fragmentation thought to be near 1-10 M_J. Programs to date have not been sensitive enough to probe the hypothesized opacity limit of fragmentation. We present the first identification of a turnover in the initial mass function below 12 M_J within NGC 2024, a young star-forming region. With JWST/NIRCam deep exposures across 0.7-5 &amp;mu;m, we identified several free floating objects down to roughly 3 M_J with sensitivity to 0.5 M_J. We present evidence for a double power law model increasing from about 60 M_J to roughly 12 M_J, consistent with previous studies, followed by a decrease down to 0.5 M_J. Our results support the predictions of star and brown dwarf formation theory, identifying the theoretical turnover in the mass function and suggest the fundamental limit of turbulent fragmentation near 3 M_J.

We report the spectroscopic discovery of a massive quiescent galaxy at z&lt;sub&gt;spec&lt;/sub&gt;=7.29±0.01, just ~700 Myr after the Big Bang. RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 was selected from public JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging from the PRIMER survey and observed with JWST/NIRSpec as part of RUBIES. The NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum reveals one of the strongest Balmer breaks observed thus far at z&amp;gt;6, no emission lines, but tentative Balmer and Ca absorption features, as well as a Lyman break. Simultaneous modeling of the NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum and NIRCam and MIRI photometry (spanning 0.9-18 &amp;mu; m) shows that the galaxy formed a stellar mass of log(M_*/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;)=10.23^+0.04_-0.04 before z~8, and ceased forming stars 50-100 Myr prior to the time of observation, resulting in log(sSFR/Gyr^-1)&amp;lt;-1. We measure a small physical size of 209_-24^+33 pc, which implies a high stellar mass surface density within the effective radius of log(&amp;Sigma;_*,e/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; kpc^-2)=10.85_-0.12^+0.11 comparable to the highest densities measured in quiescent galaxies at z~2-5. The 3D stellar mass density profile of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 is remarkably similar to the central densities of local massive ellipticals, suggesting that at least some of their cores may have already been in place at z&amp;gt;7. The discovery of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 has strong implications for galaxy formation models: the estimated number density of quiescent galaxies at z~7 is &amp;gt;100× larger than predicted from any model to date, indicating that quiescent galaxies have formed earlier than previously expected.

The external environments surrounding molecular clouds vary widely across galaxies such as the Milky Way, and statistical samples of clouds are required to understand them. We present the Perseus Arm Molecular Survey (PAMS), a James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) survey combining new and archival data of molecular-cloud complexes in the outer Perseus spiral arm in ^12CO, ^13CO, and C^18O (J=3-2). With a survey area of ~8 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, PAMS covers well-known complexes such as W3, W5, and NGC 7538 with two fields at &amp;ell; ≈ 110&amp;deg; and &amp;ell; ≈ 135&amp;deg;. PAMS has an effective resolution of 17 arcsec, and rms sensitivity of T_mb = 0.7-1.0 K in 0.3 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; channels. Here we present a first look at the data, and compare the PAMS regions in the Outer Galaxy with Inner Galaxy regions from the CO Heterodyne Inner Milky Way Plane Survey (CHIMPS). By comparing the various CO data with maps of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; column density from Herschel, we calculate representative values for the CO-to-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; column-density X-factors, which are X_^12 CO (3-2)=4.0×10^20 and X_^13 CO (3-2)=4.0×10^21cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (K km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)^-1 with a factor of 1.5 uncertainty. We find that the emission profiles, size-linewidth and mass-radius relationships of ^13CO-traced structures are similar between the Inner and Outer Galaxy. Although PAMS sources are slightly more massive than their Inner Galaxy counterparts for a given size scale, the discrepancy can be accounted for by the Galactic gradient in gas-to-dust mass ratio, uncertainties in the X-factors, and selection biases. We have made the PAMS data publicly available, complementing other CO surveys targeting different regions of the Galaxy in different isotopologues and transitions.

The Virgo Cluster is the nearest substantial cluster of galaxies to the Milky Way and a cornerstone of the extragalactic distance scale. Here, we present JWST/NIRCam observations that simultaneously cover the cores and halos of ten galaxies in and around the Virgo Cluster and are designed to perform simultaneous measurements of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) and surface brightness fluctuations (SBF). Seven of the targets are within the Virgo Cluster and where we are able to resolve some of the cluster's substructure, while an additional three provide important constraints on Virgo infall. The seven galaxies within Virgo itself all have SBF measurements from the Advanced Camera for Surveys Virgo Cluster Survey (ACSVCS). After adjusting the ACSVCS measurements for the offset from our new JWST TRGB measurements, we determine a distance to the Virgo Cluster of d = 16.17 ± 0.25 (stat) ± 0.47 (sys) Mpc. The work presented here is part of a larger program to develop a Population II distance scale through the TRGB and SBF that is completely independent of the prominent Cepheid + Type Ia supernova ladder. The TRGB distances to the galaxies presented here, when combined with future SBF measurements, will provide a crucial step forward for determining whether or not systematic errors can explain the well-known "Hubble tension'' or if there is significant evidence for cracks in the &amp;Lambda;CDM model.

&lt;p&gt;
\requiremediawiki-texvcCosmic Reionisation commenced when ultraviolet (UV) radiation produced in the first galaxies began illuminating the cold, neutral gas that filled the primordial Universe. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have shown that surprisingly UV-bright galaxies were in place beyond redshift z = 14, when the Universe was less than 300   Myr old. Smooth turnovers of their UV continua have been interpreted as damping-wing absorption of Lyman-&amp;alpha; (Ly&amp;alpha;), the principal hydrogen transition. However, spectral signatures encoding crucial properties of these sources, such as their emergent radiation field, largely remain elusive. Here we report spectroscopy from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) of a galaxy at redshift z = 13.0 that reveal a singular, bright emission line unambiguously identified as Ly&amp;alpha;, in addition to a smooth turnover. We observe an equivalent width of EW_Ly&amp;alpha; &amp;gt; 40   &amp;#8491; (rest frame), previously only seen at z &amp;lt; 9 where the intervening intergalactic medium (IGM) becomes increasingly ionised. Together with an extremely blue UV continuum, the unexpected Ly&amp;alpha; emission indicates the galaxy is a prolific producer and leaker of ionising photons. This suggests massive, hot stars or an active galactic nucleus (AGN) have created an early reionised region to prevent complete extinction of Ly&amp;alpha;, thus shedding new light on the nature of the earliest galaxies and the onset of Reionisation only 330   Myr after the Big Bang.

&lt;p&gt;
In this work, we spectroscopically select narrow-line AGN (NLAGN) among the ~ 300 publicly available medium-resolution spectra of the CEERS Survey. Using both traditional and newly identified emission line NLAGN diagnostics diagrams, we identified 52 NLAGN at 2≲ z≲ 9 on which we performed a detailed multiwavelength analysis. We also identified 4 new z≲ 2 broad-line AGN (BLAGN), in addition to the 8 previously reported high-z BLAGN. We found that the traditional BPT diagnostic diagrams are not suited to identify high-z AGN, while most of the high-z NLAGN are selected using the recently proposed AGN diagnostic diagrams based on the [OIII]&amp;lambda;4363 auroral line or high-ionization emission lines. We compared the emission line velocity dispersion and the obscuration of the sample of NLAGN with those of the parent sample without finding significant differences between the two distributions, suggesting a population of AGN heavily buried and not significantly impacting the host galaxies' physical properties, as further confirmed by SED-fitting. The bolometric luminosities of the high-z NLAGNs selected in this work are well below those sampled by surveys before JWST, potentially explaining the weak impact of these AGN. Finally, we investigate the X-ray properties of the selected NLAGN and of the sample of high-z BLAGN. We find that all but 4 NLAGN are undetected in the deep X-ray image of the field, as well as all the high-z BLAGN. We do not obtain a detection even by stacking the undetected sources, resulting in an X-ray weakness of ~ 1-2 dex from what is expected based on their bolometric luminosities. To discriminate between a heavily obscured AGN scenario or an intrinsic X-ray weakness of these sources, we performed a radio stacking analysis, which did not reveal any detection leaving open the questions about the origin of the X-ray weakness.

&lt;p&gt;
Galaxy chemical enrichment mechanisms have primarily been constrained by [&amp;alpha;/Fe] and [Fe/H] measurements of individual stars and integrated light from stellar populations. However such measurements are limited at higher redshifts (z&amp;gt;1). Recently, we proposed an analogous diagram of the oxygen-to-argon abundance ratio, log(O/Ar), vs Ar abundance, 12+log(Ar/H), as a new diagnostic window for emission nebulae. In this Letter, using robust line flux measurements including temperature sensitive auroral lines, we present direct determination of O and Ar abundances in nine SFGs from JWST/NIRSPEC spectra at z~1.3-7.7, and two more with Keck/MOSFIRE spectra at z~2.2. Utilising their positions on the log(O/Ar) vs 12+log(Ar/H) plane, we present the first inference of galaxy chemical enrichment mechanisms from an ensemble of galaxies. The SFGs at z~1.3-3.4 are consistent with the solar neighbourhood galactic chemical enrichment models of the Milky Way Galaxy that are driven by core-collapse and Type Ia supernovae. Such enrichment mechanisms thus occur at least out to z~3.4. However, the highest-redshift SFGs (z~3.6-7.7) have very low log(O/Ar) values, revealing a different enrichment process at z&amp;gt;3.6. Such low log(O/Ar) values may be caused by a rapid but intermittent star-formation and/or additional sources. The new diagnostic window for SFGs enables us to reveal the unique fingerprints of galaxy chemical enrichment out to cosmic dawn.

&lt;p&gt;
The James Webb Space telescope has discovered an abundant population of broad line emitters, typical signposts for Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Many of these sources have red colors and a compact appearance that has led to naming them `Little Red Dots'. In this paper we develop a detailed framework to estimate the photometry of AGN embedded in galaxies extracted from the \Obelisk cosmological simulation to understand the properties of color-selected Little Red Dots (cLRDs) in the context of the full AGN and massive black hole population. We find that using realistic spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and attenuation for AGN we can explain the shape of the cLRD SED as long as galaxies host a sufficiently luminous AGN that is not too much or too little attenuated. When attenuation is too low or too high, AGN do not enter the cLRD selection, because the AGN dominates over the host galaxy too much in blue filters, or it does not contribute to photometry anywhere, respectively. cLRDs are also characterized by high Eddington ratios, possibility super-Eddington, and/or high ratios between black hole and stellar mass.

We report the identification of two galaxy overdensities at z~5.7 in the sightline of the galaxy cluster Abell 2744. These overdensities consist of 25 and 17 member galaxies, spectroscopically confirmed with JWST NIRSpec/MSA and NIRCam/WFSS. Each overdensity has a total stellar mass of ~2×10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and a star formation rate of ~200 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;/yr within a central region of radius R=2 Mpc (physical). The sensitive PRISM spectra allow us to identify six galaxies that show weak Ha+[NII] emissions within the overdensities (27±6&amp;percnt;), whereas the fraction of such galaxies is found significantly lower (6±2&amp;percnt;) in field samples of the equivalent redshift range. These weak emission line galaxies, dubbed as wELGs, exhibit a strong continuum break at 4000AA rest-frame, a characteristic feature of evolved stellar populations. The high observed fraction of wELGs in the two overdensities is consistent with the idea that high-density environments are an ideal site where galaxies can accelerate their evolutionary pace compared to field analogs. Our study pinpoints an early onset of environmental effects, already important within one billion years after the Big Bang, and provides a complementary perspective on the emergence of quenched, massive galaxies at lower redshifts. Potential contributions from black hole accretion feedback to the reduction of star formation activity are discussed, but the connection to the local environments remains unclear.

&lt;p&gt;
The use of extremely metal-deficient dwarf galaxies (XMDs) as nearby analogs for high-redshift protogalaxies is generating renewed interest due to recent JWST observations studying these protogalaxies. However, the existence of a population of unenriched galaxies at z~0 raises fundamental questions about how galaxies with such pristine gas reservoirs could be formed. To address these questions we study XMDs in the IllustrisTNG simulation. We find that XMDs at z=0 are not relics of the first galaxies, but dwarf galaxies that experience a dramatic ~0.3 dex drop in their gas-phase metallicity in the past few Gyr. We investigate possible causes of this drop in metallicity including high gas fractions, outflow efficiency or inflow/outflow rates, unique environments, pristine inflow metallicity, and inflow/SFR interactions. Of these, we find that inflow/outflow interactions, parameterized by the cumulative regional SFR experienced by inflows, has the strongest correlation with dwarf galaxy metallicity and XMD formation. In other words, inefficient gas enrichment during the short time between its accretion from the CGM and the initiation of star formation is the most important cause of XMD formation in the simulation. Observationally, we identify differences in star formation history between XMDs and non-XMDs (with XMDs having significantly decreased star formation rates on 1-5 Gyr timescales) and differences in galaxy size (with XMDs having a more extended young stellar population) as the primary differences between the two populations. These results highlight the importance of inflow enrichment efficiency as a possible driver of dwarf galaxy metallicities.

Over the last decade, the Atacama Large Millimeter Array has revealed massive, dusty star-forming galaxies at z≳5, and the James Webb Space Telescope is primed to uncover even more information about them. These observations need dust evolution theory to provide context and are excellent benchmarks to test this theory. Here, we investigate the evolution of galactic dust budget at cosmic dawn using a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations of moderately massive, high-redshift (M_star≳10^9 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;; z≳5) galaxies from the FIRE project, the highest resolution (m_b ≈ 7100  M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) of such simulations to date. Our simulations incorporate a dust evolution model that accounts for the dominant sources of dust production, growth, and destruction and follows the evolution of specific dust species, allowing it to replicate a wide range of present-day observations. We find, similar to other theoretical works, that dust growth via gas-dust accretion is the dominant producer of dust mass for these massive, z≳ 5 galaxies. However, our fiducial model produces M_dust that fall ≳1 dex below observations at any given M_star (typical uncertainties are ~1 dex), which we attribute to reduced accretion efficiencies caused by a combination of low galactic metallicities and extremely bursty star formation. Modest enhancements (i.e., within observational/theoretical uncertainties) to accretion and SNe II dust creation raise M_dust by ≲1 dex, but this still falls below observations which assume T_dust~25 K. One possibility is that inferred dust masses for z≳4 galaxies are overestimated, and recent observational/analytical works that find T_dust~50 K along with metallicity constraints tentatively support this.

&lt;p&gt;
We present the latest results from the Chicago-Carnegie Hubble Program (\cchp) to measure the Hubble constant, using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The overall program aims to calibrate three independent methods: (1) Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) stars, (2) JAGB (J-Region Asymptotic Giant Branch) stars, and (3) Cepheids. To date, our program includes 10 nearby galaxies, hosting 11 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) suitable for measuring the Hubble constant (H_0). It also includes the galaxy NGC 4258, whose geometric distance provides the zero-point calibration. In this paper we discuss our results from the TRGB and JAGB methods. Our current best (highest precision) estimate is H_0 = 70.39 ± 1.22 (stat) ± 1.33 (sys) ± 0.70 (&amp;sigma;_SN), based on the TRGB method alone, with a total of 24 SN Ia calibrators from both HST and JWST data. Based on our new JWST data only, and tying into SNe Ia, we find values of H_0 = 68.81 ± 1.79 (stat) ± 1.32 (sys) for the TRGB, and H_0 = 67.80 ± 2.17 (stat) ± 1.64 (sys) km/s/Mpc for the JAGB method. The distances measured using the TRGB and the JAGB method agree, on average, at a level better than 1%, and with the SH0ES Cepheid distances at just over the 1% level. Our results are consistent with the current standard LambdaCDM model, without the need for the inclusion of additional new physics. Future JWST data will be required to increase the precision and accuracy of the local distance scale.

We present the design and observations of low resolution JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy from the Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) Cycle 1 JWST Treasury program. Targets are selected using JWST/NIRCam photometry from UNCOVER and other programs, and cover a wide range of categories and redshifts to ensure the legacy value of the survey. These categories include the first galaxies at z≳10, faint galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization (z~6-8), high redshift AGN (z≳6), Population III star candidates, distant quiescent and dusty galaxies (1≲z≲ 6), and filler galaxies sampling redshift&amp;ndash;color&amp;ndash;magnitude space from z~0.1-13. Seven NIRSpec MSA masks across the extended Abell 2744 cluster were observed, along with NIRCam parallel imaging in 8 filters (F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M, F444W, F480M) over a total area of ~26 arcmin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, overlapping existing HST coverage from programs including the Hubble Frontier Fields and BUFFALO. We successfully observed 553 objects down to m_F444W~30AB, and by leveraging mask overlaps, we reach total on-target exposure times ranging from 2.4-16.7h. We demonstrate the success rate and distribution of confirmed redshifts, and also highlight the rich information revealed by these ultradeep spectra for a subset of our targets. An updated lens model of Abell 2744 is also presented, including 14 additional spectroscopic redshifts and finding a total cluster mass of M_SL=(2.1±0.3)×10^15 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. We publicly release reduced 1D and 2D spectra for all objects observed in Summer 2023 along with a spectroscopic redshift catalog and the updated lens model of the cluster (https://jwst-uncover.github.io/DR4.html).

The J-region asymptotic giant branch (JAGB) method is a new standard candle based on the constant luminosities of carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars in the J band. The JAGB method is independent of the Cepheid and TRGB distance indicators. Therefore, we can leverage it to both cross-check Cepheid and TRGB distances for systematic errors and use it to measure an independent local Hubble constant. The JAGB method also boasts a number of advantages in measuring distances relative to the TRGB and Cepheids, several of which are especially amplified when combined with JWST's revolutionary resolving power. First, JAGB stars are 1 mag brighter in the NIR than the TRGB, and can be discovered from single-epoch NIR photometry unlike Cepheids which require congruent optical imaging in at least 12 epochs. Thus, JAGB stars can be used to measure significantly farther distances than both the TRGB stars and Cepheids using the same amount of observing time. Further advantages include: JAGB stars are easily identified solely via their colors and magnitudes, dust extinction is reduced in near-infrared observations, and JAGB stars are ubiquitous in all galaxies with intermediate-age populations. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that identifies the optimal location in a galaxy for applying the JAGB method, so as to minimize effects from crowding. We then deploy this algorithm in JWST NIRCam imaging of seven SN Ia host galaxies to measure their JAGB distances, undertaking a completely blind analysis. The zero-point of this JAGB distance scale is set in the water mega-maser galaxy NGC 4258. In our CCHP overview paper Freedman et al. (2025), we apply the JAGB distances measured in this paper to the Carnegie Supernova Program (CSP) SNe Ia sample, measuring a Hubble constant of H0 = 67.80 +/- 2.17 (stat) +/- 1.64 (sys) km/s/Mpc.

We present a detailed JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam analysis of a gravitationally-lensed galaxy (&amp;mu;=17-21) at redshift 6.14 magnified by the Hubble Frontier Field galaxy cluster MACS J0416. The target galaxy is overall a typical compact and UV-faint (M_UV=-17.8) Lyman-&amp;alpha; emitter, yet the large magnification allows the detailed characterization of structures on sub-galactic scales (down to a few parsecs). Prominent optical H&amp;alpha;, H&amp;beta; and [OIII]&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;4959,5007 lines are spatially resolved with the high spectral resolution grating (G395H, R~2700), with large equivalent widths, EW(H&amp;beta;+[OIII])≳1000 &amp;#8491;, and elevated ionising photon production efficiencies log( &amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt; /erg^-1Hz)=25.2-25.7. NIRCam deep imaging reveals the presence of compact rest-UV bright regions along with individual star clusters of R_eff=3-8~pc in size and M~2\cdot10^5-5\cdot10^6~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; in mass. These clusters are characterised by steep UV slopes, &amp;beta;_UV≲-2.5, which in some cases are associated with a dearth of line emission, indicating possible leaking of the ionizing radiation, as also supported by a Lyman-&amp;alpha; emission peaking at ~100~km~s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; from the systemic redshift. While the entire system is characterised by low-metallicity, ~0.1~Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, the NIRSpec-IFU map also reveals the presence of a low-luminosity, metal-poor region with Z≲2&amp;percnt;~Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, barely detected in NIRCam imaging; this region is displaced by &amp;gt;200~pc from one of the brightest structures of the system in UV, and would have been too faint to detect if not for the large magnification of the system.

In this study, we present a detailed multiphase analysis of HZ4, a main-sequence star-forming galaxy at z ~ 5.5, known for being a turbulent rotating disk and having a detection of a [CII] outflow in the ALMA observations. We exploit JWST/NIRSpec observations in the integral field spectroscopy mode with low- and high-spectral resolution that allow us for the first time to spatially resolve the rest-frame UV and optical emission of the galaxy to investigate the galaxy properties. In particular, the high-resolution dataset allows us to study the kinematics of the ionized gas phase, and the conditions of the interstellar medium, such as the excitation mechanism, dust attenuation, and metallicity. The lower-spectral resolution observations allow us to study the continuum emission and infer the stellar populations' ages and properties. Our findings suggest that HZ4 is a galaxy merger rather than a rotating disk as previously inferred from lower resolution [CII] data. The merger is associated with an extended broad, blueshifted emission, potentially indicative of an outflow originating from a region of intense star formation and extending up to 4 kpc. In light of these new observations we reanalyzed the ALMA data to compare the multiphase gas properties. If we interpret the broad components seen in [CII] and [OIII]&amp;lambda;5007\.A as outflows, the neutral and ionized components are co-spatial, the mass loading factor of the ionized phase is significantly lower than that of the neutral phase, aligning with trends observed in multi-phase systems at lower redshifts. Nonetheless, additional observations and larger statistical samples are essential to determine the role of mergers and outflows in the early Universe and to clarify the origin of the broad emission components observed in this system.

&lt;p&gt;
In fuzzy dark matter (FDM) cosmologies, the dark matter consists of ultralight bosons (m≲10^-20 eV). The astrophysically large de Broglie wavelengths of such particles hinder the formation of low-mass dark matter halos. This implies a testable prediction: a corresponding suppression in the faint-end of the ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF) of galaxies. Notably, recent estimates of the faint-end UVLF at z~5-9 in the Hubble Frontier Fields, behind foreground lensing clusters, probe up to five magnitudes fainter than typical ("blank-field") regions. These measurements thus far disfavor prominent turnovers in the UVLF at low luminosity, implying bounds on FDM. We fit a semi-empirical model to these and blank-field UVLF data, including the FDM particle mass as a free parameter. This fit excludes cases where the dark matter is entirely a boson of mass m&amp;lt;1.5×10^-21 eV (with 2&amp;sigma; confidence). We also present a less stringent bound deriving solely from the requirement that the total observed abundance of galaxies, integrated over all luminosities, must not exceed the total halo abundance in FDM. This more model-agnostic bound disfavors m&amp;lt;5×10^-22 eV (2&amp;sigma;). We forecast that future UVLF measurements from JWST lensing fields may probe masses several times larger than these bounds, although we demonstrate this is subject to theoretical uncertainties in modeling the FDM halo mass function.

In the local Universe, star formation is typically inefficient both globally and when considered as the fraction of gas converted into stars per local free-fall time. An important exception to this inefficiency is regions of high gravitational accelerations g, or equivalently surface densities &amp;Sigma; = g/(&amp;pi; G), where stellar feedback is insufficient to overcome the self-gravity of dense gas clouds. In this paper, I explore whether dark matter can play an analogous role in providing the requisite accelerations on the scale of entire galaxies in the early cosmos. The key insight is that characteristic accelerations in dark matter halos scale as (1+z)^2 at fixed halo mass. I show this is sufficient to make dark matter the source of intense accelerations that might induce efficient star formation on galactic scales at cosmic dawn in sufficiently massive halos. The mass characterizing this regime scales as (1+z)^-6 and corresponds to a relatively constant comoving number density of n(&amp;gt;\!M_vir) ≈ 10^-4 Mpc^-3 at z ≳ 8. For somewhat rarer halos, this model predicts stellar masses of M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 10^9 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; can form in regions that end up with sizes O(100 pc) over 40 Myr time-scales at z≈ 12-14; these numbers compare well to measurements for some of the brightest galaxies at that epoch from James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations. Dark matter and standard cosmological evolution may therefore be crucial for explaining the surprisingly high levels of star formation in the early Universe revealed by JWST.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have revolutionized extragalactic research, particularly with the discovery of little red dots (LRD), which we propose are dust-reddened broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Their unique v-shape spectral feature observed through JWST/NIRCam challenges us to discern the relative contributions of the galaxy and AGN. We study a spectral energy distribution (SED) model for LRDs from rest-frame UV to infrared bands. We hypothesize that the incident radiation from an AGN, characterized by a typical SED, is embedded in an extended dusty medium with an extinction law similar to those seen in dense regions such as Orion Nebula or certain AGN environments. The UV-optical spectrum is described by dust-attenuated AGN emission, featuring a red optical continuum at &amp;lambda;&amp;gt;4000 A and a flat UV spectral shape established through a gray extinction curve at &amp;lambda;&amp;lt;3000 A, due to the absence of small-size grains. There is no need for additional stellar emission or AGN scattered light. In the infrared, the SED is shaped by an extended dust and gas distribution (&amp;gamma;&amp;lt;1; &amp;rho;&amp;prop; r^-&amp;gamma;) with a characteristic gas density of ≃ 10-10^3~cm^-3, which allows relatively cool dust temperatures to dominate the radiation, thereby shifting the energy peak from near- to mid-infrared bands. This model, unlike the typical AGN hot torus models, can produce an infrared SED flattening that is consistent with LRD observations through JWST MIRI. Such a density structure can arise from the coexistence of inflows and outflows during the early assembly of galactic nuclei. This might be the reason why LRDs emerge preferentially in the high-redshift universe younger than one billion years.

We analyse ultra-deep JWST observations of the galaxy JADES-GS-z9-0 at z = 9.4327, and derive detailed stellar and interstellar medium (ISM) properties of this luminous (MUV=-20.43) high-redshift system. Complementary information from NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec (both low- and medium-resolution) spectroscopy reveal a compact system (Re ~110 pc) characterised by a steeply rising star formation history, which is reflected in the inferred young stellar age (t ~ 3 Myr, light-weighted), high star-formation rate surface density (&amp;Sigma;SFR ~ 72 M yr-1 kpc-2), high ionisation parameter (log(U) ~ -1.5), low metallicity (12+log(O/H) ~ 7.5), and low carbon-over-oxygen abundance ([C/O] = -0.64). Leveraging the detection of N iii]1750 we derive nitrogen-over-oxygen abundance ([N/O] ~ 0) higher than the plateau followed by low-redshift galaxies of similar metallicity, possibly revealing the imprint from (very) massive stars on the ISM enrichment and favouring a top-heavy Initial Mass Function (IMF) scenario. Massive stars powering a hard radiation field are also required to explain the rest-frame UV line ratios, though the presence of the high-excitation [Ne v]&amp;lambda;3426 emission line possibly hints at additional ionization from an AGN. We also report the tentative detection of Ly&amp;alpha; emission in the G140M spectrum, shifted by ~450 km/s redward of the systemic redshift. Combined with a modelling of the Ly&amp;alpha; spectral break, we rule out the presence of very high column densities of neutral gas pertaining to local absorbers, as well as any extended surrounding ionised bubble, suggesting that JADES-GS-z9-0 has not yet significantly contributed to cosmic Reionization.

We present results on the emission-line properties of z=1.4-7.5 star-forming galaxies in the Assembly of Ultradeep Rest-optical Observations Revealing Astrophysics (AURORA) Cycle 1 JWST/NIRSpec program. Based on its depth, continuous wavelength coverage from 1&amp;ndash;5 microns, and medium spectral resolution (R~1000), AURORA includes detections of a large suite of nebular emission lines spanning a broad range in rest wavelength. We investigate the locations of AURORA galaxies in multiple different emission-line diagrams, including traditional "BPT" diagrams of [OIII]/Hbeta vs. [NII]/Halpha, [SII]/Halpha, and [OI]/Halpha, and the "ionization-metallicity" diagram of [OIII]/[OII] (O32) vs. ([OIII]+[OII])/Hbeta (R23). We also consider a bluer rest-frame "ionization-metallicity" diagram introduced recently to characterize z&amp;gt;10 galaxies: [NeIII]/[OII] vs. ([NeIII]+[OII])/Hdelta; as well as longer-wavelength diagnostic diagrams extending into the rest-frame near-IR: [OIII]/Hbeta vs. [SIII]/[SII] (S32); and HeI/Pagamma and [SIII]/Pagamma vs. [FeII]/Pabeta. With a significant boost in signal-to-noise and large, representative samples of individual galaxy detections, the AURORA emission-line diagrams presented here definitively confirm a physical picture in which chemically-young, alpha-enhanced, massive stars photoionize the ISM in distant galaxies with a harder ionizing spectrum at fixed nebular metallicity than in their z~0 counterparts. We also uncover previously unseen evolution prior to z~2 in the [OIII]/Hbeta vs. [NII]/Halpha diagram, which motivates deep NIRSpec observations at even higher redshift. Finally, we present the first statistical sample of rest-frame near-IR emission-line diagnostics in star-forming galaxies at high redshift. In order to truly interpret rest-frame near-IR line ratios including [FeII], we must obtain better constraints on dust depletion in the high-redshift ISM.

&lt;p&gt;
We present JWST NIRSpec observations in IFS mode of the galaxy GS5001 at redshift z=3.47, the central member of a candidate protocluster in the GOODS-S field. The data cover a field of view (FoV) of 4''×4'' (~30×30~kpc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and were obtained as part of the GA-NIFS GTO program. The observations include both high (R~2700) and low (R~100) spectral resolution data, spanning the rest-frame wavelength ranges 3700-6780A and 1300-11850A, respectively. We analyse the spatially resolved ionised gas kinematics and interstellar medium properties, including obscuration, gas metallicity, excitation, ionisation parameter, and electron density. In addition to the main galaxy (GS5001), the NIRSpec FoV covers three components in the south, with velocities blue-shifted by -150 km/s with respect to the main galaxy, and another source in the north redshifted by ~200 km/s. Optical line ratio diagnostics indicate star formation ionisation and electron densities of ~500 cm^-3 across all sources in the FoV. The gas-phase metallicity in the main galaxy is 12+log(O/H) = 8.45±0.04, and slightly lower in the companions (12+log(O/H) = 8.34-8.42), consistent with the mass-metallicity relation at z~3. We find peculiar line ratios (high log [NII]/H&amp;alpha;, low log [OIII]/H&amp;beta;) in the northern part of GS5001. These could be attributed to either higher metallicity, or to shocks resulting from the interaction of the main galaxy with the northern source. We identify a spatially resolved outflow in the main galaxy, with an extension of about 3 kpc. We find maximum outflow velocities of ~400 km/s, an outflow mass of (1.7±0.4)× 10^8 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, a mass outflow rate of 23±5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1 and a mass loading factor of 0.23. These properties are compatible with star formation being the driver of the outflow.

We analyze ionized gas emission lines in deep rest-frame optical spectra of 16 quiescent galaxies at redshift 1.7&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;3.5 observed with JWST/NIRSpec by the Blue Jay survey. Robust detection of emission lines in 75&amp;percnt; of the sample indicates the presence of ongoing ionizing sources in this passive population. The H&amp;alpha; line luminosities confirm that the population is quiescent, with star formation rates that are at least ten times lower than the main sequence of star formation. The quiescent sample is clearly separate from the star-forming population in line diagnostic diagrams, and occupies a region usually populated by active galactic nuclei (AGN). Analysis of the observed line ratios, equivalent widths, and velocity dispersions leads us to conclude that in most cases the gas is ionized by AGN activity, despite the lack of X-ray detections. A subset of the sample also hosts ionized and/or neutral outflows. Our results show, for the first time using a representative sample, that low luminosity AGN are extremely common among quiescent galaxies at high redshift. These low luminosity AGN may play a key role in quenching star formation and in maintaining massive galaxies quiescent from Cosmic Noon to z~0.

Recent JWST observations have uncovered an unexpectedly large population of massive quiescent galaxies at z&amp;gt;3. Using the cosmological simulations IllustrisTNG and ASTRID, we identify analogous galaxies and investigate their abundance, formation, quenching mechanisms, and post-quenching evolution for stellar masses 9.5 &amp;lt; log_10 (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;lt; 12. We apply three different quenching definitions and find that both simulations significantly underestimate the comoving number density of quenched massive galaxies at z ≳ 3 compared to JWST observations by up to ~ 2 dex. In both simulations, the high-z quenched massive galaxies often host overmassive central black holes above the local M_BH-M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; relation, implying that AGN feedback is key in quenching galaxies in the early Universe. The typical quenching timescales for these galaxies are ~ 200-600 Myr. IllustrisTNG primarily employs AGN kinetic feedback, while ASTRID relies on AGN thermal feedback at z &amp;gt; 2.3, which is less effective and has a longer quenching timescale. Although these simulations differ in many aspects, making a direct comparison challenging, our findings suggest the need for improved physical models of AGN feedback in galaxy formation simulations. At lower stellar masses, the quenched galaxies have denser local environments than the star-forming galaxies, suggesting that environmental quenching helps quench less massive galaxies. We also study the post-quenching evolution of the high-z massive quiescent galaxies and find that many experience subsequent reactivation of star formation, evolving into primary progenitors of z=0 brightest cluster galaxies.

&lt;p&gt;
"Godzilla" is a peculiar object within the gravitationally lensed Sunburst Arc at z=2.37. Despite being very bright, it appears in only one of the twelve lensed images of the source galaxy, and shows exotic spectroscopic properties not found in any other clumps. We use JWST's unique combination of spatial resolution and spectroscopic sensitivity to provide a unified, coherent explanation of the physical nature of Godzilla. We measure fluxes and kinematic properties of rest-optical emission lines in Godzilla and surrounding regions. Using standard line ratio-based diagnostic methods in combination with NIRCam imaging and ground based rest-UV spectra, we characterize Godzilla and its surroundings. Among around 60 detected lines, we find a cascade of strong O I lines pumped by intense Ly&amp;beta; emission, as well as Ly&amp;alpha;-pumped rest-optical Fe II lines, reminiscent of the Weigelt blobs in the local LBV star Eta Carinae. Spectra and images of Godzilla and two faint adjacent images, and the detection of a low-surface brightness foreground galaxy in the NIRCam data, support the interpretation that Godzilla is an extremely magnified object due to the alignment with lensing caustics. We find that Godzilla is part of a previously identified clump, comprising ~10 - 25 % of it, with magnifications in the range of ≈600-25,000 depending on the models and images in comparison. The unique O I source in Godzilla is well explained by a non-erupting LBV accompanied by a hotter companion and/or gas condensations exposed to more intense radiation compared to the Weigelt blobs. If Godzilla is confirmed to contain an LBV star, it expands the distance to the furthest known LBV from a dozen Mpc to several Gpc.

&lt;p&gt;
Context: While class II pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars have already accreted most of their mass, the continued inflow of fresh material via Bondi-Hoyle accretion acts as an additional mass reservoir for their circumstellar disks. This may explain the observed accretion rates of PMS stars, as well as observational inconsistencies in the mass and angular momentum balance of their disks. Aims: Using a new simulation that reproduces the stellar initial mass function (IMF), we want to quantify the role of Bondi-Hoyle accretion in the formation of class II disks, as well as address the prospect of its observational detection with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Methods: We studied the mass and angular momentum of the accreting gas using passively advected tracer particles in the simulation, and we carried out radiative transfer calculations of near-infrared scattering to generate synthetic JWST observations of Bondi-Hoyle trails of PMS stars. Results: Gas accreting on class II PMS stars approximately 1 Myr after their formation has enough mass and angular momentum to strongly affect the evolution of the preexisting disks. The accreted angular momentum is large enough to also explain the observed size of class II disks. The orientation of the angular momentum vector can differ significantly from that of the previously accreted gas, which may result in a significant disk warping or misalignment. We also predict that JWST observations of class II stars will be able to detect Bondi-Hoyle trails with a 80%-100% success rate with only a 2 min exposure time, depending on the filter, if stars with both an accretion rate M&amp;#775; &amp;gt; 5e-10 Msol/yr and a luminosity L &amp;gt; 0.5 Lsol are selected.

&lt;p&gt;
In less than two years of operation, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has already accelerated significantly our quest to identify active massive black holes (BHs) in the first billion years of the Universe's history. At the time of writing, about 50 AGN detections and candidates have been identified through spectroscopy, photometry, and/or morphology. Broad-line AGN are about a hundred times more numerous than the faint end of the UV-bright quasar population at z~5-6. In this paper, we compare the observational constraints on the abundance of these AGN at z~5 to the populations of AGN produced in large-scale cosmological simulations. Assuming a null fraction of obscured simulated AGN, we find that while some simulations produce more AGN than discovered so far, some others produce a similar abundance or even fewer AGN in the bolometric luminosity range probed by JWST. Keeping in mind the large uncertainty on the constraints, we discuss the implications for the theoretical modeling of BH formation and evolution in case similar constraints continue to accumulate. At the redshift of interest, the simulated AGN populations diverge the most at Lbol~1e44 erg/s (by more than a dex in the bolometric luminosity function). This regime is most affected by incompleteness in JWST surveys. However, it holds significant potential for constraining the physical processes determining the assembly of BHs (e.g., seeding, feedback from supernova and AGN) and the current abundance of broad-line AGN with &amp;gt;1e44.5 erg/s.

Over twenty years ago, Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) observations revealed an accelerating Universe expansion, suggesting a significant dark energy presence, often modelled as a cosmological constant,  &amp;Lambda; . Despite its pivotal role in cosmology, the standard &amp;Lambda;CDM model remains largely underexplored in the redshift range between distant SNIa and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). This study harnesses the James Webb Space Telescope's advanced capabilities to extend the Hubble flow mapping across an unprecedented redshift range, from  z ≈ 0  to  z ≈ 7.5 . Using a dataset of 231 HII galaxies and extragalactic HII regions, we employ the L-&amp;sigma; relation that correlates the luminosity of Balmer lines with their velocity dispersion, to define a competitive technique for measuring cosmic distances. This approach allows the mapping of the Universe expansion history over more than 12 billion years, covering 95&amp;percnt; of its age. Our analysis, using Bayesian inference, constrains the parameter space  &amp;lbrace;  h, &amp;Omega;_m, w_0 &amp;rbrace;  =  &amp;lbrace;  0.731±0.039, 0.302^+0.12_-0.069, -1.01^+0.52_-0.29 &amp;rbrace;  (statistical) for a flat Universe. Our results provide new insights into cosmic evolution and imply a lack of change in the photo-kinematical properties of the young massive ionizing clusters in HII galaxies across most of the history of the Universe.

We calculate the abundance of UV-bright galaxies in the presence of ultralight axion (ULA) dark matter (DM), finding that axions suppress their formation with a non-trivial dependence on redshift and luminosity. We set limits on axion DM using both Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) and UV luminosity function (UVLF) data. We exclude a single axion as all the DM for m_ax &amp;lt; 10^-21.6 eV and limit axions with -26 &amp;lt; log( m_ax/eV) &amp;lt; -23 to be less than 22&amp;percnt; of the DM (both limits at 95&amp;percnt; credibility). These limits use UVLF measurements from 24,000 sources from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) that probe small-scale structure at redshifts 4 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 10. We marginalize over a parametric model that connects halo mass and UV luminosity that has been shown to match hydrodynamical simulations. Our results bridge a window in axion mass and DM fraction previously unconstrained by cosmological data, between large-scale CMB and galaxy clustering and the small-scale Lyman-&amp;alpha; forest. These high-z measurements provide a powerful consistency check of low-z tests of axion DM, which include the recent hint for a sub-dominant ULA DM fraction in Lyman-&amp;alpha; forest data. We also consider a sample of 25 spectroscopically-confirmed high-z galaxies from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We find that these data are consistent with the HST UVLF assuming &amp;Lambda;CDM and our flexible parametric model of UV luminosity. Combining HST and JWST UVLF data does not improve our constraints beyond HST alone, but future JWST measurements have the potential to improve these results significantly. We also find an excess of low-mass halos (&amp;lt; 10^9 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) at z &amp;lt; 3, which could be probed by sub-galactic structure probes (e.g., stellar streams, satellite galaxies and strong lensing).

&lt;p&gt;
We present JWST NIRCam imaging of B14-65666 ("Big Three Dragons"), a bright Lyman-break galaxy system (M_UV=-22.5 mag) at z=7.15. The high angular resolution of NIRCam reveals the complex morphology of two galaxy components: galaxy E has a compact core (E-core), surrounded by diffuse, extended, rest-frame optical emission, which is likely to be tidal tails; and galaxy W has a clumpy and elongated morphology with a blue UV slope (&amp;beta;_UV=-2.2±0.1). The flux excess, F356W-F444W, peaks at the E-core (1.05^+0.08_-0.09 mag), tracing the presence of strong [OIII] 4960,5008 &amp;#8491; emission. ALMA archival data show that the bluer galaxy W is brighter in dust continua than the redder galaxy E, while the tails are bright in [OIII] 88 &amp;mu; m. The UV/optical and sub-mm SED fitting confirms that B14-65666 is a major merger in a starburst phase as derived from the stellar mass ratio (3:1 to 2:1) and the star-formation rate, ≃1 dex higher than the star-formation main sequence at the same redshift. The galaxy E is a dusty (A_V=1.2±0.1 mag) starburst with a possible high dust temperature (≥63-68 K). The galaxy W would have a low dust temperature (≤27-33 K) or patchy stellar-and-dust geometry, as suggested from the infrared excess (IRX) and &amp;beta;_UV diagram. The high optical-to-FIR [OIII] line ratio of the E-core shows its lower gas-phase metallicity (≃0.2-0.4 Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) than the galaxy W. These results agree with a scenario where major mergers disturb morphology and induce nuclear dusty starbursts triggered by less-enriched inflows. B14-65666 shows a picture of complex stellar buildup processes during major mergers in the epoch of reionization.

We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Integral Field Spectrograph observations of NGC 3256, a local infrared-luminous late-stage merging system with two nuclei roughly 1kpc apart, both of which have evidence of cold molecular outflows. Using JWST/NIRSpec and MIRI datasets, we investigate this morphologically complex system on spatial scales of &amp;lt;100pc, where we focus on the warm molecular H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas surrounding the nuclei. We detect collimated outflowing warm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas originating from the southern nucleus, though we do not find significant outflowing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas surrounding the northern nucleus. We measure maximum intrinsic outflow velocities of ~1,000kms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, which extend out to a distance of 0.7kpc. Based on H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; S(7)/S(1) ratios, we find a larger fraction of warmer gas near the S nucleus, which decreases with increasing distance from the nucleus, signifying the southern nucleus as a primary source of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heating. The gas mass of the warm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; outflow component is estimated to be M_warm,out=(1.4±0.2)×10^6M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, as much as 6&amp;percnt; of the cold H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mass estimated using ALMA CO data. The outflow time scale is about 7×10^5yr, resulting in a mass outflow rate M&amp;#775; _warm,out=2.0±0.8M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;yr^-1 and kinetic power P_warm,out~4×10^41ergs&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Lastly, regions within our 3.0"x3.0" NIRSpec data where the outflowing gas reside show high [Fe II]/Pa&amp;beta; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Br&amp;gamma; line ratios, indicate enhanced mechanical heating caused by the outflows. The fluxes and ratios of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) in these regions are not significantly different compared to those elsewhere in the disk, suggesting the outflows may not significantly alter the PAH ionization state or grain size.

We study the reionization of the Universe due to haloes that host galaxies undergoing bursts of star formation. By comparing the recent results from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation EAGLE at z≥ 6, we find that bursty galaxies have specific star formation rate, sSFR &amp;gt;10^-2 Myr^-1, and magnitude, M_UV≤ -17. Most of them reside in haloes of mass ~ 10^9 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and some in more massive haloes. We then construct the models of escape fraction and find that a skewed Gaussian function with a flat tail towards the high mass end best describes the mean dependence of escape fraction on halo mass, considering the haloes hosting bursty galaxies as the primary drivers of reionization. We implement the models of escape fraction in the code 21cmFAST to study the progress of reionization and derive the evolution of the mean ionized fraction that agrees well with observations. We also calculate the brightness temperature, spin temperature, and kinetic temperature and further study the spatial fluctuations in these quantities to gain insights into the progress of reionization. We compute the 21 cm power spectrum and predict a peak in power at 180 MHz corresponding to redshift, z≈ 6.8, that is testable by the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Our findings suggest that the Universe was reionized by the haloes of ≳ 10^9 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;
The search for dual supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is of immense interest in modern astrophysics. Galaxy mergers may fuel and produce SMBH pairs. Actively accreting SMBH pairs are observed as a dual quasar, which are vital probes of SMBH growth. Dual quasars at cosmic noon are not well characterized. Gaia observations have enabled a novel technique to identify dual quasars at kpc scales, based on the small jitters of the light centroid as the two quasars vary stochastically. We present the first detailed study of a z=2.17, 0.46'', 3.8 kpc separation dual quasar, J0749+2255, using JWST/NIRSpec integral field unit spectroscopy. Identified by Gaia, J0749+2255 is one of the most distant, small separation dual quasars known. We detect the faint ionized gas of the host galaxy, traced by the narrow Ha emission. Line ratios indicate ionization from the two quasars and from intense star formation. Spectral analysis of the two quasars suggests that they have similar black hole properties, hinting at the possible synchronized accretion activity or lensed quasar images. Surprisingly, the ionized gas kinematics suggest a rotating disk rather than a disturbed system expected in a major gas-rich galaxy merger. Numerical simulations show that this is a plausible outcome of a major gas-rich galaxy merger several tens of Myr before coalescence. Whether J0749+2255 reflects an interesting phase of dual quasar evolution or is a lensed quasar remains unclear. Thus, this study underscores the challenges in definitively distinguishing between a dual and lensed quasars, with observations supporting either scenario.

We utilize deep JWST NIRCam observations for the first direct constraints on the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function (GSMF) at z&amp;gt;10. Our EPOCHS v1 sample includes 1120 galaxy candidates at 6.5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;13.5 taken from a consistent reduction and analysis of publicly available deep JWST NIRCam data covering the PEARLS, CEERS, GLASS, JADES GOOD-S, NGDEEP, and SMACS0723 surveys, totalling 187 arcmin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. We investigate the impact of SED fitting methods, assumed star formation histories (SFH), dust laws, and priors on galaxy masses and the resultant GSMF. Whilst our fiducial GSMF agrees with the literature at z&amp;lt;13.5, we find that the assumed SFH model has a large impact on the GSMF and stellar mass density (SMD), finding a 0.75~dex increase in the SMD at z=10.5 between a flexible non-parametric and standard parametric SFH. Overall, we find a flatter SMD evolution at z ≥ 9 than some studies predict, suggesting a rapid buildup of stellar mass in the early Universe. We find no incompatibility between our results and those of standard cosmological models, as suggested previously, although the most massive galaxies may require a high star formation efficiency. We find that the "Little Red Dot" galaxies dominate the z=7 GSMF at high-masses, necessitating a better understanding of the relative contributions of AGN and stellar emission. We show that assuming a theoretically motivated top-heavy IMF reduces stellar mass by 0.5~dex without affecting fit quality, but our results remain consistent with existing cosmological models with a standard IMF.

The JWST discovery of "little red dots'' (LRDs) is reshaping our picture of the early Universe, yet the physical mechanisms driving their compact size and UV-optical colors remain elusive. Here we report an unusually bright LRD (z=3.1) observed as part of the RUBIES program. This LRD exhibits broad emission lines (FWHM ~4000km/s), a blue UV continuum, a clear Balmer break and a red continuum sampled out to rest 4 &amp;mu;m with MIRI. We develop a new joint galaxy and AGN model within the Prospector Bayesian inference framework and perform spectrophotometric modeling using NIRCam, MIRI, and NIRSpec/Prism observations. Our fiducial model reveals a M_*~ 10^9M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; galaxy alongside a dust-reddened AGN driving the optical emission. Explaining the rest-frame optical color as a reddened AGN requires A_v≳3, suggesting that a great majority of the accretion disk energy is re-radiated as dust emission. Yet despite clear AGN signatures, we find a surprising lack of hot torus emission, which implies that either the dust emission in this object must be cold, or the red continuum must instead be driven by a massive, evolved stellar population of the host galaxy &amp;ndash; seemingly inconsistent with the high EW broad lines (H&amp;alpha; EW ~800&amp;#8491;). The widths and luminosities of Pa&amp;beta;, Pa&amp;delta;, Pa&amp;gamma;, and H&amp;alpha; imply a modest black hole mass of M_BH~10^8M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. Additionally, we identify a narrow blue-shifted HeI absorption in G395M spectra, signaling an ionized outflow with kinetic energy up to ~1&amp;percnt; the luminosity of the AGN. The low redshift of RUBIES-BLAGN-1 combined with the depth and richness of the JWST imaging and spectroscopic observations provide a unique opportunity to build a physical model for these so-far mysterious LRDs, which may prove to be a crucial phase in the early formation of massive galaxies and their supermassive black holes.

The identity of dark matter has been a mystery in astronomy, cosmology, and particle theory for about a century. Bessho, Ikeda, and Yin (2022), three of the current authors, proposed using the state-of-the-art infrared spectrographs, including WINERED at 6.5m Magellan Clay telescope and NIRSpec at James Webb Space Telescope, as efficient detectors for the indirect detection of dark matter with the mass around eV by measuring the line photons from the dark matter two body decays. Applying this concept, we have performed spectrographic observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) Leo V and Tucana II using WINERED by utilizing an object-sky-object nodding observation technique for background subtraction. We present the first result from this dark matter search. Employing zero consistent flux data after the sky subtraction, we have established one of the most stringent limits to date on dark matter decaying into line photons in the mass range of 1.8-2.7 eV. Our data can also be applied to constrain other spectra of photons from the dSphs.

Resolved stellar morphology of z&amp;gt;1 galaxies was inaccessible before JWST. This limitation, due to the impact of dust on rest-frame UV light, had withheld major observational conclusions required to understand the importance of clumps in galaxy evolution. Essentially independent of this issue, we use the rest-frame near-IR for a stellar-mass dependent clump detection method and determine reliable estimations of selection effects. We exploit publicly available JWST/NIRCam and HST/ACS imaging data from CEERS, to create a stellar-mass based picture of clumps in a mass-complete sample of 418 galaxies within a wide wavelength coverage of 0.5-4.6 &amp;mu;m and a redshift window of 1 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 2. We find that a near-IR detection gives access to a larger, and possibly different, set of clumps within galaxies, with those also detected in UV making up only 28&amp;percnt;. Whereas, 85&amp;percnt; of the UV clumps are found to have a near-IR counterpart. These near-IR clumps closely follow the UVJ classification of their respective host galaxies, with these hosts mainly populating the star-forming regime besides a fraction of them (16&amp;percnt;) that can be considered quiescent. The mass of the detected clumps are found to be within the range of 10^7.5-9.5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, therefore expected to drive gas into galaxy cores through tidal torques. The clump stellar mass function is found to have a slope of -1.50 ± 0.14, indicating a hierarchical nature similar to that of star-forming regions in the local Universe. Finally, we observe a radial gradient of increasing clump mass towards the centre of galaxies.

We present mock JWST observations for more than 250,000 different galaxies from the Astrid simulation with 3 ≤ z ≤ 6. The mock observations are made using the BPASS stellar SED model, and a simple dust model. They are then viewed through NIRCam filters, convolved with a PSF, have noise added, and are drizzled together to emulate the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey. We analyse this dataset by computing a number of morphological measures and find our catalog to have comparable statistics to similar mock catalogs, and the first release of CEERS data. We find that most of the Sersic indices of galaxies in our redshift range are lower than observed, with most having n less than one. Additionally, we observe the sizes of galaxies of all masses to increase from redshift z=6 to redshift z=3 consistent with other results. The number of galaxies in our catalog allows us to examine how relationships like the mass-size relation evolve with redshift, and compare the accuracy of a variety of traditional galaxy classification techniques (Sersic fit, Asymmetry-Concentration, and Gini-M_20) within our redshift range. We find the mass-size relation to be nearly flat at redshift z=6, and consistently increases as redshift decreases, and find the galaxy classification methods have minimal correlation with each other in our redshift range. We also investigate the impact that different stages of our imaging pipeline have on these morphological measures to determine how robust mock catalogs are to different choices at each step. Finally, we test the addition of incorporating light from AGNs into our pipeline and find that while the population of galaxies that have significant AGN luminosity is low, those galaxies do tend to have higher Sersic indices once the AGN luminosity is added, rectifying some of the systematic bias towards lower Sersic indices present in our dataset.

With its sensitivity in the rest-frame optical, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered active galactic nuclei (AGN), comprising both intrinsically faint and heavily reddened sources, well into the first billion years of the Universe, at z ~ 4-11. In this work, we revisit the AGN contribution to reionization given the high number densities associated with these objects. We use the DELPHI semi-analytic model, base-lined against the latest high-redshift datasets from the JWST and the Atacama Large millimetre Array (ALMA) to model early star forming galaxies and AGN. We calculate the escape fractions of ionizing radiation from both star formation and AGN and include the impact of reionization feeback in suppressing the baryonic content of low-mass galaxies in ionized regions. This model is validated against the key observables for star forming galaxy, AGN and reionization. In our  fiducial model, reionization reaches its mid-point at z ~ 6.9 and ends by z ~ 5.9. Low stellar mass (M_*≤ 10^9M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) star forming galaxies are found to be the key drivers of the reionization process, providing about 77&amp;percnt; of the total photon budget. Despite their high numbers, high accretion rates and higher escape fractions compared to star forming galaxies at z ~ 5, AGN only provide about 23&amp;percnt; of the total reionization budget which is dominated by black holes in high stellar mass systems (with M_* ≥ 10^9M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;). This is because AGN number densities become relevant only at z ≤ 7 - as a result, AGN contribute as much as galaxies as late as z ~ 6.2, when reionization is already in its end stages. Finally, we find that even contrasting models of the AGN ionizing photon escape fraction (increasing or decreasing with stellar mass) do not qualitatively change our results.

We report unbiased AI measurements of the fine structure constant &amp;alpha; in two proximate absorption regions in the spectrum of the quasar HE0515-4414. The data are high resolution, high signal to noise, and laser frequency comb calibrated, obtained using the ESPRESSO spectrograph on the VLT. The high quality of the data and proximity of the regions motivate a differential comparison, exploring the possibility of spatial variations of fundamental constants, as predicted in some theories. We show that if the magnesium isotopic relative abundances are terrestrial, the fine structure constants in these two systems differ at the 7&amp;sigma; level. A 3&amp;sigma; discrepancy between the two measurements persists even for the extreme non-terrestrial case of 100&amp;percnt; ^24Mg, if shared by both systems. However, if Mg isotopic abundances take independent values in these two proximate systems, one terrestrial, the other with no heavy isotopes, both can be reconciled with a terrestrial &amp;alpha;, and the discrepancy between the two measurements falls to 2&amp;sigma;. We cannot rule out other systematics that are unaccounted for in our study that could masquerade as a varying alpha signal. We discuss varying constant and varying isotope interpretations and resolutions to this conundrum for future high precision measurements.

We present the identification of 42 narrow-line active galactic nuclei (type-2 AGN) candidates in the two deepest observations of the JADES spectroscopic survey with JWST/NIRSpec. The spectral coverage and the depth of our observations allow us to select narrow-line AGNs based on both rest-frame optical and UV emission lines up to z=10. Due to the metallicity decrease of galaxies, at z&amp;gt;3 the standard optical diagnostic diagrams (N2-BPT or S2-VO87) become unable to distinguish many AGN from other sources of photoionisation. Therefore, we also use high ionisation lines, such as HeII&amp;lambda;4686, HeII&amp;lambda;1640, NeIV&amp;lambda;2422, NeV&amp;lambda;3420, and NV&amp;lambda;1240, also in combination with other UV transitions, to trace the presence of AGN. Out of a parent sample of 209 galaxies, we identify 42 type-2 AGN (although 10 of them are tentative), giving a fraction of galaxies in JADES hosting type-2 AGN of about 20±3&amp;percnt;, which does not evolve significantly in the redshift range between 2 and 10. The selected type-2 AGN have estimated bolometric luminosities of 10^41.3-44.9 erg s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and host-galaxy stellar masses of 10^7.2-9.3 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. The star formation rates of the selected AGN host galaxies are consistent with those of the star-forming main sequence. The AGN host galaxies at z=4-6 contribute ~8-30 &amp;percnt; to the UV luminosity function, slightly increasing with UV luminosity.

We study outflows in 130 galaxies with -22&amp;lt;MUV&amp;lt;-16 at z=3-9 identified in JWST NIRSpec and NIRCam WFSS data taken by the ERO, CEERS, FRESCO, GLASS, and JADES programs. We identify 30 out of the 130 galaxies with broad components of FWHM~200-700 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the emission lines of H&amp;alpha; and [OIII] that trace ionized outflows, and find no excesses from the star-formation main sequence. Four out of the 30 outflowing galaxies are Type-1 AGN whose H&amp;alpha; emission lines include line profile components as broad as FWHM&amp;gt;1000 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; while one galaxy is identified as a Type-2 AGN by high ionization emission lines. With the velocity shift and line widths of the outflow broad lines, we obtain ~80-500 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for the outflow velocities. We find that the outflow velocities are slower than low-z galaxies with similar SFRs, which may be explained by the low stellar masses of high-z galaxies. The outflow velocities of AGNs are large but not significantly different from the others. Interestingly, these outflow velocities are typically not high enough to escape from the galactic potentials, possibly suggesting fountain-type outflows. We estimate mass loading factors &amp;eta; to be 0.1-1 that are not particularly large, but comparable with those of z~1 outflows. The large fraction of galaxies with outflows (30% with high resolution data) provides constraints on outflow parameters, suggesting a wide opening angle of &amp;gt;45 deg and a large duty-cycle of &amp;gt;30%, which gives a picture of more frequent and spherical outflows in high-z galaxies.

Merger events can trigger gas accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) located at the centre of galaxies, and form close pairs of AGN. The fraction of AGN in pairs offers critical insights into the dynamics of galaxy interactions, SMBH growth, and their co-evolution with host galaxies. However, the identification of dual AGN is difficult, as it requires high-quality spatial and spectral data; hence, only very few pairs have been found in the distant Universe so far. This study aims to provide a first observational estimate of the fraction of dual AGN at 2&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6 by analysing a sample of 16 AGN observed with JWST/NIRSpec IFS, as part of the GA-NIFS survey. For two AGN in our sample, we also incorporate archival VLT/MUSE data to expand the search area. We searched for nearby companion galaxies and emission-line sources within the ~20x20 kpc field of view of the NIRSpec data cubes, extending up to ~50 kpc using the MUSE data cubes. We analysed the spectra of such emitters to determine their physical and kinematic properties. We report the serendipitous discovery of a triple AGN and four dual AGN (two of which considered as candidates), with projected separations in the range 3-28 kpc. Their AGN classification is mainly based on standard optical emission line flux ratios, as observed with JWST/NIRSpec, and is complemented with additional multi-wavelength diagnostics. The identification of these 3-5 multiple AGN out of the 16 AGN systems in GA-NIFS (i.e. ~20-30%) suggests they might be more common than previously thought based on other observational campaigns. Moreover, our inferred fraction of dual AGN moderately exceeds predictions from cosmological simulations that mimic our observational criteria (~10%). This work highlights the exceptional capabilities of NIRSpec for detecting distant dual AGN, and prompts new investigations to constrain their fraction across cosmic time.

We present the survey design and initial results of the ALMA Cycle 9 program of DUALZ, which aims to establish a joint ALMA and JWST public legacy field targeting the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744. DUALZ features a contiguous 4'×6' ALMA 30-GHz-wide mosaic in Band 6, covering areas of &amp;mu;&amp;gt;2 down to a sensitivity of &amp;sigma;=32.7~&amp;mu;Jy. Through a blind search, we identified 69 dust continuum sources at S/N ≳5.0 with median redshift and intrinsic 1.2-mm flux of z=2.30 and S_1.2mm^int=0.24~mJy. Of these, 27 have been spectroscopically confirmed, leveraged by the latest NIRSpec observations, while photometric redshift estimates are constrained by the comprehensive HST, NIRCam, and ALMA data for the remaining sources. With priors, we further identify a [CII]158 &amp;mu;m line emitter at z=6.3254±0.0004, confirmed by the latest NIRSpec spectroscopy. The NIRCam counterparts of the 1.2-mm continuum exhibit undisturbed morphologies, denoted either by disk or spheroid, implying the triggers for the faint mm emission are less catastrophic than mergers. We have identified 8 HST-dark galaxies (F150W&amp;gt;27mag, F150W-F444W&amp;gt;2.3) and 2 JWST-dark (F444W&amp;gt;30mag) galaxy candidates among the ALMA continuum sources. The former includes face-on disk galaxies, hinting that substantial dust obscuration does not always result from inclination. We also detect a marginal dust emission from an X-ray-detected galaxy at z&lt;sub&gt;spec&lt;/sub&gt;=10.07, suggesting an active co-evolution of the central black hole and its host. We assess the infrared luminosity function up to z~10 and find it consistent with predictions from galaxy formation models. To foster diverse scientific outcomes from the community, we publicly release reduced ALMA mosaic maps, cubes, and the source catalog.

Dual-phase xenon time projection chamber (TPC) detectors offer heightened sensitivities for dark matter detection across a spectrum of particle masses. To broaden their capability to low-mass dark matter interactions, we investigated the light and charge responses of liquid xenon (LXe) to sub-keV nuclear recoils. Using neutron events from a pulsed Adelphi Deuterium-Deuterium neutron generator, an in situ calibration was conducted on the LUX detector. We demonstrate direct measurements of light and charge yields down to 0.45 keV and 0.27 keV, respectively, both approaching single quanta production, the physical limit of LXe detectors. These results hold significant implications for the future of dual-phase xenon TPCs in detecting low-mass dark matter via nuclear recoils.

Infrared spectroscopy has been developed significantly. In particular, infrared photons can be measured with high spectral and angular resolution in state-of-art spectrographs. They are sensitive to monochromatic photons due to the decay and annihilation of particles beyond the Standard Model, such as dark matter (DM), while insensitive to background photons that form a continuous spectrum. In this paper, we study the indirect detection of the DM decaying into infrared light using infrared spectrographs. In particular, we show that serious thermal and astrophysical noises can be overcome. As concrete examples, the Warm INfrared Echelle spectrograph to Realize Extreme Dispersion and sensitivity (WINERED) installed at the Magellan Clay 6.5m telescope and Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) at the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are discussed. We show that a few hours of measurements of a faint dwarf spheroidal galaxy with WINERED (NIRSpec-like spectrograph) in the Magellan telescope (JWST) can probe an axion-like particle DM in the mass range m_&amp;phi;=1.8 - 2.7 eV (0.5-4 eV) with a photon coupling g_&amp;phi;&amp;gamma;&amp;gamma;≳ 10^-11 GeV^-1. Complemental approaches, taking advantage of the high resolutions, such as the measurement of the Doppler shift of the signal photon lines and the possible search of the DM decay around the Milky Way galaxy center with Infrared Camera and Spectrograph (IRCS) at 8.2m Subaru telescope, are also presented.
