&lt;p&gt;
The relationship between B-field orientation and density structure in molecular clouds is often assessed using the Histogram of Relative Orientations (HRO). We perform a plane-of-the-sky geometrical analysis of projected B-fields, by interpreting HROs in dense, spheroidal, prestellar and protostellar cores. We use James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) POL-2 850 &amp;mu;m polarisation maps and Herschel column density maps to study dense cores in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud complex. We construct two-dimensional core models, assuming Plummer column density profiles and modelling both linear and hourglass B-fields. We find high-aspect-ratio ellipsoidal cores produce strong HRO signals, as measured using the shape parameter \xi. Cores with linear fields oriented &amp;lt; 45^{\circ} from their minor axis produce constant HROs with -1 &amp;lt; \xi &amp;lt; 0, indicating fields are preferentially parallel to column density gradients. Fields parallel to the core minor axis produce the most negative value of \xi. For low-aspect-ratio cores, \xi \approx 0 for linear fields. Hourglass fields produce a minimum in \xi at intermediate densities in all cases, converging to the minor-axis-parallel linear field value at high and low column densities. We create HROs for six dense cores in Ophiuchus. \rho Oph A and IRAS 16293 have high aspect ratios and preferentially negative HROs, consistent with moderately strong-field behaviour. \rho Oph C, L1689A and L1689B have low aspect ratios, and \xi \approx 0. \rho Oph B is too complex to be modelled using a simple spheroidal field geometry. We see no signature of hourglass fields, agreeing with previous findings that dense cores generally exhibit linear fields on these size scales.

Recent findings from photometric and spectroscopic JWST surveys have identified examples of high-redshift galaxies at z \gtrsim 10. These high-z galaxies appear to form much earlier and exhibit greater UV luminosity than predicted by theoretical work. In this study, our goal is to reproduce the brightness of these sources by simulating high-redshift galaxies with virial masses M_{\rm vir} = 10^{9} - 10^{10} M_{\odot} at z &amp;gt; 10. To achieve this, we conduct cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations, modifying baryonic sub-grid physics, and post-process our simulation results to confirm the observability of our simulated galaxies. Specifically, we enhanced star formation activity in high-redshift galaxies by either increasing the star formation efficiency up to 100&amp;percnt; or adopting a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF). Our simulation results indicate that both increasing star formation efficiency and adopting a top-heavy IMF play crucial roles in boosting the UV luminosity of high-redshift galaxies, potentially exceeding the limiting magnitude of JWST surveys in earlier epochs. Especially, the episodic starburst resulting from enhanced star formation efficiency may explain the high-redshift galaxies observed by JWST, as it evacuates dust from star-forming regions, making the galaxies more observable. We demonstrate this correlation between star formation activity and dust mass evolution within the simulated galaxies. Also, adopting a top-heavy IMF could enhance observability due to an overabundance of massive stars, although it may also facilitate rapid metal enrichment. Using our simulation results, we derive several observables such as effective radius, UV slope, and emission line rates, which could serve as valuable theoretical estimates for comparison with existing spectroscopic results and forthcoming data from the JWST NIRSpec and MIRI instruments.

Lya Luminosity Functions and Angular Correlation Functions from ~20,000 Lya Emitters at z~2.2-7.3 from upto 24 {\rm deg}^2 HSC-SSP and CHORUS Surveys: Linking the Post-Reionization Epoch to the Heart of Reionization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15495v1</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;
We present the luminosity functions (LFs) and angular correlation functions (ACFs) derived from 18,960 Ly\alpha emitters (LAEs) at z=2.2-7.3 over a wide survey area of \lesssim24 {\rm deg^2} that are identified in the narrowband data of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) and the Cosmic HydrOgen Reionization Unveiled with Subaru (CHORUS) surveys. Confirming the large sample with the 241 spectroscopically identified LAEs, we determine Ly\alpha LFs and ACFs in the brighter luminosity range down to 0.5L_{\star}, and confirm that our measurements are consistent with previous studies but offer significantly reduced statistical uncertainties. The improved precision of our ACFs allows us to clearly detect one-halo terms at some redshifts, and provides large-scale bias measurements that indicate hosting halo masses of ~ 10^{11} M_\odot over z~eq 2-7. By comparing our Ly\alpha LF (ACF) measurements with reionization models, we estimate the neutral hydrogen fractions in the intergalactic medium to be x_{\rm \HI}&amp;lt;0.05 (={0.06}^{+0.12}_{-0.03}), 0.15^{+0.10}_{-0.08} ({0.21}^{+0.19}_{-0.14}), 0.18^{+0.14}_{-0.12}, and 0.75^{+0.09}_{-0.13} at z=5.7, 6.6, 7.0, and 7.3, respectively. Our findings suggest that the neutral hydrogen fraction remains relatively low, x_{\rm \HI} \lesssim 0.2, at z=5-7, but increases sharply at z &amp;gt; 7, reaching x_{\rm \HI} ~ 0.9 by z ~eq 8-9, as indicated by recent JWST studies. The combination of our results from LAE observations with recent JWST observations suggests that the major epoch of reionization occurred around z ~ 7-8, likely driven by the emergence of massive sources emitting significant ionizing photons.

We examine the quiescent fractions of massive galaxies in six z\gtrsim3 spectroscopically-confirmed protoclusters in the COSMOS field, one of which is newly confirmed and presented here. We report the spectroscopic confirmation of MAGAZ3NE~J100143+023021 at z=3.122^{+0.007}_{-0.004} by the Massive Ancient Galaxies At z&amp;gt;3 NEar-infrared (MAGAZ3NE) survey. MAGAZ3NE~J100143+023021 contains a total of 79 protocluster members (28 spectroscopic and 51 photometric). Three spectroscopically-confirmed members are star-forming ultra-massive galaxies (\log(M_{\star}/{\rm M}_\odot)&amp;gt;11; UMGs), the most massive of which has \log(M_{\star}/{\rm M}_\odot)=11.15^{+0.05}_{-0.06}. Combining Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy and the COSMOS2020 photometric catalog, we use a weighted Gaussian kernel density estimator to map the protocluster and measure its total mass 2.25^{+1.55}_{-0.65}\times10^{14}~{\rm M}_{\odot} in the dense ``core'' region. For each of the six COSMOS protoclusters, we compare the quiescent fraction to the status of the central UMG as star-forming or quiescent. We observe that galaxies in these protoclusters appear to obey galactic conformity: elevated quiescent fractions are found in protoclusters with UVJ quiescent UMGs and low quiescent fractions are found in protoclusters containing UVJ star-forming UMGs. This correlation of star-formation/quiescence in UMGs and the massive galaxies nearby in these protoclusters is the first evidence for the existence of galactic conformity at z&amp;gt;3. Despite disagreements over mechanisms behind conformity at low redshifts, its presence at these early cosmic times would provide strong constraints on the physics proposed to drive galactic conformity.

&lt;p&gt;
The UV continuum slope of galaxies, \beta, is a powerful diagnostic. Understanding the redshift evolution of \beta and its dependence on key galaxy properties can shed light on the evolution of galaxy physical properties over cosmic time. In this study, we present \beta measurements for 295 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at 5.5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;14.3 selected primarily from JADES, where \beta has been measured from high quality JWST NIRSpec/PRISM spectra. We find a median \beta=-2.3 across our full sample, and find mild increase in blueness of \beta with increasing redshift and fainter UV magnitudes. Interestingly, we find evidence for the average \beta at z &amp;gt; 9.5 to begin to redden, deviating from the trend observed at z &amp;lt; 9.5. By producing stacked spectra in bins of redshift and \beta, we derive trends between \beta and dust attenuation, metallicity, ionization parameter, and stellar age indicators directly from spectra, finding a lack of dust attenuation to be the dominant driver of bluer \beta values. We further report six galaxies with \beta&amp;lt;-3.0, which show a range of spectroscopic properties and signs of significant LyC photon leakage. Finally, we show that the redder \beta values at z &amp;gt; 9.5 may require rapid build-up of dust reservoirs in the very early Universe or a significant contribution from the nebular continuum emission to the observed UV spectra, with the nebular continuum fraction depending on the gas temperatures and densities. Our modeling shows that in the absence of dust, nebular emission at T &amp;gt; 15,000 K can reproduce the range of \beta that we see in our sample. Higher gas temperatures driven by hot, massive stars can boost the fraction of nebular continuum emission, potentially explaining the observed \beta values as well as bright UV magnitudes seen across galaxies at z &amp;gt; 10.

&lt;p&gt;
We present a catalog of 35 new candidate (13 high confidence) isolated, young stellar systems within the Virgo galaxy cluster identified through a citizen science search of public optical and ultraviolet imaging. "Blue blobs" are a class of blue, faint, isolated, extremely low stellar mass, and metal-rich star-forming clouds embedded in the hot intracluster medium of the Virgo cluster. Only six blue blobs were known previously and here we confirm an additional six of our candidates through velocity and metallicity measurements from follow-up optical spectroscopy on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET). Our 13 high confidence candidates (including the six confirmed) have properties consistent with prior known blue blobs and are inconsistent with being low-mass galaxies. Most candidates are concentrated in relatively dense regions, roughly following filamentary structures within the cluster, but avoiding its center. Three of our candidates are likely the stellar counterparts of known 'optically dark' clouds of neutral hydrogen in the cluster, while a further four are widely separated extensions to previously known blue blobs. The properties of our new candidates are consistent with previous conclusions that blue blobs likely originated from ram pressure stripping events, however, their locations in velocity--projected cluster-centric radius phase-space imply that their parent galaxies are not on their first infall into the cluster. Through our ongoing follow-up program with HET we aim to confirm additional candidates, however, detailed understanding of the stellar populations and star formation histories of blue blobs will require JWST observations.

We present the large-scale distribution and kinematics of cold molecular gas across the compact galaxy group Stephan's Quintet, based on CO(2-1) observations performed with the Atacama Compact Array (ACA) and CO(1-0) data from the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA). We find coherent structures of molecular gas associated with the galaxies and intra-group medium, which follow the distribution of warm H_{2} previously seen with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). CO is associated with a ridge of shocked gas that crosses the galaxy group, and with a spiral arm of the intruding galaxy NGC7318b, which interacts with the intra-group medium along the ridge. Although the ridge contains widespread shocks, turbulent gas, and warm H_{2}, the CO lines are narrower than elsewhere in Stephan's Quintet (FWHM~25-65 km/s), indicative of settled cold gas. At a distinctly different velocity, CO is found in the active galaxy NGC7319 and Northern star-forming region SQ-A. A bridge of turbulent molecular gas connects NGC7319 with the ridge, covering a gap of ~700 km/s between these structures. The gas excitation ranges from L'_{\rm CO(2-1)}/L'_{\rm CO(1-0)} ~ 0.3 in the bridge and SQ-A, to ~0.5 along the ridge, to near unity in the center of NGC7319. We also detect either a molecular outflow or turbulent molecular gas associated with the radio source in NGC7319. These ACA data are part of a program with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and JWST to study molecular gas physics from the largest to the smallest scales across the intra-group medium of Stephan's Quintet.

We present the application of the image coaddition algorithm, Up-sampling and PSF Deconvolution Coaddition (UPDC), for stacking multiple exposure images captured by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam). By addressing the point spread function (PSF) effect, UPDC provides visually enhanced and sharper images. Furthermore, the anti-aliasing and super-resolution capabilities of UPDC make it easier to deblend sources overlapped on images, yielding a higher accuracy of aperture photometry. We apply this algorithm to the SMACS J0723 imaging data. Comparative analysis with the Drizzle algorithm demonstrates significant improvements in detecting faint sources, achieving accurate photometry, and effectively deblending (super-resolution) closely packed sources. {As a result, we have newly detected a pair of close binary stars that were previously unresolvable in the original exposures or the Drizzled image.} These improvements significantly benefit various scientific projects conducted by JWST. The resulting dataset, named "UPdec-Webb", can be accessible through the official website of the Chinese Virtual Observatory (ChinaVO).

Studying the distribution and properties of ionised gas in outflows driven by AGN is crucial for understanding the feedback mechanisms at play in extragalactic environments. In this study, we explore the connection between ionised outflows traced by rest-frame UV absorption and optical emission lines in GS133, a Compton thick AGN at z = 3.47. We combine observations from the JWST NIRSpec Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) with archival VLT VIMOS long-slit spectroscopic data, as part of the GA-NIFS project. We perform a multi-component kinematic decomposition of the UV and optical line profiles to derive the physical properties of the absorbing and emitting gas in GS133. Our kinematic decomposition reveals two distinct components in the optical lines. The first component likely traces a rotating disk with a dynamical mass of 2e10 Msun. The second component corresponds to a galaxy-wide, bi-conical outflow, with a velocity of 1000 km/s and an extension of 3 kpc. The UV absorption lines show two outflow components, with bulk velocities v_out = -900 km/s and -1900 km/s, respectively. This characterises GS133 as a mini-BAL system. Balmer absorption lines with similar velocities are tentatively detected in the NIRSpec spectrum. Both photoionisation models and outflow energetics suggest that the ejected absorbing gas is located at 1-10 kpc from the AGN. We use 3D gas kinematic modelling to infer the orientation of the [O III] bi-conical outflow, and find that a portion of the emitting gas resides along our line of sight, suggesting that [O III] and absorbing gas clouds are partially mixed in the outflow. The derived mass-loading factor (i.e. the mass outflow rate divided by the SFR) of 1-10, and the kinetic coupling efficiency (i.e. the kinetic power divided by LAGN) of 0.1-1% per cent suggest that the outflow in GS133 provides significant feedback on galactic scales.

We present a detailed study of the large-scale shock front in Stephan's Quintet, a byproduct of past and ongoing interactions. Using integral-field spectroscopy from the new William Herschel Telescope Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer (WEAVE), recent 144 MHz observations from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS), and archival data from the Very Large Array and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we obtain new measurements of key shock properties and determine its impact on the system. Harnessing the WEAVE large integral field unit's (LIFU) field of view (90 \times 78 arcsec^{2}), spectral resolution (R~2500) and continuous wavelength coverage across the optical band, we perform robust emission line modeling and dynamically locate the shock within the multi-phase intergalactic medium (IGM) with higher precision than previously possible. The shocking of the cold gas phase is hypersonic, and comparisons with shock models show that it can readily account for the observed emission line ratios. In contrast, we demonstrate that the shock is relatively weak in the hot plasma visible in X-rays (with Mach number of \mathcal{M} ~ 2 - 4), making it inefficient at producing the relativistic particles needed to explain the observed synchrotron emission. Instead, we propose that it has led to an adiabatic compression of the medium, which has increased the radio luminosity ten-fold. Comparison of the Balmer line-derived extinction map with the molecular gas and hot dust observed with JWST suggests that pre-existing dust may have survived the collision, allowing the condensation of H_{2} - a key channel for dissipating the shock energy.

We report the discovery of five galaxy candidates at redshifts between 15.9&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;18.6 in JWST observations from the GLIMPSE survey. These robust sources were identified using a combination of Lyman-break selection and photometric redshift estimates. The ultra-deep NIRCam imaging from GLIMPSE, combined with the strong gravitational lensing of the Abell S1063 galaxy cluster, allows us to probe an intrinsically fainter population (down to M_{\rm UV}=-17.5 mag) than previously achievable. These galaxies have absolute magnitudes ranging from M_{\rm UV}= -17.7 to -18.0 mag, with UV continuum slopes between \beta ~eq -2.3 and \beta ~eq -3.0, consistent with young, dust-free stellar populations. The number density of these objects, log_{\rm 10} (\phi/[Mpc^{-3} mag^{-1}])=-3.43^{+0.28}_{-0.64} at M_{\rm UV}=-18 is in clear tension with pre-JWST theoretical predictions, extending the over-abundance of galaxies from z~10 to z~ 18.6. These results, together with the scarcity of brighter galaxies in other public surveys, suggest a steep decline in the bright-end of the UV luminosity function at z ~ 17, implying efficient star formation and possibly a close connection to the halo mass function at these redshifts. Testing a variety of star formation histories suggests that these sources are plausible progenitors of the unusually UV-bright galaxies that JWST now routinely uncovers at z = 10-14. Overall, our results indicate that the luminosity distribution of the earliest star-forming galaxies could be shifting towards fainter luminosities, implying that future surveys of cosmic dawn will need to explore this faint luminosity regime.

An analysis of a historical compilation of Hubble-Lema\^itre constant values (H_0: 163 data points measured between 1976 and 2019) assuming the standard cosmological model gives a \chi^2 value of the dispersion with respect to the weighted average of 580, much larger than the number of points, which has an associated probability that is very low. This means that Hubble tensions were always present in the literature, due either to the underestimation of statistical error bars associated with the observed parameter measurements, or to the fact that systematic errors were not properly taken into account in many of the measurements. The fact that the underestimation of error bars for H_0 is so common might explain the apparent 4.4-sigma discrepancy by Riess et al. As a matter of fact, more recent precise H_0 measurements with JWST data by Freedman et al. using standard candles in galaxies find there is no tension with CMBR data, possibly indicating that previously Riess et al. had underestimated their errors. Here we have carried out a recalibration of the probabilities. The tension of 4.4-\sigma , estimated between the local Cepheid-supernova distance ladder and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, is indeed a 2.1-\sigma tension in equivalent terms of a normal distribution, with an associated probability P = 0.036 (1 in 28). This can be increased to an equivalent tension of 2.5-\sigma in the worst cases of claimed 6-\sigma tension, which may in any case happen as a random statistical fluctuation. If Hubble tensions were always present in the literature, and present day tensions are not more important than previous ones, why, then, is there so much noise and commotion surrounding Hubble tension after 2019? It is suggested here that this obeys a sociological phenomenon of ``groupthink''.

The typically large distances, extinction, and crowding of Galactic supermassive star clusters have so far hampered the identification of their very low mass members, required to extend our understanding of star and planet formation, and early stellar evolution, to starburst. This situation has now evolved thanks to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), and its unmatched resolution and sensitivity in the infrared. In this paper, the third of the series of the Extended Westerlund 1 and 2 Open Clusters Survey (EWOCS), we present JWST/NIRCam and JWST/MIRI observations of the supermassive star cluster Westerlund 1. These observations are specifically designed to unveil the cluster members down to the BD mass regime, and to allow us to select and study the protoplanetary disks and to study the mutual feedback between the cluster members and the surrounding environment. Westerlund 1 was observed as part of JWST GO-1905 for 23.6 hours. The data have been reduced using the JWST calibration pipeline, together with specific tools necessary to remove artifacts. Source identification and photometry were performed with DOLPHOT. The MIRI images show a plethora of different features. Diffuse nebular emission is observed around the cluster, which is typically composed of myriads of droplet-like features pointing toward the cluster center or the group of massive stars surrounding the WR star W72/A. A long pillar is also observed in the NW. The MIRI images also show resolved shells and outflows surrounding the M-type RSG W20, W26, W75, and W237, the sgB[e] star W9 and the YHG W4. The color-magnitude diagrams built using the NIRCam photometry show a clear cluster sequence, which is marked in its upper part by the 1828 NIRCam stars with X-ray counterparts. NIRCam observations using the F115W filter have reached the 23.8 mag limit with 50&amp;percnt; completeness (roughly corresponding to a 0.06 Msol brown dwarf).

Understanding the processes that drive the morphology and kinematics of molecular gas in galaxies is crucial for comprehending star formation and, ultimately, galaxy evolution. Using data obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we study the behavior of the warm molecular gas at temperatures of hundreds of Kelvin and the cold molecular gas at tens of Kelvin in the galaxy MCG-05-23-16, which hosts an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images of this spheroidal galaxy, classified in the optical as S0, show a dust lane resembling a nuclear spiral and a surrounding ring. These features are also detected in CO(2-1) and H2, and their morphologies and kinematics are consistent with rotation plus local inward gas motions along the kinematic minor axis in the presence of a nuclear bar. The H2 transitions 0-0 S(3), 0-0 S(4), and 0-0 S(5), which trace warmer and more excited gas, show more disrupted kinematics than 0-0 S(1) and 0-0 S(2), including clumps of high-velocity dispersion (of up to ~ 160 km/s), in regions devoid of CO(2-1). The kinematics of one of these clumps, located at ~ 350 pc westward from the nucleus, are consistent with outflowing gas, possibly driven by localized star formation traced by Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission at 11.3 {&amp;mu;}m. Overall, we observe a stratification of the molecular gas, with the colder gas located in the nuclear spiral, ring, and connecting arms, while most warmer gas with higher velocity-dispersion fills the inter-arm space. The compact jet, approximately 200 pc in size, detected with Very Large Array (VLA) observations, does not appear to significantly affect the distribution and kinematics of the molecular gas, possibly due to its limited intersection with the molecular gas disc.

&lt;p&gt;
JWST has revealed a large population of compact, red galaxies at z&amp;gt;4 known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). We analyze the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 95 LRDs from the JWST PRIMER survey with complete photometric coverage from 1-18\ &amp;mu;m using NIRCam and MIRI imaging, representing the most extensive SED analysis on a large LRD sample with long-wavelength MIRI data. We examine SED models in which either galaxy or active galactic nucleus (AGN) emission dominates the rest-frame UV or optical continuum, extracting physical properties to explore each scenario's implications. In the galaxy-only model, we find massive, dusty stellar populations alongside unobscured, low-mass components, hinting at inhomogeneous obscuration. The AGN-only model indicates dusty, luminous AGNs with low hot dust fractions compared to typical quasars. A hybrid AGN and galaxy model suggests low-mass, unobscured galaxies in the UV, with stellar mass estimates spanning ~2 dex across the different models, underscoring the need for caution in interpreting LRD stellar masses. With MIRI photometry, the galaxy-only model produces stellar masses within cosmological limits, but extremely high stellar mass densities are inferred. The hybrid model infers highly overmassive black holes exceeding those in recently reported high-redshift AGNs, hinting at a partial AGN contribution to the rest-optical continuum or widespread super-Eddington accretion. Our findings highlight the extreme conditions required for both AGN or galaxy dominated scenarios in LRDs, supporting a mixed contribution to the red continuum, or novel scenarios to explain the observed emission.

We present a novel technique using Fourier series and Laguerre polynomials to represent morphological features of disc galaxies. To demonstrate the utility of this technique, we study the evolution of asymmetry in a sample of disc galaxies drawn from the Extended Groth Strip and imaged by the JWST Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey as well as archival HST observations. We measure disc asymmetry as the amplitude of the of the m = 1 Fourier harmonic for galaxies within redshift ranges of 1 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 4. We show that when viewed in shorter rest frame wavelengths, disc galaxies have a higher asymmetry as the flux is dominated by star forming regions. We find generally low asymmetry at rest frame infrared wavelengths, where our metric tracks asymmetry in morphological features such as bars and spiral arms. We show that higher mass galaxies have lower asymmetry and vice versa. Higher asymmetry in lower mass galaxies comes from lower mass galaxies (typically) having higher star formation rates. We measure the relation between disc galaxy asymmetry and redshift and find no conclusive relationship between them. We demonstrate the utility of the Fourier-Laguerre technique for recovering physically informative asymmetry measurements as compared to rotational asymmetry measurements. We also release the software pipeline and quantitative analysis for each galaxy.

&lt;p&gt;
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is opening new frontiers of transient discovery and follow-up at high-redshift. Here we present the discovery of a spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernova (SN Ia; SN 2023aeax) at z=2.15 with JWST, with cadenced NIRCam observations that enable multi-band light curve fitting. SN 2023aeax lands at the edge of traditional low-z cosmology color cuts because of its blue color (peak rest-frame B-V~-0.3), but we still apply a fiducial standardization approach with the BayeSN model and find that the SN 2023aeax luminosity distance measurement is in agreement (~0.1sigma) with LambdaCDM. SN 2023aeax is only the second spectroscopically confirmed SN Ia in the dark matter-dominated Universe at z&amp;gt;2 (the other is SN 2023adsy), giving it rare leverage to constrain any potential evolution in SN Ia standardized luminosities. Similar to SN 2023adsy (B-V~0.8), SN 2023aeax has a fairly extreme (but opposite) color, which may be due to the small sample size or a secondary factor, such as host galaxy properties. Nevertheless, the SN 2023aeax spectrum is well-represented by normal low-z SN Ia spectra and we find no definitive evolution in SN Ia standardization with redshift. Still, the first two spectroscopically confirmed z&amp;gt;2 SNe Ia have peculiar colors and combine for a ~1sigma distance slope relative to LambdaCDM, the implications of which require a larger sample and dedicated host galaxy observations to investigate.

&lt;p&gt;
We present an analysis of nine star-forming galaxies with \langle z \rangle = 3.95 from the JWST EXCELS survey for which we obtain robust chemical abundance estimates for the \alpha-elements O, Ne and Ar. The \alpha-elements are primarily produced via core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) which should result in \alpha-element abundance ratios that do not vary significantly across cosmic time. However, Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) models predict an excess production of Ar relative to O and Ne. The Ar/O abundance ratio can therefore be used as a tracer of the relative enrichment of CCSNe and SNe Ia in galaxies. Our sample approximately doubles the number of sources with measurements of {\rm Ar/O} at z &amp;gt; 2, and we find that our sample exhibits sub-solar Ar/O ratios on average, with \rm{Ar/O} = 0.62 \pm 0.10 \, (\rm{Ar/O})_{\odot}. In contrast, the average Ne/O abundance is fully consistent with the solar ratio, with \rm{Ne/O} = 1.07 \pm 0.12 \, (\rm{Ne/O})_{\odot}. Our results support a scenario in which Ar has not had time to build up in the interstellar medium of young high-redshift galaxies, which are dominated by CCSNe enrichment. We show that these abundance estimates are in good agreement with recent Milky Way chemical evolution models, and with Ar/O trends observed for planetary nebulae in the Andromeda galaxy. These results highlight the potential for using multiple element abundance ratios to constrain the chemical enrichment pathways of early galaxies with JWST.

The James Webb Space Telescope has uncovered a puzzling population of UV-faint broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN), nicknamed ``Little Red Dots'' (LRD) owing to their compact morphology and red rest-frame optical colours. Interpreted as dust attenuated AGN, their inferred intrinsic luminosities and supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses rival those of UV-luminous quasars, although they are &amp;gt;100 times more abundant. If LRDs and quasars are members of the same underlying population, they should inhabit comparable mass dark matter halos, traced by similar overdensities of galaxies. Otherwise, they represent distinct populations with different physical properties and formation histories. Characterizing LRD environments thus provides a critical test of their nature. Here, we report the discovery of a LRD at z=7.3, attenuated by moderate amounts of dust, A_V = {3.26}\,\rm{mag}, with an intrinsic bolometric luminosity of 10^{46.7}\,\rm{erg}\,\rm{s}^{-1} and a SMBH mass of 7\times10^8\,\rm{M}_\odot. Most notably, this object is embedded in an overdensity of eight nearby galaxies, allowing us to calculate the first spectroscopic estimate of the clustering of galaxies around LRDs. We find a LRD-galaxy cross-correlation length of r_0\!=\!9\pm2\,\rm{h}^{-1}\,\rm{cMpc}, comparable to that of z\!~\!6 UV-luminous quasars. The resulting estimate of their minimum dark matter halo mass of \log_{10}(M_{\rm{halo, min}}/\rm{M}_{\odot})= 12.3_{-0.8}^{+0.7} indicates that nearly all halos above this mass must host actively accreting SMBHs at z\approx7, in strong contrast with the far smaller duty cycle of luminous quasars (&amp;lt;1&amp;percnt;). Our results, taken at face value, motivate a picture in which LRDs are the obscured counterparts of UV-luminous quasars, which provides a natural explanation for the short UV-luminous lifetimes inferred from both quasar clustering and quasar proximity zones.

We propose that modifications to the Higgs potential within a narrow atmospheric layer near the event horizon of an astrophysical black hole could significantly enhance the rate of sphaleron transitions, as well as transform the Chern-Simons number into a dynamic variable. As a result, sphaleron transitions in this region occur without suppression, in contrast to low-temperature conditions, and each transition may generate a substantially greater baryon number than would be produced by winding around the Higgs potential in Minkowski spacetime. This effect amplifies baryon number violation near the black hole horizon, potentially leading to a considerable generation of matter. Given the possibility of a departure from equilibrium during the absorption of matter and the formation of relativistic jets in supermassive black holes, we conjecture that this process could contribute to the creation of a significant amount of matter around such black holes. This phenomenon may offer an alternative explanation for the rapid growth of supermassive black holes and their surrounding galaxies in the early Universe, as suggested by recent observations from the JWST. Furthermore, this mechanism may provide insights into the low-mass gap puzzle, addressing the observed scarcity of black holes with masses near the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit.

We determine the spectroscopic properties of ~1000 ostensibly star-forming galaxies at redshifts (z=4-10) using prism spectroscopy from JWST/NIRSpec. With rest-wavelength coverage between Lya and [S II] in the optical, we stack spectra as a function of nebular conditions, and compare UV spectral properties with stellar age. This reveals UV lines of N III], N IV], C III], C IV, He II, and O III] in the average high-z galaxy. All UV lines are more intense in younger starbursts. We measure electron temperatures from the collisionally excited [O III] line ratios, finding Te=18000-22000 K for the O++ regions. We also detect a significant nebular Balmer Jump from which we estimate only Te=8000-13000 K. Accounting for typical temperature offsets between zones bearing doubly and singly ionized oxygen, these two temperatures remain discrepant by around 40%. We use the [O III] temperatures to estimate abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. We find that log(C/O) is consistently ~-1, with no evolution of C/O with metallicity or stellar age. The average spectra are mildly enhanced in Nitrogen, with higher N/O than low-z starbursts, but are less enhanced than samples of high-z galaxies with visible UV N III] and N IV]. Whatever processes produce the N-enhancement in the individual galaxies must also be ongoing, at lower levels, in the median galaxy in the early Universe. The strongest starbursts are a source of significant ionizing emission: ionizing photon production efficiencies reach 10^25.7 Hz/erg, and show multiple signatures of high Lyman continuum escape, including Mg II escape fractions nearing 100%, significant deficits in [S II] emission, high degrees of ionization, and blue UV colors.

The history of gas assembly in early galaxies is reflected in their complex kinematics. While a considerable fraction of galaxies at z~5 are consistent with rotating disks, current studies indicate that the dominant galaxy assembly mechanism corresponds to mergers. Despite the important progress, the dynamical classification of galaxies at these epochs is still limited by observations' resolution. We present a detailed morphological and kinematic analysis of the far-infrared bright main sequence galaxy HZ10 at z=5.65, making use of new high-resolution (\lesssim0.3") [CII] 158&amp;mu;m ALMA and rest-frame optical JWST/NIRSpec observations. These observations reveal a previously unresolved complex morphology and kinematics of the HZ10. We confirm that HZ10 is not a single galaxy but consists of at least three components in close projected separation along the east-to-west direction. We find a [CII] bright central component (C), separated by 1.5 and 4 kpc from the east (E) and west (W) components, respectively. Our [CII] observations resolve the HZ10-C component resulting in a velocity gradient, produced by either rotation or a close-in merger. We test the rotating disk possibility using DysmalPy kinematic modeling and propose three dynamical scenarios for the HZ10 system: (i) a double merger, in which the companion galaxy HZ10-W merges with the disturbed clumpy rotation disk formed by the HZ10-C and E components; (ii) a triple merger, where the companion galaxies, HZ10-W and HZ10-E, merge with the rotation disk HZ10-C; and (iii) a quadruple merger, in which the companion galaxies HZ10-W and HZ10-E merge with the close double merger HZ10-C. Comparing [CII] with JWST/NIRSpec data, we find that [CII] emission closely resembles the broad [OIII] 5007{&amp;#8491;} emission. The latter reflects the interacting nature of the system and suggests that ionized and neutral gas phases in HZ10 are well mixed.

It was hypothesized in the literature that some physical parameters may be time-evolving and the astrophysical data can serve as a probe. Recently, James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have released its early observations. In this work, we select the JWST spectroscopic observations of the high redshift (z&amp;gt;7.1) galaxies with strong [OIII] (\lambda=4959 &amp;#8491; \,and 5007 &amp;#8491; \,in the rest frame) emission lines to constraint the evolution of the fine structure constant (\alpha). With the spectra from two galaxies at redshifts of 7.19 and 8.47, the deviation of \alpha to its fiducial value is found to be as small as 0.44^{+8.4+1.7}_{-8.3-1.7} \times 10^{-4} and -10.0^{+18+1.5}_{-18-1.5} \times 10^{-4}, respectively (the first error is statistical and the latter is systematic). The combination of our results with the previous data reveals that \frac{1}{\alpha} \frac{d \alpha}{dt} = 0.30^{+4.5}_{-4.5} \times 10^{-17}~{\rm yr^{-1}}. Clearly, there is no evidence for a cosmic evolution of \alpha. The prospect of further constraining the time evolution of \alpha is also discussed. The scalar field of dark energy is hypothesized to drive the acceleration of the universe's expansion through an interaction with the electromagnetic field. By integrating the observational data of the fine-structure constant variation, \frac{\Delta\alpha}{\alpha}(z), we have established a stringent upper limit on the coupling strength between dark energy and electromagnetism. Our analysis yields \zeta \leq 3.92 \times 10^{-7} at the 95&amp;percnt; confidence level, representing the most stringent bound to date.

We have developed a new regression technique, the maximum likelihood (ML)-based method and its variant, the KS-test based method, designed to obtain unbiased regression results from typical astronomical data. A normalizing flow model is employed to automatically estimate the unobservable intrinsic distribution of the independent variable as well as the unobservable correlation between uncertainty level and intrinsic value of both independent and dependent variables from the observed data points in a variational inference based empirical Bayes approach. By incorporating these estimated distributions, our method comprehensively accounts for the uncertainties associated with both independent and dependent variables. Our test on both mock data and real astronomical data from PHANGS-ALMA and PHANGS-JWST demonstrates that both the ML based method and the KS-test based method significantly outperform the existing widely-used methods, particularly in cases of low signal-to-noise ratios. The KS-test based method exhibits remarkable robustness against deviations from underlying assumptions, complex intrinsic distributions, varying correlations between uncertainty levels and intrinsic values, inaccuracies in uncertainty estimations, outliers, and saturation effects. We recommend the KS-test based method as the preferred choice for general applications, while the ML based method is suggested for small samples with sizes of N &amp;lt; 100. A GPU-compatible Python implementation of our methods, nicknamed ``raddest'', will be made publicly available upon acceptance of this paper.

We present JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopic (IFS) observations of the \Lyalpha emitter CR7 at z ~ 6.6, observed as part of the GA-NIFS program. Using low-resolution PRISM (R ~ 100) data, we confirm a bright \Lyalpha emitter, and a diffuse \Lyalpha halo extending up to 3 kpc from the peak of ionized emission, both of them associated to the most massive, UV bright galaxy in the system (CR7-A). We confirm the presence of two additional UV-bright satellites (CR7-B and CR7-C) detected at projected distances of 6.4 and 5.2 kpc from the primary source. We perform SED fitting of the low-resolution data and revealed an inverted star formation history between two satellites at early epochs and a spatially resolved anti-correlation of the gas-phase metallicity and the star formation rate density, likely driven by the gas exchange among the satellites, favouring the merger scenario for CR7. From the high-resolution G395H (R ~ 2700) data, we discover at least three additional companions mainly traced by the \OIIIL emission line, although they are not detected in continuum. We disentangle the kinematics of the system and reveal extended ionised emission linking the main galaxy and the satellites. We spatially resolve the \OIIIL, \OIII[4363], and \Hgamma emission lines and use a diagnostic diagram tailored to high-z systems to reveal tentative evidence of AGN ionisation across the main galaxy (CR7-A) and the N-E companion (CR7-B). Moreover, we detect an unresolved blue-shifted outflow from one of the satellites and present first evidence for a redshifted outflow from the main galaxy. Finally, we compute resolved electron temperature (T_e ~ 1.6 \times 10^4 K) and metallicity maps (log(Z/\zsun) from --0.8 to --0.5), and provide insights on how the physical properties of the system evolved at earlier epochs.

Over the past decades, a population of galaxies invisible in optical/near-infrared, but bright at longer wavelengths, have been identified through color selections. These so-called optically faint/dark galaxies are considered to be massive quiescent galaxies or highly dust-attenuated galaxies. Having the entire galaxy obscured by dust, however, is likely an extreme case of the much more common occurrence of optically thin and thick absorption coexisting in the same system. With the power of JWST imaging, we are able to spatially resolve massive galaxies at z~3, accurately model their spectral energy distributions, and identify candidate optically thick substructures. We target galaxies with log(M*/Msun)&amp;gt;10.3 and 2.5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;3.5, and get 486 galaxies in CEERS and PRIMER fields. Based on excess NIR luminosity, we identify 162 galaxies (~33&amp;percnt; of the parent sample) as candidate hosts of optically thick substructures. We then carry out spatially resolved SED modeling to explore the physical properties of those dark substructures and estimate the amount of optically thick obscuration. We find that optically thick dust is ubiquitous in normal massive galaxies with a wide variety of SFR and morphology. 10-20&amp;percnt; of the stellar mass/SFR are unaccounted for in our selected galaxies, and the fraction is insensitive to stellar mass or SFR. The dark substructures are generally dustier than the rest of the galaxies and are irregularly distributed, arguing against an obscured AGN as the source of the NIR excess. A correlation between the obscured luminosity and the presence of a recent starburst in the past &amp;lt;100 Myr is also observed.

The non-LTE analysis of Keck I telescope LRIS spectra yields a central logarithmic metallicity (in units of the solar value) of [Z] = -0.05\pm0.05 and a very shallow gradient of -(0.09\pm0.11)r/r25 with respect to galactocentric distance in units of the isophotal radius. Good agreement with the mass-metallicity relationship of star forming galaxies based on stellar absorption line studies is found. A comparison with HII region oxygen abundances obtained from the analysis of strong emission lines shows reasonable agreement when the Pettini &amp; Pagel (2004) calibration is used, while the Zaritsky et al. (1994) calibration yields values that are 0.2 to 0.3 dex larger. These results allow to put the metallicity calibration of the Cepheid Period--Luminosity relation in this anchor galaxy on a purely stellar basis. Interstellar reddening and extinction are determined using HST and JWST photometry. Based on extinction-corrected magnitudes, combined with the stellar effective temperatures and gravities we determine, we use the Flux-weighted Gravity--Luminosity Relationship (FGLR) to estimate an independent spectroscopic distance. We obtain a distance modulus m-M = 29.38\pm0.12 mag, in agreement with the geometrical distance derived from the analysis of the water maser orbits in the galaxy's central circumnuclear disk.

We present deep JWST/NIRSpec integral-field spectroscopy (IFS) and ALMA [CII]\lambda158&amp;mu;m observations of COS-3018, a star-forming galaxy at z~6.85, as part of the GA-NIFS programme. Both G395H (R~ 2700) and PRISM (R~ 100) NIRSpec observations revealed that COS-3018 is comprised of three separate components detected in [OIII]\lambda5008, which we dub as Main, North and East, with stellar masses of 10^{9.4 \pm 0.1}, 10^{9.2 \pm 0.07}, 10^{7.7 \pm 0.15} M_{\odot}. We detect [OIII]\lambda5008, [OIII]\lambda\lambda3727,29 and multiple Balmer lines in all three components together with [OIII]\lambda4363 in the Main and North components. This allows us to measure an ISM temperature of T_{e}= 1.27\pm0.07\times 10^4 and T_{e}= 1.6\pm0.14\times 10^4 K with densities of n_{e} = 1250\pm250 and n_{e} = 700\pm200 cm^{-3}, respectively. These deep observations allow us to measure an average metallicity of 12+log(O/H)=7.9--8.2 for the three components with the T_{e}-method. We do not find any significant evidence of metallicity gradients between the components. Furthermore, we also detect [NII]\lambda6585, one of the highest redshift detections of this emission line. We find that in a small, metal-poor clump 0.2 arcsec west of the North component, N/O is elevated compared to other regions, indicating that nitrogen enrichment originates from smaller substructures, possibly proto-globular clusters. [OIII]\lambda5008 kinematics show that this system is merging, which is probably driving the ongoing, luminous starburst.

&lt;p&gt;
In the past decade, an asymmetry in the large-scale distribution of galaxy spin directions has been observed in data from all relevant digital sky surveys, all showing a higher number of galaxies rotating in the opposite direction relative to the Milky Way as observed from Earth. Additionally, JWST deep fields have shown that the asymmetry is clear and obvious, and can be sensed even by the naked human eye. These experiments were performed using two separate statistical methods: standard binomial distribution and simple \chi^2 statistics. Stiskalek \&amp; Desmond (2024) suggested that the asymmetry in the distribution of galaxy spin directions is due to the use of binomial or \chi^2 statistics. Instead, they developed a new complex ad-hoc statistical method that shows random distribution in galaxy spin directions, and specifically in data from HSC. Source code for the method was also made available. The primary downside of the new method is that it is not able to identify asymmetry in the distribution of galaxy spin directions. Even when the new method is provided with synthetic data with extreme and obvious asymmetry, it still reports a null-hypothesis Universe with random distribution. That shows empirically that the method cannot sense asymmetry in the distribution of the directions of rotation of galaxies. While this further concludes that the distribution of galaxy spin direction as observed from Earth is not symmetric, it is not necessarily an indication of an anomaly in the large-scale structure. The excessive number of galaxies that rotate in the opposite direction relative to the Milky Way can also be driven by the internal structure of galaxies and the physics of galaxy rotation. The phenomenon can be related to other puzzling anomalies such the Ho tension. Data are publicly available, and no code is needed to reproduce the results since only conventional statistics is used.

&lt;p&gt;
We investigate size variation with rest-frame wavelength for star-forming galaxies based on the second JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey data release. Star-forming galaxies are typically smaller at longer wavelength from UV-to-NIR at z&amp;lt;3.5, especially for more massive galaxies, indicating the inside-out assembly with in-situ star formation if ignoring dust attenuation. The size variation with wavelength shows strong dependence on stellar mass, and shows little or no dependence on redshift, specific star formation rate and galaxy environment. This suggests that the size growth of star-forming galaxies is a self-regulated process primarily governed by stellar mass. We model size as a function of both mass and redshift simultaneously, obtaining R_{\rm e} \propto M_*^{0.23} (1+z)^{-1.04} at a wavelength of 0.45 {&amp;mu; \mathrm{m}}, and R_{\rm e} \propto M_*^{0.20} (1+z)^{-1.08} at 1.0 {&amp;mu; \mathrm{m}}. Based on this size evolution and the star formation main sequence from the literature, we obtain the locus of typical size growth for individual galaxies of different masses on the mass-size plane. The moving trend of galaxies on the mass-size plane, which indicates the slopes of their locus, strongly correlates with the size ratio between 0.45 {&amp;mu; \mathrm{m}} and 1.0 {&amp;mu; \mathrm{m}}, supporting the idea that the size variation with wavelength provides important information on size growth of galaxies on short timescales.

We introduce MEGATRON, a new galaxy formation model for cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations of high-redshift galaxies. The model accounts for the non-equilibrium chemistry and heating/cooling processes of \geq 80 atoms, ions, and molecules, coupled to on-the-fly radiation transfer. We apply the model in a cosmological setting to the formation of a 10^9\ {\rm M_{\odot}} halo at z=6, and run 25 realizations at pc-scale resolution, varying numerous parameters associated with our state-of-the-art star formation, stellar feedback, and chemical enrichment models. We show that the overall budget of feedback energy is the key parameter that controls star formation regulation at high redshift, with other numerical parameters (e.g. supernova clustering, star formation conditions) having a more limited impact. As a similar feedback model has been shown to produce realistic z=0 galaxies, our work demonstrates that calibration at z=0 does not guarantee strong regulation of star formation at high-redshift. Interestingly, we find that subgrid model variations that have little impact on the final z=6 stellar mass can lead to substantial changes on the observable properties of high-redshift galaxies. For example, different star formation models based on, e.g. density thresholds or turbulence inspired criteria, lead to fundamentally distinct nebular emission line ratios across the interstellar medium (ISM). These results highlight the ISM as an important resource for constraining models of star formation, feedback, and galaxy formation in the JWST era, where emission line measurements for &amp;gt;1,000 high-redshift galaxies are now available.

&lt;p&gt;
JWST/MIRI images have been used to study the Fourier transform power spectra (PS) of two spiral galaxies, NGC 628 and NGC 5236, and two dwarfs, NGC 4449 and NGC 5068, at distances ranging from 4 to 10 Mpc. The PS slopes on scales larger than 200 pc range from -0.6 at 21 microns to -1.2 at 5.6 microns, suggesting a scaling of region luminosity with size as a power law with index ranging from 2.6 to 3.2, respectively. This result is consistent with the size-luminosity relation of star-forming regions found elsewhere, but extending here to larger scales. There is no evidence for a kink or steepening of the PS at some transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional turbulence on the scale of the disk thickness. This lack of a kink could be from large positional variations in the PS depending on two opposite effects: local bright sources that make the slope shallower and exponential galaxy profiles that make the slope steeper. The sources could also be confined to a layer of molecular clouds that is thinner than the HI or cool dust layers where PS kinks have been observed before. If the star formation layers observed in the near-infrared here are too thin, then the PS kink could be hidden in the broad tail of the JWST point spread function.

We present the Early Data Release of the Multi-Cycle JWST-NEXUS Treasury program (2024-2028), which includes NIRCam imaging and WFSS observations from the first (partial) NEXUS-Wide epoch covering the central 100 {\rm arcmin^2} of the NEXUS field, located near the North Ecliptic Pole and within the Euclid Ultra-Deep Field. We release reduced NIRCam mosaics (F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F356W, F444W), photometric source catalogs, as well as preliminary WFSS spectra (in F322W2 and F444W) for the subset of bright sources (F356W&amp;lt;21 mag or F444W&amp;lt;21 mag). These observations fully cover the NEXUS-Deep area, and anchor the long-term baseline of the program. These data will be used for initial target selection for the NIRSpec/MSA spectroscopy starting from June 2025. The NIRCam imaging reaches depths of 27.4--28.2 (AB) mags in F090W--F444W. Upcoming NEXUS-Wide epochs will expand the area to the full ~ 400\,{\rm arcmin^2}, and improve the NIRCam exposure depths in the Wide tier by a factor of three. In addition, this central region will be repeatedly covered by the NEXUS-Deep observations (NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec/MSA PRISM spectroscopy) over 18 epochs with a ~ 2-month cadence. We demonstrate the data quality of the first NEXUS observations, and showcase some example science cases enabled by these data.

We used the Condor Array Telescope to obtain deep imaging observations through luminance broad-band and He II, [O III], He I, H\alpha, [N II], and [S II] narrow-band filters of an extended region of the M81 Group spanning \approx 8 \times 8 deg^2 on the sky centered near M81 and M82. Here we report aspects of these observations that are specifically related to (1) a remarkable filament known as the "Ursa Major Arc" that stretches \approx 30 deg on the sky roughly in the direction of Ursa Major, (2) a "Giant Shell of Ionized Gas" that stretches \approx 0.8 deg on the sky located \approx 0.6 deg NW of M82, and (3) a remarkable network of ionized gaseous filaments revealed by the new Condor observations that appear to connect the arc, the shell, and various of the galaxies of the M81 Group and, by extension, the group itself. We measure flux ratios between the various ions to help to distinguish photoionized from shock-ionized gas, and we find that the flux ratios of the arc and shell are not indicative of shock ionization. This provides strong evidence against a previous interpretation of the arc as an interstellar shock produced by an unrecognized supernova. We suggest that all of these objects, including the arc, are associated with the M81 Group and are located at roughly the distance \approx 3.6 Mpc of M81, that the arc is an intergalactic filament, and that the objects are associated with the low-redshift cosmic web.

We used the Condor Array Telescope to obtain deep imaging observations through the luminance broad-band and He II 468.6 nm, [O III] 500.7 nm, He I 587.5 nm, H\alpha, [N II] 658.4 nm, and [S II] 671.6 nm narrow-band filters of an extended region comprising 13 "Condor fields" spanning \approx 8 \times 8 deg^2 on the sky centered near M81 and M82. Here we describe the acquisition and processing of these observations, which together constitute unique very deep imaging observations of a large portion of the M81 Group through a complement of broad- and narrow-band filters. The images are characterized by an intricate web of faint, diffuse, continuum produced by starlight scattered from Galactic cirrus, and all prominent cirrus features identified in the broad-band image can also be identified in the narrow-band images. We subtracted the luminance image from the narrow-band images to leave more or less only line emission in the difference images, and we masked regions of the resulting images around stars at an isophotal limit. The difference images exhibit extensive extended structures of ionized gas in the direction of the M81 Group, from known galaxies of the M81 Group, clouds of gas, filamentary structures, and apparent or possible bubbles or shells. Specifically, the difference images show a remarkable filament known as the "Ursa Major Arc;" a remarkable network of criss-crossed filaments between M81 and NGC 2976, some of which intersect and overlap the Ursa Major Arc; and details of a "giant shell of ionized gas."

&lt;p&gt;
(Abridged) JWST continues to deliver incredibly detailed infrared (IR) images of star forming regions in the Milky Way and beyond. IR emission from star-forming regions is very spectrally rich due to emission from gas-phase atoms, ions, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Physically interpreting IR images of these regions relies on assumptions about the underlying spectral energy distribution in the imaging bandpasses. We aim to provide empirical prescriptions linking line, PAH, and continuum intensities from JWST images, to facilitate the interpretation of JWST images in a wide variety of contexts. We use JWST PDRs4All Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) imaging and Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) integral field unit (IFU) and MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) spectroscopic observations of the Orion Bar photodissociation region (PDR), to directly compare and cross-calibrate imaging and IFU data at ~100 AU resolution over a region where the radiation field and ISM environment evolves from the hot ionized gas to the cold molecular gas. We measure the relative contributions of line, PAH, and continuum emission to the NIRCam and MIRI filters as functions of local physical conditions. We provide empirical prescriptions based on NIRCam and MIRI images to derive intensities of emission lines and PAH features. Within the range of the environments probed in this study, these prescriptions accurately predict Pa-alpha, Br-alpha, PAH 3.3 um and 11.2 um intensities, while those for FeII 1.644 um, H_2 1--0 S(1) 2.12 um and 1--0 S(9) 4.96 um, and PAH 7.7 um show more complicated environmental dependencies. Linear combinations of JWST NIRCam and MIRI images provide effective tracers of ionized gas, H_2, and PAH emission in PDRs. We expect these recipes to be useful for both the Galactic and extragalactic communities.

HeH^+ was the first heteronuclear molecule to form in the metal-free Universe after the Big Bang. The molecule gained significant attention following its first circumstellar detection in the young and dense planetary nebula NGC 7027. We target some hydride ions associated with the noble gases (HeH^+, ArH^+, and NeH^+) to investigate their formation in a harsh environment like the novae outburst region. We use a photoionization modeling (based on the earlier published best-fitted physical parameters) of the moderately fast ONe type nova: QU Vulpeculae 1984 and CO type novae: RS Ophiuchi and V1716 Scorpii. Our steady-state modeling reveals a convincing amount of HeH^+, especially in the dense clump of RS Ophiuchi and V1716 Scorpii. The calculated upper limit of the surface brightness of HeH^+ transitions suggests that the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) could detect some of them, particularly in sources like RS Ophiuchi and V1716 Scorpii with similar physical and chemical conditions and evolution. It is to be clearly noted that the sources studied are used as templates, not as targets for observations. The detection of these lines could be useful for determining physical conditions in similar types of systems and validating our predictions based on new electron-impact rovibrational collisional data at temperatures up to 20,000 K.

&lt;p&gt;
Galaxy mergers are a key driver of galaxy formation and evolution, including the triggering of AGN and star formation to a still unknown degree. We thus investigate the impact of galaxy mergers on star formation and AGN activity using a sample of 3,330 galaxies at z = [4.5, 8.5] from eight JWST fields (CEERS, JADES GOODS-S, NEP-TDF, NGDEEP, GLASS, El-Gordo, SMACS-0723, and MACS-0416), collectively covering an unmasked area of 189 arcmin^2. We focuses on star formation rate (SFR) enhancement, AGN fraction, and AGN excess in major merger (&amp;mu; &amp;gt; 1/4) close-pair samples, defined by \Delta z &amp;lt; 0.3 and projected separations r_p &amp;lt; 100 kpc, compared to non-merger samples. We find that SFR enhancement occurs only at r_p &amp;lt; 20 kpc, with values of 0.25 \pm 0.10 dex and 0.26 \pm 0.11 dex above the non-merger medians for z = [4.5, 6.5] and z = [6.5, 8.5], respectively. No other statistically significant enhancements in galaxy sSFR or stellar mass are observed at any projected separation or redshift bin. We also compare our observational results with predictions from the SC-SAM simulation and find no evidence of star formation enhancement in the simulations at any separation range. Finally, we examine the AGN fraction and AGN excess, finding that the fraction of AGNs in AGN-galaxy pairs, relative to the total AGN population, is 3.25^{+1.50}_{-1.06} times greater than the fraction of galaxy pairs relative to the overall galaxy population at the same redshift. We find that nearly all AGNs have a companion within 100 kpc and observe an excess AGN fraction in close-pair samples compared to non-merger samples. This excess is found to be 1.26 \pm 0.06 and 1.34 \pm 0.06 for AGNs identified via the inferred BPT diagram and photometric SED selection, respectively.

We investigate the host galaxy properties of eight little red dots (LRDs) selected from the JWST UNCOVER survey, applying a new technique ({\tt\string GalfitS}) to simultaneously fit the morphology and spectral energy distribution using multi-band NIRCam images covering ~ 1-4\,&amp;mu; {\rm m}. We detect the host galaxy in only one LRD, MSAID38108 at z = 4.96, which has a stellar mass of \log (M_*/M_{\odot}) = 8.66^{+0.24}_{-0.23}, an effective radius R_e=0.66^{+0.08}_{-0.05} kpc, and a S\'ersic index n=0.71^{+0.07}_{-0.08}. No host emission centered on the central point source is found in the other seven LRDs. We derive stringent upper limits for the stellar mass of a hypothetical host galaxy by conducting realistic mock simulations that place high-redshift galaxy images under the LRDs. Based on the black hole masses estimated from the broad H\alpha emission line, the derived stellar mass limits are at least a factor of 10 lower than expected from the z \approx 0 scaling relation between black hole mass and host galaxy stellar mass. Intriguingly, four of the LRDs (50&amp;percnt; of the sample) show extended, off-centered emission, which is particularly prominent in the bluer bands. The asymmetric emission of two sources can be modeled as stellar emission, but the nature of the other two is unclear.

&lt;p&gt;
Ionized bubble sizes during reionization trace physical properties of the first galaxies. JWST's ability to spectroscopically confirm and measure Lyman-alpha (Ly\alpha) emission in sub-L* galaxies opens the door to mapping ionized bubbles in 3D. However, existing Lya-based bubble measurement strategies rely on constraints from single galaxies, which are limited by the large variability in intrinsic Ly\alpha emission. As a first step, we present two bubble size estimation methods using Lya spectroscopy of ensembles of galaxies, enabling us to map ionized structures and marginalize over Ly\alpha emission variability. We test our methods using Gpc-scale reionization simulations of the intergalactic medium (IGM). To map bubbles in the plane of the sky, we develop an edge detection method based on the asymmetry of Ly\alpha transmission as a function of spatial position. To map bubbles along the line-of-sight, we develop an algorithm using the tight relation between Ly\alpha transmission and the line-of-sight distance from galaxies to the nearest neutral IGM patch. Both methods can robustly recover bubbles with radius \gtrsim10 comoving Mpc, sufficient for mapping bubbles even in the early phases of reionization, when the IGM is ~70-90&amp;percnt; neutral. These methods require \gtrsim0.002-0.004 galaxies/cMpc^3, a 5\sigma Ly\alpha equivalent width upper limit of \lesssim30\r{A} for the faintest targets, and redshift precision \Delta z \lesssim 0.015, feasible with JWST spectroscopy. Shallower observations will provide robust lower limits on bubble sizes. Additional constraints on IGM transmission from Ly\alpha escape fractions and line profiles will further refine these methods, paving the way to our first direct understanding of ionized bubble growth.

&lt;p&gt;
We report the discovery of the first example of an Einstein zig-zag lens, an extremely rare lensing configuration. In this system, J1721+8842, six images of the same background quasar are formed by two intervening galaxies, one at redshift z_1 = 0.184 and a second one at z_2 = 1.885. Two out of the six multiple images are deflected in opposite directions as they pass the first lens galaxy on one side, and the second on the other side -- the optical paths forming zig-zags between the two deflectors. In this letter, we demonstrate that J1721+8842, previously thought to be a lensed dual quasar, is in fact a compound lens with the more distant lens galaxy also being distorted as an arc by the foreground galaxy. Evidence supporting this unusual lensing scenario includes: 1- identical light curves in all six lensed quasar images obtained from two years of monitoring at the Nordic Optical Telescope; 2- detection of the additional deflector at redshift z_2 = 1.885 in JWST/NIRSpec IFU data; and 3- a multiple-plane lens model reproducing the observed image positions. This unique configuration offers the opportunity to combine two major lensing cosmological probes: time-delay cosmography and dual source-plane lensing since J1721+8842 features multiple lensed sources forming two distinct Einstein radii of different sizes, one of which being a variable quasar. We expect tight constraints on the Hubble constant and the equation of state of dark energy by combining these two probes on the same system. The z_2 = 1.885 deflector, a quiescent galaxy, is also the highest-redshift strong galaxy-scale lens with a spectroscopic redshift measurement.

&lt;p&gt;
We present ALMA observations on the high-redshift galaxy GHZ2 and report a successful detection of the rest-frame 88um atomic transition from doubly-ionized Oxygen at z=12.3327+/-0.0005. Based on these observations, combined with additional constraints on the [OIII] 52um line luminosity and previous JWST data, we argue that GHZ2 is likely powered by compact and young star formation, and show that it follows well-established relationships found for giant HII regions and metal-poor star-forming dwarf galaxies that are known to host bright super star clusters. Additionally, these observations provide new constraints on the Oxygen electron density (100 &amp;lt; n_e[cm^-3] &amp;lt; 4,000) and dynamical mass (M_dyn=3-8x10^8M_sun). The existence of these massive starburst systems 13.3Gyr ago might explain the origin of today's globular clusters, a long-standing question in astronomy. To test this, we present observational probes to investigate whether sources like GHZ2 are linked to the formation of today's globular clusters or other more massive compact stellar systems.

&lt;p&gt;
Among the most puzzling early discoveries of JWST are "Little Red Dots" -- compact red sources that host broad Balmer emission lines and, in many cases, exhibit a "V shaped" change in slope in the rest-optical. The physical properties of Little Red Dots currently have order-of-magnitude uncertainties, because models to explain the continuum of these sources differ immensely. Here, we leverage the complete selection of red sources in the RUBIES program, supplemented with public PRISM spectra, to study the origin of this "V shape". By fitting a broken power law with a flexible inflection point, we find that a large fraction (20/44, nearly all spatially unresolved) of extremely red H\alpha emitters at 2&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6 exhibit a strong change in slope, and that all strong inflections appear associated with the Balmer limit (0.3645 &amp;mu;m). Using a simple model of a reddened AGN with an unobscured scattered light component, we demonstrate that the observed "V shape" in Little Red Dots is unlikely to occur at any specific wavelength if the entire continuum is dominated by light from a power law AGN continuum. In contrast, models with an intrinsic feature at the Balmer limit, such as those that are dominated by evolved stellar populations in the rest-UV-to-optical, can produce the observed spectral shapes, provided that a reddened component picks up sufficiently redward of the break. While no model can comfortably explain the full Little Red Dot spectral energy distribution, the common inflection location suggests that it is most likely a single component that consistently dominates the rest-UV-to-optical in Little Red Dots, and that this component is associated with T~10^4 K hydrogen due to the clear preference for a break at H_\infty.

&lt;p&gt;
We combine stellar mass functions and the recent first JWST-based galaxy-black hole scaling relations at z=6 to for the first time compute the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass volume density at this epoch, and compare this to the integrated SMBH mass growth from the population of UV-luminous quasars at z&amp;gt;6. We show that even under very conservative assumptions almost all growth of SMBH mass at z&amp;gt;6 does not take place in these UV-luminous quasars, but must occur in systems obscured through dust and/or with lower radiative efficiency than standard thin accretion disks. The `Soltan argument' is not fulfilled by the known population of bright quasars at z&amp;gt;6: the integrated SMBH mass growth inferred from these largely unobscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early Universe is by a factor \ge10 smaller than the total SMBH mass volume density at z=6. This is valid under a large range of assumption about luminosity, mass functions, and accretion modes, and is likely still a factor &amp;gt;2 smaller when accounting for known obscuration fractions at this epoch. The resulting consequences are: &amp;gt;90%, possibly substantially more, of SMBH-buildup in the early Universe does not take place in luminous unobscured quasar phases, but has to occur in obscured systems, with dust absorbing most of the emitted UV-visible AGN emission, potentially with accretion modes with super-Eddington specific accretion rates. This is consistent with short lifetimes for luminous quasar phases from quasar proximity zone studies and clustering. This would remove the empirical need for slow SMBH growth and hence exotic `high-mass seed' black holes at early cosmic time. It also predicts a large population of luminous but very obscured lower-mass quasars at z&amp;gt;6, possibly the JWST `Little Red Dots'. This finding might severe impact on how we will diagnose SMBH growth at z=7 to 15 in the future.

James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a population of red and compact sources at z \gtrsim 5 known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) that are likely active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here we present a comprehensive study of the variability of 314 LRDs with multi-epoch JWST observations in five deep fields: UDS, GOODS-S, GOODS-N, Abell 2744, and COSMOS. Our analyses use all publicly available JWST NIRCam imaging data in these fields, together with multi-epoch JWST MIRI images available. We measure the significance of the variabilities (signal-to-noise ratio or {\rm SNR}_{\rm var}) for all LRDs and statistically evaluate their variabilities using the {\rm SNR}_{\rm var} distributions. We pay particular attention to the systematic offsets of photometric zero points among different epochs that seem to commonly exist. The derived {\rm SNR}_{\rm var} distributions of the LRDs, including those with broad H\alpha/H\beta emission lines, follow the standard Gaussian distribution, and are generally consistent with those of the comparison samples of objects detected in the same images. This finding suggests that the LRD population on average does not show strong variability, which can be due to super-Eddington accretion of the black holes in AGNs. Alternatively, they are dominated by galaxies. We also find eight strongly variable LRD candidates with variability amplitudes of 0.24 - 0.82 mag. The rest-frame optical SEDs of these variable LRDs should have significant AGN contribution. Future JWST observations will provide more variability information of LRDs.

We investigate the nature of star formation in gas-rich galaxies at z &amp;gt; 7 forming in a markedly overdense region, in the whereabouts of a massive virialized halo already exceeding 10^{12} M_{\odot}. We find that not only the primary galaxy, but also the lower-mass companion galaxies rapidly develop massive self-gravitating compact gas disks, less than 500~pc in size, which undergo fragmentation by gravitational instability into very massive bound clumps. Star formation proceeds fast in the clumps, which quickly turn into compact star clusters with masses in the range 10^5-10^8 M_{\odot} and typical half-mass radii of a few pc, reaching characteristic densities above 10^5 M_{\odot} pc^{-2}. The properties of the clusters in the lowest-mass galaxy bear a striking resemblance to those recently discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in the lensed Cosmic Gems arc system at z = 10.2. We argue that, due to their extremely high stellar densities, intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) would form rapidly inside the clusters, which would then swiftly sink and merge on their way to the galactic nucleus, easily growing a 10^7~M_{\odot} supermassive black hole (SMBH). Due to the high fractional mass contribution of clusters to the stellar mass of the galaxies, in the range 20-40&amp;percnt;, the central SMBH would comprise more than 10&amp;percnt; of the mass of its host galaxy, naturally explaining the overmassive SMBHs discovered by JWST at z &amp;gt; 6.

We present a freeze-out approach to the formation of heavy elements in expanding nuclear matter. Applying concepts used in the description of heavy-ion collisions or ternary fission, we determine the abundances of heavy elements taking into account in-medium effects such as Pauli blocking and the Mott effect, which describes the dissolution of nuclei at high densities of nuclear matter. With this approach, we search for a universal primordial distribution in an equilibrium state from which the gross structure of the solar abundances of heavy elements freezes out via radioactive decay of the excited states. The universal primordial state is characterized by the Lagrangian parameters of temperature and chemical potentials of neutrons and protons. We show that such a state exists and determine a temperature of 5.266 MeV, a neutron chemical potential of 940.317 MeV and a proton chemical potential of 845.069 MeV, at a baryon number density of 0.013 fm^{-3} and a proton fraction of 0.13. Heavy neutron-rich nuclei such as the hypothesized double-magic nucleus ^{358}Sn appear in the primordial distribution and contribute to the observed abundances after fission. We discuss astrophysical scenarios for the realization of this universal primordial distribution for heavy element nucleosynthesis, including supernova explosions, neutron star mergers and the inhomogeneous Big Bang. The latter scenario may be of interest in the light of early massive objects observed with the James Webb Space Telescope and opens new perspectives to explain universality of the observed r-process patterns and the lack of observations of population III stars.

During the last decade, studies about highly attenuated and massive red star-forming galaxies (RedSFGs) at z ~ 4 have suggested that they could constitute a crucial population for unraveling the mechanisms driving the transition from vigorous star formation to quiescence at high redshifts. Since such a transition seems to be linked to a morphological transformation, studying the morphological properties of these RedSFGs is essential to our understanding of galaxy evolution. To this end, we are using JWST/NIRCam images from the CEERS survey to assemble a mass-complete sample of 188 massive galaxies at z=3-4, for which we perform resolved-SED fit. After classifying galaxies into typical blue SFGs (BlueSFGs), RedSFGs and quiescent galaxies (QGs), we compare the morphologies of each population in terms of stellar mass density, SFR density, sSFR, dust-attenuation and mass-weighted age. We find that RedSFGs and QGs present similar stellar surface density profiles and that RedSFGs manifest a dust attenuation concentration significantly higher than that of BlueSFGs at all masses. This indicates that to become quiescent, a BlueSFG must transit through a major compaction phase once it has become sufficiently massive. At the same time, we find RedSFGs and QGs to account for more than 50&amp;percnt; of galaxies with {\rm log}(M_\ast/M_\odot)&amp;gt; 10.4 at this redshift. This transition mass corresponds to the "critical mass" delineating the bimodality between BlueSFGs and QGs in the local Universe. We then conclude that there is a bimodality between extended BlueSFGs and compact, highly attenuated RedSFGs that have undergone a major gas compaction phase enabling the latter to build a massive bulb in situ. There is evidence that this early-stage separation is at the origin of the local bimodality between BlueSFGs and QGs, which we refer to as a "primeval bimodality".

We present a new semi-analytical model for the evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that is based on the extended Press-Schechter formalism and phenomenological modelling of star formation. The model yields BH mass-stellar mass relations that reproduce both the JWST and pre-JWST observations. If the efficiency for BH mergers is high the JWST data prefer light seeds while the pre-JWST data prefers heavy seeds. The fit improves for a smaller merger efficiency, O(0.1), for which both data prefer heavy seeds, while also accommodating the PTA GW background data.

We investigate the coevolution of metals and dust for 173 galaxies at 4.0&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;11.4 observed with JWST/NIRSpec. We use the code CIGALE that integrates photometric and spectroscopic data. Our analysis reveals a critical transition at Mstar = 10^8.5 MSun, from galaxies dominated by supernovae and AGB stardust, to those dominated by grain growth. This implies a two-mode building of dust mass, supported by model predictions. The detection of stardust galaxies provides a natural and inherent explanation to the excess of UV-bright galaxies at z&amp;gt;10 by JWST. Besides, we observe that the metallicity of galaxies at z&amp;gt;8 presents a metal-to-stellar mass ratio larger than a few 10^-3, above a floor. This suggests a very fast rise of metals at high redshift, impacting the tentative detections of population III objects.

We present [OIII]/H_{\rm \beta} emision line flux ratio predictions for galaxies at z ~ 7-9 using the MAPPINGS V v5.2.0 photoionization modelling code combined with an analytic galaxy formation model. Properties such as pressure and ionization parameter that determine emission line properties are thought to evolve towards high redshift. In order to determine the range of expected interstellar conditions we extend previous modelling of the Star Formation Rate Density (SFRD) function to calculate the metallicity and ionization parameter, and incorporate the potential impact of turbulence on the density of the ISM. To validate our emission line predictions we calculate the [OIII] line luminosity and its dependence on UV luminosity, as well as the flux ratio [OIII]/H_{\rm \beta} and its variation with the line luminosity, finding that both reproduce recent JWST observations from the FRESCO survey. We also use our model to predict the number counts of emission line galaxies across a range of redshift as well as the dependence of [OIII]/H_{\rm \beta} on ionization parameter and metallicity. Finally, we show that the dependence of flux ratio on luminosity may provide a diagnostic of turbulent motion in galactic discs.

We use JWST/NIRISS slitless spectroscopy from the Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public (NGDEEP) Survey to investigate the physical condition of star-forming galaxies at 1.7 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 3.4. At these redshifts, the deep NGDEEP NIRISS slitless spectroscopy covers the [O II]\lambda\lambda3726,3729, [O III]\lambda\lambda4959,5007, H\beta and H\alpha emission features for galaxies with stellar masses \log(\mathrm{M_\ast/M_\odot}) \gtrsim 7, nearly a factor of a hundred lower than previous studies. We focus on the [O III]/[O II] (O_{32}) ratio which is primarily sensitive to the ionization state and with a secondary dependence on the gas-phase metallicity of the interstellar medium. We find significant (\gtrsim5\sigma) correlations between the O_{32} ratio and galaxy properties as O_{32} increases with decreasing stellar mass, decreasing star formation rate (SFR), increasing specific SFR (sSFR\equiv \mathrm{SFR}/M_*), and increasing equivalent width (EW) of H\beta and H\alpha. These trends suggest a tight connection between the ionization parameter and these galaxy properties. Galaxies at z~2-3 exhibit a higher O_{32} than local normal galaxies with the same stellar masses and SFRs, indicating that they have a higher ionization parameter and lower metallicity than local normal galaxies. In addition, we observe an evolutionary trend in the O_{32} -- EW(H\beta) relation from z~0 and z\gtrsim5, such that higher redshift galaxies have higher EW(H\beta) and higher O_{32} at fixed EW. We argue that both the enhanced recent star formation activity and the higher star formation surface density may contribute to the increase in O_{32} and the ionization parameter.

We analyze a sample of 4500 photometrically-selected Ha emitter galaxies at redshifts z~2 and z~4-6 selected from James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) medium-band images in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey South (GOODS-S). The bulk (80%) of the galaxies in our sample have stellar masses lower than 10^8 Msun, with a median stellar mass of ~10^7.3 Msun. We derive Ha rest-frame equivalent widths ( EW0(Ha) ), line fluxes, and star formation rates using a robust photometric excess technique tested against spectroscopic measurements, being sensitive to EW0(Ha) &amp;gt; 75 A. Both EW0(Ha) and sSFR(Ha) anti-correlate with stellar mass, and at fixed stellar mass, show a steep increasing trend with redshift sSFR(Ha) ~ (1+z)^2.55. By comparing the Ha and rest-frame UV-derived SFRs, we probe the star formation histories (SFHs) of our galaxies in the past 100 Myr. The fraction of low-mass galaxies (M &amp;lt; 10^8 Msun) with signs of bursty star formation from their SFR(Ha)/SFR(UV) is ~ 50 %. It quickly drops to ~ 25 % for M &amp;gt; 10^8 Msun. This is consistent with the results from sSFR(Ha), showing 80% and 17%, respectively. SFR(Ha)/SFR(UV) is a stricter criterion than those based on the galaxy sSFR(Ha), as it only identifies the strongest starbursts, the ones at the initial phases of a bursty star-formation episode.

Knowledge of the composition of material that will form planets is crucial to understand planetary diversity and the occurrence of potentially habitable planets. Ultimately, it is the chemistry in circumstellar disks that determines the global make up of planetary systems, as the dust in these disks grows into giant planet cores and rocky planets, the gas becomes incorporated in giant planet atmospheres, and the ices can be delivered to rocky planets by comets and meteorites. With the advent of ALMA a decade ago and the recent launch of JWST, the composition of the disk gas and ice can now be studied in great detail. This review will provide an overview of our current knowledge of the disk chemical structure, focusing on the six elements essential to life on Earth: carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S).

The first all-sky, high-resolution, 3D map of the optical extinction curve of the Milky Way (Zhang &amp; Green 2024) revealed an unexpected steepening of the extinction curve in the moderate-density, "translucent" interstellar medium (ISM). We argue that this trend is driven by growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) through gas-phase accretion. We find a strong anti-correlation between the slope of the optical extinction curve -- parameterized by R(V) -- and maps of PAH abundance -- parameterized by q_{\rm PAH} -- derived from infrared emission. The range of observed q_{\rm PAH} indicates PAH growth by a factor of ~2 between A_V ~eq 1 and 3. This implies a factor-of-two stronger 2175 Angstrom feature, which is sufficient to lower R(V) by the observed amount. This level of PAH growth is possible given rapid accretion timescales and the depletion of carbon in the translucent ISM. Spectral observations by JWST would provide a definitive test of this proposed explanation of R(V) variation.

Recent observations by JWST yield a large abundance of luminous galaxies at z\gtrsim 10 compared to that expected in the CDM scenario based on extrapolations of the star formation efficiency measured at lower redshifts. While several astrophysical processes can be responsible for such observations, here we explore to what extent such an effect can be rooted in the assumed Dark Energy (DE) sector of the current cosmological model. This is motivated by recent results from different cosmological probes combined with the last data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), which indicate a tension in the DE sector of the concordance {\Lambda} CDM model. We have considered the effect of assuming a DE characterized by a negative {\Lambda} as the ground state of a quintessence field on the galaxy luminosity function (LF) at high redshifts. We find that such models naturally affect the galaxy UV luminosities in the redshift range 10 \lesssim z\lesssim 15 needed to match the JWST observations, and with the value of {\Omega}_{\Lambda}=[-0.6,-0.3] remarkably consistent with that required by independent cosmological probes. A sharp prediction of such models is the steep decline of the abundance of bright galaxies in the redshift range 15 \lesssim z\lesssim 16.

Red quasars, often associated with potent [OIII] outflows on both galactic and circumgalactic scales, may play a pivotal role in galactic evolution and black hole feedback. In this work, we explore the [FeII] emission in one such quasar at redshift z = 0.4352, F2M J110648.32+480712.3, using the integral field unit (IFU) mode of the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) aboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Our observations reveal clumpy [FeII] gas located to the south of the quasar. By comparing the kinematics of [FeII] and [OIII], we find that the clumpy [FeII] gas in the southeast and southwest aligns with the outflow, exhibiting similar median velocities up to v_50 ~ 1200 km/s and high velocity widths W_80 &amp;gt; 1000 km/s. In contrast, the [FeII] gas to the south shows kinematics inconsistent with the outflow, with W_80 ~ 500 km/s, significantly smaller than the [OIII] at the same location, suggesting that the [FeII] may be confined within the host galaxy. Utilizing standard emission-line diagnostic ratios, we map the ionization sources of the gas. According to the MAPPINGS III shock models for [FeII]/Pabeta, the regions to the southwest and southeast of the quasar are primarily photoionized. Conversely, the [FeII] emission to the south is likely excited by shocks generated by the back-pressure of the outflow on the galaxy disk, a direct signature of the impact of the quasar on its host.

We explore the reliability and robustness in measuring the age, metallicity and mass of a sample of old Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) from their integrated light, setting the stage for using GCs as cosmic clocks at high redshift. We analyse 77 GCs from the WAGGS project, first by measuring Lick indices and spectroscopic breaks with PyLick, then performing full-spectral-fitting (FSF) with BAGPIPES. The analysis of Lick indices offers an estimate of the GCs' age and [Z/H], generally aligning with literature values, but highlights a subset of old GCs for which we estimate younger ages. This discrepancy is attributed to the presence of blue horizontal branches (HB), which are not accounted for in the stellar population models. With FSF we measure the GCs' ages, [Z/H], and masses, also testing the cosmological prior's impact on ages. Compared to isochrone fitting estimates, ages are best recovered when the cosmological prior is removed, with a 20% increase in GCs' ages compatible with literature values (within \pm1.5 Gyr). The derived [Z/H] and mass agree with the reference values, regardless of HB morphology or fit setting, with average discrepancies across the entire sample of \Delta[Z/H]=-0.02\pm0.24 dex and \Delta log(M/M_{\odot})=0.04\pm 0.28 dex. Ages are best recovered for metal-rich GCs ([Z/H]\geq-0.4) showing a red HB (HBR&amp;gt;0), with 70% of the results compatible with literature values. Using a Gaussian Mixture Model, we identify a tail of 24 old GCs with age=13.4\pm1.1 Gyr. Being a natural lower limit to the age of the Universe, we use this value to constrain H_0, obtaining H_0 = 70.5^{+7.7}_{-6.3} km/s/Mpc (stat+syst) when a flat \LambdaCDM with \Omega_m =0.30 \pm 0.02 is assumed. Validating the study of GCs based on integrated light lays the foundation to extend this type of study to high-z, where lensed GCs have begun to appear, thanks to JWST. (abridged)

&lt;p&gt;
Early JWST observations have revealed the ubiquitous presence in the early Universe, up to z about 16, of extreme baryon concentrations, namely forming globular clusters, extremely dense galaxies that may or may not be UV bright, and supermassive black holes in relatively low-mass galaxies. This paper is trying to pinpoint which physical conditions may have favored the formation of such concentrations, that appear to be very common at high redshifts while their formation being progressively more and more rare at lower redshifts. Building on local globular cluster evidence, it is argued that such conditions can consist in a combination of a 10 Myr extended feedback free time, coupled to low angular-momentum densities in deep local minima of the ISM vorticity field, where baryon concentrations are more likely to form. It is argued that the former condition would follow from more massive stars failing to explode as supernovae, and the latter one from low vorticity prevailing in the early Universe, in contrast to later times with their secular increase of the angular momentum density due to the cumulative effect of tidal interactions.

&lt;p&gt;
Recent JWST observations have revealed a large population of intermediate/low-luminosity AGN at early times with peculiar properties, different from local AGN or luminous quasars. To better understand the physical conditions in the BLRs of these early AGN, we used the optical FeII (4434--4684 &amp;#8491;) and the broad \rm H \beta emission, and the ratio between their equivalent widths R_{Fe}, as a probe on a purposefully assembled sample. Specifically, we gathered a sample of 26 high redshift (\langle z \rangle=6.4) AGN, observed by JWST, with broad \rm H\beta detection both in the high and low luminosity regimes (respectively 14 faint AGN and 12 quasars), to investigate their optical FeII emission properties. In addition, we carefully selected control samples at lower z. We found that the population of faint AGN (\rm \log(L_{H \beta} / (erg \, s^{-1}))\lesssim 44) exhibits a significantly lower FeII emission than their local counterparts (R_{Fe}&amp;lt;0.24 versus R_{Fe}~eq0.85 in the control sample), while the quasars at the epoch of reionisation observed by JWST present a FeII emission profile that closely resembles that observed at z&amp;lt;3. We argue that the weakness of the FeII bump in the faint JWST AGN might be due to the reduced metallicity of their broad line region (\lesssim 0.5~Z_{\odot}), while luminous quasars have already reached chemical maturity (~ Z{_\odot} or higher). Lastly, we highlight an intriguing similarity between the spectral properties of the high redshift population of faint AGN with those harboured in local metal poor dwarf galaxies.

&lt;p&gt;
Blind spectroscopy of massive lensing galaxy clusters with MUSE has revealed large numbers of gravitationally-lensed Lyman- \alpha emitters exhibiting asymmetric profiles at 2.9 \leq z \leq 6.7 , suggesting abundant outflows from low-mass star-forming galaxies in the early universe. Are these primaeval galaxies experiencing their first bursts of star formation, or established galaxies experiencing rejuvenation? With JWST rest-frame optical/NIR continuum imaging now available for many of these objects, we can search for older stellar populations. Here, we search for spectroscopic confirmation of outflows from these galaxies, finding a few high-signal-to-noise cases in which blueshifted interstellar absorption lines are detected. Next, we analyse the star formation histories with combined HST + JWST photometry. We find most them to be well characterised by very young, low metallicity stellar populations. However, despite the rest-frame optical/NIR coverage of JWST, we cannot place strict upper bounds on the mass in old stars (age &amp;gt; 100\,\text{Myr} ).

&lt;p&gt;
We present a new analytical model for the attenuation to Epoch of Reionization (EoR) galaxies by proximate neutral hydrogen gas. Many galaxy spectra in the EoR taken by JWST have shown a flux deficit at wavelengths just redward of the Lyman break, and this has been regarded as resulting from Ly\alpha damping wing absorption by the increasing amount of neutral hydrogen in the line-of-sight. However, previous attenuation models for the intergalactic medium (IGM) commonly used in photometric redshift template-fitting codes assume that the Lyman break is rather sharp, which leads to systematic overestimation of photometric redshifts at z&amp;gt;7. In this letter, we build and empirically calibrate a new attenuation model that takes the increased Ly\alpha damping wing absorption into account. Our model consists of the canonical IGM absorption and an additional absorption component due to dense neutral hydrogen gas clouds proximate to the galaxy, and we derive the redshift evolution of HI column density of the proximate clouds by calibrating the model using CANUCS JWST observations. The resulting total transmission curve resolves the photometric redshift bias at z&amp;gt;7, an improvement that is robust to choice of template-fitting code, template set, and photometric catalog used. The new attenuation model can be easily implemented in existing template-fitting codes, and significantly improves the photometric redshift performance in the EoR.

&lt;p&gt;
The observed prevalence of galaxies exhibiting bursty star formation histories (SFHs) at z\gtrsim6 has created new challenges and opportunities for understanding their formation pathways. The degenerate effects of the efficiency and burstiness of star formation on the observed UV luminosity function are separable by galaxy clustering. However, quantifying the timescales of burstiness requires more than just the continuum UV measurements. Here we develop a flexible semi-analytic framework for modeling both the amplitude of star formation rate (SFR) variations and their temporal correlation, from which the luminosity function and clustering can be derived for SFR indicators tracing different characteristic timescales (e.g., UV continuum and H\alpha luminosities). Based on this framework, we study the prospect of using galaxy summary statistics to distinguish models where SFR fluctuations are prescribed by different power spectral density (PSD) forms. Using the Fisher matrix approach, we forecast the constraints on parameters in our PSD-based model that can be extracted from mock JWST observations of the UV and H\alpha luminosity functions and clustering bias factors at z~6. These constraints demonstrate the feasibility of constraining the burstiness of high-z galaxies solely from their one-point and two-point statistics and underscore the importance of combining tracers of both long-term and short-term SFR variations. Our flexible framework can be readily extended to characterize the SFH of high-redshift galaxies with a wider range of observational diagnostics.

&lt;p&gt;
We first briefly review the adventure of scale invariance in physics, from Galileo Galilei, Weyl, Einstein, and Feynman to the revival by Dirac (1973) and Canuto et al. (1977). We then gather concrete observational evidence that scale-invariant effects are present and measurable in astronomical objects spanning a vast range of masses (0.5 M_{\odot} &amp;lt; M &amp;lt; 10^{14} M_{\odot}) and an equally impressive range of spatial scales (0.01 pc &amp;lt; r &amp;lt; 1 Gpc). Scale invariance accounts for the observed excess in velocity in galaxy clusters with respect to the visible mass, the relatively flat/small slope of rotation curves in local galaxies, the observed steep rotation curves of high-redshift galaxies, and the excess of velocity in wide binary stars with separations above 3000 kau found in Gaia DR3. Last but not least, we investigate the effect of scale invariance on gravitational lensing. We show that scale invariance does not affect the geodesics of light rays as they pass in the vicinity of a massive galaxy. However, scale-invariant effects do change the inferred mass-to-light ratio of lens galaxies as compared to GR. As a result, the discrepancies seen in GR between the total lensing mass of galaxies and their stellar mass from photometry may be accounted for. This holds true both for lenses at high redshift like JWST-ER1 and at low redshift like in the SLACS sample. Of note is that none of the above observational tests require dark matter or any adjustable parameter to tweak the theory at any given mass or spatial scale.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed unexpectedly rapid galaxy assembly in the early universe, in tension with models of star and galaxy formation. In the gas conditions typical of early galaxies, particularly their low abundances of heavy elements (metals) and dust, the star-formation process is poorly understood. Some models predict that stars form in atomic gas at low metallicity, in contrast to forming in molecular gas as observed in higher-metallicity galaxies. To understand the very high star-formation rates at early epochs, it is necessary to determine whether molecular gas formation represents a bottleneck to star formation, or if it is plentiful even at extremely low metallicity. Despite repeated searches, star-forming molecular gas has not yet been observed in any galaxy below 7% of the Solar metallicity, leaving the question of how stars form at lower metallicities unresolved. Here, we report the detection of rotationally excited emission from molecular hydrogen in the star-forming region of the nearby, 3% Solar metallicity galaxy Leo P with the MIRI-MRS instrument onboard JWST. These observations place a lower limit on the molecular gas content of Leo P and, combined with our upper limit on carbon monoxide emission from a deep search of this galaxy, demonstrate that MIRI-MRS is sensitive to much smaller molecular gas masses at extremely low metallicity compared to the traditional observational tracer. This discovery pushes the maximum metallicity at which purely atomic gas may fuel star formation a factor of two lower, providing crucial empirical guidance for models of star formation in the early universe.

We present a joint analysis of high-resolution CO(2-1) and Paschen-\alpha emission lines to trace gas dynamics and spatially resolved star formation in ASPECS-LP.3mm.06, a z=1.1 main sequence galaxy. Utilizing data from the ALMA and JWST NIRCam Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS), we explore both ionized gas and molecular gas within this galaxy. With a substantial molecular gas fraction (f_\mathrm{mol} = 0.44 \pm 0.02), ASPECS-LP.3mm.06 remains on the star-forming main sequence and adheres to the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, indicating typical gas-to-star conversion efficiency. Our analysis reveals extended structures across multiple wavelengths, suggesting regulated star formation within a stable disk. The spatially resolved star formation efficiency (SFE) and kinematic analysis indicate that ASPECS-LP.3mm.06 features a smooth mass assembly process across bulge and disk. Additionally, the galaxy exhibits modest dust extinction (A_\mathrm{V} = 0.8), potentially linked to self-regulation during bulge formation. These findings position ASPECS-LP.3mm.06 as a prototypical galaxy, offering valuable insights into the mechanisms governing normal disk galaxy growth at z~1.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered an abundant population of compact, extremely red, and X-ray weak objects at z\gtrsim4, knows as ``Little Red Dots" (LRDs). These objects exhibit spectral energy distributions that resemble both active galactic nuclei (AGN) and stellar population templates. However, whether dominated by AGN activity or compact star formation, the high redshifts and masses/luminosities of LRDs, coupled with their significant abundance, present potential challenges to the standard \LambdaCDM model. In this work, we proposes a novel cosmic interpretation of this anomaly, suggesting that these LRDs are likely massive galaxies seeded by supermassive primordial black holes (SMPBHs) came into being in the very early universe. We analyze 434 known LRDs from the 0.54 {\rm deg}^2 COSMOS-Web survey and test the hypothesis that they originated from SMPBHs assuming sub-Eddington accretion. According to our result, SMPBHs actually could lead to the existence of more LRDs, even at higher redshifts (z&amp;gt;8).

&lt;p&gt;
The intracluster medium (ICM) today is comprised largely of hot gas with clouds of cooler gas of unknown origin and lifespan. We analyze the evolution of cool gas (temperatures \lesssim10^{4.5} K) in the ICM of 352 galaxy clusters from the TNG-Cluster simulations, with present-day mass ~10^{14.3-15.4}\,{\rm M_\odot}. We follow the main progenitors of these clusters over the past ~13 billion years (since z\lesssim7) and find that, according to TNG-Cluster, the cool ICM mass increases with redshift at fixed cluster mass, implying that this cooler past of the ICM is due to more than just halo growth. The cool cluster gas at z\lesssim0.5 is mostly located in and around satellite galaxies, while at z\gtrsim2 cool gas can also accrete via filaments from the intergalactic medium. Lower-mass and higher-redshift clusters are more susceptible to cooling. The cool ICM mass correlates with the number of gaseous satellites and inversely with the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass. The average number of gaseous satellites decreases since z=2, correlating with the decline in the cool ICM mass over cosmic time, suggesting a link between the two. Concurrently, kinetic SMBH feedback shifts the ICM temperature distribution, decreasing the cool ICM mass inside-out. At z\approx0.5, the predicted MgII column densities are in the ballpark of recent observations, where satellites and other halos contribute significantly to the total MgII column density. Suggestively, a non-negligible amount of the ICM cool gas forms stars in-situ at early times, reaching ~10^{2}\,{\rm M_\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}} and an H\alpha surface brightness of ~10^{-17}\,{\rm~erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,arcsec^{-2}} at z\approx2, detectable with Euclid and JWST.

&lt;p&gt;
The properties of luminous, blue (a.k.a. Blue Monsters), super-early galaxies at redshift z&amp;gt;10 have been successfully explained by the attenuation-free model (AFM) in which dust is pushed to kpc-scales by radiation-driven outflows. As an alternative to AFM, here we assess whether *attenuation-free* conditions can be replaced by a *dust-free* scenario in which dust is produced in very limited amounts and/or later destroyed in the interstellar medium. To this aim we compare the predicted values of the dust-to-stellar mass ratio, \xi_d, with those measured in 15 galaxies at z&amp;gt;10 from JWST spectra, when outflows are not included. Our model constrains \xi_d as a function of several parameters by allowing wide variations in the IMF, dust/metal production, and dust destruction for a set of SN progenitor models and explosion energies. We find \log \xi_d \approx -2.2 for all systems, indicative of the dominant role of SN dust production over destruction in these early galaxies. Such value is strikingly different from the data, which instead indicate \log \xi_d &amp;lt; -4. We conclude that dust destruction alone can hardly explain the transparency of Blue Monsters. Other mechanisms, such as outflows, might be required.

&lt;p&gt;
Recent studies of high-redshift galaxies using JWST, such as GN-z11 revealed highly elevated levels of nitrogen (N). This phenomenon extends to gravitationally-lensed galaxies like the Sunburst Arc at z = 2.37, as well as to globular clusters (GCs). We propose that this originates from the presence of very massive stars (VMSs) with masses ranging from 100 to 1000\,\Msun. The He {\sc ii} observed in the Sunburst Arc could also stem from the disproportionately large contribution of VMSs. We build an entirely new Framework for massive star evolution which is no longer set by Dutch or other mass-loss "recipes" but which take the physics of \Gamma or L/M-dependent winds into account. We discuss the mass-loss kink and the transition mass-loss rate between optically thin and thick winds, before we study the evaporative mass-loss history of VMSs. Our novel evolution models exhibit vertical evolution in the HR-diagram from the zero-age main sequence due to a self-regulatory effect driven by their wind-dominated nature, and we discuss what wind physics sets the stellar upper-mass limit. Our estimate for the Sunburst Arc in Vink (2023) suggests that the significant amounts of N found in star-forming galaxies likely arise from VMSs. We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of previous hypotheses, including fast rotating massive stars and supermassive stars (SMSs), and we conclude that only our VMS model satisfies the relevant criteria. Finally, we advocate for the inclusion of VMSs in population synthesis and chemical evolution models, emphasizing the need for a self-consistent wind approach, which currently does not exist. Even minor inaccuracies in mass-loss rates dramatically impact the stellar evolution of VMS, as well as their ionizing and chemical feedback.

&lt;p&gt;
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are responsible for strong mid-IR emission features near star-forming regions. It is well known that low-metallicity environments exhibit weaker PAH emission, but it is not clear how the metallicity affects the properties of the emitting PAH population. We present a detailed study of the PAH emission in the low-metallicity regime represented by 30 Dor in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and we compare it to the PAH emission in the Orion Bar to investigate the characteristics of the PAH population and how the environments affects the resulting IR emission. We analyze JWST observations of 30 Dor that include imaging (NIRCam, MIRI) and spectroscopy (NIRSpec/IFU, MIRI/MRS). We extracted NIRSpec/IFU and MIRI/MRS spectra from 18 apertures that cover the morphological structures of 30 Dor. We characterize the profiles and relative intensities of PAH emission in these apertures. The detailed profiles of the PAH emission bands in 30 Dor are all very similar, and compare well to those from one of the dissociation fronts (DF2) in the Orion Bar. The relative band ratios on the other hand show a much larger range than in the Orion Bar. The PAH emission in 30 Dor originates from a population with a higher ionization fraction than in the Orion Bar, and a size distribution that has more smaller PAHs. Since smaller PAHs typically photo-fragment before larger PAHs, our findings support the hypothesis that the lower PAH emission for lower metallicities is the result of inhibition of growth toward larger PAHs rather than photo-fragmentation.

We present JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopic characterization of GHZ9 at z= 10.145 \pm 0.010, currently the most distant source detected by the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The spectrum reveals several UV high-ionization lines, including CII, SiIV, [NIV], CIV, HeII, OIII], NIII], and CIII]. The prominent rest-frame equivalent widths (EW(CIV)~eq65A, EW(HeII)~eq18A, EW(CIII])~eq48A) show the presence of a hard radiation field, while the analysis of line ratio diagnostics suggest this galaxy hosts both AGN and star-formation activity. GHZ9 is nitrogen-enriched (6--9.5 times solar), carbon-poor (0.2--0.65 times solar), metal-poor (Z = 0.01--0.1 Z_{\odot}), and compact (&amp;lt; 106 pc), similarly to GNz11, GHZ2, and recently discovered N-enhanced high redshift objects. We exploited the newly available JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam dataset to perform an independent analysis of the Chandra data confirming that GHZ9 is the most likely JWST source associated to X-ray emission at 0.5-7 keV. Assuming a spectral index \Gamma = 2.3 (1.8), we estimate a black hole (BH) mass of 1.60 \pm 0.31 (0.48 \pm 0.09) \times 10^8M_{\odot}, which is consistent either with Eddington-accretion onto heavy (\geq 10^6 M_{\odot}) BH seeds formed at z=18, or super-Eddington accretion onto a light seed of ~ 10^2-10^4 M_{\odot} at z = 25. The corresponding BH-to-stellar mass ratio M_{BH}/M_{star}= 0.33\pm0.22 (0.10\pm0.07), with a stringent limit &amp;gt;0.02, implies an accelerated growth of the BH mass with respect to the stellar mass. GHZ9 is the ideal target to constrain the early phases of AGN-galaxy coevolution with future multi-frequency observations.

[Abridged] The [OIII]_{88&amp;mu; m}/[CII]_{158&amp;mu; m} and [OIII]_{88&amp;mu; m}/[NII]_{122&amp;mu; m} luminosity ratios have shown to be promising tracers of the ionisation state and gas-phase metallicity of the ISM. Observations of galaxies at redshift z &amp;gt; 6 show peculiarly higher [OIII]_{88&amp;mu; m}/[CII]_{158&amp;mu; m} luminosity ratios compared to local sources. No model has so far successfully managed to match the observed emission from both [OIII]_{88&amp;mu; m} and [CII]_{158&amp;mu; m} as well as their ratio. We use Cloudy to model the [CII]_{158&amp;mu; m}, [OIII]_{88&amp;mu; m}, [NII]_{122&amp;mu; m} and [NIII]_{57&amp;mu; m} emission lines of Ponos: a high-resolution (m_{\mathrm{gas}} = 883.4\, M_{\odot}) cosmological zoom-in simulation of a galaxy at redshift z = 6.5, which is post-processed using kramses-rt. We modify Carbon, Nitrogen and Oxygen abundances in our Cloudy models to obtain C/O and N/O abundance ratios respectively lower and higher than Solar, more in line with recent high-z observational constraints. We find [OIII]_{88&amp;mu; m}/[CII]_{158&amp;mu; m} luminosity ratios that are a factor of ~ 5 higher compared to models assuming solar abundances. Additionally, we find an overall better agreement of the simulation with high-z observational constraints of the [CII]_{158&amp;mu; m}-SFR and [OIII]_{88&amp;mu; m}-SFR relations. This shows that a lower C/O abundance ratio is essential to reproduce the enhanced [OIII]_{88&amp;mu; m}/[CII]_{158&amp;mu; m} luminosity ratios observed at z &amp;gt; 6. By assuming a super-solar N/O ratio, motivated by recent z &amp;gt; 6 JWST observations, our models yield an [OIII]_{88&amp;mu; m}/[NII]_{122&amp;mu; m} ratio of 1.3, which, according to current theoretical models, would be more appropriate for a galaxy with a lower ionisation parameter than the one we estimated for Ponos.

The presence of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in low mass (Mstar \lesssim 10^{9} Msun) galaxies at high redshift has been established, and it is important to characterise these objects and the impact of their feedback on the host galaxies. In this paper we apply the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting code BEAGLE-AGN to SMACS S06355, a z ~ 7.66 Type-II AGN candidate from the JWST NIRSpec Early Release Observations. This object's spectrum includes a detection of the [NeIV]2426 line, indicating an obscured AGN due to its high ionization potential energy (~ 63eV). We use BEAGLE-AGN to simultaneously model the Narrow Line Region (NLR) AGN and star-forming galaxy contributions to the observed line fluxes and photometry. Having a high-ionization emission line allows the contribution of the NLR to the remaining lines to be probabilistically disentangled. The HII region metallicity is derived to be 12+log(O/H)^{\mathrm{HII}} = 7.74^{+0.18}_{-0.19}. Assuming that the Neon-to-Oxygen abundance is similar to solar we derive a high NLR metallicity of 12+log(O/H)^\mathrm{{NLR}} = 8.77^{+0.14}_{-0.16}, with the 2\sigma lower-limit extending to 12+log(O/H)^{\mathrm{NLR}} ~ 8.00, showing the derivation is uncertain. We discuss this result with respect to non-solar Neon abundances that might boost the inferred NLR metallicity. The NLR metallicity places SMACS S06355 in a comparable region of the mass-metallicity plane to intermediate (1.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 3.0) redshift obscured AGN. Our derived accretion disc luminosity, log(L_{acc} / erg s^{-1}) = 45.19^{+0.12}_{-0.11}, is moderately high yet still uncertain. We highlight that deviations between bolometric luminosity calibrations and model grid tracks become enhanced at low metallicities.

It has been proposed, and confirmed by multiple observations, that disks around low mass stars display a molecule-rich emission and carbon-rich disk chemistry as compared to their hotter, more massive solar counterparts. In this work, we present JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey (JDISCS) MIRI-MRS observations of the solar-mass star DoAr 33, a low-accretion rate T Tauri star showing an exceptional carbon-rich inner disk. We report detections of H_2O, OH, and CO_2, as well as the more complex hydrocarbons, C_2H_2 and C_4H_2. Through the use of thermochemical models, we explore different spatial distributions of carbon and oxygen across the inner disk and compare the column densities and temperatures obtained from LTE slab model retrievals. We find a best match to the observed column densities with models that have carbon enrichment, and the retrieved emitting temperature and area of C_2H_2 with models that have C/O = 2-4 inside the 500 K carbon-rich dust sublimation line. This suggests that the origin of the carbon-rich chemistry is likely due to the sublimation of carbon rich grains near the soot line. This would be consistent with the presence of dust processing as indicated by the detection of crystalline silicates. We propose that this long-lived hydrocarbon rich chemistry observed around a solar-mass star is a consequence of the unusually low M-star-like accretion rate of the central star, which lengthens the radial mixing timescale of the inner disk allowing the chemistry powered by carbon grain destruction to linger.

We develop a parametrised model to describe the formation and evolution of massive black holes, designed for comparisons with both electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations. Using an extended Press-Schechter formalism, we generate dark matter halo merger trees. We then seed and evolve massive black holes through parameterised prescriptions. This approach, which avoids solving differential equations, is computationally efficient, enabling us to analyse observational data and infer the parameters of our model in a fully Bayesian framework. We find that observations of the black hole luminosity function are compatible with the nHz gravitational wave signal (likely) measured by PTAs, provided we allow for an increased luminosity function at high redshift (4-7), as recently suggested by JWST observations. Our model can simultaneously reproduce the bulk of the M_*-M_{\rm BH} relation at z-0, as well as its outliers, something cosmological simulations struggle to do. The inferred model parameters are consistent with expectations from observations and more complex simulations: They favour heavier black hole seeds and short delays between halo and black hole mergers, while requiring supper-Edington accretion episodes lasting a few tens of million years, which in our model are linked to galaxy mergers. We find accretion to be suppressed in the most massive black holes below z~eq 2.5, consistently with the anti-hierarchical growth hypothesis. Finally, our predictions for LISA, although fairly broad, are in agreement with previous models. Our model offers a new perspective on the apparent tensions between the black hole luminosity function and the latest JWST and PTA results. Its flexibility makes it ideal to fully exploit the potential of future gravitational wave observations of massive black hole binaries with LISA.

We present spectroscopic properties of 22 Lyman-alpha emitters(LAEs) at z=5.5-6.6 with Lyman-alpha(Lya) luminosity log(L_{Lya}[ergs^{-1}])=42.4-43.5, obtained using VLT/MUSE as part of the Middle Ages Galaxy Properties with Integral Field Spectroscopy(MAGPI) survey. Additionally, we incorporate broad-band photometric data from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam(HSC) for 17 LAEs in our sample. The HSC-y band magnitudes show that our LAEs are UV-bright, with rest-frame absolute UV magnitudes -19.7 &amp;lt; M_{UV} &amp;lt; -23.3. We find that the Lya line width increases with luminosity, and this trend becomes more prominent at z &amp;gt; 6 where Lya lines become significantly broadened (&amp;gt; 260 kms^{-1}) at luminosities log(L_{Lya}[ergs^{-1}]) &amp;gt; 43. This broadening is consistent with previous studies, suggesting that these sources are located inside larger ionized bubbles. We observe a slightly elevated ionizing photon production efficiency estimated for LAEs at z &amp;gt; 6, indicating that younger galaxies could be producing more ionizing photons per UV luminosity. A tentative anti-correlation between ionizing photon production efficiency and Lya rest-frame equivalent width is noticed, which could indicate a time delay between production and escape of ionizing photon primarily due to supernovae activity. Furthermore, we find a positive correlation between bubble radius and Lya line width, which again suggests that large ionized bubbles are created around these LAEs, allowing them to self-shield from the scattering effects of the intergalactic medium (IGM). We also detect two closely separated LAEs at z=6.046 (projected spatial separation is 15.92 kpc). The size of their respective bubbles suggests that they likely sit inside a common large ionized region. Such a closely-separated LAE pair increases the size of ionized bubble, potentially allowing a boosted transmission of Lya through neutral IGM. (Abridged)

We present archival HST and JWST ultraviolet through near infrared time series photometric observations of a massive minimal-contact binary candidate in the metal-poor galaxy WLM (Z = 0.14 Z_{\odot}). This discovery marks the lowest metallicity contact binary candidate observed to date. We determine the nature of the two stars in the binary by using the eclipsing binary modeling software (PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs; PHOEBE) to train a neural network to fit our observed panchromatic multi-epoch photometry. The best fit model consists of two hot MS stars (T_1=29800^{+2300}_{-1700} K, M_1=16^{+2}_{-3}~M_{\odot}, and T_2=18000^{+5000}_{-5000} K, M_2=7^{+5}_{-3}~M_{\odot}). We discuss plausible evolutionary paths for the system, and suggest the system is likely to be currently in a contact phase before ultimately ending in a merger. Future spectroscopy will help to further narrow down evolutionary pathways. This work showcases a novel use of data of JWST and HST imaging originally taken to characterize RR Lyrae. We expect time series imaging from LSST, BlackGEM, etc. to uncover similar types of objects in nearby galaxies.

Predicting star cluster dissolution rates from a time-series analysis of their tidal histories</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16389v1</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;
Most of the dynamical mass loss from star clusters is thought to be caused by the time-variability of the tidal field (``tidal shocks''). Systematic studies of tidal shocks have been hampered by the fact that each tidal history is unique, implying both a reproducibility and a generalisation problem. Here we address these issues by investigating how star cluster evolution depends on the statistical properties of its tidal history. We run a large suite of direct N-body simulations of clusters with tidal histories generated from power spectra of a given slope and with different normalisations, which determine the time-scales and amplitudes of the shocks, respectively. At fixed normalisation (i.e. the same median tidal field strength), the dissolution time-scale is nearly independent of the power spectrum slope. However, the dispersion in dissolution time-scales, obtained by repeating simulations for different realisations of statistically identical tidal histories, increases with the power spectrum slope. This result means that clusters experiencing high-frequency shocks have more similar mass loss histories than clusters experiencing low-frequency shocks. The density-mass relationship of the simulated clusters follows a power-law with slope between 1.08 and 1.45, except for the lowest normalisations (for which clusters effectively evolve in a static tidal field). Our findings suggest that star cluster evolution can be described statistically from a time-series analysis of its tidal history, which is an important simplification for describing the evolution of the star cluster population during galaxy formation and evolution.

&lt;p&gt;
The evolution of galaxy sizes in different wavelengths provides unique insights on galaxy build-up across cosmic epochs. Such measurements can now finally be done at z&amp;gt;3 thanks to the exquisite spatial resolution and multi-wavelength capability of the JWST. With the public data from the CEERS, PRIMER-UDS, and PRIMER-COSMOS surveys, we measure the sizes of ~ 3500 star-forming galaxies at 3 \leqslant z&amp;lt;9, in 7 NIRCam bands using the multi-wavelength model fitting code GalfitM. The size-mass relation is measured in four redshift bins, across all NIRCam bands. We find that, the slope and intrinsic scatter of the rest-optical size-mass relation are constant across this redshift range and consistent with previous HST-based studies at low-z. When comparing the relations across different wavelengths, the average rest-optical and rest-UV relations are consistent with each other up to z=6, but the intrinsic scatter is largest in rest-UV wavelengths compared to rest-optical and redder bands. This behaviour is independent of redshift and we speculate that it is driven by bursty star-formation in z&amp;gt;4 galaxies. Additionally, for 3\leqslant z&amp;lt;4 star-forming galaxies at \rm M_* &amp;gt; 10^{10} M_{\odot}, we find smaller rest-\rm 1\rm\,&amp;mu; m sizes in comparison to rest-optical (and rest-UV) sizes, suggestive of colour gradients. When comparing to simulations, we find agreement over \rm M_* \approx 10^{9} - 10^{10} M_{\odot} but beyond this mass, the observed size-mass relation is significantly steeper. Our results show the power of JWST/NIRCam to provide new constraints on galaxy formation models.

&lt;p&gt;
The asymmetry in the large-scale distribution of the directions towards spiral galaxies rotate has been observed by multiple telescopes, all show a consistent asymmetry in the distribution of galaxy spin directions as observed from Earth. Here, galaxies with redshift from HSC DR3 are annotated by their direction of rotation, and their distribution is analyzed. The results show that galaxies that rotate in the opposite direction relative to the Milky Way as observed from Earth are significantly more prevalent compared to galaxies that rotate in the same direction relative to the Milky Way. The asymmetry also forms a dipole axis that becomes stronger when the redshift gets higher. These results are aligned with observations from virtually all premier digital sky surveys, as well as space telescopes such as HST and JWST. That shows that the distribution of galaxy spin directions as observed from Earth is not symmetric, and has a possible link to the rotational velocity of the Milky Way. The experiment is provided with data, code, and a full protocol that allows to easily reproduce the results in a transparent manner. That practice is used to overcome the ``reproducibility crisis" in science.

&lt;p&gt;
The first few cycles of JWST have identified an overabundance of UV-bright galaxies and a general excess of UV luminosity density at z\gtrsim10 compared to expectations from most (pre-JWST) theoretical models. Moreover, some of the brightest high-redshift spectroscopically confirmed galaxies exhibit peculiar chemical abundance patterns, most notably extremely high N/O ratios. Since N/O has been empirically shown to scale strongly with He/H, as expected for hot hydrogen burning, these same bright high-redshift galaxies are likely also helium-enhanced. Under simplistic assumptions for stellar evolution, the bolometric luminosity of a star scales as L\propto (4-\frac{9}{2}Y+\frac{5}{4}Y^{2})^{-1} -- hence a higher He/H leads to brighter stars. In this Letter, we evolve a series of MESA models to the zero-age main-sequence and highlight that the helium enhancements at the levels measured and inferred for high-redshift galaxies can boost the 1500 \mathring{\rm A} UV luminosity by up to ~50&amp;percnt;, while simultaneously increasing the stellar effective temperature. The combination of helium enhancements with nebular continuum emission expected for intense bursts of star formation have the potential to help reduce the tension between JWST observations and certain galaxy formation models.

We present the first results of the JWST Emission Line Survey (JELS). Utilising the first NIRCam narrow-band imaging at 4.7&amp;mu;m, over 63 arcmin^{2} in the PRIMER/COSMOS field, we identified 609 emission line galaxy candidates. From these, we robustly selected 35 H\alpha star-forming galaxies at z ~ 6.1, with H\alpha star-formation rates (\rm{SFR_{H\alpha}}) ~0.9-15\ \rm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}. Combining our unique H\alpha sample with the exquisite panchromatic data in the field, we explored their physical properties and star-formation histories, and compared these to a broad-band selected sample at z~ 6 which offered vital new insights into the nature of high-redshift galaxies. UV-continuum slopes (\beta) were considerably redder for our H\alpha sample (\langle\beta\rangle~-1.92) compared to the broad-band sample (\langle\beta\rangle~-2.35). This was not due to dust attenuation as our H\alpha sample was relatively dust-poor (median A_V=0.23); instead, we argued the reddened slopes could be due to nebular continuum. We compared \rm{SFR_{H\alpha}} and the UV-continuum-derived \rm{SFR_{UV}} to SED-fitted measurements averaged over canonical timescales of 10 and 100 Myr (\rm{SFR_{10}} and \rm{SFR_{100}}). We found an increase in recent SFR for our sample of H\alpha emitters, particularly at lower stellar masses (&amp;lt;10^9 \ \rm{M_{\odot}}). We also found \rm{SFR_{H\alpha}} strongly traced SFR averaged over 10 Myr timescales, whereas the UV-continuum over-predicts SFR on 100 Myr timescales at low stellar masses. These results point to our H\alpha sample undergoing `bursty' star formation. Our F356W z ~ 6 sample showed a larger scatter in \rm{SFR_{10}/SFR_{100}} across all stellar masses, which highlighted how narrow-band photometric selections of H\alpha emitters are key to quantifying the burstiness of star-formation activity.

We present the JWST Emission Line Survey (JELS), a Cycle 1 JWST imaging programme exploiting the wavelength coverage and sensitivity of NIRCam to extend narrow-band rest-optical emission line selection into the epoch of reionization (EoR) for the first time, and to enable unique studies of the resolved ionised gas morphology in individual galaxies across cosmic history. The primary JELS observations comprise ~4.7&amp;mu;m narrow-band imaging over ~63 arcmin^{2} designed to enable selection of H\alpha emitters at z~6.1, as well as the selection of a host of novel emission-line samples including [OIII] at z~8.3 and Pa \alpha/\beta at z~1.5/2.8. For the prime F466N and F470N narrow-band observations, the emission-line sensitivities achieved are up to ~2\times more sensitive than current slitless spectroscopy surveys (5\sigma limits of 1.1-1.6\times10^{-18}\text{erg s}^{-1}\text{cm}^{-2}), corresponding to unobscured H\alpha star-formation rates (SFRs) of 1-1.6 \text{M}_{\odot}\,\text{yr}^{-1} at z~6.1 and extending emission-line selections in the EoR to fainter populations. Simultaneously, JELS also obtained F200W broadband and F212N narrow-band imaging (H\alpha at z~2.23) that probes SFRs \gtrsim5\times fainter than previous ground-based narrow-band studies (~0.2 \text{M}_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}), offering an unprecedented resolved view of star formation at cosmic noon. In this paper we describe the detailed JELS survey design, key data processing steps specific to the survey observations, and demonstrate the exceptional data quality and imaging sensitivity achieved. We then summarise the key scientific goals of JELS and present some early science results, including examples of spectroscopically confirmed H\alpha and [OIII] emitters discovered by JELS that illustrate the novel parameter space probed.

&lt;p&gt;
A simple model for the X-ray weakness of JWST-selected broad-line AGNs is proposed under the assumption that the majority of these sources are fed at super-Eddington accretion rates. In these conditions, the hot inner corona above the geometrically thin disk that is responsible for the emission of X-rays in "normal" AGNs will be embedded instead in a funnel-like reflection geometry. The coronal plasma will Compton upscatter optical/UV photons from the underlying thick disk as well as the surrounding funnel walls, and the high soft-photon energy density will cool down the plasma to temperatures in the range 30-40 keV. The resulting X-ray spectra are predicted to be extremely soft, with power-law photon indices Gamma=2.8-4.0, making high-z super-Eddington AGNs largely undetectable by Chandra.

The recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed a larger number of bright galaxies at z\gtrsim10 than was expected. The origin of this excess is still under debate, although several possibilities have been presented. We propose that gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are a powerful probe to explore the origin of the excess and, hence, the star and galaxy formation histories in the early universe. Focusing on the recently launched mission, Einstein Probe (EP), we find that EP can detect several GRBs annually at z\gtrsim10, assuming the GRB formation rate calibrated by events at z\lesssim6 can be extrapolated. Interestingly, depending on the excess scenarios, the GRB event rate may also show an excess at z~eq10, and its detection will help to discriminate between the scenarios that are otherwise difficult to distinguish. Additionally, we discuss that the puzzling, red-color, compact galaxies discovered by JWST, the so-called ``little red dots'', could host dark GRBs if they are dust-obscured star forming galaxies. We are eager for unbiased follow-up of GRBs and encourage future missions such as HiZ-GUNDAM to explore the early universe.

Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope confirm the existence of massive black holes (&amp;gt;10^6 \rm{M_{\odot}}) beyond the redshift of z=10. However, their formation mechanism(s) still remain an open question. Light seed black holes are one such formation pathway, forming as the end stage of metalfree (Population III) stars. Light seed black holes can grow into massive black holes as long as they accrete near the Eddington limit for substantial periods or undergo several bursts of super-Eddington accretion. In this work, our aim is to ascertain if light seeds can grow in gas rich galaxies - similar to those expected at high redshift (z \gtrsim 10). Using the Arepo code, we follow self-consistently the formation of Population III stars and black holes in galaxies with total masses in the range 10^8 \rm{M_{\odot}}. We find that in the absence of feedback, black holes can grow to 10^5 \rm{M_{\odot}} in just 10^4 years. These black holes do not decouple from the gas clumps in which they are born and are able to accrete at hyper-Eddington rates. In the presence of supernova feedback, the number of actively growing black holes diminishes by an order of magnitude. However, we still observe hyper-Eddington accretion in approximately 1 % of the black hole population despite supernova feedback. This (idealised) work lays the foundation for future works, where we will test our models in a cosmological framework. In this work, we neglect radiative feedback processes from stellar evolution and from accretion onto the growing black holes. This likely means that our results represent an upper limit to light seed growth. We will address these shortcomings in future work.

We investigate the star formation-AGN connection in the Seyfert 1 NGC 7469 using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) mid-infrared spectroscopic integral field unit (IFU) data. We use the IFU data to generate maps of different emission lines present in the spectrum, such as the star-formation (SF) tracer [Ne II] 12.81{&amp;mu;}m, or the AGN tracer [Ne V] 14.32{&amp;mu;}m. We can separate the AGN- and SF-dominated regions using spatially resolved mid-IR diagnostic diagrams, and further investigate the ionization sources powering each region by constructing photoionization models. We find that the previously detected eastern wind populates an intermediary region of the diagrams, between our star-forming and AGN quadrants. Although it is possible that the star forming ring may inherently not be uniform, this wind also coincides with a reduction in the [Ne II] emission in the ring, which suggests that the ionization cone intersects the ring in this direction.

&lt;p&gt;
The active galactic nucleus (AGN) feeding and feedback process in the centers of galaxy clusters and groups is still not well understood. NGC 5044 is the ideal system in which to study AGN feedback. It hosts the largest known reservoir of cold gas in any cool-core galaxy group, and features several past epochs of AGN feedback imprinted as cavities in the X-ray bright intragroup medium (IGrM), as well as parsec scale jets. We present Submillimeter Array (SMA), Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) high frequency observations of NGC 5044 to assess the time variability of the mmwaveband emission from the accretion disk, and quantify the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) from the radio to sub-millimeter band. The SED is well described by advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model and self-absorbed jet emission from an aging plasma with tau = 1kyr. We find a characteristic variability timescale of 150 days, which constrains the ADAF emission region to about 0.1pc, and the magnetic field to 4.7mG in the jets and and 870G in the accretion disk. A longer monitoring/sampling will allow to understand if the underlying process is truly periodic in nature.

We use NIRCam imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) to study the ionising properties of a sample of 15721 galaxies at 3 \leq z_{\rm{phot}} \leq 9, 90&amp;percnt; complete in stellar mass down to log(M_{\star}/[M_{\odot}])\approx 7.5. Out of the full sample, 1620 of the galaxies have spectroscopic redshift measurements from the literature. We use the spectral energy distribution fitting code \texttt{Prospector} to fit all available photometry and infer galaxy properties. We find a significantly milder evolution of the ionising photon production efficiency (\xion\/) with redshift and UV magnitude than previously reported. Interestingly, we observe two distinct populations in \xion\/, distinguished by their burstiness (given by SFR_{10}/SFR_{100}). Both populations show the same evolution with z and M_{\rm{UV}}, but have a different \xion\/ normalisation. We convolve the more representative \log(\xi_{\rm{ion}} (z,\text{M}_{\rm{UV}})) relations (accounting for ~96&amp;percnt; of the sample), with luminosity functions from literature, to place constraints on the cosmic ionising photon budget. By combining our results, we find that one of our models can match the observational constraints from the \lya\/ forest at z\lesssim6. We conclude that galaxies with M_{\rm{UV}} between -16 and -20, adopting a reasonable escape fraction, can produce enough ionising photons to ionise the Universe, without exceeding the required ionising photon budget.

&lt;p&gt;
The confirmation of massive quiescent galaxies emerging within the first billion years of the universe poses intriguing questions about the mechanisms of galaxy formation. There must be highly efficient processes at work to shut down star formation in galaxies at cosmic dawn. I present the detection of neutral outflowing gas in a massive recently quenched galaxy at z=4, showing ejective back as a quenching mechanism. Based on JWST spectrum, the star formation rate of this has been declining with a rapid e-folding timescale of ~50 Myrs. The current specific star formation rate is 5\times10^{-11} yr^{-1}, roughly 40 times lower than that of the star-forming main sequence at comparable redshifts. Emission line ratios of [NeIII]/[OII] and [OIII]/H\beta are similar to AGN at comparable redshifts. A series of FeII and MgII absorption lines appear blueshifted by ~250~km~s^{-1} relative to the stellar continuum, suggesting an outflow of neutral gas. The estimated mass outflow rate is approximately 7 times greater than the star formation rate derived from the stellar continuum, implying that the suppression of star formation is likely due to gas being depleted by the outflow. If the emission lines are AGN-driven, the AGN can also provide sufficient energy to launch the outflow observed. This galaxy represents the most distant example of its kind known to date. This study offers a compelling explanation for the existence of massive quiescent galaxies in the first billion years of the universe.

We present a set of photometric catalogs primarily aimed at providing the community with a comprehensive database for the study of galaxy populations in the high redshift Universe. The set gathers data from eight JWST NIRCam observational programs, targeting the Abell 2744 (GLASS-JWST, UNCOVER, DDT2756 and GO3990), EGS (CEERS), COSMOS and UDS (PRIMER), and GOODS North and South (JADES and NGDEEP) deep fields, for a total area of ~0.2 sq. degrees. Photometric estimates are obtained by means of well-established techniques, including tailored improvements designed to enhance the performance on the specific dataset. We also include new measurements from HST archival data, thus collecting 16 bands spanning from 0.44 to 4.44 &amp;mu;m. A grand total of ~530 thousand sources is detected on stacks of NIRCam 3.56 and 4.44 &amp;mu;m mosaics. We assess the photometric accuracy by comparing fluxes and colors against archival catalogs. We also provide photometric redshift estimates, statistically validated against a large set of robust spectroscopic data. The catalogs are publicly available on the Astrodeep website.

&lt;p&gt;
\require{mediawiki-texvc}Cosmic Reionisation commenced when ultraviolet (UV) radiation produced in the first galaxies began illuminating the cold, neutral gas that filled the primordial Universe. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have shown that surprisingly UV-bright galaxies were in place beyond redshift z = 14, when the Universe was less than 300 \, \mathrm{Myr} old. Smooth turnovers of their UV continua have been interpreted as damping-wing absorption of Lyman-\alpha (Ly\alpha), the principal hydrogen transition. However, spectral signatures encoding crucial properties of these sources, such as their emergent radiation field, largely remain elusive. Here we report spectroscopy from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) of a galaxy at redshift z = 13.0 that reveal a singular, bright emission line unambiguously identified as Ly\alpha, in addition to a smooth turnover. We observe an equivalent width of \text{EW}_\mathrm{Ly\alpha} &amp;gt; 40 \, &amp;#8491; (rest frame), previously only seen at z &amp;lt; 9 where the intervening intergalactic medium (IGM) becomes increasingly ionised. Together with an extremely blue UV continuum, the unexpected Ly\alpha emission indicates the galaxy is a prolific producer and leaker of ionising photons. This suggests massive, hot stars or an active galactic nucleus (AGN) have created an early reionised region to prevent complete extinction of Ly\alpha, thus shedding new light on the nature of the earliest galaxies and the onset of Reionisation only 330 \, \mathrm{Myr} after the Big Bang.

&lt;p&gt;
Recent JWST observations of very early galaxies, at \rm{z \gtrsim 10}, have led to claims that tension exists between the sizes and luminosities of high-redshift galaxies and what is predicted by standard \LambdaCDM models. Here we use the adaptive mesh refinement code \texttt{Enzo} and the N-body smoothed particle hydrodynamics code \texttt{SWIFT} to compare (semi-)analytic halo mass functions against the results of direct N-body models at high redshift. In particular, our goal is to investigate the variance between standard halo mass functions derived from (semi-)analytic formulations and N-body calculations and to determine what role any discrepancy may play in driving tensions between observations and theory. We find that the difference between direct N-body calculations and (semi-) analytic halo mass function fits is less than a factor of 2 (at \rm{z ~ 10}) within the mass range of galaxies currently being observed by JWST, and is therefore not a dominant source of error when comparing theory and observation at high redshift.

JWST provides new opportunities to cross-check the HST Cepheid/SNeIa distance ladder, which yields the most precise local measure of H0. We analyze early JWST subsamples (~1/4 of the HST sample) from the SH0ES and CCHP groups, calibrated by a single anchor (N4258). We find HST Cepheid distances agree well (~1 sigma) with all 8 combinations of methods, samples, and telescopes: JWST Cepheids, TRGB, and JAGB by either group, plus HST TRGB and Miras. The comparisons explicitly include the measurement uncertainty of each method in N4258, an oft-neglected but dominant term. Mean differences are ~0.03 mag, far smaller than the 0.18 mag "Hubble tension." Combining all measures produces the strongest constraint yet on the linearity of HST Cepheid distances, 0.994+-0.010, ruling out distance-dependent bias or offset as the source of the tension at ~7 sigma. Yet, measurements of H0 from current JWST subsamples produce large sampling differences whose size and direction we can directly estimate from the full HST set. We show that Delta(H0)~2.5 km/s/Mpc between the CCHP JWST program and the full HST sample is entirely consistent with differences in sample selection. Combining all JWST samples produces a new, distance-limited set of 16 SNeIa at D&amp;lt;25 Mpc and more closely resembles the full sample thanks to "reversion to the mean" of larger samples. Using JWST Cepheids, JAGB, and TRGB, we find 73.4+-2.1, 72.2+-2.2, and 72.1+-2.2 km/s/Mpc, respectively. Explicitly accounting for SNe in common, the combined-sample three-method result from JWST is H0=72.6+-2.0, similar to H0=72.8 expected from HST Cepheids in the same galaxies. The small JWST sample trivially lowers the Hubble tension significance due to small-sample statistics and is not yet competitive with the HST set (42 SNeIa and 4 anchors), which yields 73.2+-0.9. Still, the joint JWST sample provides important crosschecks which the HST data passes.

&lt;p&gt;
We report the discovery of robust spectroscopically confirmed Balmer break (BB) galaxies and candidates, with secure spectroscopic redshifts 7.1 \le z \le 9.6 from publicly available JWST extra-galactic photometric and spectroscopic surveys. To do so, we used dedicated filters probing the Balmer break and inspected the objects with NIRSpec spectroscopy. We recover the previously known objects with strong Balmer breaks and reveal 10-11 new objects with clear BBs, thus tripling the number of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies with a BB at z &amp;gt;7. Approximately half of them show a pure BB and no signs of recent star formation, whereas the other half shows BB and emission lines, indicating most likely galaxies whose star formation ceased earlier and has restarted recently. Overall we find that ~10-20% of all galaxies from our sample show signatures of an evolved stellar population. Furthermore, we find that the strength of the BB does not significantly depend on the rest-UV and rest-optical brightness of these sources. In short, our work confirms that photometry alone has the potential to measure BB strengths and to identify evolved stellar populations at high redshift and that such objects may be more frequent than previously thought. The presence of galaxies with a range of break strengths and the joint presence of BB and emission lines indicate a bursty nature of the star formation in the early Universe.

&lt;p&gt;
We present a full analysis of galaxy major merger pair fractions, merger rates, and mass accretion rates, thus uncovering the role of mergers in galaxy formation at the earliest previously unexplored epoch of 4.5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;11.5. We target galaxies with masses \log_{10}(\mathrm{M}_*/\mathrm{M}_\odot) = 8.0 - 10.0, utilizing data from eight JWST Cycle-1 fields (CEERS, JADES GOODS-S, NEP-TDF, NGDEEP, GLASS, El-Gordo, SMACS-0723, MACS-0416), covering an unmasked area of 189.36 \mathrm{arcmin}^2. We develop a new probabilistic pair-counting methodology that integrates full photometric redshift posteriors and corrects for detection incompleteness to quantify close pairs with physical projected separations between 20 and 50 kpc. Our analysis reveals an increase in pair fractions up to z = 8, reaching 0.211 \pm 0.065, followed by a statistically flat evolution to z = 11.5. We find that the galaxy merger rate increases from the local Universe up to z = 6 and then stabilizes at a value of ~ 6 Gyr^{-1} up to z = 11.5. We fit both a power-law and a power-law + exponential model to our pair fraction and merger rate redshift evolution, finding that the latter model describes the trends more accurately, particularly at z = 8.0 - 11.5. In addition, we measure that the average galaxy increases its stellar mass due to mergers by a factor of 2.77 \pm 0.99 from redshift z = 10.5 to z = 5.0. Lastly, we investigate the impact of mergers on galaxy stellar mass growth, revealing that mergers contribute 71 \pm 25&amp;percnt; as much to galaxy stellar mass increases as star formation from gas. This indicates that mergers drive about half of galaxy assembly at high redshift.

&lt;p&gt;
The study of starburst and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback is crucial for understanding the regulation of star formation and the evolution of galaxies across cosmic time. Arp 220, the closest ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG), is in an advanced phase of a major merger with two distinct nuclei, and it shows evidence of multiphase and multiscale (from &amp;lt; 0.1 to &amp;gt; 5 kpc) outflows. Therefore, it represents an ideal system for investigating outflow mechanisms and feedback phenomena in detail. Using new JWST NIRSpec IFU observations, we investigated the spatially resolved gaseous (in both ionized and hot molecular phases) and stellar kinematics in the innermost 1 kpc. We decoupled the different gas kinematic components through multi-Gaussian fitting, identifying two multiphase outflows, each associated with one nucleus, with velocities up to ~ 1000km/s. We also resolved two counter-rotating discs around each nucleus embedded in a larger-scale rotational disk. We compute the total outflow mass (\approx 10^7M_\odot), the mass rate (~ 15M_{\odot}yr^{-1}), and the energetics (\dot E_{out}\approx 10^{42}erg/s) for each nucleus, and we found that the ionized and hot molecular outflowing gas contribute around 2-30% of the total mass and the energy of the outflows, as inferred from the combination of multiwavelength information. We discuss the possible origin of the outflows, finding no compelling evidence to prefer a starburst- or AGN-driven scenario. Regardless of their nature, outflows in Arp~220 propagate in multiple directions from parsec to kiloparsec scales, potentially impacting a significant portion of the host galaxy. This contrasts with isolated systems where outflows typically follow a more collimated path or are limited to the central region of the galaxy and hence do not affect the interstellar medium throughout the entire galaxy.

&lt;p&gt;
Photometric redshifts are widely used in studies of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs), but catastrophic photo-z failure can undermine all redshift-dependent results. Here we report the spectroscopic redshift confirmation of COSBO-7, a strongly lensed DSFG in the COSMOS-PRIMER field. Recently, a photometric redshift solution of z\gtrsim7.0 was reported for COSBO-7 based on ten bands of {\it James Webb} Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam and MIRI imaging data. This z value was favored by four independent spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes, and the result provided an appealing candidate for the most distant massive DSFG known to date. This photo-z solution was also supported by a single line detection in Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) Band 3 consistent with CO(7-6) at z=7.46. However, our new ALMA observations robustly detect two lines in Band 6 identified as CO(7-6) and [CI](2-1) at z_{\rm spec}=2.625, and thus the Band 3 line as CO(3-2). These three robust line detections decidedly place COSBO-7 at z=2.625, refuting the photo-z solution. We derive physical parameters by fitting near-infrared(NIR)-to-millimeter(mm) photometry and lens modeling, revealing that COSBO-7 is a main sequence galaxy. We examine possible reasons for this photo-z failure and attribute it to (1) the likely underestimation of photometric uncertainties at 0.9\,&amp;mu;m and 1.15 \,&amp;mu;m; and (2) the lack of photometry at wavelengths beyond 20\,&amp;mu;m. Notably, we recover a bona fide z_{\rm phot}~ 2.3 by including the existing MIPS 24\,&amp;mu;m photometry, demonstrating the critical importance of mid-infrared (MIR) data in bolstering photo-z measurements. This work highlights a common challenge in modeling the SEDs of DSFGs, and provides a cautionary tale regarding the reliability of photometric redshifts as well as pseudo-spectroscopic redshifts based on single line detection.

&lt;p&gt;
The metal content of galaxies is a direct probe of the baryon cycle. A hallmark example is the relationship between a galaxy's stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and gas-phase metallicity: the Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR). While low-redshift (z\lesssim4) observational studies suggest that the FMR is redshift-invariant, recent high-z JWST data indicate deviations from the FMR established at low-z. In this study, we utilize the FMR to predict the evolution of the normalisation of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) using the cosmological simulations Illustris, IllustrisTNG, EAGLE, and SIMBA. Our findings demonstrate that a z = 0 calibrated FMR struggles to predict the evolution in the MZR of each simulation. To quantify the divergence of the predictions, we introduce the concepts of a ``static'' FMR, where the role of the SFR in setting the normalization of the MZR does not change with redshift, and a ``dynamic'' FMR, where the role of SFR evolves over time. We find static FMRs in SIMBA and dynamic FMRs in Illustris, IllustrisTNG and EAGLE. We suggest that the differences between these models likely points to the subtle differences in the implementation of the baryon cycle. Moreover, we echo recent JWST results at z &amp;gt; 4 by finding significant offsets from the FMR in IllustrisTNG and EAGLE, suggesting that the observed FMR may have a similar dynamic trend as these simulations. Overall, our findings imply that the current FMR framework neglects important time variations of these simulations' baryon cycles.

While rotation-supported gas disks are known to exist as early as at z ~ 7, it is still a general belief that stellar disks form late in the Universe. This picture is now being challenged by the observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which have revealed a large number of disk-like galaxies that could be at z &amp;gt; 3, with some being candidates at z &amp;gt; 7. As an early formation of stellar disks will greatly impact our theory of galaxy formation and evolution, it is important to determine when such systems first emerged. Here we present D-CEERS-RUBIES-z5289 at z=5.289+-0.001, the second confirmed stellar disk at z &amp;gt; 5, discovered using the archival JWST NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec spectroscopic data. This galaxy has a highly regular edge-on disk morphology, extends to ~6.2 kpc along its major axis, and has an effective radius of ~1.3--1.4 kpc. Such a large stellar disk is yet to be produced in numerical simulations. By analyzing its 10-band spectral energy distribution using four different tools, we find that it has a high stellar mass of 10^{9.5-10.0} M_sun. Its age is in the range of 330--510 Myr, and it has a mild star formation rate of 10--30 M_sun/yr. While the current spectroscopic data do not allow the derivation of its rotation curve, the width of its Halpha line from the partial slit coverage on one side of the disk reaches ~345 km/s, which suggests that it could have a significant contribution from rotation.

We present the stellar metallicities and multi-element abundances (C, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Fe) of 15 massive (log M/M_\odot=10.2-11.2) quiescent galaxies at z=1-3, derived from ultradeep JWST-SUSPENSE spectra. Compared to quiescent galaxies at z~0, these galaxies exhibit a deficiency of 0.26\pm0.04 dex in [C/H], 0.16\pm0.03 dex in [Fe/H], and 0.07\pm0.04 dex in [Mg/H], implying rapid formation and quenching before significant enrichment from asymptotic giant branch stars and Type Ia supernovae. Additionally, we find that galaxies forming at higher redshift consistently show higher [Mg/Fe] and lower [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], regardless of their observed redshift. The evolution in [Fe/H] and [C/H] is therefore primarily driven by lower-redshift samples naturally including galaxies with longer star-formation timescales. In contrast, the lower [Mg/H] likely reflects earlier-forming galaxies expelling larger gas reservoirs during their quenching phase. Consequently, the mass-metallicity relation, primarily reflecting [Mg/H], is somewhat lower at z=1-3 compared to the lower redshift relation. Finally, we compare our results to standard stellar population modeling approaches employing solar abundance patterns and non-parametric star-formation histories (using Prospector). Our SSP-equivalent ages agree with the mass-weighted ages from Prospector, while the metallicities disagree significantly. Nonetheless, the metallicities better reflect [Fe/H] than total [Z/H]. We also find that star-formation timescales inferred from elemental abundances are significantly shorter than those from Prospector, and we discuss the resulting implications for the early formation of massive galaxies.

The stochastic nature of star formation and photon propagation in high-redshift galaxies can result in sizable galaxy-to-galaxy scatter in their properties. Ignoring this scatter by assuming mean quantities can bias estimates of their emissivity and corresponding observables. We construct a flexible, semi-empirical model, sampling scatter around the following mean relations: (i) the conditional halo mass function (CHMF); (ii) the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR); (iii) galaxy star formation main sequence (SFMS); (iv) fundamental metallicity relation (FMR); (v) conditional intrinsic luminosity; and (vi) photon escape fraction. In our fiducial model, ignoring scatter in these galaxy properties overestimates the duration of the EoR, delaying its completion by up to \Delta z ~ 2. We quantify the relative importance of each of the above sources of scatter in determining the ionizing, soft-band X-ray and Lyman Werner (LW) emissivities as a function of scale and redshift. We find that scatter around the SFMS is important for all bands, especially at the highest redshifts where the emissivity is dominated by the faintest, most "bursty" galaxies. Ignoring this scatter would underestimate the mean emissivity and its standard deviation computed over 5 cMpc regions by factors of up to ~2-10 at 5&amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 15. Scatter around the X-ray luminosity to star formation rate relation is important for determining X-ray emissivity, accounting for roughly half of its mean and standard deviation. The importance of scatter in the ionizing escape fraction depends on its functional form, while scatter around the SHMR contributes at the level of ~10-20%. Although scatter does flatten the UV luminosity functions, shifting the bright end by 1-2 magnitudes, the level of scatter in our fiducial model is insufficient to fully explain recent estimates from JWST photometry (consistent with previous studies).

We have used public JWST/NIRSpec and JWST/NIRCam observations from the CEERS and JADES surveys in order to analyze the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) over the redshift range 1.4 \leq z &amp;lt; 7. We calculate the star-formation rates (SFRs) of the galaxy sample using three approaches: Balmer line luminosity, spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, and UV luminosity. We find a larger degree of scatter about the SFMS using the Balmer-based SFRs compared to the UV-based SFRs. Because these SFR indicators are sensitive to star formation on different time scales, the difference in scatter may be evidence of bursty star-formation histories in the early universe. We additionally compare the H\alpha-to-UV luminosity ratio (L(H\alpha)/\nuL_{\nu,1600}) for individual galaxies in the sample and find that 29&amp;percnt;-52&amp;percnt; of the ratios across the sample are poorly described by predictions from a smooth star-formation history. Measuring the burstiness of star formation in the early universe has multiple significant implications, such as deriving accurate physical parameters from SED fitting, explaining the evolution of the UV luminosity function, and providing constraints for sub-grid models of feedback in simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.

We present an analysis of eight JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) 5.6 micron images with 5\,\sigma depths of ~0.1 uJy. We detect 2854 sources within our combined area of 18.4 square arcminutes. We compute the MIRI 5.6um number counts including an analysis of the field-to-field variation. Compared to earlier published MIRI 5.6 um counts, our counts have a more pronounced knee, at roughly 2 uJy. The location and amplitude of the counts at the knee are consistent with the Cowley et al. (2018) model predictions, although these models tend to overpredict the counts below the knee. In areas of overlap, 84% of the MIRI sources have a counterpart in the COSMOS2020 catalog. These MIRI sources have redshifts that are mostly in the z~0.5-2, with a tail out to z~5. They are predominantly moderate to low stellar masses (10^8-10^{10}M_{\odot}) main sequence star-forming galaxies, suggesting that with ~2hr exposures, MIRI can reach well below M^* at cosmic noon and reach higher mass systems out to z~5. Nearly 70% of the COSMOS2020 sources in areas of overlap now have a data point at 5.6um (rest-frame near-IR at cosmic noon) which allows for more accurate stellar population parameter estimates. Finally, we discover 31 MIRI-bright sources not present in COSMOS2020. A cross-match with IRAC channel 1 suggests that 10-20% of these are likely lower mass (M_*\approx10^9M_{\odot}), z~1 dusty galaxies. The rest (80--90%) are consistent with more massive but still very dusty galaxies at z&amp;gt;3.

&lt;p&gt;
We present James Webb Space Telescope MIRI data of the inner 3x2kpc^2 of the galaxy IC5063, in which the jets of a supermassive black hole interact with the gaseous disk they are crossing. Jet-driven outflows were known to be initiated along or near the jet path and to modify the stability of molecular clouds, possibly altering their star formation properties. The MIRI data, of unprecedented resolution and sensitivity in the infrared, now reveal that there are more than ten discrete regions with outflows, nearly doubling the number of such known regions. Outflows exist near the radio lobes, at the nucleus, in a biconical structure perpendicular to the jet, and in a bubble moving against the disk. In some of them, velocities above escape velocity are observed. Stratification is also observed, with higher ionization or excitation gas attaining higher velocities. More outflows and bow shocks, found further away from the nucleus than the radio lobes, in regions without significant radio emission, reveal the existence of past or weak radio jets that interacted with the interstellar medium. The coincidence of the bow shocks with the optical extended emission line region (EELR) suggests that the jets also contributed to the gas ionization. Maps of the H2 gas excitation temperature, T_ex, indicate that the molecular gas is most excited in regions with radio emission. There, T_ex is &amp;gt;100 K higher than in the EELR interior. We argue that a combination of jet-related shocks and cosmic rays is likely responsible for this excess molecular gas excitation.

&lt;p&gt;
Observations with the {\it James Webb Space Telescope} have revealed a high abundance of bright galaxies at redshift, z\gtrsim 12, which has been widely interpreted as conflicting with the \LambdaCDM model. In Cowley et al. (2018) predictions were made -- prior to the {\it JWST} observations -- for the expected abundance of these galaxies using the Durham semi-analytic galaxy formation model, {\sc galform}, which is known to produce a realistic population of galaxies at lower redshifts including the present day. Key to this model is the assumption of a ``top-heavy" initial mass function of stars formed in bursts (required to explain the number counts and redshift distribution of sub-millimetre galaxies). Here, we compare the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity functions derived from {\it JWST} observations with those predicted by the Cowley et al. model up to z=14 and make further predictions for z=16. We find that below z~ 10, the Cowley et al. predictions agree very well with observations, while agreement at z\gtrsim12 requires extending the model to take into account the timescale for the growth of obscuring dust grains at these very early times and its dependence on gas metallicity. We trace the evolution of these galaxies from z=14 to z=0 and find that their descendants typically reside in halos with a median mass 2.5\times 10^{13}\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}. The stellar masses of the descendants range from 3.2\times 10^{6}\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}} to 3.2\times 10^{11}\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}. Although these galaxies were all central galaxies at z=14, over half of their descendants end up as satellites in massive halos.

&lt;p&gt;
"Godzilla" is a peculiar object within the gravitationally lensed Sunburst Arc at z=2.37. Despite being very bright, it appears in only one of the twelve lensed images of the source galaxy, and shows exotic spectroscopic properties not found in any other clumps. We use JWST's unique combination of spatial resolution and spectroscopic sensitivity to provide a unified, coherent explanation of the physical nature of Godzilla. We measure fluxes and kinematic properties of rest-optical emission lines in Godzilla and surrounding regions. Using standard line ratio-based diagnostic methods in combination with NIRCam imaging and ground based rest-UV spectra, we characterize Godzilla and its surroundings. Among around 60 detected lines, we find a cascade of strong O I lines pumped by intense Ly\beta emission, as well as Ly\alpha-pumped rest-optical Fe II lines, reminiscent of the Weigelt blobs in the local LBV star Eta Carinae. Spectra and images of Godzilla and two faint adjacent images, and the detection of a low-surface brightness foreground galaxy in the NIRCam data, support the interpretation that Godzilla is an extremely magnified object due to the alignment with lensing caustics. We find that Godzilla is part of a previously identified clump, comprising ~10 - 25 % of it, with magnifications in the range of \approx600-25,000 depending on the models and images in comparison. The unique O I source in Godzilla is well explained by a non-erupting LBV accompanied by a hotter companion and/or gas condensations exposed to more intense radiation compared to the Weigelt blobs. If Godzilla is confirmed to contain an LBV star, it expands the distance to the furthest known LBV from a dozen Mpc to several Gpc.

&lt;p&gt;
Massive quiescent galaxies in the young universe are expected to be quenched rapidly, but it is unclear whether they all experience starbursts before quenching and what physical mechanism drives rapid quenching. We study 14 massive quiescent galaxies (\log(M_\star/M_\odot) &amp;gt; 10) at z~2 selected from a representative sample of the Blue Jay survey. We reconstruct their star formation histories by fitting spectral energy distribution models to the JWST/NIRSpec R~1000 spectra. We find that massive quiescent galaxies can be split into three categories with roughly equal numbers of galaxies according to their SFHs: 1) Relatively old galaxies quenched at early epochs; 2) Galaxies that are rapidly and recently quenched after a flat or bursty formation history (depending on the assumed prior); 3) Galaxies that are rapidly and recently quenched after a major starburst. Most recently quenched galaxies show neutral gas outflows, probed by blueshifted \rm Na\,I\,D absorption, and ionized gas emission, with line ratios consistent with active galactic nucleus (AGN) diagnostics. This suggests that AGN activity drives multi-phase gas outflows, leading to rapid quenching. By tracing back the SFHs of the entire sample, we predict the number density of massive quiescent galaxies at z=4-6: n=(1.5-6.0)\times10^{-5}\,\rm Mpc^{-3}. The two old massive quiescent galaxies in our sample appear to have extremely early formation and quenching (z\gtrsim6), possibly descendants of early post-starbursts at z&amp;gt;3. These galaxies still show neutral gas reservoirs and weak H\alpha emission, perhaps because the ejective AGN feedback that caused rapid quenching has weakened over time.

We report JWST/NIRSpec observations of a star-forming galaxy at z=2.76, MACSJ1149-WR1. We securely detect two temperature-sensitive auroral lines, [SIII]6312 (7.4\sigma) and [OII]7320+7331 doublets (10\sigma), and tentatively [NII]5755 (2.3\sigma) for the first time in an individual galaxy at z&amp;gt;1. We perform a detailed analysis of its interstellar media (ISM), and derive electron temperatures, various heavy element abundances (O/H, N/O, S/O, and Ar/O) in the hot ionized region, and the neutral fraction in the warm ionized region. MACSJ1149-WR1 shows a broad feature at the wavelength of HeII 4686, which consists of a broad (~1000km/s), blue-shifted (~-110km/s) line component. Taken together with its mildly elevated N/O abundance, we conclude that MACSJ1149-WR1 is experiencing a young starburst (&amp;lt;10Myr), likely hosting a large number of Wolf-Rayet stars. None of its spectral features support the presence of AGN, including: (i) the absence of broad components and velocity shifts in Hydrogen recombination lines, (ii) low [FeII]{\rm 1.257 &amp;mu; m}/Pa\beta ratio, and (iii) the absence of high-ionization lines. Our analysis using HeI lines reveals a higher electron temperature and a higher attenuation value, indicating that HeI may probe a smaller spatial scale than HI, presumably the region dominated by the aforementioned Wolf-Rayet stars. The star formation rates derived from various HeI lines broadly agree with those from Hydrogen recombination lines. We thus advocate that HeI can be an excellent, independent probe of multi-phase ISM in the era of JWST.

&lt;p&gt;
\require{mediawiki-texvc}Given the sensitivity of the resonant Lyman-\mathrm{\alpha} (Ly\mathrm{\alpha}) transition to absorption by neutral hydrogen, observations of Ly\mathrm{\alpha} emitting galaxies (LAEs) have been widely used to probe the ionising capabilities of reionisation-era galaxies and their impact on the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, prior to JWST our understanding of the contribution of fainter sources and of ionised `bubbles' at earlier stages of reionisation remained uncertain. Here, we present the characterisation of three exceptionally distant LAEs at z&amp;gt;8, newly discovered by JWST/NIRSpec in the JADES survey. These three similarly bright (M_\text{UV} \approx -20\,\mathrm{mag}) LAEs exhibit small Ly\mathrm{\alpha} velocity offsets from the systemic redshift, \Delta v_\mathrm{Ly\alpha} \lesssim 200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}, yet span a range of Ly\mathrm{\alpha} equivalent widths (15\,&amp;#8491;, 31\,&amp;#8491;, and 132\,&amp;#8491;). The former two show moderate Ly\mathrm{\alpha} escape fractions (f_\mathrm{esc,Ly\alpha} \approx 10&amp;percnt;), whereas Ly\mathrm{\alpha} escapes remarkably efficiently from the third (f_\mathrm{esc,Ly\alpha} \approx 72&amp;percnt;), which moreover is very compact (half-light radius of 90\pm10\,\mathrm{pc}). We find these LAEs are low-mass galaxies dominated by very recent, vigorous bursts of star formation accompanied by strong nebular emission from metal-poor gas. We infer the two LAEs with modest f_\mathrm{esc,Ly\alpha}, one of which reveals evidence for ionisation by an active galactic nucleus, may have reasonably produced small ionised bubbles preventing complete IGM absorption of Ly\mathrm{\alpha}. The third, however, requires a ~ 3\,\text{physical Mpc} bubble, indicating faint galaxies have contributed significantly. The most distant LAEs thus continue to be powerful observational probes into the earlier stages of reionisation.

We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Integral Field Spectrograph observations of NGC 3256, a local infrared-luminous late-stage merging system with two nuclei roughly 1\;\rm{kpc} apart, both of which have evidence of cold molecular outflows. Using JWST/NIRSpec and MIRI datasets, we investigate this morphologically complex system on spatial scales of &amp;lt;100\;\rm{pc}, where we focus on the warm molecular H_2 gas surrounding the nuclei. We detect collimated outflowing warm H_2 gas originating from the southern nucleus, though we do not find significant outflowing H_2 gas surrounding the northern nucleus. We measure maximum intrinsic outflow velocities of ~1,000\;\rm{km}\;\rm{s}^{-1}, which extend out to a distance of 0.7\;\rm{kpc}. Based on H_2 S(7)/S(1) ratios, we find a larger fraction of warmer gas near the S nucleus, which decreases with increasing distance from the nucleus, signifying the southern nucleus as a primary source of H_2 heating. The gas mass of the warm H_2 outflow component is estimated to be M\rm{_{warm,out}}=(1.4\pm0.2)\times10^6\;\rm{M}_{\odot}, as much as 6&amp;percnt; of the cold H_2 mass estimated using ALMA CO data. The outflow time scale is about 7\times10^5\;\rm{yr}, resulting in a mass outflow rate \dot{M}\rm{_{warm,out}}=2.0\pm0.8\;\rm{M}_{\odot}\;\rm{yr}^{-1} and kinetic power P\rm{_{warm,out}}\;~\;4\times10^{41}\;\rm{erg}\;\rm{s}^{-1}. Lastly, regions within our 3.0"x3.0" NIRSpec data where the outflowing gas reside show high [Fe II]/Pa\beta and H_2/Br\gamma line ratios, indicate enhanced mechanical heating caused by the outflows. The fluxes and ratios of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) in these regions are not significantly different compared to those elsewhere in the disk, suggesting the outflows may not significantly alter the PAH ionization state or grain size.

We present an analysis of the galaxy merger rate in the redshift range 4.0&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;9.0 (i.e. about 1.5 to 0.5 Gyr after the Big Bang) based on visually identified galaxy mergers from morphological parameter analysis. Our dataset is based on high-resolution NIRCam JWST data (a combination of F150W and F200W broad-band filters) in the low-to-moderate magnification (&amp;mu;&amp;lt;2) regions of the Abell 2744 cluster field. From a parent set of 675 galaxies (M_{U}\in[-26.6,-17.9]), we identify 64 merger candidates from the Gini, M_{20} and Asymmetry morphological parameters, leading to a merger fraction f_m=0.11\pm0.04. There is no evidence of redshift evolution of f_m even at the highest redshift considered, thus extending well into the epoch of reionization the constant trend seen previously at z\lesssim 6. Furthermore, we investigate any potential redshift dependent differences in the specific star formation rates between mergers and non-mergers. Our analysis reveals no significant correlation in this regard, with deviations in the studied redshift range typically falling within (1-1.5)\sigma from the null hypotesis that can be attributed to sample variance and measurement errors. Finally, we also demonstrate that the classification of a merging system is robust with respect to the observed (and equivalently rest-frame) wavelength of the high-quality JWST broad-band images used. This preliminary study highlights the potential for progress in quantifying galaxy assembly through mergers during the epoch of reionization, with significant sample size growth expected from upcoming large JWST infrared imaging datasets.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered a surprising population of bright galaxies in the very early universe (&amp;lt;500 Myrs after the Big Bang) that is hard to explain with conventional galaxy formation models and whose physical properties remain to be fully understood. Insight into their internal physics is best captured through nebular lines but, at these early epochs, the brightest of these spectral features are redshifted into the mid-infrared and remain elusive. Using the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument, MIRI, here we present the first detection of H{\alpha} and doubly-ionized oxygen ([OIII]5007AA) at z&amp;gt;10. These detections place the bright galaxy GHZ2/GLASS-z12 at z=12.33+/-0.04, making it the most distant astronomical object with direct spectroscopic detection of these lines. These observations provide key insights into the conditions of this primeval, luminous galaxy, which shows hard ionizing conditions rarely seen in the local Universe likely driven by compact and young (~30Myr) burst of star formation. Its oxygen-to-hydrogen abundance is close to a tenth of the solar value, indicating a rapid metal enrichment. This study confirms the unique conditions of this remarkably bright and distant galaxy and the huge potential of mid-IR observations to characterize these objects.

Dating the ages and weighting the stellar populations in galaxies are essential steps when studying galaxy formation through cosmic times. Evolutionary population synthesis models with different input physics are used for this purpose. Moreover, the contribution from the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stellar phase, which peaks for intermediate-age 0.6-2 Gyr, has been debated for decades. Here we report the detection of strong cool-star signatures in the rest-frame near-infrared spectra of three young (~1Gyr), massive (~10^10Msun) quiescent galaxies at large look-back time, z=1-2, using JWST/NIRSpec. The coexistence of oxygen- and carbon-type absorption features, spectral edges and features from rare species, such as vanadium and possibly zirconium, reveal a strong contribution from TP-AGB stars. Population synthesis models with a significant TP-AGB contribution reproduce the observations better than those with a weak TP-AGB, which are commonly used. These findings call for revisions of published stellar population fitting results, as they point to populations with lower masses and younger ages and have further implications for cosmic dust production and chemical enrichment. New generations of improved models are needed, informed by these and future observations.

We present a new determination of the star-forming main sequence (MS), obtained through stacking 100k K-band-selected galaxies in the far-infrared (FIR) Herschel and James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) imaging. By fitting the dust emission curve to the stacked FIR photometry, we derive the IR luminosities (LIR), and hence the star formation rates (SFRs) out to z&amp;lt;5.7. The functional form of the MS is found, with the linear SFR-M* relation that flattens at high stellar masses and the normalization that increases exponentially with redshift. We derive the corresponding redshift evolution of the specific star formation rate (sSFR) and compare our findings with the recent literature. We find our MS to be exhibiting slightly lower normalization at z&amp;lt;2 and to flatten at somewhat larger stellar masses at high redshifts. By deriving the relationship between the peak dust temperature (Td) and redshift, where Td increases linearly from ~20 K at z=0.5 to ~50 K at z=5, we conclude that the apparent inconsistencies in the shapes of the MS are most likely caused by the different dust temperatures assumed when deriving SFRs in the absence of FIR data. Finally, we investigate the derived shape of the star-forming MS by simulating the time evolution of the observed galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF). While the simulated GSMF is in good agreement with the observed one, some inconsistencies persist. In particular, we find the simulated GSMF to be slightly overpredicting the number density of low-mass galaxies at z&amp;gt;2.

JWST observations of galaxies at z\gtrsim 8 suggest that they are more luminous and clumpier than predicted by most models, prompting several proposals on the physics of star formation and feedback in the first galaxies. In this paper, we focus on the role of ultraviolet (UV) radiation in regulating star formation by performing a set of cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations of one galaxy at sub-pc resolution with different radiative feedback models. We find that the suppression of cooling by far UV (FUV) radiation (i.e., \mathrm{H_2} dissociating radiation) from Pop II stars is the main physical process triggering the formation of compact and massive star clusters and is responsible for the bursty star formation observed in metal-poor galaxies at z\gtrsim 10. Indeed, artificially suppressing FUV radiation leads to a less intense continuous mode of star formation distributed into numerous, but low-mass open star clusters. Due to the intense FUV field, low-metallicity clouds remain warm (~ 10^4\,\mathrm{K}) until they reach a relatively high density (\gtrsim 10^3\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}), before becoming self-shielded and transitioning to a colder (~ 100\,\mathrm{K}), partially molecular phase. As a result, star formation is delayed until the clouds accumulate enough mass to become gravitationally unstable. At this point, the clouds undergo rapid star formation converting gas into stars with high efficiency. We, therefore, observe exceptionally bright galaxies (ten times brighter than for continuous star formation) and subsequent quenched "dead" galaxies that did not form stars for tens of Myrs.

Despite the importance of the dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at z&amp;gt;2 for understanding the galaxy evolution in the early Universe, their stellar distributions traced by the near-IR emission were spatially unresolved until the arrival of the JWST. In this work we present, for the first time, a spatially-resolved morphological analysis of the rest-frame near-IR (~1.1-3.5&amp;mu;m) emission in DSFGs traced with the JWST/MIRI. In particular, we study the mature stellar component for the three DSFGs and a Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) present in an overdensity at z=4.05. Moreover, we use MIRI images along with UV to (sub)-mm ancillary photometric data to model their SEDs and extract their main physical properties. The sub-arcsec resolution MIRI images have revealed that the stellar component present a wide range of morphologies, from disc-like to compact and clump-dominated structures. These near-IR structures contrast with their UV emission, which is usually diffuse and off-centered. The SED fitting analysis shows that GN20 dominates the total SFR with a value ~2500 M_\odotyr^{-1} while GN20.2b has the highest stellar mass in the sample (M_*~2\times10^{11} M_\odot). The two DSFGs classified as LTGs (GN20 and GN20.2a) show high specific SFR (sSFR&amp;gt;30 Gyr^{-1}) placing them above the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) at z~4 by &amp;gt;0.5 dex while the ETG (i.e.,GN20.2b) is compatible with the high-mass end of the main sequence. When comparing with other DSFGs in overdensities at z~2-7 we observe that our objects present similar SFRs, depletion times and projected separations. Nevertheless, the effective radii computed for GN20 and GN20.2a are up to two times larger than those of isolated galaxies observed in CEERS and ALMA-HUDF at similar redshifts. We interpret this difference in size as an effect of rapid growth induced by the dense environment.

We report measurements of the galaxy two-point correlation function at cosmic dawn, using photometrically-selected sources from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). The JWST/NIRCam dataset comprises approximately N_g ~eq 7000 photometrically-selected Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs), spanning in the redshift range 5\leq z&amp;lt;11. The primary objective of this study is to extend clustering measurements beyond redshift z&amp;gt;10, finding a galaxy bias b=9.6\pm1.7 for the sample at \overline{z} = 10.6. The result suggests that the observed sources are hosted by dark matter halos of approximately M_{h}~ 10^{10.6}~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}, in broad agreement with theoretical and numerical modelling of early galaxy formation during the epoch of reionization. Furthermore, the JWST JADES dataset enables an unprecedented investigation of clustering of dwarf galaxies two orders of magnitude fainter than the characteristic L_* luminosity (i.e. with M_{F200W}~eq-15.8) during the late stages of the epoch of reionization at z~ 6. By analyzing clustering as a function of luminosity, we find that b(M_{F200W}) aligns with previous results for brighter galaxies and then decreases with M_{F200W}, as theoretically expected for fainter candidates. These initial results demonstrate the potential for further quantitative characterisation of the interplay between assembly of dark matter and light during cosmic dawn that the growing samples of JWST observations are enabling.

&lt;p&gt;
We measure resolved (kiloparsec-scale) outflow properties in a sample of 10 starburst galaxies from the DUVET (Deep near-UV observations of Entrained gas in Turbulent galaxies) sample, using Keck/KCWI observations of H\beta and [OIII]~\lambda5007. We measure ~460 lines-of-sight that contain outflows, and use these to study scaling relationships of outflow velocity (v_{\rm out}), mass-loading factor (\eta; mass outflow rate per SFR) and mass flux (\dot{\Sigma}_{\rm out}; mass outflow rate per area) with co-located SFR surface density (\Sigma_{\rm SFR}) and stellar mass surface density (\Sigma_{\ast}). We find strong, positive correlations of \dot{\Sigma}_{\rm out} \propto \Sigma_{\rm SFR}^{1.2} and \dot{\Sigma}_{\rm out} \propto \Sigma_{\ast}^{1.5}. We also find shallow correlations between v_{\rm out} and both \Sigma_{\rm SFR} and \Sigma_{\ast}. Our resolved observations do not suggest a threshold in outflows with \Sigma_{\rm SFR}, but rather we find that the local specific SFR (\Sigma_{\rm SFR}/\Sigma_\ast) is a better predictor of where outflows are detected. We find that outflows are very common above \Sigma_{\rm SFR}/\Sigma_\ast\gtrsim 0.1~Gyr^{-1} and rare below this value. We argue that our results are consistent with a picture in which outflows are driven by supernovae, and require more significant injected energy in higher mass surface density environments to overcome local gravity. The correlations we present here provide a statistically robust, direct comparison for simulations and higher redshift results from JWST.

Extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) exhibit large equivalent widths (EW) in their rest-optical emission lines ([OIII]\lambda5007 or H\alpha rest-frame EW &amp;gt; 750\r{A}) which can be tied to a recent upturn in star formation rate, due to the sensitivity of the nebular line emission and the rest-optical continuum to young (&amp;lt;10Myr) and evolved stellar populations, respectively. By studying a sample of 85 star forming galaxies (SFGs), spanning the redshift and magnitude interval 3 &amp;lt;z&amp;lt;9.5 and -16&amp;gt; M_{UV}&amp;gt;-21, in the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) with NIRSpec/prism spectroscopy, we determine that SFGs initiate an EELG phase when entering a significant burst of star formation, with the highest EWs observed in EELGs with the youngest luminosity-weighted ages (&amp;lt;5 Myr old) and the highest burst intensity (those with the greatest excess between their current and long-term average SFR). We spectroscopically confirm that a greater proportion of SFGs are in an EELG phase at high redshift in our UV-selected sample (61\pm4&amp;percnt; in our z&amp;gt;5.7 high-redshift bin, compared to 23^{+4}_{-1}&amp;percnt; in our lowest-redshift bin 3&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;4.1) due to the combined evolution of metallicity, ionisation parameter and star formation histories with redshift. We report that the EELGs within our sample exhibit a higher average ionisation efficiency (\log_{10}(\xi_{ion}^{HII}/erg^{-1}Hz)=25.5\pm0.2) than the non-EELGs. High-redshift EELGs therefore comprise a population of efficient ionising photon producers. Additionally, we report that 53&amp;percnt; (9/17) of EELGs at z&amp;gt;5.7 have observed Lyman-\alpha emission, potentially lying within large ionised regions. The high detection rate of Lyman-\alpha emitters in our EELG selection suggests that the physical conditions associated with entering an EELG phase also promote the escape of Lyman-\alpha photons.

Using integrated spectra for two gravitationally lensed galaxies from the JWST TEMPLATES Early Release Science program, we analyze faint auroral lines, which provide direct measurements of the gas-phase chemical abundance. For the brighter galaxy, SGAS1723+34 (z = 1.3293), we detect the [OIII]\lambda4363, [SIII]\lambda6312, and [OII]\lambda\lambda7320,7330 auroral emission lines, and set an upper limit for the [NII]\lambda5755 line. For the second galaxy, SGAS1226+21 (z = 2.925), we do not detect any auroral lines, and report upper limits. With these measurements and upper limits, we constrain the electron temperatures in different ionization zones within both of these galaxies. For SGAS1723+34, where auroral lines are detected, we calculate direct oxygen and nitrogen abundances, finding an N/O ratio consistent with observations of nearby (z~ 0) galaxies. These observations highlight the potent combination of JWST and gravitational lensing to measure faint emission lines in individual distant galaxies and to directly study the chemical abundance patterns in those galaxies.

The morphology of a galaxy reflects the mix of physical processes occurring within and around it, offering indirect clues to its formation and evolution. We apply both visual classification and computer vision to test the suspected connection between galaxy mergers and AGN activity, as evidenced by a close/merging galaxy pair, or tidal features surrounding an apparently singular system. We use JADES JWST/NIRCam imagery of a complete, mutliwavelength AGN sample recently expanded with JWST/MIRI photometry. This 0.9-25 &amp;mu;m dataset enables constraints on the host galaxy morphologies of a broad range of AGN beyond z~1, including heavily obscured examples missing from previous studies. Our primary AGN sample consists of 243 lightly to highly obscured X-ray-selected AGN and 138 presumed Compton-thick, mid-infrared-bright/X-ray-faint AGN revealed by MIRI. Utilizing the shape asymmetry morphology indicator, A_S, as the metric for disturbance, we find that 88% of the Seyferts sampled are strongly spatially disturbed (A_S&amp;gt;0.2). The experimental design we employ reveals a \gtrsim 3\sigma obscuration-merger (N_H-A_S) correlation at 0.6&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;2.4, and also recovers a physical distinction between the X-ray- and mid-IR-detected AGN suggestive of their link to a common evolutionary scenario. Placing the observed pattern of disturbances in the context of the other average host galaxy properties, we conclude that mergers are common amongst obscured AGN. This finding presents tension with the leading model on AGN fueling that requires Seyfert AGN with sub-quasar luminosities (L_{bol} &amp;lt; 10^{45} ergs/s) to evolve only through non-merger mechanisms.

The chemical composition of galaxies offers vital insights into their formation and evolution. A key aspect of this study is the correlation between helium abundance (He/H) and metallicity, which is instrumental in estimating the primordial helium produced during Big Bang nucleosynthesis. We investigate the chemical enrichment history of low-metallicity galaxies, with a particular focus on extremely metal-poor galaxies (EMPGs), using one-zone models. Our one-zone model, employing the Limongi &amp; Chieffi (2018) yield, aligns well with observed high He/H ratios at low metallicities and successfully reproduces Fe/O ratios similar to those found in EMPGs. In contrast, the Nomoto et al. (2013) yield does not fully match the high Fe/O ratios observed in EMPGs. Furthermore, we explored models incorporating supermassive stars (SMS) as Pop III stars and intermittent star formation, both of which produced higher He/H ratios than the standard one-zone model. A model calculation that incorporates SMS yields effectively explain young galaxies (&amp;lt; 10^8 years) with metallicities (\mathrm{O/H}) \times 10^5 &amp;lt; 20 and \mathrm{He/H} &amp;gt; 0.085. Notably, the model, where the outer envelope of the SMS's CO core is completely ejected, achieves \mathrm{He/H} &amp;gt; 0.12, aligning with the properties of high-z galaxies recently discovered by JWST. Additionally, these models predict high N/O, consistent with JWST observations in the early universe.

We find ourselves on the brink of an exciting era in observational astrophysics, driven by groundbreaking facilities like JWST, Euclid, Rubin, Roman, SKA, or ELT. Simultaneously, computational astrophysics has shown significant strides, yielding highly realistic galaxy formation simulations, thanks to both hardware and software enhancements. Bridging the gap between simulations and observations has become paramount for meaningful comparisons. We introduce py-ananke, a Python pipeline designed to generate synthetic resolved stellar surveys from cosmological simulations, adaptable to various instruments. Building upon its predecessor, ananke by Sanderson et al. 2020 (arXiv:1806.10564), which produced Gaia DR2 mock star surveys, the py-ananke package offers a user-friendly "plug &amp; play" experience. The pipeline employs cutting-edge phase-space density estimation and initial mass function sampling to convert particle data into synthetic stars, while interpolating pre-computed stellar isochrone tracks for photometry. Additionally, it includes modules for estimating interstellar reddening, dust-induced extinctions, and for quantifying errors through dedicated modeling approaches. py-ananke promises to serve as a vital bridge between computational astrophysics and observational astronomy, facilitating preparations and making scientific predictions for the next generation of telescopes.

We present SPICE, a new suite of RHD cosmological simulations targeting the epoch of reionisation. The goal of these simulations is to systematically probe a variety of stellar feedback models, including "bursty" and "smooth" forms of supernova energy injection, as well as poorly-explored scenarios such as hypernova explosions and radiation pressure. Subtle differences in the behaviour of supernova feedback drive profound differences in reionisation histories, with burstier forms of feedback causing earlier reionisation. We also find that some global galaxy properties, such as the dust-attenuated luminosity functions and star formation main sequence, remain degenerate between models. Stellar feedback and its strength determine the morphological mix of galaxies emerging by z = 5 and that the reionisation history is inextricably connected to intrinsic properties such as galaxy kinematics and morphology. While star-forming, massive disks are prevalent if supernova feedback is "smooth", "bursty" feedback preferentially generates dispersion-dominated systems. Different modes of feedback produce different strengths of outflows, altering the ISM/CGM in different ways, and in turn strongly affecting the escape of LyC photons. We establish a correlation between galaxy morphology and LyC escape fraction, revealing that dispersion-dominated systems have escape fractions 10-50 times higher than their rotation-dominated counterparts at all redshifts. Dispersion-dominated systems should thus preferentially generate large HII regions as compared to their rotation-dominated counterparts. Since dispersion-dominated systems are more prevalent if stellar feedback is more explosive, reionisation occurs earlier in our simulation with burstier feedback. Statistical samples of post-reionisation galaxy morphologies probed with JWST, ALMA and MUSE can constrain stellar feedback and models of cosmic reionisation.

We study outflows in 130 galaxies with -22&amp;lt;MUV&amp;lt;-16 at z=3-9 identified in JWST NIRSpec and NIRCam WFSS data taken by the ERO, CEERS, FRESCO, GLASS, and JADES programs. We identify 30 out of the 130 galaxies with broad components of FWHM~200-700 km/s in the emission lines of H{\alpha} and [OIII] that trace ionized outflows, and find no excesses from the star-formation main sequence. Four out of the 30 outflowing galaxies are Type 1 AGN whose H{\alpha} emission lines include line profile components as broad as FWHM&amp;gt;1000 km/s. With the velocity shift and line widths of the outflow broad lines, we obtain ~80-500 km/s for the outflow velocities. We find that the outflow velocities as a function of star-formation rate are comparable to or higher than those of galaxies at z~1, accounting for the selection bias, while the outflow velocities of AGN are large but not significantly different from the others. Interestingly, these outflow velocities are typically not high enough to escape from the galactic potentials, suggestive of fountain-type outflows, which are concluded on the basis of thorough comparisons with recent JWST results. We estimate mass loading factors {\eta} to be 0.1-1 that are not particularly large, but comparable with those of z~1 outflows. The large fraction of galaxies with outflows (30% with high resolution data) provides constraints on outflow parameters, suggesting a wide opening angle of &amp;gt;45 deg and a large duty-cycle of &amp;gt;30%, which gives a picture of more frequent and spherical outflows in high-z galaxies.

We present JWST NIRSpec prism spectroscopy of gravitationally lensed galaxies at z\gtrsim9 found behind the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744 in the UNCOVER Cycle 1 Treasury Program. We confirm the source redshift via emission lines and/or the Ly\alpha break feature for ten galaxies at z=8.50-13.08 down to M_{\rm UV}=-17.3. We achieve a high confirmation rate of 100&amp;percnt; for z&amp;gt;9 candidates reported in Atek et al. (2023). Using six sources with multiple emission line detections, we find that the offset of the redshift estimates between the lines and the Ly\alpha break alone with prism can be as large as \pm0.2, raising caution in designing future follow-up spectroscopy for the break-only sources with ALMA. With spec-z confirmed sources in UNCOVER and the literature, we derive lower limits on the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function (LF) at z~eq9-12 and find these lower limits to be consistent with recent photometric measurements. We identify at least two unambiguous and several possible active galactic nucleus (AGN) systems based on X-ray emission, broad line (BL) H\beta, high ionization line (e.g., NIV]1487, CIV1549) detections, and excess in UVLF. This requires the AGN LFs at z~eq 9-10 to be comparable or even higher than the X-ray AGN LF estimated at z~6 and indicates a plausible cause of the high abundance of z&amp;gt;9 galaxies claimed in recent photometric studies may be AGNs. One UV-luminous source is confirmed at the same redshift as a dusty BL AGN at z=8.50 with a physical separation of 380 kpc in the source plane. These two sources show blueward Ly\alpha line or continuum emission, suggesting that they reside in the same ionized bubble with a radius of 7.69\pm0.18 pMpc. Our results imply that AGNs have a non-negligible contribution to cosmic reionization.
