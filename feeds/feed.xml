We explore for the first time the possibility of detecting lensed star transients in galaxy-galaxy strong lensing systems upon repeated, deep imaging using the  James-Webb Space Telescope ( JWST). Our calculation predicts that the extremely high recent star formation rate of ~ 100 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;rmyr^-1 over the last 50 Myr (not accounting for image multiplicity) in the "Cosmic Horseshoe'' lensed system (z = 2.381) generates many young, bright stars, of which their large abundance is expected to lead to a detection rate of ~ 60 transients per pointing in  JWST observations with a 5&amp;sigma; limiting magnitude of ~ 29 m_AB. With the high expected detection rate and little room for uncertainty for the lens model compared with cluster lenses, our result suggests that the Cosmic Horseshoe could be an excellent tool to test the nature of Dark Matter based on the spatial distribution of transients, and can be used to constrain axion mass if Dark Matter is constituted of ultra-light axions. We also argue that the large distance modulus of ~46.5 mag at z ≈ 2.4 can act as a filter to screen out less massive stars as transients and allow one to better constrain the high-mass end of the stellar initial mass function based on the transient detection rate. Follow-up  JWST observations of the Cosmic Horseshoe with would allow one to better probe the nature of Dark Matter and the star formation properties, such as the initial mass function at the cosmic noon, via lensed star transients.

We use FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the co-evolution between Milky Way-size galaxies and their host dark matter halos. We find that the formation of these galaxies follows a two-phase pattern, with an early phase featured by hot dynamics, bulge-dominated structure and bursty star formation, and a later phase featured by cold dynamics, disk-dominated structure and steady star formation. The transition times of these galaxy properties are tightly correlated with the time when the host halo transits from fast to slow accretion, suggesting that the two-phase assembly of halos drive the two-phase formation of galaxies. The physical origin of dynamical hotness can be summarized into two modes of star formation: a scattered mode in which stars form at large radii within cold gas streams associated with fast assembly of halos, and a concentrated mode in which stars form at small radii through violent fragmentation from globally self-gravitated gas when halo assembly is about to slow down. Cold gaseous and stellar disks can form only when the conditions of the two modes are removed by the stall of halo assembly and the reduction of gas by feedback processes. The two modes of star formation leave distinct imprints on the structural properties of high-redshift galaxies, providing implications to be tested by JWST and future observations.

&lt;p&gt;
We present new ALMA [OIII]_88 observations of eight previously [CII]_158-detected galaxies at 6.8 ≲ z ≲ 7.7. Six of our targets &amp;ndash; the primary sample &amp;ndash; are massive, UV-luminous galaxies drawn from the REBELS survey, while the remaining two are UV-fainter galaxies that were previously serendipitously detected through their luminous [CII] lines in the REBELS fields. We detect [OIII]_88 emission in all eight galaxies at 6.2 - 17.7&amp;sigma; significance, and find them to be consistent with the local dwarf galaxy relation between L_[OIII] and star formation rate. Our sample spans [OIII]/[CII] ≈ 1.9 - 9.6, which is typical for the high-redshift galaxy population. Five of the primary targets benefit from JWST/NIRSpec observations, enabling a direct comparison of the [OIII]/[CII] ratio against rest-optical ISM diagnostics. We supplement our high-redshift sample with eleven z≈6-14 galaxies in the literature for which similar ALMA and JWST observations are available, and furthermore compare to the [OIII]/[CII] ratios measured for local dwarf galaxies. We find that, at fixed metallicity and ionization parameter, z&amp;gt;6 galaxies show elevated [OIII]/[CII] ratios compared to local dwarfs. Instead, we find that a large [OIII]_4959,5007+H&amp;beta; equivalent width &amp;ndash; a proxy for burstiness &amp;ndash; is the main driver of the high [OIII]/[CII] ratios seen in the early Universe, which is primarily due to [CII] being suppressed in bursty galaxies. Given the apparent validity of the [OIII]_88-SFR relation across most of cosmic time, as well as the abundance of young, bursty galaxies at high redshift, [OIII]_88 is set to remain a powerful ISM tracer at the cosmic dawn.

&lt;p&gt;
Understanding the co-evolution of galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) requires accurate modeling of dust-obscured systems. Recent surveys using the Mid Infrared Instrument (MIRI) onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered a large population of dust obscured AGN, challenging current theoretical frameworks. We present an updated version of the Simulated Infrared Extragalactic Dusty Sky (SIDES) simulation framework. Our updates include modified star-forming and starburst galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) templates as well as quiescent and AGN templates. We also incorporate a probabilistic assignment of the fraction of the IR emission that is due to an AGN. Our simulations successfully reproduce the observed MIRI source number counts, redshift distributions, and AGN population fractions. We find that AGN dominate at bright flux densities (S_&amp;nu; ≳ 20  &amp;mu; Jy while main sequence galaxies dominate at the faint end. We also quantify the effects of cosmic variance, showing that surveys with areas below 25  arcmin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; suffer from ~ 30 &amp;percnt; uncertainty in bright AGN counts. Finally, we provide diagnostic color-color diagrams and joint Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and MIRI flux distributions to aid interpretation of current and upcoming JWST surveys.

Planetary nebulae are sites where ejected stellar material evolves into complex molecules, but the precise physical conditions and chemical routes that govern these processes are unclear. The presence of abundant carbon-rich molecules in O-rich environments poses particular challenges. Here we report the first detection of methyl cation (CH3+) in any planetary nebula, observed in the O-rich nebula NGC 6302 using JWST MIRI/MRS observations. CH3+ is a key driver of organic chemistry in UV-irradiated environments. Spatially resolved observations reveal that CH3+ is co-located with 12CO, H2, H II, HCO+, and Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). LTE modelling of the CH3+ emission yields excitation temperatures of 500-800K in the inner bubble and torus, rising to 1000-2000K in the outer bubble of NGC 6302, with column densities ranging from ~10^11 to 10^13 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This detection demonstrates that hydrocarbon radical chemistry must be incorporated into planetary nebulae chemical models. Further near-IR observations are crucial to map different chemical networks operating in these environments.

&lt;p&gt;
Deep JWST imaging of the massive galaxy cluster MACS0417.5-1154, at redshift z=0.443, reveals a huge population of globular clusters (GCs) and Ultra-Compact Dwarfs (UCDs) primarily distributed around its single central giant galaxy (BCG). We present NIRCam/SWC photometry of the GC system in four bands (F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W). The spatial distribution of the system matches well in radial and ellipticity profile with the high elongation (b/a = 0.5) of the BCG halo light. The total GC population within MACS0417 is estimated to be near 1.5 x 10^5, similar to the systems in Abell 2744, Coma, and other galaxy clusters with comparable masses. With similar results for GC photometry in hand from other lensing clusters at a range of redshifts, it is now possible to trace on purely observational grounds the luminosity evolution of GC systems over many Gigayears of lookback time, as seen through their color-magnitude diagrams. We show this sequence for five systems reaching to lookback times of more than 7 Gyr. A systematic change in the GC/UCD sequence with lookback time is clearly visible, near what is expected for age-fading of a simple stellar population with time. Lastly, we evaluate the effectiveness of the various JWST NIRCam filters for broadband photometry of GC systems as a function of redshift, as an aid to planning further studies.

Cosmic rays (CRs), from active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets and supernovae (SNe), serve as a significant feedback mechanism influencing emission lines in narrow line region (NLR) clouds. These highly energetic particles, propelled by shocks, heat the interstellar medium (ISM) and modify its chemical composition. This study investigates the role of CRs, particularly in their ability to excite gas and align with observed line ratios across UV and optical diagnostics. We employ CLOUDY to explore CR ionization rate, ionization parameter, and initial hydrogen density effects on optical and mid-infrared (MIR) emission. Our analysis includes high-quality optical data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) for NGC 5728, supplemented by infrared observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Our previous results indicate that CRs are instrumental in heating the inner regions of gas clouds, enhancing emission of low-ionization optical lines. Mid-infrared data reveal that emission lines like [Ar II] and [Ne II] within the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) field of view are sensitive to CRs. In contrast, high-ionization lines (for example, [Ne V]) serve as robust tracers of photoionization insensitive to CRs. Moreover, mixed optical and MIR diagnostics offer insight into the relative roles of CRs and shocks, which often produce similar signatures in emission lines. We find that while both mechanisms can elevate certain line ratios, their influence on MIR diagnostics diverges: shocks and CRs affect low-ionization lines differently, allowing for a better understanding when multi-wavelength data are available. Our approach not only helps to resolve the degeneracy between metallicity and CR ionization but also enables the potential differentiation of shocks and CR-driven processes in AGN.

With the rise of the integral field spectroscopy, we are currently dealing with large amounts of spatially resolved data, whose analysis has become challenging, especially when observing complex objects such as nearby galaxies. We aim to develop a method to automatically separate different physical regions within the central parts (1"~160 pc, on average) of galaxies. This can allow us to better understand the systems, and provide an initial characterisation of the main ionisation sources affecting its evolution. We have developed an unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithm to analyse data cubes based on spectral similarity. It clusters together spaxels with similar spectra, which is useful to disentangle between different physical processes. We have applied this method to a sample of 15 nearby (distances &amp;lt;100 Mpc) galaxies, 7 from the Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS) and 8 archival sources, all observed with the medium resolution spectrometer (MRS) of the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on board of the JWST. From the clusters, we computed their median spectrum and measured the line and continuum properties. We used these measurements to train random forest models and create several empirical mid-IR diagnostic diagrams for the MRS channel 3 wavelength range, including among others the bright [Ne II], [Ne III], and [Ne V] lines, several H2 transitions, and PAH features. The clustering technique allows to differentiate emission coming from an AGN, the disc, and star forming regions in galaxies, and other composite regions, potentially ionised by several sources simultaneously. This is supported by the results from the empirical diagnostic diagrams, that are indeed able to separate physically distinct regions. This innovative method serves as a tool to identify regions of interest in any data cube prior to an in-depth analysis of the sources. [abridged]

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widespread in the interstellar medium (ISM) of Solar metallicity galaxies, where they play a critical role in ISM heating, cooling, and reprocessing stellar radiation. The PAH fraction, the abundance of PAHs relative to total dust mass, is a key parameter in ISM physics. Using JWST and MUSE observations of 42 galaxies from the PHANGS survey, we analyze the PAH fraction in over 17 000 H II regions spanning a gas-phase oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H) = 8.0-8.8 (Z ~ 0.2-1.3 Zsun), and ~400 isolated supernova remnants (SNRs). We find a significantly lower PAH fraction toward H II regions compared to a reference sample of diffuse ISM areas at matched metallicity. At 12+log(O/H) &amp;gt; 8.2, the PAH fraction toward H II regions is strongly anti-correlated with the local ionization parameter, suggesting that PAH destruction is correlated with ionized gas and/or hydrogen-ionizing UV radiation. At lower metallicities, the PAH fraction declines steeply in both H II regions and the diffuse ISM, likely reflecting less efficient PAH formation in metal-poor environments. Carefully isolating dust emission from the vicinity of optically-identified supernova remnants, we see evidence for selective PAH destruction from measurements of lower PAH fractions, which is, however, indistinguishable at ~50 pc scales. Overall, our results point to ionizing radiation as the dominant agent of PAH destruction within H II regions, with metallicity playing a key role in their global abundance in galaxies.

Using NIRSpec on JWST, we studied a sample of 15 intermediate-mass (1.8-4.1 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) young stellar objects (YSOs) previously identified with MIRI photometry in the low-metallicity NGC 346 star-forming cluster in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). All objects, observed in the 1.7-5.3 micron range, show strong hydrogen recombination lines in the Paschen, Brackett, Pfund, and Humphreys series, confirming their very young ages. The spectra of 11 YSOs show prominent absorption bands from the three most important ice species (H2O, CO2, CO), marking the first detection of these ices in intermediate-mass YSOs beyond our Galaxy. In three YSOs, water ice appears to be in crystalline form. In some objects, we also detect 13CO2 and OCS ices &amp;ndash; never before observed beyond the Milky Way (MW) &amp;ndash; and methanol ice in at least one star. We compared the column densities of H2O, CO2, and CO ices with those measured in more and less massive protostars in the MW and Large Magellanic Cloud, finding that in NGC 346 ice column densities reach values nearly an order of magnitude lower than in more massive objects (~1x10^17 cm-2 for water and ~1x10^16 cm-2 for CO2 and CO). However, the relative proportions of the ice species abundances do not differ from those in massive MW YSOs. This suggests that metallicity may not significantly affect ice chemistry in protoplanetary discs and that, shielded by the protostellar envelope or deep in the midplane, circumstellar material is likely impervious to the radiation environment.

&lt;p&gt;
Recent Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) results provided strong evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (sGWB), consistent with a population of merging massive black holes (MBHs) at z&amp;lt;1. Meanwhile, JWST observations at z&amp;gt;5 suggest a higher number density of accreting MBHs than previously estimated. Together with constraints from local MBHs and high-z quasars, these findings offer a unique opportunity to test MBH seeding and early growth models. We explore this using \tt L-GalaxiesitBH, a new extension of the galaxy formation model \tt L-Galaxies, developed to explicitly model all stages of MBH evolution, including seeding, accretion, and binary dynamics. To take advantage of both the high resolution of the \tt MillenniumII and the large volume of the \tt Millennium simulations, we run \tt L-GalaxiesitBH on the former and use its outputs as initial conditions for the latter, via our itgrafting method. We find that reproducing the number density of high-z active MBHs observed by JWST requires either a heavy seed formation rate significantly higher than that predicted by current models (≳ 0.01 Mpc^-3 at z ~ 10), or widespread formation of light seeds undergoing multiple phases of super-Eddington accretion. Furthermore, matching the amplitude of the PTA sGWB signal requires nearly all galaxies with stellar masses M_*&amp;gt; 10^9 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; to host central MBHs by z~0. Given the extreme heavy seed densities required to satisfy both PTA and JWST constraints, our results favor a scenario in which MBHs originate from light seeds that grow rapidly and efficiently in the early universe. This work demonstrates the power of combining multi-messenger data with physical models to probe the origins and evolution of MBHs across cosmic time.

&lt;p&gt;
MACS J0138-2155 is the only known cluster to strongly lens two supernovae (SNe), Requiem and Encore, from the same host galaxy at z=1.949. We present seven independent mass models of the galaxy cluster built using six software packages. By conducting a blind analysis (no exchanges of results between modeling teams), we quantified uncertainties due to modeling and software. Through HST, JWST and MUSE observations, we assembled high-quality data products, including eight "gold" lensed image systems consisting of 23 images with secure spectroscopic redshifts, and one "silver" system with a likely redshift value. Restricting to the gold images, we obtain overall consistent model predictions of the positions, magnifications and time delays of SN Encore and SN Requiem images, especially for models with &amp;chi;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ 25. We predict the appearance of the next images of SNe Encore and Requiem with a time delay of &amp;gt;~3000 days and of ~3700 to 4000 days, respectively, based on a fiducial cosmological model of H_0 = 70  km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; Mpc^-1 and &amp;Omega;_m = 0.3. We obtain relations between H_0 and the time delays of SNe Encore and Requiem. In particular, for H_0 = 73  km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; Mpc^-1, the four lowest &amp;chi;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; models predict SN Requiem to reappear in ~Apr-Dec 2026; for H_0 = 67  km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; Mpc^-1, in ~Mar-Nov 2027. Using the newly measured time delay between the two detected images of SN Encore by Pierel et al. (submitted) and our mass models, we jointly infer H_0 = 66.9^+11.2_-8.1 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; Mpc^-1, where the uncertainty is dominated by that of the time delay. The long delays of the next-appearing SN Requiem and SN Encore images provide excellent opportunities to measure H_0 with an uncertainty of 2-3%. Our mass models form the basis for cosmological inference from this unique lens cluster with two strongly lensed SNe. (Abridged)

Spatially resolved stellar populations of massive, quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon provide powerful insights into star-formation quenching and stellar mass assembly mechanisms. Previous photometric work has revealed that the cores of these galaxies are redder than their outskirts. However, spectroscopy is needed to break the age-metallicity degeneracy and uncover the driver of these colour gradients. Here, we derive age and elemental abundance gradients for 8 distant (1.2 ≲ z ≲ 2.2), massive (10.3≲log(M_*/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;)≲ 11.1), quiescent galaxies, by fitting full-spectrum models to ultra-deep NIRSpec-MSA spectroscopy from the JWST-SUSPENSE survey. We find that these galaxies have negative age, positive [Mg/H] and [Mg/Fe], and flat [Fe/H] gradients, implying that galaxy cores are older and Mg-deficient compared to galaxy outskirts. The age gradients indicate inside-out quenching, while the Mg-deficient cores suggest rapid gas expulsion as the central quenching mechanism. Thus, galaxy cores formed faster and quenched more efficiently than their outskirts. In this scenario, however, our [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] gradients are still puzzling. Our results contrast lower-redshift studies, which find flat age and [Mg/Fe] gradients and negative metallicity gradients. Additionally, we find a positive trend between age gradients and rotational support, and marginal trends between gradients and galaxy velocity dispersions and ages. We discuss our findings in the context of galaxy growth scenarios, including minor mergers and progenitor bias, and the possible occurrence of different quenching mechanisms across redshift. With this work, we present the first stellar population gradients from NIRSpec-MSA spectroscopy, in the largest current sample of distant, quiescent galaxies.

&lt;p&gt;
Multiply-imaged supernovae (SNe) provide a novel means of constraining the Hubble constant (H_0). Such measurements require a combination of precise models of the lensing mass distribution and an accurate estimate of the relative time delays between arrival of the multiple images. Only two multiply-imaged SNe, Refsdal and H0pe, have enabled measurements of H_0 thus far. Here we detail the third such measurement for SN Encore, a z=1.95 SNIa discovered in JWST/NIRCam imaging. We measure the time delay, perform simulations of additional microlensing and millilensing systematics, and combine with the mass models of Suyu et al. in a double-blind analysis to obtain our H_0 constraint. Our final time-delay measurement is &amp;Delta; t_1b,1a=-39.8_-3.3^+3.9 days, which is combined with seven lens models weighted by the likelihood of the observed multiple image positions for a result of H_0=66.9_-8.1^+11.2 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; Mpc^-1. The uncertainty on this measurement could be improved significantly if template imaging is obtained. Remarkably, a sibling to SN Encore (SN "Requiem") was discovered in the same host galaxy, making the MACS J0138.0-2155 cluster the first system known to produce more than one observed multiply-imaged SN. SN Requiem has a fourth image that is expected to appear within a few years, providing an unprecedented decade-long baseline for time-delay cosmography and an opportunity for a high-precision joint estimate of H_0.

&lt;p&gt;
Recent studies show that light seeds of black holes, which grow into massive black holes (MBHs) over time, often struggle to remain at the centers of their birthplaces in high-redshift galaxies, limiting their ability to accrete gas and merge with other black holes. In this work, we investigate how off-center formation of the first seeds affects the evolution of the MBH and massive black hole binary (MBHB) populations over cosmic history. To this end, we use the ttL-Galaxies  BH semi-analytical model, which includes multiple seed formation mechanisms, with light Population III remnants being the most significant contributors. To incorporate off-center formation, we modify the model to track the initial seed location, the sinking timescales toward the galactic center, and any growth during this phase. The results indicate that seed formation occurring away from the galactic center has a negligible impact on the MBH population at z&amp;lt;1, but causes significant differences at higher redshifts. Particularly, the abundance of 10^5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; MBHs at z&amp;gt;4 can be up to 2-10 times smaller compared to a nuclear seed formation model. Quasar luminosity functions with L_bol&amp;gt;10^44 erg/s are similarly affected, although they still align with observational constraints. The off-centre formation also alters the galaxy-MBH mass relation. At z&amp;gt;5, the amplitude of the relation can be up to 2 dex smaller than in nuclear seed models. These differences fade by z ~ 2 for galaxies &amp;gt;10^11 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, and by z=0 for smaller galaxies. Notably, the overmassive MBH population recently unveiled by JWST is still present in the model, suggesting they can form independently of the seed dynamics. Finally, the merging rate of MBHs within LISA sensitivity band is strongly impacted. Specifically, there is a suppression of events at high-z and an enhancement at low-z.

&lt;p&gt;
The role of interactions and mergers in the rapid quenching of massive galaxies in the early Universe remains uncertain, largely due to the difficulty of directly linking mergers to quenching. Collisional ring galaxies provide a unique opportunity, as their morphology allows precise dating of the interaction, which can then be compared to quenching timescales inferred from star formation histories. We study a gravitationally bound system at z=1.61 in the UDS field, composed of a Host galaxy (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; = 10^11.4 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) with a collisional ring and an X-ray AGN, and the Bullet galaxy (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; = 10^11.2 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;), located at a projected distance of ~ 8 kpc. Combining JWST and HST imaging with Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy, we find compelling evidence for an ongoing starburst in the Host concurrent with rapid quenching in the Bullet. The ring, ~ 20 kpc in diameter, is expanding at 127^+72_-29 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, implying the galaxies first collided 47&amp;ndash;96 Myr ago. This timeline is consistent with the Host's current starburst and the Bullet's sudden quenching, strongly suggesting both phenomena were triggered by the interaction. Crucially, the Bullet shows no evidence of a preceding starburst, ruling out rapid gas consumption as the primary quenching channel. Instead, we suggest that merger-driven processes &amp;ndash; such as enhanced turbulence and disk instabilities &amp;ndash; may have suppressed star formation. An additional possibility, which we term the "Dragon Effect,'' is that AGN-driven outflows from the Host disrupted the Bullet's low-density molecular gas, thereby preventing efficient star formation and accelerating quenching.

&lt;p&gt;
We report a new population of objects discovered using the data from the James Webb Space Telescope, which are characterized by their point-like morphology and narrow permitted emission lines. Our sample includes nine objects found in three JWST wide survey fields, which have z=3.624 to 5.378 and M_B ~ -18.3 to -21.4 mag. Their light distributions follow gaussian profiles, with the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) values only 3.7%&amp;ndash;34.6% larger than those of the point spread functions. Their sharpest FWHM sizes correspond to only 0.49 to 0.96 kpc. They have very strong [O III] and Halpha lines (median rest-frame equivalent widths of 1610.6 and 1374.0 A, respectively), and the line widths of the latter are only 150&amp;ndash;360 km/s. Due to the limitation of the current data, the exact nature of this new population is still uncertain. The emission line diagnostics shows that at least one object is consistent with being AGN. On the other hand, the spectral energy distributions of most of the nine objects can be fitted reasonably by normal galaxy templates, which suggest that they could also be very young (median age of 120 Myrs), star-forming (median star formation rate of 1.8 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;/yr) galaxies in the early formation stage (having acquired a median stellar mass of only 10^8.4 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;). If they are indeed star-forming galaxies, their gas-phase metallicities range from 12+log(O/H) = 7.8 to 8.3. It will be critical to understand this population by deeper medium-resolution spectroscopy in the future. If they are AGNs, they constitute a new kind of type 2 AGNs that are low-luminosity and almost "hostless". If they are star-forming galaxies, they also constitute a new kind whose early formation is likely a secular process starting from a very compact core, which is in line with the picture of a monolithic collapse.

We characterize two candidate cool galactic outflows in two relatively low mass, highly inclined Virgo cluster galaxies: NGC4424 and NGC4694. Previous analyses of observations using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) carbon monoxide (CO) line emission maps did not classify these sources as cool outflow hosts. Using new high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, JWST mid-infrared photometry in the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-tracing F770W band, we identify extended structures present off of the stellar disk. The identified structures are bright in the MIRI F770W and F2100W bands, suggesting they include PAHs as well as other dust grains. As PAHs have been shown to be destroyed in hot, ionized gas, these structures are likely to be outflows of cool (T≤ 10^4K) gas. This work represents an exciting possibility for using mid infrared observations to identify and measure outflows in lower mass, lower star formation galaxies.

We report JWST NIRCAM and MIRI observations of Sgr B2, the most active site of star formation in the Galaxy. These observations, using 14 filters spanning 1.5 to 25 microns, have revealed a multilayered and highly structured cloud that contains both a revealed, low-extinction and hidden, high-extinction population of massive stars. JWST has detected new candidate HII regions around massive stars previously missed by radio telescopes. MIRI has detected radiation escaping from the forming massive cluster Sgr B2 N along its outflow cavities, demonstrating that infrared radiation finds geometric escape routes even in the densest, most heavily embedded regions in the universe. JWST further highlights the gas asymmetry in the cloud, showing a sharp, straight cutoff along the eastern cloud edge. Despite the great sensitivity of these observations, no extended population of YSOs has been detected, placing a limit on their minimum extinction; this result hints that star formation has only just begun in the cloud. Together, these results suggest that, despite already holding the crown for most actively star-forming cloud, we have underestimated the total star formation in Sgr B2. JWST unveils previously hidden massive stars and ionized structures, offering a transformative view of how stars form under some of the most extreme Galactic conditions.

The combination of ALMA submillimeter and JWST/MIRI mid-infrared observations offers a transformative view of protostellar jets and outflows by probing cold and warm gas components across diverse physical conditions. We present a detailed comparison of gas distribution in these regimes for the jet/outflow system associated with G205.46-14.56S3 (HOPS 315), focusing on the inner ~800 AU along the jet. ALMA CO and SiO trace both lobes of the bipolar jet, revealing high-velocity collimated jets and wider outflow components. JWST/MIRI detects mainly the blueshifted lobe; the redshifted side is likely obscured by strong mid-infrared extinction. Shorter-wavelength MIRI H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rotational lines (S(7)-S(4)) trace compact jet structures resembling SiO emission, while longer-wavelength lines (S(3)-S(1)) reveal more extended emission akin to low-velocity CO. From H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rotational emission, we identify two molecular gas temperature components: warm (~ 773 ± 44 K) and hot (~ 2499±720 K). Using the ortho-to-para ratio, we estimate visual extinction A_V ≈ 23.3 ± 2.5 mag. JWST/MIRI emission imply a jet mass-loss rate of M&amp;#775;_J, blue, jwst ≈ (0.27 ± 0.1) × 10^-6M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1. The combination of ALMA and JWST reveals stratified layers within the outflow and jet, as well as shock structures, providing a comprehensive view of their physical conditions. This multiwavelength study demonstrates that combining submillimeter observations from ALMA with infrared data from JWST is crucial for uncovering the full physical and chemical structure of protostellar jets and outflows.

We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) near-infrared (NIRCam) Br&amp;alpha;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [Fe II], and PAH imaging of the molecule-rich, high-excitation bipolar planetary nebula (PN) NGC 6537 (the Red Spider), complemented by new ALMA and Chandra observations and archival HST images. The resulting multiwavelength view of the Red Spider establishes the detailed lobe/torus structure of the nebula and the mass-loss history of its progenitor star. The extinction-penetrating JWST/NIRCam Br&amp;alpha; and PAH and ALMA 3 mm continuum imaging exposes the complexity of the ionized inner nebula. JWST/NIRCam H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; imaging traces the full, ~1.1 pc extent of the bubble-like lobes formed by fast (~300-400 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) polar outflows, while ALMA ^13CO(1-0) mapping reveals a point-symmetric, slowly (~10 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) expanding equatorial torus of radius ~0.13 pc. In striking contrast, the [Fe II] image displays an extended S-shaped emission morphology that traces collisions between an active, collimated wind and slower-moving material along the lobe rims. No X-rays are detected from the nebula or its central star in deep Chandra/HRC-I imaging. However, the combined HST and JWST imaging reveals a near-IR excess at the central star indicative of emission from hot (~1000 K) circumstellar dust. We propose that interactions between the nebular progenitor star and a close companion are responsible for the ejection of NGC 6537's molecular torus, the formation of a circumbinary dust disk, and the launching of fast, wandering, collimated outflows that have inflated the polar lobe bubbles traced by near-IR H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission and are presently generating the [Fe II]-emitting shocks.

&lt;p&gt;
The Period-Luminosity (PL) relation is usually derived using time-averaged magnitudes, which require multiple-epoch observations to determine periods and adequately sample the light curves. Although single-epoch observations are more practical and require significantly less observational effort, they inherently introduce greater photometric scatter, leading to an increased dispersion in the derived Period-Luminosity relations. In this paper, we explore, in detail, a method that transforms single random-phase data to their mean-light values, using information obtained in other bands for the same Cepheid. This approach enables the accurate re-construction of mean-light PL relations for wavelengths observed with space-based facilities, for instance, where the number of epochs per star makes simple averaging or template fitting less than optimal, with the latter requiring very high-precision periods for predictive phasing. While applying this technique across multiple bands, from optical to mid-IR, we focus particularly on widely separated bands covering the mid-IR to the optical. We showcase this method using the J band (as being observed by JWST) as the random-phase component. Our results show that this correction reduces the scatter of the PL relation in the J band by a factor of approximately 0.7×, equivalent to increasing the number of random-phase observations by a factor of 10, needed to obtain the same increase in precision as delivered here.

Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed massive, evolved galaxies only a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, challenging standard cosmological models. To test the hypothesis that the Galactic nucleus may act as a source of matter and energy capable of accelerating galaxy formation, we examined whether the Milky Way itself shows signs of central activity. Expansion of the Galactic center would imply such activity in its nuclear region. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed stellar motions along the south north axis of the Galaxy using Gaia DR3 data. Average Galactocentric radial velocities were computed in 50 control points, spaced by 0.1 kpc with a sampling radius of 0.05 kpc, up to 5 kpc from the Galactic center. The results show a strong symmetry: in the northern region, 36 of 50 points have positive velocities, with an average of 19.15 +/- 10.80 km/s (N = 50), while in the southern region, 37 of 50 points have negative velocities, with an average of - 19.24 +/- 8.22 km/s (N = 50). A Students t test confirms that the two distributions differ significantly (0.003). The combination of positive average velocities in the north and negative average velocities in the south indicates a symmetric outflow of stars away from the Galactic center, consistent with expansion in its central region. These Galactocentric radial velocities are consistent with the formation of massive, evolved galaxies within 300 My, as observed by JWST. If extended to other galaxies, the results (together with earlier findings on globular cluster motions) suggest that aspects of standard galaxy formation models may require refinement. This interpretation, however, remains preliminary and requires further study.

Early JWST observations reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of high-redshift candidate massive galaxies at z ≳ 7, and recent DESI measurements show a preference for dynamical dark energy, which together present a significant challenge to the standard &amp;Lambda;CDM cosmology. In this work, we jointly analyze high-redshift galaxy data from JWST, baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI DR2, and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and ACT, measuring the total neutrino mass \sum m_&amp;nu;. We consider three dark energy models (&amp;Lambda;CDM, wCDM, and w_0w_aCDM) and three mass hierarchies. Our results indicate that in the w_0w_aCDM model, adding JWST data to CMB+DESI tightens the upper limit of \sum m_&amp;nu; by about 5.8&amp;percnt;-10.2&amp;percnt;, and we obtain \sum m_&amp;nu; &amp;lt; 0.167~eV (2&amp;sigma;) in the normal hierarchy (NH) case. Furthermore, JWST also offers indicative lower limits on star formation efficiency parameter of f_*,10 ≳ 0.146-0.161. Bayesian evidence weakly favors the w_0w_aCDM+\sum m_&amp;nu;(NH) model relative to the &amp;Lambda;CDM+\sum m_&amp;nu;(NH) model using CMB+DESI+JWST data. These results suggest that the joint analysis of high-redshift JWST data and low-redshift DESI data provides compelling constraints on neutrino mass and merits further investigation.

Recent results from the James Webb Space Telescope show that nearby spiral galaxies are dominated by the presence of H I and H II bubbles that strongly shape their surrounding medium. These bubbles result from the feedback of high-mass stars at different stages of their life cycle. However, early (pre-supernova) feedback from high-mass stars is still poorly quantified. Recent results from numerical simulations suggest that the impact of high-mass star early feedback (photoionization, wind) on star formation properties is complex, time-dependent, and strongly depends on physical conditions, including the magnetic field properties. In our Galaxy, ionized (H II) regions observed in different evolution stages show a high diversity of star formation in their associated photo-dissociation regions (PDRs). However, the way in which the low- to high-density interstellar medium evolves to this situation remains elusive. Quantifying the impact of early feedback from high-mass stars on star formation properties and star formation laws (star formation rate, star formation efficiency versus gas surface density, &amp;Sigma;gas) will allow for a better understanding of the evolution of star formation laws in external galaxies, the laws that are key ingredients of galaxy evolution models. PRIMA, with its high sensitivity, large mapping efficiency, and polarimetric capabilities, offers a unique opportunity to address the way radiative feedback and magnetic field control star formation in the Milky Way.

The main accretion phase of protostars is characterized by the ejection of material in the form of jets/outflows. External UV irradiation can potentially have a significant impact on the excitation conditions within these outflows. High-resolution observations in the mid-infrared allow us to investigate the details of those energetic processes through the emission of shock-excited H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; . Our aim is to spatially resolve H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ionic/atomic emission within the outflows of low-mass protostars, and investigate its origin in connection to shocks influenced by external ultraviolet irradiation. We analyze spectral maps of 5 Class I protostars in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI/MRS). Four out of five protostars show strong H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [\ionNe II], and [\ionFe II] emission associated with outflows/jets. Pure rotational H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; transitions from S(1) to S(8) are found and show two distinct temperature components on Boltzmann diagrams with rotational temperatures of ~500-600 K and ~1000-3000 K respectively. Both C-type shocks propagating at high pre-shock densities (n_H ≥10^4 cm^-3) and J-type shocks at low pre-shock densities (n_H ≤10^3 cm^-3) reproduce the observed line ratios. However, only C-type shocks produce sufficiently high column densities of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, whereas predictions from a single J-type shock reproduce the observed rotational temperatures of the gas better. A combination of various types of shocks could play a role in protostellar outflows as long as UV irradiation is included in the models. The origin of this radiation is likely internal, since no significant differences in the excitation conditions of outflows are seen at various locations in the cloud.

&lt;p&gt;
While the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) now allows identifying quiescent galaxies (QGs) out to early epochs, the photometric selection of quiescent galaxy candidates (QGCs) and the derivation of key physical quantities are highly sensitive to the assumed star-formation histories (SFHs). We aim to quantify how the inclusion of JWST/MIRI data and different SFH models impacts the selection and characterisation of QGCs. We test the robustness of the physical properties inferred from the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, such as M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;, age, star formation rate (SFR), and AV, and study how they impact the quiescence criteria of the galaxies across cosmic time. We perform SED fitting for ~13000 galaxies at z&amp;lt;6 from the CEERS/MIRI fields with up to 20 optical-mid infrared (MIR) broadband coverage. We implement three SFH prescriptions: flexible delayed, NonParametric, and extended Regulator. For each model, we compare results obtained with and without MIRI photometry and dust emission models. We evaluate the impact of these configurations on the number of candidate QGCs, selected based on rest UVJ colours, sSFR and main-sequence offset, and on their key physical properties such as M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;, AV, and stellar ages. The number of QGCs selected varies significantly with the choice of SFH from 171 to 224 out of 13000 galaxies, depending on the model. This number increases to 222-327 when MIRI data are used (up to ~45% more QGCs). This enhancement is driven by improved constraints on dust attenuation and M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;. We find a strong correlation between AV and M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;, with massive galaxies (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;~10^11 M&amp;odot;) being 1.5-4.2 times more attenuated in magnitude than low-mass systems (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;~10^9 M&amp;odot;), depending on SFH. Regardless of the SFH assumption, ~13% of QGCs exhibit significant attenuation (AV &amp;gt; 0.5) in support of recent JWST studies challenging the notion that quiescent galaxies are uniformly dust-free.

Time-delay cosmology offers an alternative approach to measuring the Hubble constant (H_0), which is distinct from the cosmic distance ladder and cosmic microwave background radiation methods. In this study, we present an improved strong lens mass modeling analysis of the cluster-lensed supernova Refsdal, incorporating the latest spectroscopic redshift data from the MUSE on the Very Large Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope CANUCS/Technicolor. The robustness of our lens models is confirmed using the Jackknife method. From our analysis that considers four lens mass models with different assumptions on profiles of dark matter halos and external perturbations, we derive a constraint on the Hubble constant of H_0=66.0±4.3\Mpc after combining best-fitted values of the four lens models.

[Shortened for arXiv] We conduct a systematic search for log(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;ast;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) ≥ 9.5 quiescent galaxies at z &amp;gt; 3 in six extragalactic deep fields observed with NIRCam, with the goal of extracting their physical and statistical features in a uniform and self-consistent manner. We exploit the ASTRODEEP-JWST photometric catalogs to single out robust candidates, including sources quenched only a few tens of Myr before the observation. We apply a SED-fitting procedure which explores three functional forms of star formation history and the &amp;chi;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; probabilities of the solutions, with additional checks to minimise the contamination from interlopers, tuning our selection criteria against available spectroscopic data from the DAWN archive and simulated catalogs. We select 633 candidates, which we rank by a reliability parameter based on the probabilities of the quiescent and alternative star-forming solutions, with 291 candidates tagged as "gold". According to the best-fit models, 79&amp;percnt; of the massive (log(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;ast;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) ≥ 10.5) quiescent galaxies at 3 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 5 stopped forming stars at least 150 Myr before the time of observation, while 89&amp;percnt; of low-mass sources have been quenched for less than 150 Myr. The abundance of low-mass old quiescent systems does not increase significantly with time from z = 5 to 3: low-mass objects seem to be experiencing a short episode of quenching followed by rejuvenation ("breathing''), consistent with a downsizing scenario of galaxy formation. We also find an abrupt drop in the density of massive quiescent candidates at z &amp;gt; 5. We derive estimates for the number density of early passive galaxies up to z = 10 and compare them against various models: tensions with data remain in the modeling of the observed bimodality of time passed since quenching as a function of mass.

We present the discovery of two low-mass, high-redshift, quiescent galaxies, GS-z5-Q1 and COS-z5-Q1, using JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy alongside NIRCam and MIRI photometry. Observed at a redshift of z=5.39 and z=5.11 respectively, and with stellar masses of 10^9.6M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and 10^9.5M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, GS-z5-Q1 and COS-z5-Q1 are two of the most distant quiescent galaxies spectroscopically confirmed to-date, and are by far the least massive (~10× lower mass). Full spectrophotometric modelling reveals that COS-z5-Q1 appears to have quenched more than 300Myr prior to observation (z~ 7) and has a formation redshift of around z~11, whilst GS-z5-Q1 formed and quenched in a single burst around 150Myr prior to observation (z~6). GS-z5-Q1 is found to lie near the centre of a known high-z overdensity in GOODS-S, as would be expected by galaxy formation models, while COS-z5-Q1 lies towards the outskirts of an overdense region. This highlights the role that environment could play in accelerating galaxy evolutionary processes and could possibly be linked to the galaxies' quiescent nature. By modelling their stellar populations, we show that these types of low-mass quiescent galaxies could potentially be descendants of the higher-z "mini-quenched" galaxies. The discovery of these two low-mass z&amp;gt;5 quiescent galaxies illuminates a previously undiscovered galaxy population and motivates dedicated follow-up surveys to investigate the overall population.

&lt;p&gt;
JWST NIRCam and MIRI photometry of NGC 602, a low-metallicity young star cluster in the Small Magellanic Cloud, reveals an extended mid-infrared bright emission feature designated as MZS-1. This feature is prominent between 10 and 25.5 microns, but is extremely faint at 7.7 microns and entirely undetected at shorter wavelengths. MZS-1 exhibits an elliptical morphology with a major axis of approximately 8 arcseconds and a minor axis of about 4 arcseconds. Its elongated shape and multiple emission peaks in the two-dimensional flux map suggest a group of deeply embedded sources with blackbody-like temperatures ranging from 100 K to 140 K. SED fitting using the Robitaille 2017 model grids identifies these sources as Stage I young stellar objects (YSOs) with masses below approximately 3 solar masses and a total stellar mass of the protocluster of about 300 solar masses (based on a Salpeter IMF). The low YSO masses are consistent with their absence in Spitzer-based catalogs due to sensitivity limits. By revealing a deeply embedded, low-mass protocluster invisible in previous surveys, this work highlights JWST's unparalleled resolution and sensitivity in uncovering the earliest stages of low-mass cluster formation in the metal-poor regime.

Some of the most puzzling discoveries of NASA's JWST in the early Universe surround the surprising abundance of compact red sources, which show peculiar continuum shapes and broad hydrogen spectral lines. These sources, dubbed "Little Red Dots'' or LRDs, have been the subject of intense inquiry in the literature. Any of the proposed explanations, from accreting super-massive black holes ensconced in ultra-dense gas to extremely compact star-systems, has significant implications for the earliest phases of galaxy evolution. Part of the difficulty in concretely identifying the physical mechanisms that drive their rest ultra-violet/optical spectral properties is the lack of bona fide signatures &amp;ndash; either star-formation or accreting super-massive black hole, that uniquely discriminate between competing interpretations. In this work, we report the discovery of several spectral features that strongly favor the existence of an accreting super-massive black hole in an LRD witnessed in the first 800 Myr of cosmic time, including several rare iron transitions and a possible [FeVII]. Additionally, we report on the properties of significant Balmer absorption and find that the small widths and relative depths of the absorption feature suggest the source of the absorber is at or beyond the outer edge of the broad-line region and does it fully cover the accreting SMBH in the center of the system. The detection of these iron features, coupled with the properties of the Balmer absorption, unveils an alternative scenario for LRDs &amp;ndash; one where there are direct sight-lines from the accretion disk to gas on scales at (or beyond) the broad-line gas region.

The process of galaxy evolution over cosmic time is not yet fully understood, since there is a debate on the impact of galaxy collisions on the star formation and metallicity. The local environment of the galaxy mergers could also have a large impact on the evolution of the galaxies, but it has not yet been possible to examine it in detail. Modern simulations with larger capacity, including the newest physical knowledge and new observations with JWST, help us to answer these questions. Using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation, we processed the catalogue data and the merger tree files of the TNG300-1 simulation. We calculated the galaxies average star formation rate (SFR) and mass at redshifts between 0 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 15. We investigated the environment of galaxy mergers, with the focus on the local density, and also examined how the SFR changes in merging galaxies. We compared our findings with JWST results and highlighted differences in the star formation rate density (SFRD) history between the models and observations.

The existence of abundant post-starburst/quiescent galaxies just ~1-2 Gyrs after the Big Bang challenges our current paradigm of galaxy evolution. Cosmological simulations suggest that quasar feedback is likely the most promising mechanism responsible for such rapid quenching. Here we report a high detection rate (6/27) of exceptionally fast and powerful galaxy-scale outflows traced by [O III] emission in z ~ 5-6 luminous quasars as revealed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with velocity up to ~8400 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and order-of-magnitude kinetic energy outflow rates up to ~260% the observed quasar bolometric luminosities. This fraction is ≳6.6 times larger than that in luminosity-matched comparison samples at z ~ 1.5-3.5 (0/58) and z &amp;lt; 1 (5/148). These extreme outflows are comparable to or even faster than the most rapid [O III] outflows reported at z ≲ 3, and could reach the circumgalactic medium (CGM) or even the intergalactic medium (IGM). The average kinetic energy outflow rate of our entire sample is ~230× higher than that at cosmic noon. The substantially higher frequency of outflows with energetics well above the threshold for negative feedback in our sample strongly suggests that quasar feedback plays a significant role in efficiently quenching/regulating early massive galaxies.

&lt;p&gt;
The stellar initial mass function (IMF) and the fraction of binary systems are fundamental ingredients that govern the formation and evolution of galaxies. Whether the IMF is universal or varies with environment remains one of the central open questions in astrophysics. Dwarf galaxies such as the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), with their low metallicity and diffuse star-forming regions, offer critical laboratories to address this issue. In this work, we exploit ultra-deep photometry from the James Webb Space Telescope to investigate the stellar populations in the field of the SMC. Using the m_F322W2 versus m_F115W-m_F322W2 color-magnitude diagram (CMD), we derive the luminosity function and measure the fraction of unresolved binary systems. We find a binary fraction of f_bin^q&amp;gt;0.6=0.14±0.01, consistent with results from synthetic CMDs incorporating the metallicity distribution of the SMC. Additionally, the measured binary fraction in the SMC field is consistent with those observed in Galactic open clusters and Milky Way field stars of similar ages and masses, suggesting similar binary formation and evolutionary processes across these low-density environments. By combining the luminosity function with the best-fit isochrone, we derive the the mass function (MF) down to 0.22 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, the lowest mass limit reached for the SMC to date. The resulting MF follows a power-law with a slope of &amp;alpha;=-1.99±0.08. This value is shallower than the canonical Salpeter slope of &amp;alpha;=-2.35, providing new evidence for IMF variations in low-metallicity and low-density environments.

&lt;p&gt;
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has observed compact, massive proto-stellar clusters of low metallicity in the Cosmic Gems arc galaxy at high redshift, which represent likely precursors to globular clusters. We model the mass growth of stellar black holes (BHs) during the first few Myr of the life of a massive, compact, gaseous stellar cluster before stellar feedback expels the primordial gas. At high redshift, in a lower metallicity environment stellar winds get weaker allowing for larger gas-depletion time-scales in the cluster despite of energetic pair-instability supernova (PISN) feedback for sufficiently compact clusters. Mass segregation drives the massive stellar progenitors of BHs in the center of the cluster where gas is most dense. We estimate the conditions for which the initial black hole mass function (BHMF), with a PISN-induced cut-off &amp;lt;55M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, gets shifted to values within the upper BH mass gap, ~ 60-130M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, or higher, as observed by Gravitational Wave (GW) experiments LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. We find that the BHs are shifted by the end of gas depletion to values within and above the mass gap, well within the range of BH components of the recent GW-signal GW231123, depending on total mass, star formation efficiency, metallicity and compactness. The individual BH mass increase follows approximately a surprisingly steep power law with respect to initial BH mass with an exponent in the range ≈ 4-6. This occurs in gaseous proto-stellar clusters that are sufficiently massive and compact, with typical values of total mass ~ 10^6M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and size ~ 1pc. Our analysis suggests that proto-stellar clusters at high redshift such as Cosmic Gems arc clusters have generated through early gas accretion, BHs as heavy as ~ 10^2-10^3M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;
We investigate the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) and star formation rates (SFRs) across cosmic time in the COLIBRE simulations of galaxy formation. COLIBRE includes a multiphase interstellar medium, radiative cooling rates coupled to a model for the evolution of dust grains, and employs prescriptions for stellar and AGN feedback calibrated to reproduce the z=0 observed GSMF and stellar mass - size relation. We present the evolution of the GSMF from simulations at three resolutions: m_gas≈ m_dm~ 10^7, 10^6, and 10^5~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, in cosmological volumes of up to 400^3, 200^3, and 50^3 cMpc^3, respectively. We demonstrate that COLIBRE is consistent with the observed GSMF over the full redshift range for which there are observations to compare with (0&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;12), with maximum systematic deviations of ≈ 0.3 dex reached at 2&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;4. We also examine the evolution of the star-forming main sequence, cosmic SFR density, stellar mass density, and galaxy quenched fraction, making predictions for both the fiducial COLIBRE model with thermally-driven AGN feedback and its variant with hybrid (thermal + kinetic jet) AGN feedback, and finding good agreement with observations. Notably, we show that COLIBRE matches the number density of massive quiescent galaxies at high redshifts reported by JWST, while predicting a stellar-to-halo mass relation that evolves little with redshift. We conclude that neither a redshift-dependent star formation efficiency, nor a variable stellar initial mass function, nor a deviation from &amp;Lambda;CDM is necessary to reproduce the high-redshift JWST stellar masses and SFRs.

We analyze the morphology of 125 submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) in the PRIMER-COSMOS field using double Sersic modeling on JWST NIRCam images across six bands (F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M and F444W), with SMGs being classified by bulge Sersic index (n_bulge) and bulge-to-total luminosity ratio (B/T). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test between the bright (SFR &amp;gt; 175 M_sun yr^-1) and the faint group (SFR &amp;lt; 175 M_sun yr^-1) reveals no significant statistical differences in morphology across bands. However, we notice that SMGs skew towards higher B/T ratios and lower n_bulge from shorter to longer wavelengths. In F444W, bright SMGs exhibit higher B/T and lower n_bulge, indicating flatter, disturbed bulges, while faint SMGs show lower B/T and higher n_bulge. Notably, SMGs with higher B/T tend to have low Sersic index, challenging the local universe dichotomy of classical bulges (B/T &amp;gt; 0.5, n &amp;gt; 4) versus pseudo-bulges (B/T &amp;lt; 0.35, n &amp;lt; 2). In the F277W band, non-parametric measurements indicate predominantly disk-dominated patterns, with only 24 percent of SMGs demonstrating merger signatures. After the removal of SMGs with disturbed morphology, the bulge classification scheme in F277W shows pseudo-bulges (21 percent) and clump migration bulges (16 percent) from secular evolution, compared to 4 percent merger-built bulges. Surprisingly, 48 percent of SMGs defy the classification scheme, showing high B/T (approximately 0.7) but low Sersic index (n_bulge ≤ 1). Bars are confirmed in 7 percent of SMGs. This work suggests that secular evolution takes precedence over major mergers, supporting the idea that isolated evolution fueled by filamentary gas inflow plays a non-negligible role in the SMG bulge formation.

JWST has identified some of the Universe's earliest galaxies, repeatedly pushing the frontier to ever higher redshifts and stellar masses. The presence of such extreme galaxies at such early times, with large stellar populations and high star-formation rates, naturally results in a tension between observation and theory. This tension between numerical models and observations can be either due to our underlying cosmological models or due to a gap in our understanding of early Universe astrophysics. In a prelude to this letter, we showed how the Renaissance simulations, which focused on high redshift galaxy formation were able to reconstruct similar stellar masses to the earliest and highest mass galaxies that had been discovered by JWST at the time of its publication (McCaffrey et al.2023). Since then many more galaxies have been discovered by JWST, in particular the "Mirage-or-Miracle" (MoM) survey broke the record recently with the highest redshift galaxy MoM-z14, which has a spectroscopically confirmed redshift of z ~ 14.44 followed closely by GS-z14 with a spectroscopically confirmed redshift of z ~ 14.3. We investigate in this letter whether these newly discovered galaxies are in conflict with the Renaissance simulations and thus whether they are causing tension with our established models of cosmology and/or high-redshift astrophysics. We discover that MoM-z14's high mass at early redshift can be explained by the Renaissance simulation suite, whereas the extremely high stellar mass of GS-z14 remains an outlier when compared to previous measurements of high-redshift galaxies detected by JWST and our numerical models (even after accounting for cosmic variance).

While C IV is the most common absorption line in Broad Absorption Line Quasar spectra, Balmer absorption lines are among the rarest. We present analysis of Balmer absorption in a sample of fourteen iron low-ionization BAL quasars (FeLoBALQs); eight are new identifications. We measured velocity offset, width, and apparent optical depth. The partial covering ubiquitous in BAL quasar spectra alters the measured Balmer optical depth ratios; taking that into account, we estimated the true H(n= 2) column density. We found the anticipated correlation between Eddington ratio and outflow speed, but it is weak in this sample because nearly all of the objects have the low outflow speeds characterizing loitering outflow FeLoBAL quasars (H. Choi et al. 2022b), objects that are also found to have low accretion rates (K. M. Leighly et al. 2022; H. Choi et al. 2022a). Measures of dN/dv, the differential column density with respect to the outflow speed, are anticorrelated with the luminosity and Eddington ratio: the strongest absorption is observed at the lowest speeds in the lowest luminosity objects. The absorption line width is correlated with &amp;alpha;oi, the F&amp;lambda; point-to-point slope between 5100A and 3 microns. This parameter is strongly correlated with the Eddington ratio among low-redshift quasars (K. M. Leighly et al. 2024). Balmer absorption lines have been recently found in the spectra of Little Red Dots (LRDs), a class of high-redshift objects discovered by JWST. We note suggestive similarities between LRDs and FeLoBAL quasars in the emission line shape, the presence of steep reddening and a scattered blue continuum, the lack of hot dust emission, and X-ray weakness.

&lt;p&gt;
Little Red Dots (LRDs) are a puzzling population of extragalactic sources whose origin is highly debated. In this Letter, we stack NIRCam, MIRI and ALMA images of a large and homogeneously-selected sample of LRDs from multiple JWST Legacy fields. We find clear evidence for hot-dust emission, seen as a rising mid-infrared continuum up to rest-frame &amp;lambda;_rest~ 3&amp;mu;m, that is best explained by a standard dusty AGN structure. This scenario holds regardless of whether the Optical/Ultraviolet (UV) continuum is stellar or AGN-dominated. Either ways, we argue that AGN-heated dust must have a geometry that leaves at least part of the Optical/UV continuum and broad-line region emission unobscured, which explains the observed blue UV slopes and prominent Balmer features. Lack of detections in the deep stack of X-ray images suggests that Compton-thick (N_H&amp;gt;3×10^24 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) gas obscuration is common, and likely confined within the dust sublimation radius (R_sub~0.1 pc). While this gas-dust displacement is in line with recent models (e.g. the "Black Hole Star''), how pre-enriched hot dust can form around a nearly-pristine black hole environment remains to be explained.

&lt;p&gt;
We report the discovery of a faint (M_1700 ~ -12.2), oxygen-deficient strongly-lensed ionizing source &amp;ndash; dubbed LAP2 (Lensed And Pristine 2) &amp;ndash; at a spectroscopic redshift of z=4.19. LAP2 appears to be isolated and lies very close to the caustic produced by the lensing galaxy cluster Abell 2744. It was observed with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec MSA in prism mode as part of the UNCOVER program. The NIRSpec spectrum reveals prominent Lya emission (7.1 sigma), clear Ha emission (6.2 sigma), tentative Hb emission (2.8 sigma), and no detectable [OIII]4959,5007 (~ 7 times fainter than Ha). The inferred [OIII] 2 sigma upper limit corresponds to an R3 index &amp;lt;0.85 (assuming the Ha/Hb ~ 2.86 case~B recombination ratio), which, under high-ionization conditions, implies a metallicity of Z &amp;lt; 6 X 10^(-3) Z_sun. The combination of faint ultraviolet luminosity, large rest-frame Ha equivalent width (~ 650 A), and extremely compact size (&amp;lt; 10 pc) suggests that LAP2 is being caught in an early, pristine formation phase consistent with an instantaneous-burst scenario, with an estimated stellar mass of at most a few 10^4 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. Deep VLT/MUSE observations further reveal copious Lya emission forming an arclet that straddles the critical line. LAP2 thus joins the rare class of extremely metal-poor star-forming complexes that JWST has started to unveil at redshifts 3 - 7, and provides a rare glimpse into a still very poorly explored faint-luminosity regime.

&lt;p&gt;
The James Webb Space Telescope (itJWST) opened a new observational window on the primordial Universe. Here we present new JWST NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy (IFS) observations of the z=7.54 quasar ULAS J1342+0928 obtained as part of the Galaxy Assembly with NIRSpec IFS (GA-NIFS) GTO programme. The new data-set obtained with both the prism (R~100) and the high-resolution grating (R~2700) allow for a complete description of the quasar emission from the rest-frame UV to optical bands. The low-resolution data reveal the presence of [\ionO iii] emission on ~7 kpc scales, well above the typical galaxy size at this redshift, likely associated with a past outflow event. Additionally, the high-resolution observations show a more energetic ionised outflow on nuclear scales (≲ 0.6 kpc). The total ionised mass outflow rate ranges between 50 and 300 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;   yr^-1 where the significant spread is mostly due to the lack of tight constraints on the electron density. This range overlaps in part with the star formation rate range (85&amp;ndash;545 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;   yr^-1), implying that the nuclear outflow could ultimately lead to an early star formation quenching. By employing an accretion disc modelling, for the first time on itJWST data, we manage to robustly estimate the black hole mass and the bolometric luminosity, log(M_BH/(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;))=9.2± 0.2 and log(L_bol/(erg   s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;))=46.8± 0.1, respectively. We derive an Eddington ratio of &amp;lambda;_Edd~ 0.4, challenging the paradigm of widespread super-Eddington accretion in quasars at the epoch of reionisation.

A semi-analytical model for the evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the &amp;Lambda;CDM paradigm has been shown to yield stellar mass-BH mass relations that reproduce both the JWST and pre-JWST observations. Either fuzzy or warm dark matter (FDM or WDM) would suppress the formation of the smaller galactic halos that play important roles in the CDM fit to the high-redshift SMBH data. Our analysis of the stellar mass-BH mass relation disfavours FDM fields with masses &amp;lt; 2.0× 10^-20 eV and WDM particles with masses &amp;lt; 7.2 keV, both at the 95 % confidence level.

We select a mass-complete sample of 225 quiescent galaxies at z&amp;gt;2 with M_* &amp;gt; 10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; from PRIMER and JADES photometry spanning a total area of ≃320 sq. arcmin. We restrict our analysis to only area with optical coverage in three HST ACS filters, and provide evidence that this is important for selecting the most complete and clean samples of z&amp;gt;2 massive quiescent galaxy candidates. We investigate the contamination in our sample via JWST NIRSpec spectroscopic validation, Chandra X-ray imaging, and ALMA interferometry, calculating a modest total contamination fraction of 12.9_-3.1^+4.0 per cent. The removal of HST data increases star-forming galaxy contamination by ≃10 per cent and results in a ≃20 per cent loss of candidates recovered from HST+JWST data combined. We calculate massive quiescent galaxy number densities at 2&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;5, finding values three times larger than pre-JWST estimates, but generally in agreement with more-recent and larger-area JWST studies. In comparison with galaxy evolution simulations, we find that most can now reproduce the observed massive quiescent galaxy number density at 2&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;3, however they still increasingly fall short at z&amp;gt;3, with discrepancies of up to ≃ 1 dex. We place 14 of our z&amp;gt;3 massive quiescent galaxies on the BPT and WHaN diagrams using medium-resolution spectroscopic data from the EXCELS survey. We find a very high incidence of faint AGN in our sample, at a level of ≃50 per cent, consistent with recent results at cosmic noon. This is interesting in the context of maintenance-mode feedback, which is invoked in many simulations to prevent quenched galaxies from re-igniting star formation. To properly characterise the evolution of early massive quiescent galaxies, greater coverage in optical filters and significantly larger spectroscopic samples will be required.

&lt;p&gt;
Asymmetric dark matter can be efficiently captured by neutron stars via elastic scattering with nucleons and dark matter self scattering. The accumulated dark matter thermalizes and concentrates in the stellar interior, forming a dark matter core. In this work, we propose a novel framework in which a \mathbbZ_3 symmetry allows for number-changing self-interactions of the form 3 arrow 2 within the dark sector. These cannibalistic reactions become increasingly efficient at high dark matter densities, leading to a significant depletion of the dark matter population in the stellar core. This number depletion heats up the neutron star above the standard cooling expectations, yielding observable thermal signatures in relatively old, isolated neutron stars, potentially detectable via James Webb Space Telescope. We show that even in the presence of other heating mechanisms, e.g. dark matter annihilation and kinetic heating, the cannibal heating dominates for certain parameter space. We demonstrate that the cannibal heating can predict detectable heating signatures in old neutron stars, thereby allowing a broader range of viable dark matter masses and couplings to the Standard Model.

Convolutional neural networks have shown their ability to differentiate between self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) and cold dark matter (CDM) on galaxy cluster scales. However, their large parameter counts and ''black-box'' nature make it difficult to assess whether their decisions adhere to physical principles. To address this issue, we have built a Convolutional Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CKAN) that reduces parameter count and enhances interpretability, and propose a novel analytical framework to understand the network's decision-making process. With this framework, we leverage our network to qualitatively assess the offset between the dark matter distribution center and the galaxy cluster center, as well as the size of heating regions in different models. These findings are consistent with current theoretical predictions and show the reliability and interpretability of our network. By combining network interpretability with unseen test results, we also estimate that for SIDM in galaxy clusters, the minimum cross-section (&amp;sigma;/m)_th required to reliably identify its collisional nature falls between 0.1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g and 0.3 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g. Moreover, CKAN maintains robust performance under simulated JWST and Euclid noise, highlighting its promise for application to forthcoming observational surveys.

We present the analysis of the stellar and interstellar medium (ISM) properties of MARTA-4327, a star-forming galaxy at z=2.224 observed by means of deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy in both medium- and high-resolution gratings as part of the "Measuring Abundances at high Redshift with the Te Approach" (MARTA) programme. We report one of the highest-redshift detections of the Wolf-Rayet (WR) blue and red bumps in a non-lensed system. The broad He ii&amp;lambda;4686 feature is consistent with a young (~ 5-6 Myr) burst dominated by WN stars, although both SSP models and empirical templates struggle to reproduce the nitrogen stellar features at ≈ 4640 A. Based on the relative strength of the available optical stellar features, we disfavor the presence of very massive stars (VMS) in this system. Elemental abundance ratios such as Ne/O, N/O, and Ar/O align with observations of local star-forming galaxies (including WR galaxies), suggesting that any impact of the WR population on the chemical enrichment of the ISM is strongly localized. However, the gas-phase Fe/O ratio appears enhanced compared to local galaxies of similar metallicity, which we interpret as evidence for reduced Fe depletion onto dust grains, possibly linked to localized destruction in WR-driven wind environments. In addition, we detect a broad and blueshifted (~70 km/s) H&amp;alpha; component, revealing the presence of an ionized outflow with a mass loading factor &amp;eta; ~ 0.2. Finally, we report the robust detection of O I&amp;lambda;8446 emission (among the first at high redshift), which we interpret as originating from Ly&amp;beta; fluorescence and/or collisional excitation in dense clumps. Overall, MARTA-4327 represents a unique system for studying the role of massive stars in shaping the ISM in galaxies at Cosmic Noon.

The nature of dark matter remains a central question in cosmology, with fuzzy dark matter (FDM) models offering a compelling alternative to the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. We explore FDM scenarios by performing 21-cm simulations across a parameter space with \texorpdfstringf_FDM \in [0.02, 0.10] f_FDM in [0.02, 0.10] and \texorpdfstringm_FDM \in [10^-24, 10^-21] eV m_FDM in [10^-24, 10^-21] eV, obtaining global neutral hydrogen fractions (\texorpdfstringx_HI x_HI) for each model. Observational \texorpdfstringx_HI x_HI data and associated uncertainties from JWST are incorporated by estimating full probability density functions (PDFs) for both \texorpdfstringx_HI x_HI and redshift \texorpdfstringz z using Bayesian inference with the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), yielding non-Gaussian multivariate uncertainty distributions. A hybrid machine learning framework is then trained on these observational PDFs to learn both central values and correlated uncertainties in \texorpdfstringx_HI x_HI and \texorpdfstringz z, iteratively refining its parameters in each training epoch through direct incorporation of the multivariate PDFs derived from observational constraints. We then compare the simulation outputs to the machine-learned observational trends to identify the most consistent models. Our results indicate that FDM models with \texorpdfstringm_FDM ≃ 10^-22 eV m_FDM approx 10^-22 eV and \texorpdfstringf_FDM ≃ 0.04 f_FDM approx 0.04 best match current data, while lighter masses are strongly constrained. By integrating simulations and machine learning in an uncertainty-aware framework, this work explores the physics of the early Universe and guides future studies of 21-cm cosmology and reionization.

The JWST has enabled the discovery of Active Galactic Nuclei at high redshifts. The intrinsic UV spectrum of GN-z11 at redshift z = 10.6 has a spectral slope compatible with a standard accretion disc. By fitting a disc model to its spectrum, we find that the mass of the black hole must be above 1.6e7 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; in order that it lies below the Eddington limit. We define this mass as the Eddington mass of the black hole. We note that the spectral shape is consistent with that of accreting stellar mass black holes sources in their soft state, for which no variability is expected. Mom-z14 is a more distant object at z = 14.44 and has a similar UV slope. Disc model-fitting gives a similar result but lower mass accretion rate. We also examine 3 further high redshift objects: GS z14-1, GHZ2 and GS-z11-1 at z = 13.86, 12.34 and 11.28, again obtaining similar results. If sub-Eddington accretion discs are indeed the origin of much of the UV emission from these objects, then the existence of massive black holes less than 440 and 290 Myr after the Big Bang point either to exceptional black hole seeds or to primordial black holes. The observed spread of UV spectral slopes in high redshift objects suggests that our approach may be relevant to about half of that population.

&lt;p&gt;
New populations of red active galactic nuclei (known as "Little Red Dots'') discovered by JWST exhibit remarkable spectral energy distributions. Leveraging X-ray through far-infrared observations of two of the most luminous known Little Red Dots, we directly their bolometric luminosities. We find evidence that more than half of the bolometric luminosity likely emerges in the rest-frame optical, with L_bol/L_5100 = 5, roughly half the value for "standard'' Active Galactic Nuclei. Meanwhile, the X-ray emitting corona, UV-emitting black-body, and reprocessed mid to far-infrared emission are all considerably sub-dominant, assuming that the far-infrared luminosity is well below current measured limits. We present new bolometric corrections that dramatically lower inferred bolometric luminosities by a factor of ten compared to published values in the literature. These bolometric corrections are in accord with expectations from models in which gas absorption and reprocessing are responsible for the red rest-frame optical colors of Little Red Dots. We discuss how this lowered luminosity scale suggests a lower mass scale for the population by at least an order of magnitude \bf (e.g., ~ 10^5-10^7~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; black holes, and ~ 10^8~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; galaxies), alleviating tensions with clustering, overmassive black holes, and the integrated black hole mass density in the Universe.

JWST has revealed a previously unknown population of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early Universe. These JWST-AGN at high redshifts are characterised by a set of peculiar properties, including unusually weak X-ray emission. Here we investigate the apparent lack of X-ray emission in the framework of the "AGN radiative dusty feedback'' scenario based on the effective Eddington limit for dust. We analyse how the boundary in the N_H - &amp;lambda; plane, defined by the column density versus the Eddington ratio, is modified as a function of the dusty gas parameters (metallicity, dust grain size and composition). Low metallicity gas with little dust content tends to survive against radiation pressure, and likely accumulates in the nuclear region. We suggest that such dust-poor gas can provide long-lived absorption and may lead to heavy X-ray obscuration, as observed in early JWST-AGN. The blowout vs. stalling condition of the obscuring clouds indicates that higher metallicities are required to eject heavier column densities, while large columns of gas can stall in low metallicity environments. Therefore the metallicity may play a key role in the AGN radiative dusty feedback scenario. We discuss how other peculiar properties of JWST-AGN &amp;ndash; such as Balmer absorption features and weak radio emission &amp;ndash; may be naturally interpreted within the same physical framework.

&lt;p&gt;
Ultra-violet (UV) radiation from accreting black holes ionizes the intergalactic gas around early quasars, carving out highly ionized bubbles in their surroundings. Any changes in a quasar's luminosity are therefore predicted to produce outward-propagating ionization gradients, affecting the Lyman-&amp;alpha; (Ly&amp;alpha;) absorption opacity near the quasar's systemic redshift. This "proximity effect" is well-documented in rest-UV quasar spectra but only provides a one-dimensional probe along our line-of-sight. Here we present deep spectroscopic observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) of galaxies in the background of a super-luminous quasar at z_QSO≈6.3, which reveal the quasar's "light echo" with Ly&amp;alpha; tomography in the transverse direction. This transverse proximity effect is detected for the first time towards multiple galaxy sightlines, allowing us to map the extent and geometry of the quasar's ionization cone. We obtain constraints on the orientation and inclination of the cone, as well as an upper limit on the obscured solid angle fraction of f_obsc&amp;lt;91&amp;percnt;. Additionally, we find a timescale of the quasar's UV radiation of t_QSO=10^5.6^+0.1_-0.3 years, which is significantly shorter than would be required to build up the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) with conventional growth models, but is consistent with independent measurements of the quasars' duty cycle. Our inferred obscured fraction disfavors a scenario where short quasar lifetimes can be explained exclusively by geometric obscuration, and instead supports the idea that radiatively inefficient accretion or growth in initially heavily enshrouded cocoons plays a pivotal role in early SMBH growth. Our results pave the way for novel studies of quasars' ionizing geometries and radiative histories at early cosmic times.

The Hydrogen-alpha (Ha) emission line in galaxies is a powerful tracer of their recent star formation activity. With the advent of JWST, we are now able to routinely observe Ha in galaxies at high redshifts (z &amp;gt; 3) and thus measure their star-formation rates (SFRs). However, using "classical" SFR(Ha) calibrations to derive the SFRs leads to biased results because high-redshift galaxies are commonly characterized by low metallicities and bursty star-formation histories, affecting the conversion factor between the Ha luminosity and the SFR. In this work, we develop a set of new SFR(Ha) calibrations that allow us to predict the SFRs of Ha-emitters at z &amp;gt; 3 with minimal error. We use the SPHINX cosmological simulations to select a sample of star-forming galaxies representative of the Ha-emitter population observed with JWST. We then derive linear corrections to the classical SFR(Ha) calibrations, taking into account variations in the physical properties (e.g., stellar metallicities) among individual galaxies. We obtain two new SFR(Ha) calibrations that, compared to the classical calibrations, reduce the root mean squared error (RMSE) in the predicted SFRs by &amp;Delta;RMSE ≈ 0.04 dex and &amp;Delta;RMSE ≈ 0.06 dex, respectively. Using the recent JWST NIRCam/grism observations of Ha-emitters at z ~ 6, we show that the new calibrations affect the high-redshift galaxy population statistics: (i) the estimated cosmic star-formation density decreases by &amp;Delta;&amp;rho;(SFR) ≈ 12%, and (ii) the observed slope of the star-formation main sequence increases by &amp;Delta; \partiallog SFR / \partiallog M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.08 ± 0.02.

&lt;p&gt;
Young (≲ 10 Myr) planetary-mass companions (PMCs) provide valuable insights into the formation and early evolution of planetary systems. To date, only a dozen such objects have been identified through direct imaging. Using JWST/NIRCam observations towards the Orion Nebula, obtained as part of the itPDRs4All Early Release Science program, we have identified a faint point source near the M-type star V2376 Ori. Follow-up spectroscopic observations with the MUSE instrument on the VLT confirm that the source, V2376 Ori b, is indeed a young planetary-mass companion. It is a member of Orion D, around 80 pc in the foreground of the Trapezium cluster of Orion and with an age of approximately 7 ± 3 Myr. We fit the SED of V2376 Ori b to infer a mass of ~ 20~M_Jup. The MUSE spectrum reveals several accretion tracers. Based on the H&amp;alpha; line intensity, we estimate an accretion rate of ~10^-6.5 ± 0.7~M_Jup yr^-1, which is comparable to that of young PMCs such as PDS~70b. In addition, the MUSE data cube reveals extended emission in the [O scii] doublet at 7320 and 7330~&amp;#8491;, which is interpreted as evidence of a dynamical interaction between the two sources that, potentially, involves mass transfer between their individual accretion disks. These results demonstrate that JWST/NIRCam imaging surveys of young stellar associations can uncover new PMCs, which can then be confirmed and characterized through ground-based spectroscopic follow-up.

We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) and Mid-infrared Instrument (MIRI) integral-field spectroscopy of the nearby blue compact dwarf II Zw 40, which has a low metallicity of 25% of solar. Leveraging the high spatial/spectral resolution and wavelength coverage of JWST/NIRSpec, we present robust detections of the 3.3 um polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission on 20 pc scales. The strength of the Pf delta emission relative to the 3.3 PAH feature is significantly stronger than typical higher metallicity star-forming galaxies. We find that 3.3 um PAH emission is concentrated near the northern super star cluster and is co-spatial with CO gas. A strong correlation exists between the 3.3/11.3 PAH ratio and radiation hardness probed by NeIII/NeII, providing evidence of photodestruction of PAH molecules in intense radiation environments. Our analysis shows that while the overall PAH fraction is lower in II Zw 40 than in higher metallicity galaxies, the contribution of the 3.3 um PAH feature to the total PAH emission is higher. We propose that the PAH size distribution is fundamentally shaped by two competing mechanisms in low-metallicity environments: photo-destruction and inhibited growth. Additionally, the high radiation field intensity in II Zw 40 suggests that multi-photon heating of PAHs may be an important effect. As one of the first spatially resolved studies of aromatic emission in a low-metallicity environment, our spectroscopic results offer practical guidance for future observations of the 3.3 um PAH feature in low-metallicity galaxies using JWST.

We report the discovery and characterization of a wide binary population in the ultrafaint dwarf galaxy Bo\"otes I using deep JWST/NIRCam imaging. Our sample consists of 52 candidate binaries with projected separations of 7,000 - 16,000 au and stellar masses from near the hydrogen-burning limit to the main-sequence turnoff (~0.1 - 0.8~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;). By forward-modeling selection biases and chance alignments, we find that 1.25±0.25&amp;percnt; of Bo\"otes I stars are members of wide binaries with separations beyond 5,000 au. This fraction, along with the distributions of separations and mass ratios, matches that in the Solar neighborhood, suggesting that wide binary formation is largely insensitive to metallicity, even down to [Fe/H] ≈ -2.5. The observed truncation in the separation distribution near 16,000 au is well explained by stellar flyby disruptions. We also discuss how the binaries can be used to constrain the galaxy's dark matter properties. We show that our detection places new limits on primordial black hole dark matter, finding that compact objects with M ≳ 5~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; cannot constitute more than ~1&amp;percnt; of the dark matter content. In contrast to previous work, we find that wide binaries are unlikely to provide robust constraints on the dark matter profile of ultrafaint galaxies given the uncertainties in the initial binary population, flyby disruptions, and contamination from chance alignments. These findings represent the most robust detection of wide binaries in an external galaxy to date, opening a new avenue for studying binary star formation and survival in extreme environments.

Current observations taken by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allow us to observe the absorption features of icy mantles that cover interstellar dust grains, which are mainly composed of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, CO, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, along with other minor species. Thanks to its sensitivity and spectral resolution, JWST has the potential to observe ice features towards hundreds of sources at different stages along the process of star formation. However, identifying the spectral features of the different species and quantifying the ice composition is not trivial and requires complex spectroscopic analysis. We present Automatic Ice Composition Estimator (AICE), a new tool based on artificial neural networks. Based on the infrared (IR) ice absorption spectrum between 2.5 and 10 microns, AICE predicts the ice fractional composition in terms of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, CO, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CH_3OH, NH_3, and CH_4. To train the model, we used hundreds of laboratory experiments of ice mixtures from different databases, which were reprocessed with baseline subtraction and normalisation. Once trained, AICE takes less than one second on a conventional computer to predict the ice composition associated with the observed IR absorption spectrum, with typical errors of ~3 &amp;percnt; in the species fraction. We tested its performance on two spectra reported towards the NIR38 and J110621 background stars observed within the JWST Ice Age program, demonstrating a good agreement with previous estimations of the ice composition. The fast and accurate performance of AICE enables the systematic analysis of hundreds of different ice spectra with a modest time investment. In addition, this model can be enhanced and re-trained with more laboratory data, improving the precision of the predictions and expanding the list of predicted species.

The recent observations of highly accreting supermassive black holes (SMBH) at very high redshift (&amp;gt;4) with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allowed us to shed light for the very first time on the early evolutionary phases of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Perhaps unsurprisingly, several of the physical properties observed in these new objects, including those known as little red dots (LRDs), are closely reminiscent of the low-mass and high-Eddington AGN in the local Universe, and in particular of the class of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies. However, some differences also emerged, likely due to the radically different evolutionary path and the environment where LRDs and NLS1s live. In this work, we review the multiwavelength properties of local NLS1s and compare them with type 1 AGN found at high-z, showing that despite some differences, the study of NLS1s can be extremely useful to better understand the extreme accretion physics of high-z quasars and the early stages of AGN evolution.

&lt;p&gt;
Little red dots (LRDs), high-redshift, compact, red objects with V-shaped spectra, are one of the most exciting and perplexing discoveries made by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). While the simplest explanation for LRDs is that they are high redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN), due to their compactness and frequent association with broad line emission, the lack of corresponding X-ray emission and observed variability cast doubt on this picture. Here, we simulate LRD light curves using both traditional models for sub-Eddington AGN variability derived empirically from lower-redshift AGN observations and moderately super-Eddington AGN disk models from radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations to examine the reason for the lack of variability. We find that even though most LRDs have only been observed 2&amp;ndash;4 times in a given waveband, we should still be detecting significantly more variability if traditional sub-Eddington AGN variability models can be applied to LRDs. Instead, our super-Eddington model light curves are consistent with the lack of observed LRD variability. In addition, the ongoing high-cadence \sc nexus campaign will detect changes in magnitude, &amp;Delta; m&amp;gt;1, for traditional sub-Eddington models, but will only observe significant continuum variability for the lowest mass LRDs for our super-Eddington AGN models. Even if LRDs lack continuum variability, we find that the ongoing spectroscopic JWST campaign \sc twinkle should observe broad emission line variability as long as soft X-ray irradiation manages to reach the broad line region from the inner disk. Our models show that super-Eddington accretion can easily explain the lack of continuum variability in LRDs.

&lt;p&gt;
The real nature of little red dots (LRDs), a class of very compact galaxies in the early Universe recently discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope, is still poorly understood. The most popular theories competing to interpret the phenomena include active galactic nuclei and enhanced star formation in dusty galaxies. To date, however, neither model gives a completely satisfactory explanation to the population as a whole; thus, alternative theories have arisen, including tidal disruption events (TDEs). By considering observational constraints on the radio emission of LRDs, we discuss whether TDEs are adequate alternatives solving these high-redshift enigmas. We utilise radio flux density upper limits from LRD stacking analyses, TDE peak radio luminosities, and volumetric density estimates. We find that the characteristic values of flux densities and luminosities allow radio-quiet TDEs as the underlying process of LRDs in any case, while the less common radio-loud TDEs are compatible with the model under special constraints only. Considering other factors, such as volumetric density estimates, delayed and long-term radio flares of TDEs, and cosmological time dilation, TDEs appear to be a plausible explanation for LRDs from the radio point of view.

We present a theoretical framework for seeding and growing supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in dark matter halos along their assembly histories. Seeds are bred out of Pop-III stars formed during the first collapse of pristine gas in mini-halos that have reached the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-cooling limit, modulated by UV radiation from star formation and dynamical heating from fast halo assembly. Such breeding persists until the enrichment of the intergalactic medium (IGM) enables Pop-II stars to form. Post-seeding growth of black holes (BHs) is driven by distinct channels, starting with episodic super-Eddington accretion associated with nuclear bursts induced by global disturbances of galaxies, followed by sustained sub-Eddington accretion via capturing sub-clouds formed in self-gravitating gas clouds (SGCs) in halos of fast assembly, and ending with merger-dominated, quiescent growth. We implement the model in subhalo merger trees to build a coherent framework to follow the SMBH-galaxy-halo co-evolution over their full lives in the full structure hierarchy. BH seeds are bred with a broad mass spectrum of M_BH = 10&amp;ndash;10^5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; at z ≈ 20&amp;ndash;30 in mini-halos with masses of 10^5&amp;ndash;10^8 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. Nuclear bursts provide the key condition for seeds to grow into SMBHs. The M_BH-M_* relation is a multi-piece, redshift-dependent function shaped by the interplay among different growth channels. Our model predictions are broadly consistent with existing observations; especially, a population of BHs reminiscent of 'little red dots' (LRDs) discovered by JWST naturally results from the seeding and growing processes. Potential future tests of the model are discussed.

Recently James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have observed an excess of luminous galaxies at high redshifts (z ≳ 10). In this work, we investigate whether supermassive primordial black holes (SMPBHs) can explain it by their influence on the ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) of high-redshift galaxies. Through Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, we constrain the parameters relevant with SMPBHs against current JWST observational data. The results reveal that SMPBHs with masses M_PBH ~ 10^6.3-8.3 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, abundances f_PBH ~ 10^-7 -10^-5, and sub-Eddington ratios &amp;lambda;_E \ll 1 can effectively enhance the bright end of the UV LF, consistent with JWST observations.

Accurately distinguishing between quiescent and star-forming galaxies is essential for understanding galaxy evolution. Traditional methods, such as spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, can be computationally expensive and may struggle to capture complex galaxy properties. This study aims to develop a robust and efficient machine learning (ML) classification method to identify quiescent and star-forming galaxies within the Farmer COSMOS2020 catalog. We utilized JWST wide-field light cones from the Santa Cruz semi-analytical modeling framework to train a supervised ML model, the CatBoostClassifier, using 28 color features derived from 8 mutual photometric bands within the COSMOS catalog. The model was validated against a testing set and compared to the SED-fitting method in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, and execution time. Preprocessing steps included addressing missing data, injecting observational noise, and applying a magnitude cut (ch1 &amp;lt; 26 AB) along with a redshift range of 0.2 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 3.5 to align the simulated and observational datasets. The ML method achieved an F1-score of 89&amp;percnt; for quiescent galaxies, significantly outperforming the SED-fitting method, which achieved 54%. The ML model demonstrated superior recall (88% vs. 38%) while maintaining comparable precision. When applied to the COSMOS2020 catalog, the ML model predicted a systematically higher fraction of quiescent galaxies across all redshift bins within 0.2 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 3.5 compared to traditional methods like NUVrJ and SED-fitting. This study shows that ML, combined with multi-wavelength data, can effectively identify quiescent and star-forming galaxies, providing valuable insights into galaxy evolution. The trained classifier and full classification catalog are publicly available.

&lt;p&gt;
We propose that galaxy structural changes - and the rapid rise of a population of galaxies with early-type morphologies at cosmic noon (1&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;3) - can be explained with EASE: Early, Accelerated, Secular Evolution. The mechanism relies on the torques exerted by stellar spirals in late-type galaxies that are present and active at z&amp;gt;1.5 as revealed by JWST/NIRCam. The process is at once secular, because the transformative structural changes (heating, compaction, bulge formation) occur over many (≈10-30) orbital periods, but accelerated, because orbital times were significantly shorter than at the present day. In a first application, we take galaxy effective radius as a proxy for galaxy structure and, using new measurements of the abundance and properties of stellar spirals observed in a collection of JWST deep fields, show that EASE predicts a distribution of early-type sizes that is smaller than late-type galaxies and consistent with what is observed. The success of EASE relies on an updated picture of the influence of spiral arms, in which transience plays a key role. We present a new calculation of the characteristic wave equation in the fluid approximation that applies to steady and non-steady open spirals beyond the more traditional tight-winding limit. This shows open, transient spirals above the Jeans length growing and decaying on the order of a dynamical time in a wider region around and inside corotation than canonical steady spirals. We show that this transient activity spreads out angular momentum gains and losses, and the associated dynamical heating, giving spirals a more extended influence than a single steady spiral. The ubiquity of spirals in star-forming galaxies with M_*&amp;gt;10^10.5M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; across the redshifts where early-type galaxies appear in large numbers suggests that EASE can play an important role in the morphological transformation of galaxies.

&lt;p&gt;
Some massive, quiescent galaxies at z&amp;gt;3 appear to contain considerable numbers of old stars (forming at z&amp;gt;7). Works inferring the star formation histories of at least one such galaxy observed with JWST have suggested that the assembly of so much stellar mass so early may challenge the well-established Cold Dark Matter (CDM) cosmological framework, or else indicate extraordinarily high past star formation efficiencies. However, these studies implicitly assume that all the stars in place at the epoch of observation assembled in-situ, i.e. in a single galaxy. In hierarchical models like CDM, massive galaxies assemble following successive mergers of smaller galaxies. Thus, inferences of the growth of stellar mass using the ages of stars within a descendant massive galaxy will be biased. In this paper, I use the TNG100 simulation to quantify this bias across a range of descendant galaxy masses and redshifts, for inferences made for different past epochs. I demonstrate that the assumption of in-situ stellar mass assembly can lead to significant biases in inferred stellar mass histories, with historic (i.e. looking back from the epoch of observation) stellar masses overestimated by over an order of magnitude in some cases. The bias increases with increasing halo mass, for inferences made further from the epoch of observation, and with decreasing descendant galaxy redshift. I derive corrections that can be applied to inferred stellar mass histories for more robust comparisons with dark matter halo mass functions at high redshift.

We present JWST/MIRI spectra from the Medium-Resolution Spectrometer of IZw18, a nearby dwarf galaxy with a metallicity of ~ 3% Solar. Here, we investigate warm molecular hydrogen, H2, observed in spectra extracted in ~ 120 pc apertures centered on eleven regions of interest. We detect 7 H2 rotational lines, some of which are among the weakest ever measured. The H2 population diagrams are fit with local-thermodynamic-equilibrium models and models of photodissociation regions. We also fit the ortho-/para-H2 ratios (OPRs); in three of the six regions for which it was possible to fit the OPR, we find values significantly greater than 3, the maximum value for local thermodynamic equilibrium. To our knowledge, although predicted theoretically, this is the first time that OPR significantly &amp;gt; 3 has been measured in interstellar gas. We find that OPR tends to increase with decreasing H2 column density, consistent with the expected effects of self-shielding in advancing photodissociation fronts. The population diagrams are consistent with H nucleon densities of ~ 10^5 cm^-3, and an interstellar radiation field scaling factor, G0, of ~ 10^3. This warm, dense H2 gas co-exists with the same highly ionized gas that emits [OIV] and [NeV]. Emission from T ≥ 50K dust is detected, including an as-yet unidentified dust emission feature near 14 &amp;mu;m; possible identification as Al_2O_3 is discussed. The continuum emission from several regions requires that a considerable fraction of the refractory elements be incorporated in dust. Despite stacking spectra in the SE where H2 is found, no significant emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is detected.

&lt;p&gt;
One of the most surprising results of early James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations is the discovery of an abundance of red, compact, broad-line objects dubbed "little red dots" (LRDs) at z&amp;gt;4. Their spatial density (~10^-4-10^-5 cMpc^-3) is 100 times more abundant than UV-selected quasars at those redshift if one extrapolates the quasar luminosity function (QLF) down to the LRD regime. However, whether LRDs dominate black hole accretion at quasar-like luminosities (L_bol≳ 10^45-46 erg s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) remains unanswered, as probing the bright end of the LRD luminosity function requires a much larger area than those able to be surveyed by JWST. In this work, we present our search for the brightest LRDs (K&amp;lt;23.7) at 4.5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;4.9 using wide-area multiwavelength imaging surveys from the near-UV to the infrared bands. With over 15 square degrees of sky coverage, we only identify one single LRD candidate at z&lt;sub&gt;phot&lt;/sub&gt;≈4.6, which translates into a spatial density of n(M_5100&amp;lt;-23.5)≈10^-8 cMpc^-3 &amp;ndash; this is nearly 10 times less abundant than the UV-selected quasars at similar optical luminosity. When combined with the LRD sample identified by JWST at the same redshift range, we find a sharp cutoff in the optical luminosity function at &amp;lambda; L_5100≈2.5×10^44 erg s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, while the QLF turnover occurs at ≳20 times higher luminosity. We therefore confirm the exclusively low-luminosity nature of LRDs, ruling out that LRDs are the counter parts of quasars. Furthermore, we speculate that, if the shape of the luminosity function holds up, it points to LRDs being powered by low-mass black holes with a narrow range of Eddington-level accretion rates.

&lt;p&gt;
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a previously unknown population of compact, red galaxies at z ~ 5, known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). With effective radii of ~ 100 pc and stellar masses of 10^9-10^11   M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, a purely stellar interpretation implies extreme central densities, &amp;rho;&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;~10^4-10^5   M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;   pc^-3 and in some cases up to ~ 10^9   M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;   pc^-3, far exceeding those of globular clusters. At such densities, the dynamical friction time for 10   M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; stars in the central 0.1 pc is &amp;lt; 0.1 Myr, driving rapid mass segregation. We investigate the dynamical consequences of such an environment using: (i) a Fokker-Planck analysis of long-term core evolution, (ii) an analytical model for the collisional growth of a very massive star (VMS), and (iii) direct N-body simulations. All approaches show that runaway collisions produce a VMS with mass 9×10^3 &amp;lt; M_VMS   [M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;] &amp;lt; 5×10^4 within &amp;lt;1 Myr. Once the supply of massive stars is depleted, the VMS contracts on a ~ 8000 yr Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale and undergoes a general relativistic collapse, leaving a massive black hole of mass M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 10^4   M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. We conclude that LRDs are natural nurseries for the formation of heavy black hole seeds via stellar-dynamical processes. This pathway produces seed number densities that far exceed those expected from direct collapse models, and, owing to the dense residual stellar core, can sustain high rates of tidal disruption events.

Mass loss is a key physical process in the evolution of massive stars, the impact of which propagates into galactic evolution, population synthesis models, the interpretation of high-redshift galaxies, and explosive events such as supernovae. However, there are currently substantial uncertainties in the low-metallicity, low-luminosity thin wind regime where classical diagnostics (H-alpha and ultraviolet, UV, P Cygni profiles) yield wind momenta that are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude below prescriptions implemented by default in most evolutionary models. Here, we present spectra of the mass-loss diagnostic line Br-alpha in 15 OB-type stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud obtained using the Near Infrared Spectrograph on the James Webb Space Telescope. The line profile morphology, recovered by virtue of the outstanding signal-to-noise ratio of the data and the avoidance of regions with nebular emission, is consistent with predictions based on previous mass-loss rate estimates from optical and UV spectroscopy. Moreover, an initial spectroscopic analysis of sources covering the thin wind regime confirms the low mass-loss rates, indicates a change of slope in the wind-momentum-luminosity relation in this regime with respect to high-luminosity objects, and strengthens the abovementioned discrepancies with commonly used wind-momentum prescriptions.

&lt;p&gt;
The James Webb Space Telescope's (JWST) discovery of an unexpectedly high abundance of UV-bright galaxies at redshifts z &amp;gt; 10 poses a significant challenge to the standard &amp;Lambda;CDM cosmology. This work tests whether this tension can be resolved solely by modifying the cosmological background, without invoking significant evolution in the astrophysical properties of early galaxies. We investigate an alternative framework featuring the presence of an anti-de Sitter vacuum in the dark energy sector, a model that naturally arises in quantum gravity models like string theory and can enhance early structure formation. Using a self-consistent semi-analytical model that couples galaxy evolution with reionization, we confront this scenario with a wide range of observations. We first show that while a model tailored to fit the high-z UV luminosity functions (UVLFs) shows promise, it is in strong tension with well-established cosmological constraints from the CMB and other low-redshift probes. Conversely, models within this framework that are consistent with these constraints provide only a modest boost to structure formation and fail to reproduce the observed JWST galaxy abundances at z &amp;gt; 10. While these models remain consistent with the cosmic reionization history, our primary result is that this class of cosmological modifications is insufficient on its own to explain the galaxy excess. Our study underscores the critical importance of holistic testing for any beyond-&amp;Lambda;CDM proposal; apparent success in one observational regime does not guarantee overall viability. By demonstrating the limitations of a purely cosmological solution, our results strengthen the case that evolving astrophysical properties are a necessary ingredient for solving the challenge of early galaxy formation.

We present a systematic search for broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST sample of 18 star-forming galaxies (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;10^9.5~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) at redshifts z=4.4-5.7. Using JWST/NIRSpec IFU, we identify 7 AGN candidates through the detection of broad \Ha emission lines from 33 aperture spectra centred on photometric peaks. These candidates include one highly robust AGN detection with FWHM ~ 2800 \kms and six showing broad components with FWHM ~ 600-1600 \kms, with two in a merger system. We highlight that only broad-line detection is effective since these candidates uniformly lie within narrow emission-line ratio diagnostic diagrams where star-forming galaxies and AGNs overlap. The broad-line AGN fraction ranges from 5.9&amp;percnt; to 33&amp;percnt;, depending on the robustness of the candidates. Assuming that the majority are AGNs, the relatively high AGN fraction is likely due to targeting high-mass galaxies, where simulations demonstrate that broad-line detection is more feasible. Their black hole masses range from 10^6 to 10^7.5~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; with 0.1 ≲ L_bol/L_Edd≲ 1. Counter to previous JWST studies at high redshift that found overmassive black holes relative to their host galaxies, our candidates lie close to or below the local M_BH-M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; scaling relations, thus demonstrating the effect of selection biases. This study provides new insights into AGN-host galaxy co-evolution at high redshift by identifying faint broad-line AGNs in galaxy samples, highlighting the importance of considering mass-dependent selection biases and the likelihood of a large population of AGNs being undermassive and just now being tapped by JWST.

One of the main open issues in galaxy formation and evolution is the early assembly of the most massive galaxies and their contribution to the stellar mass and star formation rate densities at early epochs. Massive red sources already in place at z &amp;gt; 2 to 3 have been found in deep Spitzer-IRAC and ALMA surveys. They are often called optically and near-IR dark, or HST-dark, being undetected even in the deepest HST frames. The submillimeter (i.e., ALMA) detection of these sources confirms their high-z dusty nature: they are massive (e.g., log(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;gt; 10) and dusty star-forming galaxies with estimated redshifts in the 2.5 to 7 range. They seem to lie mostly below the main sequence (MS) of star-forming galaxies and show gas depletion times &amp;lt;1 Gyr. Imaging with the PRIMA/PRIMAger instrument over the full 25 to 265 micron range will allow us to characterize their still uncovered spectral energy distributions between JWST and ALMA spectral windows, probing their dust content and properties (e.g., temperature, mass), whereas spectroscopic observations with FIRESS will be the key to investigate the nature of their powering source (e.g., AGN or star formation) and to study the physics of their ISM, by detecting and measuring fine structure lines in the mid- and far-IR domain.

The UV-optical dust attenuation curve is key to interpreting the intrinsic properties of galaxies and provides insights into the nature of dust grains and their geometry relative to stars. In this work, we constrain the UV-optical slope of the stellar attenuation curve using a spectroscopic-redshift sample of ~3300 galaxies at z~1-9, to characterize the diversity and redshift evolution of stellar attenuation curves and to gain insight into dust production and evolution at high redshifts. The sample is constructed from three JWST/NIRCam grism surveys in GOODS and A2744 fields, with a wealth of JWST/NIRCam and HST photometry. With constraints from spectroscopic redshifts and emission line fluxes, we use the Prospector SED fitting code with a flexible dust model. We find that the attenuation curve slope varies strongly with Av at all redshifts, becoming flatter at higher attenuation. We find no strong correlation between attenuation curve slope and size or axis ratio, and the trends with stellar mass and star-formation rate are largely driven by their correlation with Av. We find strong evidence that at fixed Av, the curve becomes flatter with increasing redshift. On average, the attenuation curves derived here are shallower than those at z~0 and than the SMC curve. The highest redshift galaxies at z=7-9 (124 galaxies, a significantly larger sample than in previous studies) show slopes even flatter than the Calzetti curve, implying reduced UV obscuration and lower IR luminosities than expected from an SMC dust curve, by as large as an order of magnitude. Hydrodynamical simulations that couple dust growth to gas chemical enrichment successfully reproduce the different loci of high- and low-redshift galaxies in the slope-Av diagram, suggesting that dust in high-redshift galaxies is increasingly dominated by large grains produced in supernova ejecta with limited ISM processing at early times.

We present new JWST/NIRCam observations of the interacting dwarf galaxy system NGC 4485/NGC 4490 (a.k.a. Arp 269), obtained as part of the Cycle 1 Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic Star clusTers (FEAST) program. NGC 4485 and NGC 4490 form the closest known pair of interacting late-type dwarf galaxies (at ~ 7.4 Mpc), excluding the Magellanic Clouds. Near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) reveal a wide range of stellar populations in both galaxies, including young (≲ 200 Myr) upper main sequence stars, core helium-burning stars, and oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We also identify intermediate-age (~ 200 Myr &amp;ndash; 1 Gyr) carbon-rich AGB stars and a well-populated old (≳ 1 Gyr) red giant branch (RGB). The CMDs show two distinct bursts of star formation beginning ~ 30 Myr and ~ 200 Myr ago, the latter consistent with the most recent pericenter passage predicted by N-body simulations. The spatial distribution of stars reveals a tidal bridge extending from NGC 4485 and connecting to the disk of NGC 4490. Compact star-forming regions are seen along NGC 4490's spiral arms, possibly originating from its infrared nucleus. A significant metallicity gradient is observed in the young stellar populations forming the bridge. These findings suggest that during the last pericenter passage, gas was stripped from NGC 4485 via tidal forces or ram pressure, accreted by NGC 4490, and mixed with in-situ material, fueling ongoing star formation. This system provides a unique nearby laboratory for studying how tidal interactions shape the star formation and chemical enrichment history of dwarf galaxies.

The cosmic evolution of obscured star formation, dust properties and production mechanisms, and the prevalence of dust-obscured AGN out to high redshifts are currently some of the hot topics in astrophysics. While much progress has been made in the early days with Spitzer and Herschel, these facilities have not reached the necessary depths to observe the mid-IR light of high-redshift (z &amp;gt; 3) galaxies. Recently, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has filled in the blue side of the rest-frame mid-IR. The Atacama Large (Sub)Millimeter Array (ALMA), on the other hand, provides excellent sensitivity in the far-IR regime, allowing the study of dust and gas properties at high redshifts. Filling the wavelength gap between JWST and ALMA is crucial to progress our understanding of early galaxy evolution - and this will be an important goal in the next decades. The Probe far-IR Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA), with sensitive imaging and spectroscopic capabilities at 24-240&amp;mu;m and currently in Phase A study, will achieve this and provide insights into early galaxy evolution, Black Hole growth, and dust production mechanisms. Here we present PRIDES, a possible deep and wide-area survey over 1.6 square-degrees of the COSMOS field with PRIMA to study these science cases.

&lt;p&gt;
We present a combined HST and JWST 0.2 - to - 5 &amp;mu;m analysis of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of emerging young star clusters (eYSCs) in four nearby galaxies from the Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic Star clusTers (FEAST) survey: M51, M83, NGC 628, and NGC 4449. These clusters, selected for their bright Pa&amp;alpha; and 3.3 &amp;mu;m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission, are still associated to their natal gas cloud and have been largely missed in previous HST optical campaigns. We modeled their SEDs using the CIGALE fitting code and identified: i) a systematic flux excess at 1.5 - 2.5 &amp;mu;m that is not accounted for by current stellar population models; ii) the preference for a set of dust model parameters that is not aligned with expectations from self-consistent analyses of star-forming regions, suggesting model shortcomings also in the 3 - 5 &amp;mu;m. The near-infrared (NIR) excess is most prominent in low-mass (≤ 3000 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) and young (≤ 6 Myr) clusters. Additionally, we see that the SED fitting analysis wrongly assigns ages ≥ 6 Myr to a fraction of strong Pa&amp;alpha; emitters with equivalent widths suggestive of significantly younger ages. A parallel analysis with the slug code suggests that stochastic initial mass function (IMF) sampling of pre-main-sequence stars combined with extinction might partially reduce the gap. We conclude that the inclusion of young stellar object SEDs, along with more realistic sampling of the cluster IMF, might be needed to fully account for the stellar population and dust properties of eYSCs.

&lt;p&gt;
Cycle 1 JWST observations of Cepheids in SN Ia hosts resolved their red-giant-dominated NIR backgrounds, sharply reducing crowding and showing that photometric bias in lower-resolution HST data does not account for the Hubble tension. We present Cycle 2 JWST observations of &amp;gt;100 Cepheids in NGC 3447, a unique system that pushes this test to the limit by transitioning from low to no background contamination. NGC 3447, an SN Ia host at D~25 Mpc, is an interacting pair comprising (i) a spiral with mixed stellar populations, typical of H0 calibrators, and (ii) a young, star-forming companion (NGC 3447A) devoid of old stars and hence stellar crowdinga rare "perfect host" for testing photometric bias. We detect ~60 long-period Cepheids in each, enabling a "three-way comparison" across HST, JWST, and background-free conditions. We find no component-to-component offset (sigma&amp;lt;0.03 mag; a calibration independent test), and a 50% reduction in scatter to ~0.12 mag in the background-free case, the tightest seen for any SN Ia host. Across Cycles 1-2 we also measure Cepheids in all SH0ES hosts observed by JWST (19 hosts of 24 SNe Ia; &amp;gt;50% of the sample) and find no evidence of bias relative to HST photometry, including for the most crowded, distant hosts. These observations constitute the most rigorous test yet of Cepheid distances and provide strong evidence for their reliability. Combining JWST Cepheid measurements in 19 hosts (24 SNe Ia) with HST data (37 hosts, 42 SNe Ia) yields H0 = 73.49 +/- 0.93 km/s/Mpc. Including 35 TRGB-based calibrations (from HST and JWST) totals 55 SNe Ia and gives H0 = 73.18 +/- 0.88 km/s/Mpc, ~6 sigma above the LambdaCDM+CMB expectation.

JWST has uncovered a diverse population of extreme near-infrared dropouts, including ultra high-redshift (z&amp;gt;15) galaxy candidates, dust-obscured galaxies challenging dust production theories, sources with strong Balmer breaks - possibly compact AGN in dense environments - and cold, sub-stellar Galactic objects. This work presents Capotauro, a F356W-dropout in the CEERS survey with F444W AB magnitude of ~27.68 and a sharp &amp;gt;3 mag flux drop between 3.5-4.5 &amp;mu;m, undetected below 3.5 &amp;mu;m. We combine JWST/NIRCam, MIRI, and NIRSpec/MSA data with HST/ACS and WFC3 observations to perform a spectro-photometric analysis of Capotauro using multiple SED-fitting codes. Our setup tests z≥15 as well as z&amp;lt;10 dusty, Balmer-break or strong-line galaxy solutions, and the possibility of Capotauro being a Milky Way sub-stellar object. Among extragalactic options, our analysis favors interpreting the sharp drop as a Lyman break at z~32, consistent with the epoch of formation of the first stars and black holes, with only ~0.5&amp;percnt; of the posterior volume at z&amp;lt;25. Lower-redshift solutions struggle to reproduce the extreme break, suggesting that if Capotauro lies at z&amp;lt;10, it must show a non-standard combination of strong dust attenuation and/or Balmer breaks, making it a peculiar interloper. Alternatively, its properties match a very cold (Y2-Y3 type) brown dwarf or a free-floating exoplanet with a record-breaking combination of low temperature and large distance (T_eff&amp;lt;300 K, d≳130 pc, up to ~2 kpc). While current data cannot determine its nature, Capotauro emerges as a remarkably unique object in all plausible scenarios, and a compelling target for follow-up.

&lt;p&gt;
We present a catalogue of dense cores identified in James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) Gould Belt Survey SCUBA-2 observations of nearby star-forming clouds. We identified 2257 dense cores using the getsources algorithm, of which 59% are starless, and 41% are potentially protostellar. 71% of the starless cores are prestellar core candidates, suggesting a prestellar core lifetime similar to that of Class 0/I YSOs. Higher-mass clouds have a higher fraction of prestellar cores compared to protostars, suggesting a longer average prestellar core lifetime. We assessed completeness by inserting critically-stable Bonnor&amp;ndash;Ebert spheres into a blank SCUBA-2 field: completeness scales as distance squared, with an average mass recovery fraction of 73±6% for recovered sources. We calculated core masses and radii, and assessed their gravitational stability using the Bonnor-Ebert criterion. Maximum starless core mass scales with cloud complex mass with an index 0.58± 0.13, consistent with the behaviour of maximum stellar masses in embedded clusters. We performed least-squares and Monte Carlo modelling of the core mass functions (CMFs) of our starless and prestellar core samples. The CMFs can be characterised using log-normal distributions: we do not sample the full range of core masses needed to create the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF). The CMFs of the clouds are not consistent with being drawn from a single underlying distribution. The peak mass of the starless core CMF increases with cloud mass; the prestellar CMF of the more distant clouds has a peak mass ~ 3× the log-normal peak for the system IMF, implying a ~ 33% prestellar core-to-star efficiency.

Although the majority of star-forming galaxies show a tight correlation between stellar mass and dust extinction, recent James Webb Space Telescope observations have revealed a peculiar population of Highly Extincted Low-Mass (HELM) galaxies, which could revolutionise our understanding of dust production mechanisms. To fully understand the dust content of these galaxies, which are a minority of the overall galaxy population, far-infrared observations over large areas are pivotal. In this paper, we derive the expected PRIMAger, the far-IR (24-235&amp;mu; m) imaging camera proposed for the Probe far-IR Mission for Astrophysics, fluxes for a set of photometric candidates HELM galaxies. Taking into account a deep survey of 1000h over 1  deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, we expect to detect around 3.1 × 10^4 HELM sources in at least one PRIMAger filter, 100 of which are at z=1-1.5. For 32% of this sample, there will be observations in at least four PRIMAger filters, covering at least the 90 to 240&amp;mu; m wavelength range, which will allow us to obtain a detailed fit of the dust emission and estimate the dust mass.

&lt;p&gt;
Abridged. HE 1327-2326 (HE 1327), with [Fe/H]=-5.2, is one of the most metal-poor stars detected and a candidate to be the offspring of the first stars. Numerous efforts have been made to match its abundance pattern. However, no model satisfactorily explains its entire surface chemical composition. The high CNO pattern with [N/Fe]&amp;gt;[C/Fe]&amp;gt;[O/Fe], the light element 'slide' (between Na and Si), and the presence of Sr and Ba in HE 1327 is reminiscent of those asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars that undergo third dredge-up, hot bottom burning, and s-processing, suggesting that AGBs may have been progenitors of the star. We assume that, where HE 1327 formed, the interstellar medium was well-mixed, and adopt an initial stellar composition based on the observed chemical evolution of the early universe. We calculated models of hyper-metal-poor AGB stars and compared their yields to the observed abundances of HE 1327. Our 3 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; models match 13 of the 14 measured elements in HE1327. They are also consistent with the seven elements with upper limits. The only discrepancy is O, underproduced by 0.5-1.0 dex. Unlike the SN models, the AGB models also match Sr and Ba. Our model predicts high abundances of P and Pb, which would be useful in testing the AGB scenario. We propose that HE 1327 is the oldest known object that shows nucleosynthetic evidence of the first AGB stars. With lifetimes as short as 200 Myr, these stars may have formed and polluted the universe very early. Recent Pop III star formation simulations support their formation, and their strong N production is qualitatively consistent with recent JWST observations showing high N/O ratios just 440 Myr after the Big Bang. Importantly, our results also suggest that the interstellar medium may have shown some degree of homogeneity and mixing even at these early epochs.

&lt;p&gt;
In clustered star-forming regions, stellar feedback-such as HII regions/photon-dominated regions (PDRs), and protostellar jets/outflows-shapes cloud structures and influences star formation. Using high-resolution ALMA millimeter and JWST infrared data, we analyze the cloud structure and the impact of stellar feedback in the nearest dense cluster-forming region Oph A. All 6 known Class 0/I and 2 of 6 Flat Spectrum/Class II objects are detected in the 1.3 mm dust continuum. Additionally, we newly detected 7 substellar cores, three of which show compact near-infrared emission, suggesting they are young substellar objects. The remaining cores, with masses of 0.01 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and high densities, are likely gravitationally bound. They appear connected by faint CO finger-like structures extending from the triple Class 0 system VLA1623-2417 Aa+Ab+B, suggesting they may have been ejected from the close binary VLA1623 Aa+Ab. 12CO and near-infrared data reveal multiple protostellar outflows. From the comparison, we identified several new outflows/jets, and shocked structures associated to the GSS30 large bipolar bubble. Strong 12CO emission traces the eastern edge of the Oph A ridge, forming part of the expanding HII/PDR bubble driven by the nearby Herbig Be star S1. The northern ridge appears blown out, with warm gas flowing toward GSS 30, injecting additional turbulent momentum. Several C18O striations in the S1 bubble align with magnetic fields, and position-velocity diagrams show wave-like patterns, possibly reflecting magnetohydrodynamic waves. Stellar feedback significantly influences Oph A's cloud structure.

&lt;p&gt;
We have analyzed the aromatic infrared bands (AIBs) in the 6-11.2 &amp;mu;m range around the Wolf-Rayet binary WR140 (d=1.64 kpc) obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MRS). In WR140's circumstellar environment, we have detected AIBs at 6 &amp;mu;m and 7.7 &amp;mu;m which are attributed to C-C stretching modes. These features have been detected in the innermost dust shell (Shell1; ~2100 au from WR140), the subsequent dust shell (Shell2; ~5200 au), and "off-shell'' regions in the MRS coverage. The 11.2 &amp;mu;m AIB, which is associated with the C-H out-of-plane bending mode, has been tentatively detected in Shell2 and the surrounding off-shell positions around Shell2. We compared the AIB features from WR140 to spectra of established AIB feature classes A, B, C, and D. The detected features around WR140 do not agree with these established classes. The peak wavelengths and full width half maxima (FWHMs) of the 6 &amp;mu;m and 7.7 &amp;mu;m features are, however, consistent with those of R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars with hydrogen-poor conditions. We discuss a possible structure of carbonaceous compounds and environments where they form around WR140. It is proposed that hydrogen-poor carbonaceous compounds initially originate from the carbon-rich WR wind, and the hydrogen-rich stellar wind from the companion O star may provide hydrogen to these carbonaceous compounds.

During the second half of Cycle 1 of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we conducted the Parallel Application of Slitless Spectroscopy to Analyze Galaxy Evolution (PASSAGE) program. PASSAGE received the largest allocation of JWST observing time in Cycle 1, 591 hours of NIRISS observations to obtain direct near-IR imaging and slitless spectroscopy. About two thirds of these were ultimately executed, to observe 63 high-latitude fields in Pure Parallel mode. These have provided more than ten thousand near-infrared grism spectrograms of faint galaxies. PASSAGE brings unique advantages in studying galaxy evolution: A) Unbiased spectroscopic search, without prior photometric pre-selection. By including the most numerous galaxies, with low masses and strong emission lines, slitless spectroscopy is the indispensable complement to any pre-targeted spectroscopy; B) The combination of several dozen independent fields to overcome cosmic variance; C) Near-infrared spectral coverage, often spanning the full range from 1.0&amp;ndash;2.3 &amp;mu;m, with minimal wavelength gaps, to measure multiple diagnostic rest-frame optical lines, minimizing sensitivity to dust reddening; D) JWST's unprecedented spatial resolution, in some cases using two orthogonal grism orientations, to overcome contamination due to blending of overlapping spectra; E) Discovery of rare bright objects especially for detailed JWST followup. PASSAGE data are public immediately, and our team plans to deliver fully-processed high-level data products. In this PASSAGE overview, we describe the survey and data quality, and present examples of these accomplishments in several areas of current interest in the evolution of emission-line galaxy properties, particularly at low masses.

We present observational evidence that intense ionizing radiation from a luminous quasar suppresses nebular emission in nearby galaxies on intergalactic scales at z=6.3. Using JWST/NIRCam grism spectroscopy from the SAPPHIRES and EIGER programs, we identify a pronounced decline in [O III] &amp;lambda;5008 luminosity relative to the UV continuum (L_5008/L_1500) among galaxies within ~10 comoving Mpc (cMpc) of the quasar J0100+2802, the most UV-luminous quasar known at this epoch (M_1450=-29.26). While L_1500 remains roughly constant with transverse distance, L_5008 increases significantly, suggesting suppression of very recent star formation toward the quasar. The effect persists after controlling for completeness, local density, and UV luminosity, and correlates with the projected photoionization-rate profile \Gamma_qso. A weaker but directionally consistent suppression in L_5008/L_1500 is also observed along the line of sight. The transverse suppression radius (~8-10 cMpc) implies a recent radiative episode with a cumulative duration ~4.5 Myr, shorter than required for thermal photoheating to dominate and thus more naturally explained by rapid H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photodissociation and related radiative processes. Environmental effects alone appear insufficient to explain the signal. Our results provide direct, geometry-based constraints on large-scale quasar radiative feedback and recent quasar lifetimes.

Thus far, Lyman-&amp;alpha; damping wings towards quasars have been used to probe the itglobal ionization state of the foreground intergalactic medium (IGM). A new parameterization has demonstrated that the damping wing signature also carries itlocal information about the distribution of neutral hydrogen (HI) in front of the quasar before it started shining. Leveraging a recently introduced Bayesian ttJAX-based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) inference framework, we derive constraints on the Lorentzian-weighted HI column density N_HI^DW, the quasar's distance r_patch to the first neutral patch and its lifetime t_Q based on JWST/NIRSpec spectra of the two z ~ 7.5 quasars J1007+2115 and J1342+0928. After folding in model-dependent topology information, we find that J1007+2115 (and J1342+0928) is most likely to reside in a &amp;langle; x_HI &amp;rangle; = 0.32_-0.20^+0.22 (0.58_-0.23^+0.23) neutral IGM while shining for a remarkably short lifetime of log_10 t_Q /yr = 4.14_-0.18^+0.74 (an intermediate lifetime of 5.64_-0.43^+0.25) along a sightline with log_10 N_HI^DW /cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 19.70_-0.86^+0.35 (20.24_-0.22^+0.25) and r_patch = 28.9_-14.4^+54.0  cMpc (10.9_-5.9^+5.6  cMpc). In light of the potential presence of local absorbers in the foreground of J1342+0928 as has been recently suggested, we also demonstrate how the Lorentzian-weighted column density N_HI^DW provides a natural means for quantifying their contribution to the observed damping wing signal.

We investigate the nature and spectroscopic diversity of early galaxies from a sample of 40 sources at z&amp;gt;10 with JWST/NIRSpec prism observations, the largest of its kind thus far. We compare the properties of strong UV line emitters, as traced by intense CIV emission, with those of more "typical" sources with weak or undetected CIV. The more typical (or "CIV-weak") sources reveal significant scatter in their CIII] line strengths, UV continuum slopes, and physical sizes, spanning CIII] equivalent widths of ~1-51 &amp;#8491;, UV slopes of &amp;beta;~-1.6 to -2.6, and half-light radii of ~50-1000 pc. In contrast, CIV-strong sources generally occupy the tail of these distributions, with CIII] EWs of 16-51 &amp;#8491;, UV slopes &amp;beta;&amp;lt;-2.5, compact morphologies (r_50&amp;lt;100 pc), and elevated star formation surface densities (&amp;Sigma;_SFR&amp;gt;100 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;yr^-1kpc^-2). Collectively these properties are consistent with concentrated starbursts that temporarily outshine the extended structure of the galaxy. Comparing average properties from composite spectra, we find the diversity of the sample is primarily driven by bursts and lulls of star formation on very short timescales (&amp;lt;3 Myr), where strong CIV emitters are observed at the apex of these phases and sources devoid of emission lines represent periods of relative inactivity. An apparent association between strong CIV and enhanced nitrogen abundance suggests both features may be modulated by the same duty cycle and reflect a generic mode of star formation. We show that AGN are unlikely to be a significant contributor to this duty cycle based on a comparison of UV line diagnostics to photoionisation models, although some non-thermal activity cannot be fully ruled out. Our results support a unified evolutionary picture whereby transient bursts and lulls can explain the spectral diversity and early growth of bright galaxies in the first 500 Myr.

Little Red Dots (LRDs), newly identified compact and dusty galaxies with an unexpectedly high number density observed by JWST, have an unusual "V-shaped" rest-frame UV to near-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED). A group of hyper-luminous, obscured quasars with excess blue emission, called Blue-excess Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxies (BHDs), also exhibit qualitatively similar SEDs to those of LRDs. They represent a rare population of galaxies hosting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) accreting near the Eddington limit at redshifts z ~ 1&amp;ndash;4. In this study, we compare their multi-wavelength SEDs to investigate whether LRDs, or a subset of them, could be high-redshift analogs of BHDs. Our analysis reveals that despite their similar "V-shape" SEDs, LRDs appear to be a different population than BHDs. The "V-shape" of BHDs appear at longer wavelengths compared to LRDs due to different selection strategies, suggesting LRDs have much less dust attenuation than typical BHDs. The bluer colors in the rest-frame infrared (continuum) emission of LRDs suggest the absence of hot dust heated by AGN accretion activities. We also argue that the blue excess in LRDs is unlikely from AGN scattered light. The compact morphologies and lower X-ray detection frequencies of LRDs suggest a distinct formation pathway from BHDs &amp;ndash; which are thought to be powered by super-Eddington accretion onto central SMBHs following major galaxy mergers.

Protoclusters, galaxy clusters' high redshift progenitors, hold the keys to understanding the formation and evolution of clusters and their member galaxies. However, their cosmological distances and spatial extensions (tens of Mpc) have inhibited complete mapping of their structure and constituent galaxies, which is key to robustly linking protoclusters to their descendants. Here we report the discovery of the Bigfoot, a tridimensional structure at z = 3.98 including 11 subgroups traced by 55 (700) spectroscopic (photometric) redshifts with JWST, extending over 15× 37 × 49cMpc^3 in the PRIMER-UDS field. Bigfoot's large-scale and mass function of member galaxies closely match constrained simulations' predictions for the progenitors of today's most massive clusters (M_0 &amp;gt; 10^15 M__ &amp;odot; ). All subgroups with M_h &amp;gt; 10^12.5 M__ &amp;odot;  exhibit enhanced fractions of massive galaxies (&amp;gt;10^10.0 M__ &amp;odot; ) compared to lower-mass halos and the field, demonstrating the accelerated formation of massive galaxies in massive halos. The presence of this massive protocluster with a large central halo (10^13.0 M__ &amp;odot; ) in a JWST deep field bears important cosmological implication that favors high &amp;sigma; _8 of PLANCK cosmology over low-redshift probes.

&lt;p&gt;
The presence of massive black holes (BHs) exceeding 10^9 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; already at redshift z &amp;gt; 6 challenges standard models of BH growth. Super-Eddington (SE) accretion has emerged as a promising mechanism to solve this issue, yet its impact on early BH evolution in tailored numerical experiments remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the growth of BH seeds embedded in a gas-rich, metal-poor protogalaxy at z ~ 15, using a suite of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations that implement a slim-disc-based SE accretion model. We explore a broad parameter space varying the initial BH mass, feedback efficiency, and spin. We find that SE accretion enables rapid growth in all cases, allowing BHs to accrete up to 10^5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; within a few 10^3-10^4 years, independent of seed properties. Feedback regulates this process, both by depleting central gas and altering BH dynamics via star formation-driven potential fluctuations, yet even the strongest feedback regimes permit significantly greater growth than the Eddington-limited case. Growth stalls after less than ~1 Myr due to local gas exhaustion, as no large-scale inflows are present in the adopted numerical setup. Our results show that SE accretion naturally leads to BHs that are over-massive relative to their host galaxy stellar content, consistent with JWST observations. We conclude that short, low-duty-cycle SE episodes represent a viable pathway for assembling the most massive BHs observed at early cosmic times, even starting from light seeds.

We present constraints on the reionization optical depth, &amp;tau;, obtained using several independent methods. First, we perform a non-parametric reconstruction of the reionization history, using Lyman-&amp;alpha; constraints on the evolution of the volume-averaged neutral hydrogen fraction, x_HI(z), including recent results from the James Webb Space Telescope. When combined with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI and Big Bang nucleosynthesis constraints, these data imply a rapid reionization history (z_mid=7.00^+0.12_-0.18 and &amp;Delta; z_50=1.12^+0.12_-0.29) and a value of &amp;tau;=0.0492^+0.0014_-0.0030, which is largely insensitive to the assumed cosmological model and independent of cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. The optical depth can also be measured from large-scale (&amp;ell;&amp;lt;30) CMB polarization data, yielding constraints that are similarly model-insensitive and consistent with the Ly&amp;alpha; bound. Third, &amp;tau; may be constrained from the attenuation of small-scale (&amp;ell;&amp;gt;30) CMB anisotropies, but the results are sensitive to the choice of cosmological model. Assuming &amp;Lambda;CDM and combining small-scale CMB data with CMB lensing and type 1a supernovae (SNe) yields tight constraints that are compatible with the Ly&amp;alpha; bound. Adding galaxy clustering and lensing measurements brings the constraints further into agreement with the Ly&amp;alpha; bound. These independent results reinforce a consensus picture in which reionization is rapid and late. However, the combination of small-scale CMB, CMB lensing, and BAO data yields &amp;tau;=0.094±0.011, which is in 4&amp;sigma; tension with our Ly&amp;alpha; bound. Non-standard reionization scenarios can reconcile some but not all constraints. Concordance is restored in alternative cosmological models, such as models with dynamical dark energy favoured by BAO, CMB, and SNe data.

We present HST2EUCLID, a novel Python code to generate Euclid realistic mock images in the H_E, J_E, Y_E, and I_E photometric bands based on panchromatic Hubble Space Telescope observations. The software was used to create a simulated database of Euclid images for the 27 galaxy clusters observed during the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH) and the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) program. Since the mock images were generated from real observations, they incorporate, by construction, all the complexity of the observed galaxy clusters. The simulated Euclid data of the galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1-2403 were then used to explore the possibility of developing strong lensing models based on the Euclid data. In this context, complementary photometric or spectroscopic follow-up campaigns are required to measure the redshifts of multiple images and cluster member galaxies. By Euclidising six parallel blank fields obtained during the HFF program, we provide an estimate of the number of galaxies detectable in Euclid images per deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per magnitude bin (number counts) and the distribution of the galaxy sizes. Finally, we present a preview of the Chandra Deep Field South that will be observed during the Euclid Deep Survey and two examples of galaxy-scale strong lensing systems residing in regions of the sky covered by the Euclid Wide Survey. The methodology developed in this work lends itself to several additional applications, as simulated Euclid fields based on HST (or JWST) imaging with extensive spectroscopic information can be used to validate the feasibility of legacy science cases or to train deep learning techniques in advance, thus preparing for a timely exploitation of the Euclid Survey data.

We analyze eight spectroscopically confirmed Little Red Dots (LRDs) at redshifts z = 5.1-8.7 with JWST/NIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI data. The LRDs have red NIRCam colors, F150W-F444W &amp;gt; 1, but flat NIRCam-MIRI colors, -0.5 &amp;lt; F444W - F770W &amp;lt; 0.5, suggesting weak warm/hot dust components. The LRDs have -1.0 &amp;lt; F1000W - F1500W &amp;lt; 1.1, suggestive of non-uniform rest near-IR properties within the sample. We model the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the LRDs using the CIGALE and Prospector codes to assess how the differing templates impact the interpretation for LRDs for cases of: (1) models with star-forming stellar populations only; (2) active galactic nuclei (AGN) dominated models; and (3) composite AGN and star-forming models. Using the Bayesian information criterion, we find that six of the eight LRDs favor AGN models compared to star-forming models, though no model reproduces all of the observed properties. Two LRDs with pronounced Balmer-breaks and broad H&amp;alpha; have SEDs that are reproduced with hot, dense-gas (log T/K=5-5.7, log n/cm^-3 = 9-11) models with low dust attenuation (A(V)≃ 0.5 mag). However, these models require an additional thermal component (800-1400 K) to account for the MIRI data, and fail to reproduce the rest-UV and narrow [OIII] emission. The total bolometric emission from the dense-gas models, and possibly CIGALE AGN models, appear consistent with literature constraints in the far-IR and radio, and require log L_bol/L&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;12. These results suggest that our LRDs cannot be modeled entirely with standard templates, but instead require a novel treatment of gas conditions, AGN and star-formation.

&lt;p&gt;
Stars and planets form within cold, dark molecular clouds. In these dense regions, where starlight cannot penetrate, cosmic rays (CRs) are the dominant source of ionization &amp;ndash; driving interstellar chemistry(Dalgarno (2006, PNAS, 103, 12269)), setting the gas temperature(Goldsmith et al. (1969, ApJ, 158, 173)), and enabling coupling to magnetic fields(McKee &amp; Ostriker (2007, ARA&amp;A, 45, 565; arXiv:0707.3514)). Together, these effects regulate the collapse of clouds and the onset of star formation. Despite this importance, the cosmic-ray ionization rate, \zeta, has never been measured directly. Instead, this fundamental parameter has been loosely inferred from indirect chemical tracers and uncertain assumptions, leading to published values that span nearly two orders of magnitude and limiting our understanding of star formation physics. Here, we report the first direct detection of CR-excited vibrational H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission, using itJames Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of the starless core Barnard 68 (B68). The observed emission pattern matches theoretical predictions for CR excitation precisely, confirming a decades-old theoretical proposal long considered observationally inaccessible. This result enables direct measurement of \zeta, effectively turning molecular clouds into natural, light-year-sized, cosmic-ray detectors. It opens a transformative observational window into the origin, propagation, and role of cosmic rays in star formation and galaxy evolution.

&lt;p&gt;
Though type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are found in all types of galaxies, recent local Hubble constant measurements have disfavored using SNe Ia in early-type or quiescent galaxies, aiming instead for better consistency with SNe Ia in star-forming, late-type host galaxies calibrated by Cepheid distances. Here we investigate the feasibility of a parallel distance ladder using SNe Ia exclusively in quiescent, massive (log M_*/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 10) host galaxies, calibrated by tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distances. We present TRGB measurements to four galaxies: three measured from the Hubble Space Telescope with the ACS F814W filter, and one measured from the JWST NIRCam F090W filter. Combined with literature measurements, we define a TRGB calibrator sample of five high-mass, early-type galaxies that hosted well-measured SNe Ia: NGC 1316 (SN 2006dd), NGC 1380 (SN 1992A), NGC 1404 (SN 2007on, SN 2011iv), NGC 4457 (SN 2020nvb), and NGC 4636 (SN 2020ue). We jointly standardize these calibrators with a fiducial sample of 124 Hubble-flow SNe Ia from the Zwicky Transient Facility that are matched in host-galaxy and light-curve properties. Our results with this homogenized subsample show a Hubble residual scatter of under 0.11 mag, lower than usually observed in cosmological samples of the full SN~Ia distribution. We obtain a measurement of the Hubble constant, H_0 = 75.3 ± 2.9 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; Mpc^-1, including statistical and estimated systematic uncertainties, and discuss the potential to further improve the precision of this approach. As calibrator and supernova samples grow, we advocate that future cosmological applications of SNe Ia use subsamples matched in host-galaxy and supernova properties across redshift.

We discovered a hyperluminous dust-obscured galaxy with mysterious blue-excess emission (BlueDOG) in rest-frame UV of its spectral energy distribution (SED) from a multi-wavelength survey in the AKARI Deep Field - South (ADF-S). We present the results of SED analysis with multiwavelength photometric data and spectroscopic analysis, observed with Gemini-S/GMOS, FLAMINGOS-2, to explore the origin of blue-excess emission of a hyperluminous BlueDOG, ADFS-KMTDOG-102, at z=2.6. The SED analysis shows that this BlueDOG is a highly massive system (log M_*/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;=12.3) with substantial extinction. Additionally, the proportion of the old stellar population exceeds that of the young stellar population, which suggests stellar evolution cumulated from the early universe. The mass of supermassive black hole (SMBH) estimated using the extinction-corrected broad H&amp;alpha; emission line yields log M_BH/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;=10.2. We discuss the similarity between the BlueDOG and 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs), recently discovered with the James Webb Space Telescope, showing SED shapes remarkably similar to those of LRDs. The UV emission line ratios indicate that the emission lines are primarily powered by the central active galactic nuclei (AGN). In contrast, the origin of the blue-excess UV continuum remains ambiguous, since both recent star formation and AGN-induced scattered light are viable explanations, based on the results from the SED fitting and scattered light modeling.

NGC 6302 is a spectacular bipolar planetary nebula (PN) whose spectrum exhibits fast outflows and highly ionized emission lines, indicating the presence of a very hot central star (~220,000 K). Its infrared spectrum reveals a mixed oxygen and carbon dust chemistry, displaying both silicate and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features. Using the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) and Medium Resolution Spectrometer, a mosaic map was obtained over the core of NGC 6302, covering the wavelength range of 5&amp;ndash;28 micron and spanning an area of ~18.5 arcsec x15 arcsec. The spatially resolved spectrum reveals ~200 molecular and ionized lines from species requiring ionisation potentials of up to 205 eV. The spatial distributions highlight a complex structure at the nebula's centre. Highly ionized species such as Mg VII and Si VII show compact structures, while lower-ionization species such as H^+ extend much farther outwards, forming filament-defined rims that delineate a bubble. Within the bubble, the H^+ and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission coincide, while the PAH emission appears farther out, indicating an ionization structure distinct from typical photodissociation regions, such as the Orion Bar. This may be the first identification of a PAH formation site in a PN. This PN appears to be shaped not by a steady, continuous outflow, but by a series of dynamic, impulsive bubble ejections, creating local conditions conducive to PAH formation. A dusty torus surrounds the core, primarily composed of large (micron-sized) silicate grains with crystalline components. The long-lived torus contains a substantial mass of material, which could support an equilibrium chemistry and a slow dust-formation process.

&lt;p&gt;
Massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift show significantly more compact morphology than their local counterparts. To examine their internal structure across a wide redshift range and investigate potential redshift dependence, we performed spatially resolved SED fitting using pixedfit software on massive (log(M_*/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;)~11) quiescent galaxies at 0&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;4 with public James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope imaging data from the Public Release Imaging for Extragalactic Research and the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey. We find that at z ~ 3.5, the half-mass radius is about 5.4 times smaller than at z ~ 0.5. This growth is driven by stellar mass buildup in the outskirts (r &amp;gt; 4 kpc), while the central regions (r ~ 1 kpc) remain largely unchanged, with stellar mass surface density similar to local quiescent galaxies. The estimated star formation rates are too low to explain the stellar mass growth, indicating an additional stellar mass accumulation process, such as mergers, is necessary. We parameterize the size-mass relation of the most massive galaxies in our sample as log(R_e,mass) &amp;prop; &amp;alpha; log(M_*), and find &amp;alpha; = 2.67^+1.14_-1.17 for z≤ssapprox2, consistent with growth dominated by minor mergers, and &amp;alpha; = 0.91^+0.20_-0.16 for z≳2, consistent with growth dominated by major mergers. These results indicate that massive quiescent galaxies originate from compact quenched systems and grow through combinations of minor and major mergers.

&lt;p&gt;
Dust plays a pivotal role in shaping the observed morphology of galaxies. While traditional cosmological simulations often assume a fixed dust-to-gas (DTG) or dust-to-metal (DTM) mass ratio to model dust effects, recent advancements have enabled on-the-fly (OTF) dust modeling that captures the spatial and temporal evolution of dust. In this work, we investigate the impact of dust modeling on galaxy morphology using the NewCluster simulation, which implements a detailed OTF dust model. We generate mock images of NewCluster galaxies under both OTF and fixed DTM models using the radiative transfer code SKIRT, and compare their morphology to JWST observations. We measure morphology indices and use the G-M_20 test to classify galaxies. We find that the OTF galaxy models exhibit brighter centers and more pronounced bulges than those of the fixed DTM models, resulting in a lower late-type galaxy (LTG) fraction, particularly at high redshifts. This central brightening is linked to a phenomenon we refer to as the DTM cavity, a localized depression in the DTM ratio driven by intense bulge starbursts. Our results highlight the importance of modeling dust evolution in a physically motivated manner, as fixed DTM models fail to capture key morphological features.

We present a systematic investigation of the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) using uniform metallicity diagnostics across redshifts z~0 to z~3.3. We present new Keck/DEIMOS measurements of the [OII]&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;3726,3729 emission line doublet for star-forming galaxies at z~1.5 with existing measurements of redder rest-optical lines from the MOSDEF survey. These new observations enable uniform estimation of the gas-phase oxygen abundance using ratios of the [OII], H&amp;beta;, and [OIII] lines for mass-binned samples of star-forming galaxies in 6 redshift bins, employing strong-line calibrations that account for the distinct interstellar medium ionization conditions at z&amp;lt;1 and z&amp;gt;1. We find that the low-mass power law slope of the MZR remains constant over this redshift range with a value of &amp;gamma;=0.28±0.01, implying the outflow metal loading factor (\zeta_out=\fracZ_out Z_ISM\fracM&amp;#775;_out SFR) scales approximately as \zeta_out&amp;prop; M_*^-0.3 out to at least z~3.3. The normalization of the MZR at 10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; decreases with increasing redshift at a rate of dlog(O/H)/dz =-0.11±0.01 across the full redshift range. We find that any evolution of the FMR is smaller than 0.1 dex out to z~3.3. We compare to cosmological galaxy formation simulations, and find that IllustrisTNG matches our measured combination of a nearly-invariant MZR slope, rate of MZR normalization decrease, and constant or very weakly evolving FMR. This work provides the most detailed view of MZR and FMR evolution from the present day through Cosmic Noon with a fine time sampling of 1-3 Gyr, setting a robust baseline for metallicity evolution studies at z&amp;gt;4 with JWST.

&lt;p&gt;
3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our Solar System, and only the second to display a clear coma. Infrared spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) provides the opportunity to measure its coma composition and determine the primary activity drivers. We report the first results from our JWST NIRSpec campaign for 3I/ATLAS, at an inbound heliocentric distance of r_H=3.32 au. The spectral images (spanning 0.6-5.3 &amp;mu;m) reveal a CO2 dominated coma, with enhanced outgassing in the sunward direction, and the presence of H2O, CO, OCS, water ice and dust. The coma CO2/H2O mixing ratio of 7.6±0.3 is among the highest ever observed in a comet, and is 4.5-sigma above the trend as a function of heliocentric distance for long-period and Jupiter-family comets (excluding the outlier C/2016 R2). Our observations are compatible with an intrinsically CO2-rich nucleus, which may indicate that 3I/ATLAS contains ices exposed to higher levels of radiation than Solar System comets, or that it formed close to the CO2 ice line in its parent protoplanetary disk. A low coma H2O gas abundance may also be implied, for example, due to inhibited heat penetration into the nucleus, which could suppress the H2O sublimation rate relative to CO2 and CO.

We investigate the star formation histories (SFHs) of a sample of massive galaxies (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 10^10   M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) in the redshift range 1 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 4.5. We analyze spectro-photometric data combining broadband photometry from HST and JWST with low-resolution grism spectroscopy from JWST/NIRISS, obtained as part of the MIDIS (MIRI Deep Imaging Survey) program. SFHs are derived through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using two independent codes, BAGPIPES and Synthesizer, under various SFH assumptions. This approach enables a comprehensive assessment of the biases introduced by different modeling choices. The inclusion of NIRISS spectroscopy, even with its low resolution, significantly improves constraints on key physical parameters, such as the mass-weighted stellar age (t_M) and formation redshift (z_form), by narrowing their posterior distributions. The massive galaxies in our sample exhibit rapid stellar mass assembly, forming 50&amp;percnt; of their mass between 3 ≤ z ≤ 9. The highest inferred formation redshifts are compatible with elevated star formation efficiencies (&amp;epsilon;) at early epochs. Non-parametric SFHs generally imply an earlier and slower mass assembly compared to parametric forms, highlighting the sensitivity of inferred formation timescales to the chosen SFH model, particularly for galaxies at z &amp;lt; 2. Quiescent galaxies are, on average, older (t_M ~ 1.1 Gyr) and assembled more rapidly at earlier times than their star-forming counterparts. These findings support the "downsizing'' scenario, in which more massive and passive systems form earlier and more efficiently.

I present written notes from three lectures given at the 54th Saas-Fee Advanced Course of the Swiss Society of Astrophysics and Astronomy in January 2025 entitled "Galaxies and Black Holes in the First Billion Years as seen by the JWST". I focused my lectures on progress in studies of cosmic reionisation, the properties of galaxies in the reionisation era, topics related to the redshift frontier and the search for Population III stars. The lectures were given to graduate students in astrophysics and cover both pedagogical material as well as observational results from the first two and half years of JWST science operations. The pace of discovery with JWST is, of course, rapid and so my lectures discuss long-term goals, analysis methods and their assumptions and limitations in the hope that the underlying material will retain value in the near future. In this written version, the visual material is that presented at Saas-Fee in January 2025 but I have provided updates on progress from the literature up to August 2025. The material is aimed at early career researchers and should not be considered as a scholarly review of the entire JWST literature on high redshift galaxies

&lt;p&gt;
The high-redshift (z&amp;gt;4) compact sources with "V-shaped" spectral energy distributions (SEDs), known as Little Red Dots (LRDs), are discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope and provide valuable clues to the physics of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the early universe. The nature of LRDs is controversial. Recently, several studies have investigated LRDs through variability, a characteristic feature of AGNs. These studies explore LRD variability by extrapolating empirical relationships from local quasars. Here, we adopt the Corona-heated Accretion-disk Reprocessing (CHAR) model, which is motivated by accretion physics and applicable to reproduce AGN conventional variability, to study the variability of 22 LRDs in \citetTee2025. Our results indicate that the observed variability in LRDs is dominated by measurement uncertainties. Within the CHAR model, the lack of variability in LRDs can be explained by two scenarios: either AGNs contribute ≲30&amp;percnt; of the observed luminosities, or they are intrinsically luminous AGNs. We use simulations to demonstrate the observational requirements to effectively investigate LRDs via variability: first, a sample of about 200 LRDs; second, each LRD has two observations separated by at least two years in the observed frame; third, the photometric uncertainty is ≤ 0.07 mag. If the LRDs still lack variability under these conditions, the time-domain study would provide independent evidence that the accretion mode of LRDs differs significantly from low-redshift quasars.

We present the results from performing spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting on 121 variable active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) using photometry from both the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) covering 0.2 - 4.8 microns. We designed a bespoke SED fitting code which decomposes the total SED into its stellar and AGN contributions. Our SED fitting retrieves a significant contribution to the total SED from an AGN template for 26 of our variable sources with 0 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 7. We leverage the model AGN spectrum to estimate black hole masses (M_BH) using the measured luminosity at 5100 &amp;#8491; and local empirical calibrations. Common with recently discovered JWST broad line AGN (BL-AGN), we observe a trend in the M_BH - M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;ast;&lt;/sub&gt; plane where low redshift sources have M_BH which agree with local relations while high redshift sources have increasingly overmassive black holes with respect to the stellar mass (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;ast;&lt;/sub&gt;) of their host galaxies. Within our sample, we identify two IMBH candidates hosted by dwarf galaxies at z&amp;lt;1 featuring overmassive BHs in the M_BH-M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;ast;&lt;/sub&gt; plane, similarly to our high redshift sources. Finally, our SED fitter successfully retrieves the AGN nature of one source at z &amp;gt;6. This object has z&lt;sub&gt;phot&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.74 and we estimate a lower limit on its black hole mass of log_10(M_BH/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;gt; 7.36.

Complex organic molecules (COMs) have been detected abundantly at various stages of star formation, particularly in the warm protostellar phase. The progress in gas-phase measurements has been accelerated by the advent of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and in ice measurements by the James Webb Space Telescope. Particularly, the community has moved from single-source studies of COMs to statistical analyses because of these powerful instruments. In this article, I review surveys that consider COMs in the gas and ice. The two takeaways from this review include; 1. Gas-phase abundance ratios for some COMs show a small difference across many objects and the ice abundance ratios show similar or higher values to the gas, both pointing to the importance of ice chemistry in COM formation, 2. Some COM ratios show larger differences across many objects which could be due to either chemical or physical effects, thus both factors need to be considered when interpreting the data.

SCUPOL, the polarimeter for SCUBA on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), was used for polarization observations of 104 regions at 850 micron wavelength and 15 arcsec resolution in the mapping mode by Matthews et al. (2009). They presented the polarization values and magnetic field morphologies in these regions. In this work, we took the opportunity to use this big legacy survey data to investigate further the collective statistical properties of the measured polarization in different star-forming regions containing cores and filaments. We did not reproduce the polarization maps but used the polarization value catalogs to investigate the statistics of distributions. In some of these regions, the data from the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) polarization observation at 1.3 mm wavelength and 2.5 arcsec resolution were also available from the TADPOL survey (Hull et al., 2014). We used that data and compared it with JCMT/SCUPOL values. We also study how the direction of outflows appears to relate to the mean B-field direction from large scale (JCMT observation at 15 arcsec) to small scale (CARMA observation at 2.5 arcsec) for the nine core regions common in both.

High-redshift galaxies exhibit compact regions of intense star formation, known as "clumps,'' which are conspicuous in the rest-frame ultraviolet. Studying them can shed light on how they form and evolve and inform theoretical models of galaxy evolution. We examine the evolution of clumpy galaxies with redshift and stellar mass over 2&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;12 with James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging from the JWST Advanced Extragalactic Survey (JADES). Off-center clumps are detected in the rest-frame near-ultraviolet (NUV) using similar techniques to those in earlier studies based on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. This is done for a sample of 9,121 star-forming galaxies with stellar masses log≤ft(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) ≥ 8. The fraction of clumpy galaxies, f_clumpy, increases from ~20&amp;percnt; at z&amp;gt;6.5 to ~80&amp;percnt; at z~2.75 at log≤ft(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) ≥ 9. Our f_clumpy values are generally higher at fixed redshift and increase faster with decreasing redshift than what studies based on HST data found, which we attribute largely to the higher sensitivity of JWST. Clumps make up 15-20&amp;percnt; of the NUV luminosity of clumpy galaxies, with little dependence on redshift or stellar mass. f_clumpy correlates with stellar mass and there is little correlation with specific star-formation rate. Our f_clumpy measurements are compared with those from simulations as well as other observations. At low redshifts (z≲5.75) and intermediate-to-high stellar masses (log≤ft(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) ≥ 9), our results suggest gas fragmentation due to violent disk instabilities to be the dominant mechanism for forming clumps. At high redshifts and low stellar masses, compression of gas during mergers appears to dominate.

The James Webb Space Telescope recently uncovered a population of massive black holes (BHs) in the first billion years after the Big Bang. Among these high-redshift BH candidates, observations have identified a class of active galactic nuclei candidates, dubbed Little Red Dots (LRDs), with extraordinarily compact gas reservoirs and peculiar spectral features. LRDs clearly emerge at redshift z&amp;lt;8 and their abundance declines by z&amp;lt;5. Recent theoretical studies have explored the link between LRDs and the formation of heavy BH seeds in the early Universe, such as direct-collapse BHs (DCBHs). Here we present results from preliminary runs for the MELIORA cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, where we implement an accurate model for DCBH formation, accounting for the Lyman-Werner radiation field and mass-inflow rates in the target host haloes. We aim to test whether or not DCBH formation could lead to systems resembling those hypothesized for LRDs. We find that the population of newly formed DCBHs in the simulations exhibits a steep decline at z&amp;lt;6, akin to the emergence of LRDs, primarily driven by reduced inflows. The birth of DCBHs is associated with a significant gas compaction event, followed by a phase of intense luminosity in the 200 Myr after their birth, and subsequently by the formation of the first PopIII stars in these very haloes. If these DCBHs nurseries are associated with LRDs, then it could explain their weak emission from X-rays and hot dust.

New JWST observations have revealed the presence of a significant number of high-redshift barred galaxies. The origin of these bars remains unclear, and their properties appear difficult to reconcile with the results of cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. I present an example of a tidally induced bar-like galaxy formed at z = 2.9 in the TNG100 suite of the IllustrisTNG simulations. The galaxy was identified among the sample of bar-like galaxies studied before and has the earliest bar formation time among the tidally induced subsample of those objects. Its disk transformed into a bar as a result of a close interaction with a massive progenitor of a brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). It remained on a tight orbit around the host and survived until the present, losing most of its initial mass and becoming red but preserving its prolate shape. Even before the interaction, at z = 3.5, the galaxy experienced a few mergers, which elongated its shape. This temporary distortion also made it look like a bar with spiral extensions of up to 6 kpc. The long-lived bar formed later was about 3 kpc long and grew over the next few gigayears. This example demonstrates that high-z bars should not be sought among the progenitors of present-day simulated barred galaxies but rather among the tidally interacting early population of galaxies in forming groups and clusters. Some of these galaxies may have survived as ellipticals, and some may have merged with their BCGs.

Variability detected in galaxies is usually attributed to their active galactic nuclei (AGNs). While all AGNs are intrinsically variable, the classic AGN unification model predicts that type~2 AGNs rarely vary because their engines are obstructed by dust tori. Previous UV-to-near-IR variability studies largely support this expectation. Here, we present a variability study by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) that reveals a more subtle picture. Using NIRCam imaging data from three surveys over ~140~arcmin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the COSMOS field, we found 117 galaxies with ≥ 4&amp;sigma; variability in the F356W band across a ~2-year baseline. Cross-matching with existing JWST spectroscopic data in this area, we identified five of them at z=0.19&amp;ndash;3.69, which were all coincidentally observed by a NIRSpec program almost contemporaneously with the last imaging epoch. One additional variable was identified at z=0.90 using the archival Keck telescope data. These six objects form our spectroscopic subsample. Interestingly, two reside in close-pair environments, while two others form a close pair themselves. Most of their light curves can hardly be explained by nuclear transients, and AGN variability is a more plausible cause. However, among these six objects, (1) only one shows broad permitted lines (&amp;Delta; v &amp;gt; 1000~km~s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) indicative of a type~1 AGN; (2) two show narrow permitted lines consistent with type~2 AGNs, with another one likely type~2 based on the host galaxy properties; and (3) two others, which form a pair, show no emission lines. Our results add more challenges to the unification model.

Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal young massive clusters (YMCs) as key building blocks of early galaxies. They are not only important constituents of galaxies, but also potential birthplaces of very massive stars (VMSs) and black hole (BH) seeds. We explore stellar dynamics in extremely dense clusters with initial half-mass densities of &amp;rho;_h ≳ 10^8M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;pc^-3 at very low metallicity, comparable to some of the densest clusters seen by JWST. Using direct N-body and Monte Carlo simulations with stellar evolution, we show that VMS formation through collisions is unavoidable, with final masses reaching 5×10^3 to 4×10^4M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. These results support the existence of a critical mass scale above which collisions become highly efficient, enabling the formation of VMSs and intermediate-mass BHs (IMBHs). Our models, using nbody6++gpu and MOCCA with updated SSE/BSE routines, show that dense clusters rapidly form VMSs via stellar bombardment. The VMSs then collapse into BH seeds of a few 10^3 to 10^4M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; in less than 4 Myr. We identify a critical mass-density threshold beyond which clusters undergo runaway collisions that yield massive BH seeds. For typical YMCs detected by JWST, efficiencies up to 10% are expected, implying BH masses up to 10^5M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; if formed via collisions. We predict a scaling relation for BH mass, log(M_BH/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;)=-0.76+0.76log(M/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;). Frequent VMS formation may also explain the high nitrogen abundance observed in galaxies at high redshift.

The resonant scattering nature of Ly&amp;alpha; photons interacting with neutral hydrogen makes Ly&amp;alpha;-emitting galaxies (LAEs) robust tracers of the intergalactic neutral hydrogen fraction, and thus sensitive probes of cosmic reionization. We present an extensive study of the Ly&amp;alpha; evolution from galaxies at 4.5 ≤ z ≤ 11 in the UDS field, observed as part of the CAPERS survey, and complemented with spectra from the DAWN JWST Archive. The combined sample includes 651 spectroscopically confirmed Ly&amp;alpha;-break galaxies, among which we find 73 S/N&amp;gt;3 LAEs in JWST-NIRSpec PRISM spectra. We trace the redshift evolution of the Ly&amp;alpha; emitter fraction with EW_0 &amp;gt;25 A (X_Ly&amp;alpha;) between z = 5 and z = 9, presenting the first such analysis in the UDS field. At z = 5 and 6, the UDS results agree with the average JWST X_Ly&amp;alpha; values from multiple fields. However, JWST measurements are consistently lower than ground-based results. To investigate this, we compare JWST observations to a population of star-forming galaxies at z~6 observed with VLT-FORS2. We find that a Ly&amp;alpha; slit-loss of 35 ± 10% in JWST spectra accounts for the offset, as the resonant Ly&amp;alpha; emission is more spatially extended than the stellar continuum. From z = 6 to 7, the UDS field shows a significant drop in Ly&amp;alpha; visibility, from which we infer a neutral hydrogen fraction of X_HI = 0.7&amp;ndash;0.9. Finally, we identify two robust ionized bubbles at z = 7.29 and 7.77, with radii of R&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.6 and 0.5 physical Mpc and photometric overdensities of N/&amp;langle;N&amp;rangle; = 3 and 4, based on candidate counts down to the photometric completeness limit. Compared to the large ionized region at z~7 in the EGS field, these results indicate significant field-to-field variation, supporting a patchy, inhomogeneous reionization process.

Recent JWST surveys of high-redshift galaxies have found surprisingly large black holes, with many being measured to be ~100 times more massive than local galaxies with the same stellar mass. Here, we find that a population of these black holes would have dramatic implications for our understanding of their growth across cosmic time. We first show that the global black hole mass density at z ~ 5 would be comparable to local values. This would not occur if these black holes occupy a small fraction of galaxies, though it would be expected if these black holes radiate at high efficiencies (requiring that the central engines of AGN spin rapidly). We then show that the individual detected z ~ 5 black holes would remain overmassive compared to the local relation if they grow according to the average rates of state-of-the-art models. These systems must instead grow at least an order of magnitude more slowly than expected if they are to fall within the observed scatter of the local black hole mass-stellar mass relation. Such slow growth is surprising in comparison to other estimates of the radiative efficiency of AGN, especially because growth must be rapid at z &amp;gt; 5 in order to build up such massive black holes quickly. Finally, we highlight the challenges that overmassive black holes have on our understanding of the impact of quasar feedback on galaxies.

&lt;p&gt;
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered a new population of objects, the Little Red Dots (LRDs), characterized by V-shaped spectra indicative of strong breaks around the Balmer limit and compact morphology that gave them their name. A popular explanation is that they are a sub-population of active galactic nuclei/supermassive black holes (AGN/SMBHs) predominantly found in the high-redshift Universe (z≳3). Similarly, direct collapse black holes (DCBHs), theorized to form from collapsing massive, extremely metal-poor gas clouds, have been invoked to explain high-redshift quasars, the most massive AGN sub-population. Here, we employ the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH to produce a population of DCBHs and compare them against observed LRD demographics and properties. Specifically, we compare the DCBH-seeded SMBH population against the standard stellar-remnant seeds and find that DCBH models agree better with observed LRD population statistics and host halo properties. Furthermore, for the most extreme and earliest LRD detections, interpreted to be systems with an AGN but little stellar component, DCBHs are able to reproduce the observed spectral shape and properties under multiple scenarios - high dust attenuation or AGN surrounded by dense gas - that have been proposed to explain the unique shape of LRD spectra. Even when super-Eddington accretion, invoked previously to explain the nature of LRDs, is enforced on stellar remnant seeds, the spectral characteristics of extreme LRDs cannot be reproduced. We emphasize the importance of gas-metallicity observations as an additional dimension besides the widely used SMBH-stellar mass ratios to further constrain the progenitors of LRDs.

&lt;p&gt;
The cosmic 21-cm signal is a promising probe of the early Universe, owing to its sensitivity to the thermal state of the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) and properties of the first luminous sources. In this work, we constrain the 21-cm signal and infer IGM properties by leveraging multi-wavelength synergies. This builds on our earlier study, where we developed the synergy between high-redshift UV luminosity functions (UVLFs), cosmic X-ray and radio backgrounds (CXB and CRB), 21-cm global signal non-detection from SARAS~3, and 21-cm power spectrum upper limits from HERA, to constrain the astrophysical properties of Population II galaxies. Through a combination of CXB and HERA data, we find the IGM kinetic temperature to be T_K(z=15)≲ 7.7~K, 2.5~K ≲ T_K(z=10) ≲ 66~K, and 20~K≲ T_K(z=6) ≲ 2078~K at 95&amp;percnt; credible interval (C.I.). Similarly, CRB and HERA data place an upper limit on the radio emission efficiency of galaxies, giving T_rad(z=15) ≲ 47~K, T_rad(z=10)≲ 51~K, and T_rad(z=6)≲ 101~K. These constraints, strengthened by the inclusion of UVLFs from HST and JWST, allow us to place the first itlower bound on the cosmic 21-cm signal. We infer an absorption trough of depth -201~mK≲ T_21,min ≲ -68~mK at z_min≈10-16, and a power spectrum of 8.7~mK^2 &amp;lt; &amp;Delta;_21^2(z=15) &amp;lt; 197~mK^2 at k=0.35~hMpc^-1. Our results provide promising predictions for upcoming 21-cm experiments, and highlight the power of multi-wavelength synergies in constraining the early Universe.

Star formation governs galaxy evolution, shaping stellar mass assembly and gas consumption across cosmic time. The Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, linking star formation rate (SFR) and gas surface densities, is fundamental to understand star formation regulation, yet remains poorly constrained at z &amp;gt; 2 due to observational limitations and uncertainties in locally calibrated gas tracers. The [CII] 158 &amp;mu; m line has recently emerged as a key probe of the cold ISM and star formation in the early Universe. We investigate whether the resolved [CII]-SFR and KS relations established at low redshift remain valid at 4 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 6 by analysing 13 main-sequence galaxies from the ALPINE and CRISTAL surveys, using multi-wavelength data (HST, JWST, ALMA) at ~2 kpc resolution. We perform pixel-by-pixel spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling with CIGALE on resolution-homogenised images. We develop a statistical framework to fit the [CII]-SFR relation that accounts for pixel covariance and compare our results to classical fitting methods. We test two [CII]-to-gas conversion prescriptions to assess their impact on inferred gas surface densities and depletion times. We find a resolved [CII]-SFR relation with a slope of 0.87 ± 0.15 and intrinsic scatter of 0.19 ± 0.03 dex, which is shallower and tighter than previous studies at z~5. The resolved KS relation is highly sensitive to the [CII]-to-gas conversion factor: using a fixed global &amp;alpha;_[CII] yields depletion times of 0.5-1 Gyr, while a surface brightness-dependent W_[CII], places some galaxies with high gas density in the starburst regime (&amp;lt;0.1 Gyr). Future inputs from both simulations and observations are required to better understand how the [CII]-to-gas conversion factor depends on local ISM properties. We need to break this fundamental limit to properly study the KS relation at z≳4.

JWST/NIRCam 0.9 to 2.0 micron images reveal a population of point sources around the major galaxies in the El Gordo cluster at redshift z=0.87. Their distribution in the color&amp;ndash;magnitude diagrams shows a narrow sequence well separated from field-galaxy contamination and consistent with their identification as ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) or luminous globular clusters (GCs). The point-source sequence is more luminous by almost a magnitude than the corresponding sequence in Abell 2744 at z=0.31, matching the predicted evolutionary change for GC/UCDs over the 4-Gyr difference in lookback time between these two clusters. Deeper observations should allow direct JWST imaging of GC/UCD populations, even without the help of lensing, up to z ~ 1.4, a lookback time of more than 9 Gyr. Such observations would directly reveal the evolution of these compact stellar systems two-thirds of the way back to the Big Bang.

Massive stars play a critical role in the evolution of galaxies, but their formation remains poorly understood. One challenge is accurate measurement of the physical properties of massive protostars, such as current stellar mass, envelope mass, outflow cavity properties, and system orientation. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting is widely-used to test models against observations. The far-infrared SED traces cold dust in envelopes, while the near- and mid-infrared (MIR) probes emission from outflow cavities and/or the inner envelope. However, SED fitting has degeneracy limiting its ability to yield accurate measurements of protostellar properties. Here, we develop image profile (IMPRO) fitting as a method to improve the characterization of protostars. We utilize brightness distributions from multi-wavelength MIR images of massive protostars taken by SOFIA/FORCAST as part of the SOFIA Massive Star Formation (SOMA) survey to constrain protostellar properties via comparison to a grid of radiative transfer models. We develop a fitting pipeline to extract information along the outflow axis, which is then combined with the SED fitting to yield improved constraints on protostellar properties. We apply the IMPRO fitting method on the nearby massive protostar Cepheus A, finding that its properties become more tightly constrained compared to SED fitting, especially in the inclination of the source. However, for the more distant G35.20-0.74N, we find that the spatial resolution of SOFIA/FORCAST limits the utility of this combined fitting pipeline. However, higher resolution MIR observations, e.g., with JWST, are expected to greatly expand the applicability of this fitting technique to protostars across the Galaxy.

We present the second data release of the Systematic Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES), focusing on JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution spectroscopy of galaxies across cosmic time. This release includes spectroscopic observations of 166 galaxies spanning 0 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 7.5, sampling star-forming galaxies, quiescent systems, and active galactic nuclei (AGN), with an emphasis on galaxies at cosmic noon (z ~ 1-3). We describe the target selection strategy, the observational setup with the G140M/F100LP and G235M/F170LP gratings, and the data calibration process. The final data products include the reduced spectra, redshift catalog, emission-line catalogs produced with ttGELATO for emission-line galaxies and ttpPXF fits for quiescent systems, and ancillary spectral energy distribution (SED) fit results derived from multi-band photometry. The SMILES NIRSpec dataset enables investigations of obscured AGN, multi-phase outflows, ionizing properties, and the role of environment in galaxy evolution.

LDN 1616 is a cometary globule located approximately 8 degrees west of the Orion OB1 associations. The massive OB stars in the Orion belt region act as catalysts, triggering the star formation activity observed in the L1616 region, which is a photodissociation region (PDR). This paper provides an in-depth analysis of gas kinematics within the L1616 PDR, leveraging the Heterodyne Array Receiver Program (HARP) on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) to observe 13CO and C18O (3-2) emissions. Employing the Clumpfind algorithm on the C18O emission data, we identify three distinct clumps within this PDR. For each of these clumps, we derive key physical parameters, including the mean kinetic temperature, optical depth, and velocity dispersion. In addition, we compute the non-thermal velocity dispersion and Mach number, providing critical insights into the turbulent dynamics of the gas. A comprehensive evaluation of mass, including virial and energy budget evaluations, is conducted to assess the gravitational stability and star-forming potential of the identified clumps. While previous studies have proposed that radiation-driven implosion (RDI) is the dominant mechanism initiating star formation in LDN 1616, our results suggest that the clumps may represent pre-existing substructures within the PDR. This interpretation is supported by our estimation of a relatively low interstellar radiation field, which, although insufficient to form clumps independently, may enhance gravitational instability through additional compression. Thus, our findings offer a more nuanced perspective on the role of RDI, highlighting its capacity to trigger star formation by amplifying the instability of pre-existing clumpy structures in PDRs like LDN 1616.

Strong oxygen depletion in the inner regions of a very low-mass star disk?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11761v1</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;
JWST is discovering a plethora of species in planet-forming disks around very low-mass stars such as C2H2, C6H6, C4H2, CH3 etc. The column densities of these species retrieved from 0D slab models are very large, e.g. of the order of 10^20 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This is indicating a carbon-dominated chemistry in a gas with a high C/O ratio. The disk around 2MASS-J1605321-1993159 (M4.5) is one such source showing a molecular pseudo-continuum of C2H2. Still two oxygen-bearing molecules, CO and CO2 are also detected in this source. We aim to take the next step beyond 0D slab models to interpret the spectrum. We examine whether 2D thermo-chemical disk models can produce the large inferred column densities of \ceC2H2 in the inner regions of the disk and produce a pseudo-continuum in the mid-IR spectrum. We also want to constrain whether depletion of oxygen or enrichment of carbon is causing the high C/O ratio triggering a carbon-dominated chemistry. We utilize the radiative thermo-chemical disk model P\tiny ROD\tiny IM\tiny O to identify a disk structure which is capable of producing the observed molecular emission of species such as CO, CO2, C2H2, and H2O simultaneously. The spectrum is generated using the fast line tracer FLiTs. We derive the gas temperature &amp;langle; T &amp;rangle;, column density &amp;langle; log_10 N&amp;rangle; and the emitting area &amp;langle; r_1 - r_2 &amp;rangle; for these molecules from the 2D disk model and compare them to the parameters retrieved originally from 0D slab models. We use the different effect that changing the O or C abundance has on CO and C2H2 respectively to discriminate between O depletion and C enhancement. We find that a disk structure characterised by the presence of a gap can best explain the observations. The inner disk is strongly depleted in dust, especially small grains (&amp;lt;5 &amp;mu;m), and ..

Aims: To investigate the physical processing of PAHs in high-mass star-forming environments. This study aims to characterize how the PAH ionization fraction varies across different H II regions and to search for spectroscopic evidence of the processing or destruction of PAH molecules in intense radiation fields. Methodology: We utilized mid-infrared integral field spectroscopic data from the JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) in its Medium Resolution Spectroscopy (MRS) mode. One-dimensional spectra were extracted for each of the four H II regions. We measured the integrated fluxes of the prominent PAH emission features at 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3 micron and calculated key diagnostic flux ratios to probe the physical state of the PAH population. Results: The four H II regions in NGC 5457 exhibit significant diversity in their PAH spectral characteristics. The diagnostic F(8.6)/F(11.3) ratio, a tracer of PAH ionization, varies from 0.23 to 0.62 across the sample. The region with the highest ionization (highest F(8.6)/F(11.3)) shows the lowest F(7.7)/F(8.6) ratio (1.13), while the region with the lowest ionization has the highest F(7.7)/F(8.6) ratio (2.38). Conclusion: The observed spectral diversity is primarily driven by variations in the PAH ionization state, which is governed by the local radiation field intensity. The strong anti-correlation between the F(7.7)/F(8.6) and F(8.6)/F(11.3) ratios provides a new, powerful diagnostic for PAH processing. This trend is interpreted as an evolutionary sequence where increasingly harsh radiation fields not only ionize the PAH population but also alter the surviving cations, consistent with the selective destruction of the carriers of the 7.7 micron feature.

We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam imaging of the nearby Seyfert 1.9 galaxy NGC 4258, which hosts strong star formation regions as well as an anomalous jet-like radio structure that extends through a significant portion of its disk. This galaxy provides a unique environment to study Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN)-driven shocks and their impact on the interstellar medium (ISM) as its proximity allows for narrow-band observations of various near-infrared tracers sensitive to multiple levels of shock and radiative excitation: [Fe II] (1.64 &amp;mu;m), Pa&amp;alpha; (1.87 &amp;mu;m), H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (2.21 &amp;mu;m), 3.3 &amp;mu;m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission, Br&amp;alpha; (4.05 &amp;mu;m), and Pf&amp;beta; (4.66 &amp;mu;m), allowing us to trace shocks with parsec-scale resolution. Comparing these near-infrared observations with available ultraviolet, optical, radio, and X-ray imaging, we find that shocks present in the brightest regions of the anomalous radio structure are likely of low-velocity (50-100 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), suggesting that these features originate from AGN-driven winds that interact with the host medium and mechanically impart energy into the disk. Further, while co-spatial [Fe II] and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission indicate multi-phase shocks, PAH emission is relatively weaker or absent in the most shock-excited regions, consistent with the destruction of small dust grains. Finally, we propose that surveys identifying enhanced [Fe II] in AGN host galaxies may systematically reveal a key population where AGN feedback is significantly coupled with the surrounding ISM and actively shaping galaxy evolution.

&lt;p&gt;
In today's Universe, most galaxies are rotationally supported against gravity. However, a small fraction of the most massive galaxies which are no longer forming stars (i.e., they are quiescent) are dispersion supported, and are termed 'slow-rotators.' These galaxies, which are highly evolved and often exist in dense cluster environments, are theorized to be formed by a history of merger activity that on average decreases the angular momentum of the merged system and disturbs any disk structure. At high redshift, such extreme slow-rotating systems are predicted to be far less common. While observations of massive high-redshift galaxies which enable kinematic studies are challenging to obtain, all previous data have revealed systems that are rotating rapidly. No slow-rotators have been confirmed from stellar kinematics beyond z~2. In this work we present results from James Webb Space Telescope near-infrared integral field spectroscopy of XMM-VID1-2075, a massive, quiescent galaxy at z=3.449 with a morphology exhibiting clear low-surface brightness asymmetries and with a measured spin parameter of &amp;lambda; _R_e = 0.101 ± 0.018, consistent with the lack of rotation seen in slow rotators in the local Universe. Taken together, these lines of evidence suggest that merger activity played a key role in the formation and kinematic transformation of some of the most massive galaxies when the Universe was &amp;lt;2 Gyr old, much earlier than previously observed.

&lt;p&gt;
Using cosmological radiation-hydrodynamical simulations, we study the effect of accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on nearby dark-matter (DM) haloes in the very early universe. We find that an SMBH with a spectral energy distribution (SED) extending from the near-ultraviolet to hard X-rays, can produce a radiation background sufficient to delay gravitational collapse in surrounding DM haloes until up to 10^7 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; of zero-metallicity gas is available for the formation of Population III (Pop III) stars or direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs). We model three scenarios, corresponding to an SMBH located at physical distances of 10, 100, and 1000 kpc from the Pop III host DM halo. Using these three scenarios, we use the SED to compute self-consistent photoionization, photoheating, and photodissociation rates. We include the effects of Compton scattering and gas self-shielding. The X-ray portion of the spectrum maintains an elevated free-electron fraction as the gas collapses to high density. This stimulates H2 formation, allowing the gas to cool further while counteracting the dissociation of H2 by Lyman-Werner radiation. As a result, a large cluster of Pop III stars is expected to form, except in the case with the most intense radiation in which a DCBH may instead form. Our simulated Pop III clusters have comparable HeII 1640 luminosities to the recently discovered Pop III host candidate near GN-z11, observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. In two of the scenarios we consider, the resulting clusters could be detectable using the telescope's NIRSpec instrument out to z ~ 15.

We present detections of auroral emission lines of [OIII], [OII], [SIII], and [SII] in deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy for 41 star-forming galaxies at z=1.4-7.2 from the AURORA survey. We combine these new observations with 98 star-forming galaxies at z=1.3-10.6 with detected auroral lines drawn from the literature to form a sample of 139 high-redshift galaxies with robust electron temperature and direct-method oxygen abundance determinations. This sample notably covers a wider dynamic range in metallicity than previous work, spanning 0.02-0.9~Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. We calibrate empirical relations between 19 emission-line ratios and oxygen abundance, providing a robust tool set to infer accurate gas-phase metallicities of high-redshift galaxies when auroral lines are not detected. While calibrations based on lines of &amp;alpha; elements (O, Ne, S, Ar) appear reliable, we find significant scatter in calibrations involving lines of N driven by a high dispersion in N/O at fixed O/H, suggesting that N-based line ratios are less reliable tracers of the oxygen abundance at high redshift. These new high-redshift calibrations are notably offset from those based on typical z~0 galaxy and HII region samples, and are better matched by samples of extreme local galaxies that are analogs of high-redshift sources. The new metallicity calibrations presented in this work pave the way for robust studies of galaxy chemical evolution in the early Universe, leading to a better understanding of baryon cycling and galaxy formation from Cosmic Noon through the Epoch of Reionization.

&lt;p&gt;
Predictions from current theories and simulations suggest that dual AGN systems are exceedingly rare at high redshifts. The intense radiation and powerful outflows from AGNs regulate star formation, heat the interstellar medium, and drive massive gas outflows that shape the host galaxy and its surroundings. One manifestation of AGN feedback is the creation of extended Ly&amp;alpha; nebulae. However, identifying these systems at high-z is challenging. Here, we report a remarkable dual AGN candidate at z ~ 5.4 using JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec, with a separation of ~1.7 arcseconds (~10.4 pkpc). This is one of the highest spectroscopically confirmed redshift dual AGNs discovered. Photometric SED fitting shows excellent agreement with AGN templates, strongly suggesting a rare dual AGN system. BPT diagrams and high ionisation lines further support the presence of AGNs. VLT/MUSE observations reveal strong extended Ly&amp;alpha; emission, extending to &amp;gt;22 kpc, making it one of the most extended Ly&amp;alpha; nebulae at z ~ 6. This provides observational evidence of anisotropic AGN-driven photoionization or shocks. The high Ly&amp;alpha; escape fraction also indicates an AGN outflow. This dual AGN candidate is also associated with a well-defined overdensity, potentially at the center of a z ~ 5.4 protocluster or filamentary structure node. Further analysis indicates the fraction of dual AGNs is significantly higher than theoretically expected at high redshifts. This discovery provides a new opportunity to study dual AGN interactions and their impact on the circumgalactic medium and cosmic structure evolution.

&lt;p&gt;
Gas-giant exoplanets are test cases for theories of planet formation as their atmospheres are proposed to carry signatures of their formation within the protoplanetary disk. The metallicity and C/O are key diagnostics, allowing to distinguish formation location within the disk (e.g., relative to snowlines), and mechanism (e.g., core accretion versus gravitational instability). We can now probe the composition of the planet-forming regions of disks, and that in gas-giant exoplanets, to scrutinise these theories and diagnostics. So far, ALMA has revealed that the outer disk regions are typically metal-depleted and O-poor, whereas JWST is showing that the inner disk regions around Sun-like stars are mostly O-rich. Further, JWST is showing that most transiting gas-giant planets are typically metal-enriched and O-rich, consistent with formation at/within the water snowline and pollution by icy bodies. There is emerging an arguably "conventional" picture of gas-giant planet formation for transiting planets, to be confirmed, of course, with future data.

Detecting Population III (Pop. III) stars remains a major observational challenge. Their Balmer series recombination line emission, redshifted into the infrared at z ~ 5-11, is a potential tracer. JWST/NIRSpec offers the first opportunity to detect such lines, provided fluxes exceed instrumental sensitivity. This study aims to model the expected luminosities of the first four Balmer series transitions from Pop. III star-forming halos and assess their detectability with JWST/NIRSpec across 5 ≤ z ≤ 11. We use the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH with merger trees constructed from the extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism and cosmological N-body simulations targeting Milky Way-like halos and the halo population in a 8~Mpc/h box. Predicted fluxes are compared to JWST detection limits derived from the Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) assuming a 10,000 s NIRSpec exposure at a signal-to-noise ratio of 5. For our default model parameters, Pop. III H&amp;alpha; fluxes peak at ~10^-21 erg s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 2-3 orders of magnitude below the JWST detection threshold (~6 × 10^-19 erg s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The fluxes in the other Balmer series lines are weaker than H&amp;alpha; and hence are also not detectable. Among the model parameters that we explore, the ionizing photon escape fraction f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt;,III has the strongest effect on Pop. III Balmer series fluxes when changed: reducing f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt;,III from 0.9 to 0.1 increases the fluxes by ≳1 order of magnitude. However, even in this case, the lines remain undetectable. Balmer series lines powered by emission from Pop. III stars will be undetectable by JWST without strong lensing (&amp;mu; ≳ 10). A-SLOTH provides a useful tool to predict emission strengths and assess the detectability of Pop. III stars across cosmic history.

&lt;p&gt;
There are several puzzling phenomena from recent JWST observations, which seem to push the standard &amp;Lambda;CDM cosmology over the edge. All those puzzles can be understood in a coherent way if we assume that first massive black holes (MBHs, the "heavy eggs") formed by directly collapsing from wave CDM haloes, which can be even earlier than the formation of first galaxies (the "chickens"). We elucidate two false obstacles that have been believed to prevent wave CDM haloes from collapsing into black holes (namely "maximum stable mass" and "bosenova") and point out that general-relativistic instabilities (e.g., the non-axisymmetric instability numerically found in spinning scalar-field boson stars) could serve as the concrete mechanisms for direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) born from wave dark matter. Once the MBHs formed, star formation bursts in and around the accretion flows, characteristic of a special mode in compact regions of high gravitational accelerations.

We present JWST/MIRI spectra from the Medium-Resolution Spectrometer of IZw18, a nearby dwarf galaxy with a metallicity of ~3% Solar. Its proximity enables a detailed study of highly ionized gas that can be interpreted in the context of newly discovered high-redshift dwarf galaxies. We derive aperture spectra centered on eleven regions of interest; the spectra show very low extinction, A_V ≲ 0.1, consistent with optical determinations. The gas is highly ionized; we have detected 10 fine-structure lines, including [OIV] 25.9 micron with an ionization potential (IP) of ~ 55 eV, and [NeV] 14.3 micron with an IP of ~ 97 eV. The ionization state of IZw18 falls at the extreme upper end of all of the line ratios we analyzed, but not coincident with galaxies containing an accreting massive black hole (active galactic nucleus). Comparison of the line ratios with state-of-the-art photoionization and shock models suggests that the high ionization state in IZw18 is not due to shocks. Rather it can be attributed to metal-poor stellar populations with a self-consistent contribution of X-ray binaries or ultra-luminous X-ray sources. It could also be partially due to a small number of hot low-metallicity Wolf-Rayet stars ionizing the gas; a small fraction (a few percent) of the ionization could come from an intermediate-mass black hole. Our spectroscopy also revealed four 14 micron continuum sources, ≳ 30-100 pc in diameter, three of which were not previously identified. Their properties are consistent with HII regions ionized by young star clusters.

Little Red Dots (LRDs) are compact sources at z&amp;gt;5 discovered through JWST spectroscopy. Their spectra exhibit broad Balmer emission lines (≳1000~km~s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), alongside absorption features and a pronounced Balmer break &amp;ndash; evidence for a dense, neutral hydrogen medium with the n=2 state. When interpreted as arising from AGN broad-line regions, inferred black hole masses from local scaling relations exceed expectations given their stellar masses, challenging models of early black hole-galaxy co-evolution. However, radiative transfer effects in dense media may also impact the formation of hydrogen emission lines. We model three scattering processes shaping hydrogen line profiles: resonance scattering by hydrogen in the n=2 state, Raman scattering of UV radiation by ground-state hydrogen, and Thomson scattering by free electrons. Using 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations with multi-branching resonance transitions, we examine their imprint on line shapes and ratios. Resonance scattering produces strong deviations from Case B flux ratios, clear differences between H&amp;alpha; and H&amp;beta;, and encodes gas kinematics in line profiles but cannot broaden H&amp;beta; due to conversion to Pa&amp;alpha;. While Raman scattering can yield broad wings, scattering of UV continuum is disfavored given the absence of strong FWHM variations across transitions. Raman scattering of higher Lyman-series emission can produce H&amp;alpha;/H&amp;beta; wing width ratios of ≳1.28, agreeing with observations. Thomson scattering can reproduce the observed ≳1000~km  s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; wings under plausible conditions, e.g., T_e ~ 10^4  K and N_e~10^24~cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;ndash; and lead to black hole mass overestimates by factors ≳10. Our results provide a framework for interpreting hydrogen lines in LRDs and similar systems.

We present the number density of massive (  log (M_*/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;gt; 10.3 ) quiescent galaxies at 2&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;5 using JWST NIRSpec PRISM spectra. This work relies on spectra from RUBIES, which provides excellent data quality and an unparalleled, well-defined targeting strategy to robustly infer physical properties and number densities. We identify quiescent galaxy candidates within RUBIES through principal component analysis and construct a final sample using star formation histories derived from spectro-photometric fitting of the NIRSpec PRISM spectra and NIRCam photometry. By inverting the RUBIES selection function, we correct for survey incompleteness and calculate the number density of massive quiescent galaxies at these redshifts, providing the most complete spectroscopic estimates prior to cosmic noon to date. We find that early massive quiescent galaxies are surprisingly common (≳ 10^-5 Mpc^-3 by 4&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;5), which is consistent with previous studies based on JWST photometry alone and/or in smaller survey areas. We compare our number densities with predictions from six state-of-the-art cosmological galaxy formation simulations. At z&amp;gt;3, most simulations fail to produce enough massive quiescent galaxies, suggesting the treatment of feedback and/or the channels for early efficient formation are incomplete in most galaxy evolution models.

Deep and wide-field near-infrared (NIR) surveys have recently discovered and confirmed ultramassive galaxies (UMGs; log (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;gt;11) spectroscopically at high redshift. However, most are characterized using only ultraviolet (UV)-to-NIR photometry, offering limited insight into obscured star formation and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity. In this work, we add ten far-infrared (FIR)-to-radio passbands to the existing UV-to-NIR catalogs for two spectroscopically confirmed UMGs from the MAGAZ3NE survey, COS-DR3-195616 (z&lt;sub&gt;spec&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.255) and COS-DR1-209435 (z&lt;sub&gt;spec&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.481). Utilizing the full UV-to-radio photometry, we revise our earlier UV-NIR-based interpretation of the nature of these galaxies. While both were previously identified as quiescent, our analysis reveals that 195616 is an unobscured galaxy undergoing quenching, and 209435 is a heavily obscured, actively star-forming UMG. We find that 195616 has already depleted most of its molecular gas and is expected to experience minimal future stellar mass growth. In contrast, 209435 contains a substantial molecular gas reservoir and has a prolonged depletion timescale. It is anticipated to increase 0.34 dex in stellar mass, reaching a stellar mass of log (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) = 11.72 over the next 0.72 Gyr. We present multi-pronged evidence for AGN activity in both UMGs. Our findings support a scenario where AGN feedback in 195616 may have contributed to gas depletion during quenching, while 209435 continues to form stars despite hosting an obscured AGN, suggesting feedback has not yet suppressed star formation. Our work shows the importance of FIR-to-radio observations for accurately inferring the nature and properties of galaxies at z≳3.

We combine James Webb Space Telescope images of the nearby galaxy NGC 5194 in the hydrogen recombination line Pa-alpha (lambda=1.8756 micron) from the Cycle 1 program JWST-FEAST with 21 micron dust continuum images from the Cycle 2 Treasury program JWGT to quantify the difference in the calibration of mid-infrared star formation rates (SFR) between HII regions and galaxies. We use the archival HST H-alpha image to correct the Pa-alpha emission for the effects of dust attenuation. Our data confirm previous results that the dust-corrected Pa-alpha flux is tightly correlated with the 21 micron emission at the scales of HII regions. When combined with published JWST data for the HII regions of the galaxy NGC 628 and Spitzer 24 micron data for whole galaxies and for kpc-size galaxy regions, we show that the L(24)-L(Pa-alpha) correlation has exponent &amp;gt;1 across six decades in luminosity. In addition, the hybrid 24 micron+H-alpha SFR indicator has a scaling constant about 4.4 times higher for HII regions than for whole galaxies, also in agreement with previous results. Models of stellar populations with a range of star formation histories reveal that the observed trends can be entirely ascribed to and quantified with the contribution to the IR emission by stellar populations older than ~5-6 Myr. Based on the models' results, we provide: (1) a calibration for the infrared SFR across six orders of magnitude in L(24), from HII regions to luminous galaxies, and (2) a prescription for the scaling constant of the hybrid infrared SFR indicators as a function of the star formation timescale.

We study the efficiency of high-e migration as a pathway for Hot Jupiter formation in the dense globular cluster 47 Tuc. Gravitational N-body simulations are performed to investigate the orbital evolution of star-planet systems due to dynamical stellar perturbations. Planetary systems that have been scattered into orbits of sufficiently high eccentricity can undergo tidal circularisation, with Hot Jupiter formation being one possible stopping condition. We also account for the possibility of (i) ionisation due to high-energy encounters, (ii) tidal disruption of the planet by tidal forces inside the Roche limit and (iii) Warm Jupiter formation. The orbital evolution of a population of cold Jupiter progenitors, with initial semi-major axes between 1-30 au, is simulated over 12 Gyr using a simplified dynamical model of 47 Tuc. Our computational treatment of dynamical encounters yields an overall HJ occurrence rate of F_HJ = 5.9 x 10^-4 per cluster star (a 51 per cent enhancement relative to the analytic baseline). The probability of Hot Jupiter formation is highest in the core and falls off steeply beyond a few parsecs from the centre of the cluster, where the stellar density is too low to drive efficient eccentricity diffusion. The code can be found here: https://github.com/James-Wirth/HotJupiter.

Observations indicate that high-redshift galaxies undergo episodic star formation bursts, driving strong outflows that expel gas and suppress accretion. We investigate the consequences for metal and dust content of galaxies at z≥\!5 using our semi-analytical model, ASHVINI. We track gas-phase and stellar metallicities (Z_g, Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;) and dust mass (M_d) in dark matter haloes spanning M_h = 10^6 - 10^11 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, comparing continuous and bursty star formation scenarios, which reflect underlying assumptions of instantaneous and delayed feedback, and we allow for metallicity-dependent feedback efficiency. Delayed feedback induces oscillations in Z_g and Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;, with Z_g declining sharply at low stellar and halo masses. This decline shifts to higher stellar and halo masses as the redshift decreases. Reionization introduces significant scatter, producing an upturn followed by rapid Z_g decline. Metallicity-dependent feedback moderates this decline at z=7-10, flattening the Z_g-mass relation to ≃ 0.03 - 0.04 Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. Dust production tracks Z_g but is sensitive to burst history, causing delayed enrichment. Our results show that burst-driven feedback decouples Z_g and Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;, imprints intrinsic scatter in mass-metallicity relations, and delays dust growth. These effects are strongest in low-mass halos (M_h~ 10^7 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;), where shallow potentials amplify the impact of feedback. Our results are consistent with recent hydrodynamical and semi-analytical simulations and provides context for interpreting JWST metallicity and dust measurements, highlighting the importance of episodic star formation in early galaxy chemical evolution.

Our observations with the James Webb Space Telescope have made the remarkable discovery of strong gravitational lensing arcs from XLSSC 122 (z=1.98) - setting the record for the most distant galaxy cluster that exhibits strong lensing. The discovery of giant arcs enables a strong-lensing analysis and a measurement of the concentration of the dark matter halo. We perform a strong-lensing analysis of the cluster and measure the radial projected mass density profile. Our measurements reveal an exceptionally high concentration in the core of XLSSC 122. A Navarro&amp;ndash;Frenk&amp;ndash;White profile fit to the inner 100 kpc estimates the concentration to be 6.3±0.5. The high concentration of XLSSC 122 contributes to the emerging picture that massive structure formation in the early universe may proceed more rapidly than standard models suggest. We estimate the mass within 100 kpc to be M(R&amp;lt;100 kpc) = 6.5±0.7×10^13 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. Our mosaic images are made public at https://kylefinner.github.io/xlssc122 .

Understanding the role of high-redshift protoclusters in cosmic reionization is essential to unveiling the early stages of structure formation. Using deep imaging and spectroscopy from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) JADES Deep Survey in GOODS-South, we identify two prominent protoclusters at z&amp;gt;7 and investigate their environmental properties in comparison to field galaxies. Protocluster members exhibit systematically higher ionizing photon production efficiency ( &amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt; ) and inflated [OIII]/H&amp;beta; ratios at fixed UV magnitude or stellar mass, likely driven by young, metal-poor stellar populations and intense star formation. Despite these properties, their Ly&amp;alpha; emission is weak or absent, and they show high proximate neutral hydrogen column densities, suggesting insufficient ionizing output to maintain ionized bubbles. We also find that a strong Ly&amp;alpha; emitter (LAE), JADES-GS-z7-LA, may lie within the same ionized region as one protocluster. Although their Lyman continuum escape fractions (f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 0.1) are comparable to those of LAEs, individual protocluster galaxies are faint (M_UV &amp;gt; -19) and low-mass (log(M_*/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) ~ 8.5). The enhanced number density within protoclusters boosts the local UV luminosity density by nearly 1 dex. The surrounding gas remains largely neutral, suggesting that reionization was highly patchy and modulated by environment. The protocluster galaxies likely host ionization-bounded nebulae with holes, suppressing Ly&amp;alpha; visibility, in contrast to field galaxies that are more consistent with density-bounded nebulae.

We present spatially resolved maps of morphology, kinematics, and energetics of warm ionized gas in six powerful radio galaxies at z=3.5-4, using JWST/NIRSpec IFU to quantify jet-driven feedback in the early universe. All sources exhibit broad [OIII] emission-line profiles with W80 (line width) values of 950-2500 km/s across ~10s of kpc, signifying large-scale outflows. The outflowing nebulae are preferentially aligned with the radio jet axis, suggesting jet-driven origin. On average, the regions with the broadest lines and highest velocities are co-spatial with radio lobes or cores, and exhibit the strongest kinetic power. Ionized gas masses associated with the outflows span 1 to 8 × 10^9  M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, with total mass outflow rates of 80-950 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;/yr and kinetic powers between 10^43.2 and 10^45.0 erg/s. The outflow kinetic power corresponds to 0.15%-2% of the AGN bolometric luminosity, sufficient to impact galaxy evolution. However, only ≲ 1&amp;percnt; of the jet mechanical energy couples to the warm ionized gas via outflows, consistent with predictions from hydrodynamic simulations. A large fraction of the jet energy may instead reside in shock-heated hot gas, supported by X-ray detection, or used to thermalize the gas and produce the observed emission-line nebulae. Our results demonstrate that radio jets in massive, gas-rich systems at high-redshift can inject significant kinetic and thermal energy to the surroundings, providing direct evidence for jet-driven feedback operating during the peak epoch of galaxy formation.

&lt;p&gt;
We present high-resolution ALMA [CII] 158 micron observations and JWST/NIRCam+MIRI imaging of MAMBO-9, a pair of optically-dark, dusty star-forming galaxies at z=5.85. MAMBO-9 is among the most massive, gas-rich, and actively star-forming galaxies at this epoch, when the Universe was less than 1 Gyr old. The new, 400 pc-resolution [CII] observations reveal velocity gradients in both objects; we estimate dynamical masses and find a relative mass ratio of 1:5. The kinematics of both objects suggest both rotation and strong tidal interaction, suggesting that the pair has already experienced a close encounter. Indeed, the new JWST imaging reveals a continuous bridge of moderately dust-obscured material between the two. We perform spatially-resolved SED fitting using the high-resolution ALMA+JWST imaging, finding that the majority of recent star-formation is concentrated in extremely obscured (A_V &amp;gt; 10) clouds, while the majority of rest-optical light (stellar continuum and H&amp;alpha; emission) is emergent from moderate-to-highly obscured (A_V~ 1-5) regions on the outskirts. Combining our new stellar and dynamical mass measurements with previous CO observations, we find that the mass budget of MAMBO-9 requires a CO-to-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion factor (&amp;alpha;_CO) of roughly unity, indicative of a highly metal-enriched ISM. Finally, we show that MAMBO-9 resides in a large overdensity spanning the PRIMER-COSMOS field, with 39 galaxies spectroscopically confirmed within ~ 25 cMpc. With a total baryonic mass ~ 10^11 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, MAMBO-9 can be considered a prototype of massive galaxy formation and likely progenitor of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in the lower-redshift Universe.

&lt;p&gt;
We present the analysis of an ancient galaxy at z=2.675 which we dub "Eridu.'' Simultaneously modeling the JWST/NIRSpec G140M and G235M spectra from the SMILES program and 0.4-25 &amp;mu;m HST, JWST/NIRCam, and JWST/MIRI photometry from the the JADES+SMILES photometric catalogs shows that Eridu is massive and quiescent with stellar mass log(M_*/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;)=10.96^+0.01_-0.01 and average star formation rate &amp;lt;1 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1 over the last 100 Myr. Star formation histories inferred from various models produce disconcertingly early and fast formation within ~300 Myr of the Big Bang and quenching 2 Gyr prior to observation (z~10). This stellar mass assembly implies that the progenitor of Eridu had M_*≈10^11 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; at z&amp;gt;10, nearly two orders of magnitude more than the most massive current high redshift observations. From Eridu's spectrum we infer [Mg/Fe] =+0.65^+0.20_-0.19, indicating its stellar population is extremely &amp;alpha;-enhanced, which is consistent with the rapid formation timescale inferred from its star formation history. Eridu inhabits a massive protostructure which offers additional explanations for rapid mass assembly and quenching via environmental mechanisms, e.g. major mergers. Though its inferred formation is at odds with observations of the brightest cosmic dawn galaxies, we anticipate that future high-redshift galaxy formation models and sophisticated stellar population modeling codes will unearth how Eridu formed at the dawn of time.

&lt;p&gt;
A comprehensive account of the cosmic star-formation history demands an accurate census of dust-enshrouded star formation over cosmic time. We provide strong new constraints from a large sample of 777 red galaxies, selected based on their dust-reddened, rest-frame UV-optical emission. This sample of 777 galaxies spans 1 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 8 and is selected from PRIMER JWST NIRCam and HST COSMOS optical data, ensuring robust colour criteria. The SEDs indicate that these dust-reddened galaxies are star-forming, with median SFR ~ 40M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;yr^-1 and stellar mass log(M_*/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) = 10.3^+0.6_-0.8; each exceeds the corresponding medians of the full JWST-detected population by over two dex. Our sample thus clearly shows that red galaxies dominate the high-mass end: they comprise 72 &amp;percnt; of galaxies with log(M/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;gt; 10 at z = 3.3, rising to 91&amp;percnt; by z ~ 7 (albeit with large uncertainties at the highest redshifts). Crucially, we find that the number density of massive red star-forming galaxies at z ~ 6 is sufficient to explain the abundance of quiescent galaxies at z &amp;gt; 3, consistent with typical quenching timescales allowed in the ~ 1Gyr interval from z ~ 6 to z ~ 3. This large abundance yields a substantial contribution to the cosmic star-formation rate density: at z ~ 4, red galaxies provide  &amp;rho;_SFR = 3.9^+0.6_-0.5 × 10^-2 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1Mpc^-3, and at z ~ 5 they supply nearly 40 &amp;percnt; of the total &amp;rho;_SFR. This exceeds the contribution of bright sub(mm)-selected dusty star-forming galaxies by more than an order of magnitude. Future deeper and wider ALMA surveys will provide further opportunities to strengthen and extend our results in our quest to fully quantify the contribution of dust-obscured activity to &amp;rho;_SFR at high redshifts.

Spatially resolved gas-phase metallicity maps are a crucial element in understanding the chemical evolution of galaxies. We present spatially resolved metallicity maps obtained from NIRISS/WFSS observations. This is the first such work presenting multiple individual galaxies. We investigate the source of ionisation, metallicity and its relation to star-formation in a spatially-resolved sense for a sample of eight galaxies &amp;ndash; four from JWST-PASSAGE and four from GLASS-JWST ERS. All but one galaxy are in the redshift range 1.9 ≤ z ≤ 2, the outlier being at z = 3.1. Our sample covers a range of 8.0 &amp;lt; logM &amp;lt; 9.5 in stellar mass, 0.2 &amp;lt; log(SFR/\M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;pyr) &amp;lt; 1.1 in star-formation rate (SFR) and 7.8 &amp;lt; logOH &amp;lt; 9.0 in global metallicity. As a solution to the challenge of SF-AGN demarcation in absence of resolved \halpha, we present a new SF-demarcation line in the itOHNO parameter space based on MAPPINGS v5.1 publicly available \hii region model grids. We present the mass-metallicity gradient relation for our sample, which showed no clear trend with stellar mass, perhaps hinting at the fact that the high-z galaxies have not yet started their accretion dominated phase. By interpreting the correlation between spatially resolved metallicity and SFR maps as a proxy for effective timescales of metal-transport in galaxies, we find a weak trend such that this timescale increases with stellar mass, implying a more effective feedback in lower mass galaxies.

Understanding the morphological structures of Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) is crucial for unveiling their formation pathways and the physical origins of Ly&amp;alpha; emission. However, the evolution of their sizes and structural scaling relations remains debated. In this study, we analyze a large sample of 876 spectroscopically confirmed LAEs at 3 ≲ z &amp;lt; 7, selected from the MUSE, VANDELS, and CANDELSz7 surveys in the GOODS-S, UDS, and COSMOS fields. Utilizing deep, high-resolution near-infrared images from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we measure their rest-frame UV and optical V-band effective radii (R_e) through two-dimensional S\'ersic profile fitting. Our results show that these LAEs are generally compact with weak size evolution, following R_e,UV &amp;prop; (1 + z)^-0.91 ± 0.10 and R_e,V &amp;prop; (1 + z)^-0.93 ± 0.18, respectively. Their UV and optical sizes are statistically comparable, indicating negligible UV-to-optical color gradients. For the first time, we establish the rest-frame optical size-mass relation for LAEs at z&amp;gt;3, finding slopes comparable to typical star-forming galaxies (SFGs), but with slightly smaller sizes at a given stellar mass. These results provide important clues for understanding the formation mechanisms and structural evolution of LAEs in the early universe.

We present measurements of the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF) in three redshift bins over z~5.5-14 from the JWST COSMOS-Web survey. Our samples, selected using the dropout technique in the HST/ACS F814W, JWST/NIRCam F115W, and F150W filters, contain a total of 3099 galaxies spanning a wide luminosity range from faint (M_UV~-19 mag) to bright (M_UV~-22.5 mag). The galaxies are undergoing rapid star formation, with blue stellar populations. Surprisingly, their median UV spectral slope &amp;beta; does not evolve at z&amp;gt;8, suggesting minimal dust, or physical separation of dust and star formation at early epochs. The measured UVLF exhibits an excess at the bright-end (M_UV&amp;lt;-21 mag) compared to pre-JWST empirical results and theoretical predictions of an evolving Schechter function, with the excess beginning at z~9 and becoming increasingly prominent toward z~12. Our analysis suggests that reproducing the observed abundance of UV-bright galaxies at high redshift requires a combination of physical processes, including elevated star formation efficiencies, moderate levels of stochasticity in galaxy luminosities, and minimal dust attenuation.

The chemical composition of the inner regions of disks around young stars will determine the properties of planets forming there. Many disk physical processes drive the chemical evolution, some of which depend on/correlate with the stellar properties. We aim to explore the connection between stellar properties and inner disk chemistry, using mid-infrared spectroscopy. We use JWST-MIRI observations of a large, diverse sample of sources to explore trends between C_2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Additionally, we calculate the average spectrum for the T Tauri (M_*&amp;gt;0.2 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) and very low-mass star (VLMS, M_*≤0.2 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) samples and use slab models to determine the properties. We find a significant anti-correlation between the flux ratio of C_2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and the stellar luminosity. Disks around VLMS have significantly higher F_C_2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/F_H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O flux ratios than their higher-mass counterparts. We also explore trends with the strength of the 10 &amp;mu;m silicate feature, stellar accretion rate, and disk dust mass, all of which show correlations with the flux ratio, which may be related to processes driving the carbon-enrichment in disks around VLMS, but also have degeneracies with system properties. Slab model fits to the average spectra show that the VLMS H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O emission is quite similar in temperature and column density to a warm (~600 K) H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O component in the T Tauri spectrum, indicating that the high C/O gas phase ratio in these disks is not due to oxygen depletion alone. Instead, the presence of many hydrocarbons, including some with high column densities, points to carbon enhancement in the disks around VLMS. The observed differences in the inner disk chemistry as a function of host properties are likely to be accounted for by differences in the disk temperatures, stellar radiation field, and the evolution of dust grains.

Recently, the Covarying Coupling Constants and Tired Light (CCC+TL) hybrid model was proposed to explain the unexpectedly small angular diameters of high-redshift galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) that are challenging to reconcile with the &amp;Lambda;CDM model. In this work, we test the CCC+TL model against model-independent Hubble parameter [H(z)] measurements obtained from cosmic chronometers. It turns out that the parameter set optimized for the type-Ia supernova (SN Ia) dataset within the CCC+TL model fails to reproduce the H(z) data, but the &amp;Lambda;CDM model works well. Statistical comparison using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) strongly favors &amp;Lambda;CDM over CCC+TL for the H(z) data, with &amp;Delta; BIC = 60.85. Additionally, the fit of the CCC+TL model to the H(z) data results in a best-fit value for the speed-of-light variation index parameter &amp;alpha; disagreeing with that for the SN Ia data at the ~ 6&amp;sigma; level, demonstrating significant internal tension within the CCC+TL framework.

&lt;p&gt;
The carbon to oxygen (C/O) abundance ratio is a valuable tracer of star formation history, as C and O enrichment occurs on different timescales. However, measurements based on ultraviolet (UV) collisionally excited lines and those based on optical recombination lines may be subject to biases from the abundance discrepancy factor (ADF), which is well established for oxygen but uncertain for carbon. We present precise UV-based measurements of gas-phase C^2+/O^2+ ionic abundance in four H II regions which have prior optical-based measurements, combined with archival UV data for two additional H II regions, in order to establish a reliable abundance scale and to investigate biases between the two methods. We find a clear ADF for the C^2+ ion which is consistent with that of O^2+, assuming a similar temperature structure in the zones of the nebula which these ions occupy. The C/O abundance derived from UV collisional lines and optical recombination lines is therefore also consistent to within &amp;lt;0.1 dex, with an offset of 0.05±0.03 dex in C^2+/O^2+ for the standard T_e method. While the absolute C/H and O/H abundances are subject to large uncertainty from the ADF, our results establish that C/O abundances measured from these different methods can be reliably compared. Thus we confirm the robustness of gas-phase C/O measurements for studying galaxy evolution and star formation timescales, including from rest-UV observations of high redshift galaxies with JWST.

We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of four Luminous Red Novae (LRNe): dusty, extragalactic transients from stellar mergers following common-envelope evolution (CEE) in massive binary stars. Our targets - AT2021blu, AT2021biy, AT2018bwo, and M31-LRN-2015 - span a broad range in progenitor primary masses (≈3-24M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) and post-merger ages (≈1100-3700 days). All four were observed with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) from 5-25&amp;mu;m; AT2021blu and AT2021biy additionally have 5-12&amp;mu;m spectra from the Low-Resolution Spectrometer. These spectra show strong features of oxygen-rich molecules, including water vapor, supporting the recent association of water fountain sources with CEE. Radiative transfer modeling of the spectral energy distributions yields dust masses of ≈4.2×10^-5, 3×10^-4, 7.5×10^-5, and 7.7×10^-4M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; respectively - corresponding to ≈10%, 60%, 6% and 12% of median dust masses in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) at similar phases. Accounting for their occurrence rates, we estimate that LRNe can contribute ~25% as much dust as CCSNe to the cosmic dust budget. Furthermore, the lower expansion velocities of LRNe may reduce dust destruction by reverse shocks compared to CCSNe, potentially increasing this contribution. In addition to dust masses, we use our phJWST observations to measure late-time properties such as the luminosities, temperatures, radii, and dust-to-gas ratios of the merger remnants. Our results highlight the need for broader infrared studies of LRNe to quantify their contribution to the cosmic dust budget, study the evolution of oxygen-rich molecules, and probe the final fates of CEE.

We present a photometric analysis of globular clusters (GCs) in the massive galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1-2403 (z = 0.397) using deep JWST/NIRCam imaging from the PEARLS program. PSF photometry in the F090W, F115W, F150W, and F200W filters was performed with DAOPHOT, yielding a catalog of 2,971 unresolved, point-like sources consistent with a GC population. Artificial star tests indicate 50% completeness at F200W = 30.63 AB mag and 80% completeness at F200W = 30.36 AB mag. Color-magnitude diagrams reveal broad color distributions with increasing scatter toward fainter magnitudes. We apply both the KMM algorithm and Gaussian Mixture Modeling to the F115W-F200W and F150W-F200W color indices, finding limits to possible subpopulations at the highest completeness thresholds. The globular cluster luminosity function (GCLF) is modeled as a log-normal distribution modulated by a hyperbolic tangent completeness function. While the data do not reach the expected turnover magnitude at M_abs = -8.93 mag, the observed luminosity function peaks around M_F200W approximately -12 mag and declines sharply at fainter magnitudes due to incompleteness, probing only the bright tail of the GCLF.

&lt;p&gt;
Recently, Nakajima et al. (2025) presented James Webb Space Telescope observations of the z=6.6 Population III (Pop III) candidate LAP1-B, which is gravitationally lensed by galaxy cluster MACS J0416. We argue that this is the first object to agree with three key theoretical predictions for Pop III stars: (1) formation in extremely low-metallicity halos with virial temperatures ranging from T_vir~ 10^3-10^4~K, (2) a top-heavy initial mass function, and (3) formation of low-mass clusters with ~ a ~few× 1000~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; in massive Pop III stars. LAP1-B is consistent with recently formed Pop III stars hosted in a ~ 5× 10^7~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; dark matter halo, some of which have enriched their surrounding gas either with supernovae or stellar winds. We use the semi-analytic model of Visbal et al. (2020) to predict the abundance of Pop III clusters observable at the high magnification provided by the foreground galaxy cluster MACS J0416. Using fiducial parameters unmodified from previous work, we expect about one observable Pop III galaxy similar to LAP1-B in the range z=6-7. At earlier times, the intrinsic abundance is higher, but Pop III systems would not have been detected because of their increased luminosity distance and lower mass dark matter halos, which would host fewer stars. Thus, we find that LAP1-B was found at the redshift theoretically expected, given current observable limits, despite the fact that most Pop III systems form much earlier.

&lt;p&gt;
In the 7 Ms Chandra Deep Field-South catalog, only one source, XID 912, was highly significantly detected in X-rays but had no formally reported counterparts in the UV, optical, infrared, or radio bands. We identified its potential JWST and VLT VIMOS counterparts and measured the corresponding aperture photometry to construct its spectral energy distribution (SED). We fitted this SED using CIGALE. The results indicate that the source is most likely an off-nuclear ultraluminous X-ray source, rather than a background active galactic nucleus.

We present an analysis of the globular cluster (GC) population in the galaxy cluster RXJ 2129.7+0005 (z = 0.234) based on JWST NIRCam imaging in three filters: F115W, F150W, and F200W. We use this material to provide a detailed look at the color-magnitude distribution of the GCs and their spatial distribution around the central giant galaxy. We identified 3,160 GC candidates brighter than F150W=29.5, and assessed photometric completeness through artificial star tests. We determined that the GCs follow a radial power-law distribution with an index of 1.58 ± 0.04, with the redder GCs exhibiting a slightly greater central concentration. Their spatial distribution is also highly elliptical, closely following the shape of the BCG halo light.

&lt;p&gt;
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and carbonaceous dust have been observed in clumpy circumstellar environments, yet their formation and evolutionary pathways in such environments remain elusive. We aim to characterize the PAH emission in a clumpy planetary nebula to decipher their formation and evolution pathways. We obtained JWST Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) integral field unit spectroscopic observations of two individual knots in the Ring Nebula (NGC 6720), a clumpy planetary nebula, and determine the PAH spectral characteristics. We detect the 3.3 and 11.2 um PAH emission bands in both knots but do not detect PAH emission in the 6-9 um range. We supplement our data with Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) Short-Low 1 (SL1) and SL2 data, containing 11.2, weak 6.2, and weak 7.7 um PAH emission bands. The JWST data confirm the unusual profile of the 11.2 um band, which is very broad and redshifted with respect to typical 11.2 um PAH profiles. We estimate the PAH population to be largely neutral. The relative integrated surface brightness of the 3.3 and 11.2 um bands indicates the presence of small-sized PAHs, consisting of 35 +/- 6 carbon atoms. We find that the PAH emission is concentrated outside of the clumps, in the inter-clump medium, and confirm the existence of enhanced PAH emission in a narrow 'PAH ring' centred on the central star. This morphology suggests that PAHs formed during the Ring Nebula's asymptotic giant branch phase, in the central star's dust-driven wind.

&lt;p&gt;
The first JWST observations of SN 1987A provided clear evidence that a compact object is ionizing the innermost ejecta. Here we analyze a second epoch of JWST NIRSpec and MIRI/MRS observations to better characterize the properties of this region, aided by a higher spectral resolving power for the new NIRSpec data. We confirm the presence of the previously identified narrow lines from the central region; [Ar VI] 4.5292 &amp;mu;m, [Ar II] 6.9853 &amp;mu;m, [S IV] 10.5105 &amp;mu;m, and [S III] 18.7130 &amp;mu;m, and also identify similar components in [Ca V] 4.1585 &amp;mu;m, [Cl II] 14.3678 &amp;mu;m, and possibly [Fe II] 1.6440 &amp;mu;m. These lines are blueshifted by ~ -250 km/s, while the emission region is spatially unresolved and located southeast of the center. The offset and blueshift could imply a kick velocity of 510 ± 55 km/s for the neutron star. We also identify [Ca IV] 3.2068 &amp;mu;m near the center, but it is displaced to the north and has a redshift of ~ 700 km/s. We find that scattering by dust in the ejecta with a typical grain size ~ 0.3 &amp;mu;m can explain the [Ca IV] properties and the absence of other narrow lines at shorter wavelengths, while dust absorption is important at &amp;lambda; ≳ 8 &amp;mu;m. Photoionization models for a pulsar wind nebula and a cooling neutron star are both compatible with the observations, with the exception of the [Fe II] feature. The two models primarily differ at short wavelengths, where new lines are expected to emerge over time as the optical depth of dust in the expanding ejecta decreases.

We present a multiwavelength spectroscopic survey of 23 luminous mid-infrared-selected Type-2 quasars at redshifts z = 0.88 to 3.49. The targets were selected in the SDSS Stripe 82 field based on their bright WISE W4 detections (flux &amp;gt; 5 mJy) and extremely faint or red optical counterparts (e.g., r &amp;gt; 23 or r - W4 &amp;gt; 8.4), designed to identify heavily obscured quasars. Deep near-infrared (Gemini/GNIRS) and optical (Keck/LRIS and KCWI) spectroscopy confirm 23 out of 24 candidates as Type-2 quasars in this redshift range, including 12 objects at z &amp;gt; 2. The spectra exhibit strong rest-frame UV and optical emission lines (Ly-alpha, C IV, [O III], H-alpha) with a wide range of line widths, indicating significant spectral diversity. Approximately one-third of the sample (8 of 23) shows broad H-alpha emission (FWHM &amp;gt; 2000 km/s) despite their Type-2 classification, while the rest have only narrow lines (FWHM &amp;lt; 2000 km/s) characteristic of classical obscured quasars. Notably, these broad-line Type-2 quasars share similar spectral energy distributions with the JWST-discovered "little red dot" (LRD) AGNs, suggesting that our sample could be lower-redshift analogues of the heavily obscured broad-line AGNs uncovered by JWST. We also find that the [O III] 5007 angstrom emission is relatively weak for their high bolometric luminosities, deviating from trends seen in lower-redshift Type-2 QSOs. A new composite spectrum for Type-2 QSOs is built using our sample. Overall, our results demonstrate that mid-IR selection efficiently uncovers a diverse population of obscured quasars and that spectroscopic follow-up is crucial for revealing their true nature. This study provides new insights into heavily obscured SMBH growth at cosmic noon and bridges the gap to the obscured AGN populations now being revealed by JWST.

Near-infrared imaging is a powerful technique in observational astronomy, but the bright background, primarily from the Earth\'s atmosphere, makes the detection of faint features particularly challenging. To recover low surface brightness (LSB) structures in such data, we present NASIM (Near-infrared Automated low Surface brightness reduction In Maneage), a fully automated and reproducible data reduction pipeline optimised for VISTA/VIRCAM observations. NASIM builds on GNU Astronomy Utilities (Gnuastro) to effectively remove large-scale instrumental artefacts while preserving faint, diffuse emission. As a key science application, we focus on deep Ks-band observations of the Euclid Deep Field South (KEDFS), one of the deepest VISTA/VIRCAM datasets and a high-priority field for synergy with current and future facilities, including Euclid, JWST, LSST, Roman, Spitzer, and ALMA. With VIRCAM no longer operational, KEDFS now stands as a unique legacy dataset. We release selected tiles from the KEDFS survey and highlight science cases, including galaxy outskirts, LSB galaxies, and intracluster light, that demonstrate NASIM\'s ability to recover diffuse structures. A direct comparison with conventional VISTA data reduction pipelines demonstrates the advantages of NASIM in preserving diffuse emission without compromising compact source detection. All quantitative results presented in this paper are fully reproducible with Maneage (commit 4d32667).

&lt;p&gt;
As part of the JWST GTO program MINDS, we analyze the mid-infrared emission of three Class II binary systems: VW Cha, WX Cha, and RW Aur, to investigate the impact of stellar multiplicity on the chemistry and physics of their inner disk. We analyze the 1D spectrum from JWST/MIRI-MRS for primary and secondary disks separately, extracted by combining forward modeling with a theoretical PSF and aperture photometry. We modeled the molecular lines with 0D slab models. We interpret the results by comparing our JWST spectra to VLT/CRIRES+, Spitzer/IRS, and ALMA. Primary and secondary disks are dramatically different in their mid-infrared emission, with primary disks showing H2O-rich spectra, and secondary disks being mostly line poor to the sensitivity of our spectra. When comparing MIRI-MRS to Spitzer/IRS, we observe large variability in the line emission of VW Cha A, as well as in the continuum of RW Aur A. The disks around VW Cha BC and RW Aur B show evidence of ionizing radiation, and a further comparison with ALMA at high angular resolution dust continuum suggest that the spectrum of RW Aur B is well explained by its ~4 au cavity. All the systems show [Ne II] jet emission, and three of them also show spatially resolved emission structures in H2, likely originated by outflows and dynamical interactions. Many of the observed features in the primary disks, such as enhanced water emission, could be linked to the increased accretion and radial drift produced by dynamical disk truncation. However, additional mechanisms are needed to explain the large differences between primary and secondary disks, potentially inner disk substructures. This work is an example of the need for combining multiple facilities to fully understand the observations from JWST.

With excellent spectral and angular resolutions and, especially, sensitivity, the JWST allows us to observe infrared emission lines that were previously inaccessible or barely accessible. These emission lines are promising for evaluating the physical conditions in different galaxies. Based on \sc MAPPINGS V photoionization models, we systematically analyze the dependence of over 20 mid-infrared (mid-IR) emission lines covered by the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) onboard JWST on the physical conditions of different galactic environments, in particular narrow line regions (NLRs) in active galactic nuclei (AGN). We find that mid-IR emission lines of highly ionized argon (i.e., [Ar~\small V]7.90,13.10) and neon (i.e., [Ne~\small V]14.32,24.32, [Ne~\small VI]7.65) are effective in diagnosing the physical conditions in AGN. We accordingly propose new prescriptions to constrain the ionization parameter (U), peak energy of the AGN spectrum (E_peak), metallicity (12+log (O/H)), and gas pressure (P/k) in AGN. These new calibrations are applied to the central regions of six Seyfert galaxies included in the Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS) as a proof of concept. We also discuss the similarity and difference in the calibrations of these diagnostics in AGN of different luminosities, highlighting the impact of hard X-ray emission and particularly radiative shocks, as well as the different diagnostics in star-forming regions. Finally, we propose diagnostic diagrams involving [Ar~\small V]7.90 and [Ne~\small VI]7.65 to demonstrate the feasibility of using the results of this study to distinguish galactic regions governed by different excitation sources.

We present the 2025 release of the spectral synthesis code Cloudy, highlighting significant enhancements to the scope and accuracy of the physics which have been made since the previous release. A major part of this development involves resolving the Lyman &amp;alpha; line into j-resolved fine-structure doublets, making Cloudy of use to the X-ray community. On this front, we have also updated inner-shell ionization line energies and incorporated the 1 keV feature commonly observed in X-ray binaries. Additionally, we update our in-house database, Stout, for the carbon isoelectronic sequence, improving Cloudy microphysical calculations for all wavelengths. We have also extended the molecular network by adding new silicon-bearing species, titanium-related reactions, and phosphorus-containing molecules, enhancing Cloudy's ability to model the complex chemistry relevant to rapidly growing field of exoplanet atmospheres. Finally, we outline future developments aimed at maximizing the scientific return from the current and upcoming generation of observatories, including XRISM, JWST, Roman, the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) and NewAthena.

The formation and evolution of galaxies are intricately linked to the baryon cycle, which fuels star formation while shaping chemical abundances within galaxies. Investigating the relationship between star formation and metallicity for large samples of galaxies requires expensive IFU surveys or sophisticated tools to analyze grism data. Here we analyze JWST NIRISS slitless grism data using Sleuth, a tool that forward models and infers spatially resolved physical properties from grism data, including observations from JWST NIRISS/NIRCam and future grism data like that from the Roman Space Telescope. Sleuth enables extraction of high-quality emission line maps from slitless spectra, overcoming contamination and spatially varying stellar populations, which previously limited such studies. Utilizing Sleuth with data from the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS), we investigated the relationship between metallicity and star formation in the star-forming clumps of galaxies at 0.6 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 1.35. We analyzed a sample of 20 galaxies, extracted high-quality emission line maps with Sleuth, and analyzed, in detail, the spatially resolved properties of star-forming clumps. Using H&amp;alpha;, [SII], and [SIII] emission line maps, we examined the spatially resolved metallicities, ionization, and star formation rates of our sample. Our findings reveal that these star-forming clumps show lower metallicities (~ 0.1 dex) than their surrounding galactic environments, indicating a metallicity dilution of 20 &amp;percnt; within the clumps' gas. Our analysis indicates that these clumps exhibit intensified star formation and reduced metallicity, likely due to the inflow of metal-poor gas. These clumps illustrate the dynamic relationship between star formation and chemical enrichment within galaxies.

&lt;p&gt;
We present a novel formation channel for supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries in the early Universe, driven by primordial black holes (PBHs). Using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the role of massive PBHs (m_BH ~ 10^6 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) in catalyzing the formation of direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs), providing a natural in situ pathway for binary SMBH formation. PBHs enhance local overdensities, accelerate structure formation, and exert thermal feedback on the surrounding medium via accretion. Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation from accreting PBHs suppresses H2 cooling, shifting the dominant gas coolant to atomic hydrogen. When combined with significant baryon-dark matter streaming velocities (v_b&amp;chi; ≳ 0.8 &amp;sigma;_b&amp;chi;, where &amp;sigma;_b&amp;chi; is the root-mean-square streaming velocity), these effects facilitate the formation of dense, gravitationally unstable, atomically cooling gas clouds in the PBH's wake. These clouds exhibit sustained high inflow rates (M&amp;#775;_infall ≳ 0.01 - 0.1 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1), providing ideal conditions for DCBH formation from rapidly growing supermassive stars of ~ 10^5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; at redshifts z ~ 20 - 10. The resulting systems form SMBH binaries with initial mass ratios q ~ O(0.1) and separations of ~ 10 pc. Such PBH-DCBH binaries provide testable predictions for JWST and ALMA, potentially explaining select high-z sources such as the Little Red Dots (LRDs), and represent gravitational-wave sources for future missions like LISA and TianQin-bridging early-Universe black hole physics, multi-messenger astronomy, and dark matter theory.

&lt;p&gt;
This paper presents the first study of the most massive globular cluster (GC) in the Milky Way, omega Centauri, employing recently acquired JWST deep images. By combining these data with archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images, we derived proper motions (PMs) for a significant portion of the JWST field. Our analysis of the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) reveals two prominent sequences extending from a magnitude F322W2 ~ 17.5 to the bottom of the main sequence (MS). These sequences correspond to the two main stellar populations of omega Centauri: the bMS (He-rich) and rMS (He-normal) populations. The two sequences intersect at the MS knee (F322W2 ~ 19.5) and change positions for lower magnitudes, with the bMS luminosity function (LF) ending at least ~0.5 magnitudes brighter than the rMS LF. We identified a third group of stars (named gMS) along the main sequence located between the two primary ones and conducted a detailed analysis of the LFs and MFs for these three stellar populations. The LFs of these sequences show similar trends, with the rMS being the most populated and the bMS the least. The MFs display distinct power-law slopes: the rMS is well fitted by a single power-law while the gMS and the bMS are characterised by MFs steeper than that of the rMS for masses larger than 0.2 solar masses and flatter MFs for smaller masses. The flattening around ~0.2 solar masses for the gMS and the bMS might be a real feature of the MFs of these populations or due to uncertainties in the adopted mass-luminosity relationship (MLR). The variation in the slope of the MFs of the gMS and bMS contributes to the steepening (flattening) of the combined MF for masses higher (lower) than 0.2 solar masses.

We present the first astrophysical detection of methanol (CH3OH) in the torsional band near 25 um. Using high resolution mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy, we identified over seventy gas-phase CH3OH absorption lines between 20 and 28 um towards the massive protostar NGC 7538 IRS 1 with SOFIA/EXES. We derive a temperature of 180 K and a total column density of 2 x 10^17 cm-2, comparable to sub-mm measurements. Complementary analysis of acetylene (C2H2) absorption lines is also included. Both CH3OH and C2H2 reveal an unresolved second velocity component. These MIR absorption lines likely probe the molecular material in two edge-on disks, supporting the scenario that NGC 7538 IRS 1 consists of multiple protostars. We provide an updated line list for the torsional band of CH3OH, which was generated from lab work and model calculations. This discovery and the updated line list will enable the search for CH3OH in JWST/MIRI spectra.

JWST has revealed a new high-redshift population called little red dots (LRDs). Since LRDs may be in the early phase of black hole growth, identifying them in the early universe is crucial for understanding the formation of the first supermassive black holes. However, no robust LRD candidates have been identified at z&amp;gt;10, because commonly-used NIRCam photometry covers wavelengths up to ~5 &amp;mu; m and is insufficient to capture the characteristic V-shaped spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of LRDs. In this study, we present the first search for z≳10 LRD candidates using both NIRCam and MIRI imaging from COSMOS-Web, which provides the largest joint NIRCam-MIRI coverage to date (0.20 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Taking advantage of MIRI/F770W to remove contaminants, we identify one robust candidate, CW-LRD-z10 at z&lt;sub&gt;phot&lt;/sub&gt;=10.5^+0.7_-0.6 with M_UV=-19.9^+0.1_-0.2 mag. CW-LRD-z10 exhibits a compact morphology, a distinct V-shaped SED, and a non-detection in F115W, all consistent with being an LRD at z~10. Based on this discovery, we place the first constraint on the number density of LRDs at z~10 with M_UV~-20 of 1.2^+2.7_-1.0×10^-6 Mpc^-3 mag^-1, suggesting that the fraction of LRDs among the overall galaxy population increases with redshift, reaching ~3&amp;percnt; at z~10. Although deep spectroscopy is necessary to confirm the redshift and the nature of CW-LRD-z10, our results imply that LRDs may be a common population at z&amp;gt;10, playing a key role in the first supermassive black hole formation.

Recent JWST observations have revealed a puzzling population of optically red and compact galaxies with peculiar "V"-shaped spectra at high redshift, known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). Until now, most spectroscopically confirmed LRDs are found at z &amp;gt; 4 and it has been speculated that LRDs are tracing the early stages of black hole evolution. We report an independent rediscovery of a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN), SDSS J102530.29+140207.3, at z = 0.1, which shows spectral features matching those of LRDs seen in the early Universe, including the V-shaped spectrum, broad Balmer lines (with widths of 1000-2000 km/s), and deep Balmer absorption. We present a new GTC observation of this LRD, which reveals an optical continuum similar to those of G-to-K giant stars including an unambiguous G-band absorption originating from the CH molecule. In addition, this local LRD shows a series of absorption lines potentially related to low-ionization ions or atoms but are deeper than what is observed in empirical stellar templates. We further identify a series of [FeII] emission lines indicative of low-ionization gas, which we find also present in an JWST-selected LRD at z = 2.26. We find small but statistically significant variability in H&amp;alpha; consistent with previous findings. Finally, with the new X-ray observation from NuSTAR, we confirm the extreme X-ray weakness of this LRD, which might imply Compton-thick gas obscuration with N_H&amp;gt;10^24~cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. All evidence suggests SDSS J102530.29+140207.3 has a complex gaseous environment and the strong ionic, atomic, and molecular absorptions are hard to explain with typical stellar and AGN models.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled unexpectedly massive galaxy candidates at high redshifts, challenging standard &amp;Lambda;CDM cosmological predictions. In this work, we study the predictions of more realistic dark matter halo models combined with modified matter power spectra for interpreting JWST observations of high-redshift galaxies. We employ three halo mass functions: the conventional Sheth-Tormen (ST) model and two physically motivated alternatives introduced by Del Popolo (DP1 and DP2). Our analysis of cumulative stellar mass densities at z ≃ 8&amp;ndash;10 reveals that the standard ST mass function systematically underpredicts JWST observations, achieving marginal consistency only with high star formation efficiencies. In contrast, the DP1 and DP2 models demonstrate significantly improved agreement with observations even within standard &amp;Lambda;CDM, with statistical consistency within 1&amp;ndash;2&amp;sigma; for moderate star formation efficiencies. When combined with modified power spectra, these refined halo models achieve suitable agreement with JWST data across broad parameter ranges, particularly for steeper spectral indices that amplify high-mass halo formation. Crucially, we find that moderate star formation efficiencies coupled with small-scale power enhancements provide robust reconciliation between theory and observations, eliminating the need for extreme astrophysical assumptions. Our results demonstrate that incorporating realistic halo collapse physics, often neglected in standard analyses, can substantially alleviate apparent tensions between JWST observations and &amp;Lambda;CDM predictions, highlighting the critical importance of small-scale structure formation physics in early cosmic epochs.

We present a systematic study of merging galaxies among Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) using JWST/NIRCam high-resolution imaging data. From a large sample of 817 spectroscopically confirmed LAEs at 3&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;7 in the GOODS-S field, we identify late-stage mergers and interacting systems with fractions of 39.4&amp;percnt;±2.5&amp;percnt; and 60.6&amp;percnt;±6.3&amp;percnt;, respectively. These fractions exhibit significant redshift evolution and depend on both stellar mass (M_*) and UV magnitude (M_UV), being most prevalent in massive (log(M_*/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;gt;8.5) and bright (M_UV&amp;lt;-19.5) systems. At fixed M_* and M_UV, we find negligible differences in the UV slope (&amp;beta;) between late-stage mergers and isolated LAEs; however, a clear bimodal distribution emerges in the M_*-sSFR plane, where isolated LAEs peak at log(M_*/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;)≈7.8 and log(sSFR/yr^-1)≈-7.4, and late-stage mergers peak at log(M_*/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;)≈8.6 and log(sSFR/yr^-1)≈-7.6. Our results reveal two evolutionary classes &amp;ndash; Pristine LAEs, low-mass (M_*&amp;lt;10^8.5M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;), isolated systems that represent early-stage galaxies with minimal merger interactions, and Merger-driven LAEs, massive (M_*&amp;gt;10^8.5M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) systems in which mergers enhance star formation and facilitate the escape of Lyman-alpha photons or accrete pristine LAEs &amp;ndash; both of which are consistent with both observational and theoretical expectations and collectively demonstrate that mergers are a central driver of LAE evolution across the first two billion years.

Among high-redshift galaxies, aside from active galactic nuclei (AGNs), X-ray binaries (XRBs) can be significant sources of X-ray emission. XRBs play a crucial role in galaxy evolution, reflecting the stellar populations of galaxies and regulating star formation through feedback, thereby shaping galaxy structure. In this study, we report a spectroscopically confirmed X-ray emitting galaxy pair (UDF3 and UDF3-2) at z = 2.544. By combining multi-wavelength observations from JWST/NIRSpec MSA spectra, JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging, Chandra, HST, VLT, ALMA, and VLA, we analyze the ionized emission lines, which are primarily driven by H II region-like processes. Additionally, we find that the mid-infrared radiation can be fully attributed to dust emission from galaxy themselves. Our results indicate that the X-ray emission from these two galaxies is dominated by high-mass XRBs, with luminosities of L_X= (1.43±0.40) × 10^42   erg   s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for UDF3, and (0.40±0.12) × 10^42   erg   s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for UDF3-2. Furthermore, we measure the star formation rate (SFR) of 529_-88^+64 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1 for UDF3, placing it ≈ 0.5 dex below the L_X/SFR-z relation. This offset reflects the redshift-dependent enhancement of L_X/SFR-z relation, which is influenced by metallicity and serves as a key observable for XRB evolution. In contrast, UDF3-2, with the SFR of 34_-6^+6 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1, aligns well with the L_X/SFR-z relation. This galaxy pair represents the highest-redshift non-AGN-dominated galaxies with individual X-ray detections reported to date. This finding suggests that the contribution of XRBs to galaxy X-ray emission at high redshift may be underestimated.

&lt;p&gt;
The relation between the masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies encodes information on their mode of growth, especially at the earliest epochs. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has opened such investigations by detecting the host galaxies of AGN and more luminous quasars within the first billion years of the universe (z &amp;gt; 6). Here, we evaluate the relation between the mass of SMBHs and the total stellar mass of their host galaxies using a sample of nine quasars at 6.18 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 6.4 from the Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) survey with NIRCam and NIRSpec observations. We find that the observed location of these quasars in the SMBH-galaxy mass plane (log MBH ~ 8-9; log M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; ~9.5-11) is consistent with a non-evolving intrinsic mass relation with dispersion (0.80_-0.28^+0.23 dex) higher than the local value (~0.3-0.4 dex). Our analysis is based on a forward model of systematics and includes a consideration of the impact of selection effects and measurement uncertainties, an assumption on the slope of the mass relation, and finds a reasonable AGN fraction (2.3%) of galaxies at z ~ 6 with an actively growing UV-unobscured black hole. In particular, models with a substantially higher normalisation in MBH would require an unrealistically low intrinsic dispersion (~0.22 dex) and a lower AGN fraction (~0.6%). Consequently, our results predict a large population of AGNs at lower black hole masses, as are now just starting to be discovered in focused efforts with JWST.

Recent observations by JWST reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of rapidly growing supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe, underscoring the need for improved models for their origin and growth. Employing new full radiative transfer hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation, we investigate the local and intergalactic feedback of SMBH progenitors for the Population III.1 scenario, i.e., efficient formation of supermassive stars from pristine, undisturbed dark matter minihalos. Our cosmological simulations capture the R-type expansion phase of these Pop III.1 stars, with their H-ionizing photon luminosities of ~10^53 s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; generating HII regions that extend deep into the intergalactic medium, reaching comoving radii of r_HII~ 1 cMpc. We vary both the Pop III.1 ionization flux and cosmological formation environments, finding the former regulates their final r_HII, whereas the latter is more important in setting their formation redshift. We use the results from our radiation-hydrodynamics simulations to estimate the cosmic number density of SMBHs, n_SMBH, expected from Pop III.1 progenitors. We find n_SMBH~10^-1 cMpc^-3, consistent with the results inferred from recent observations of the local and high redshift universe. Overall, this establishes Pop III.1 progenitors as viable candidates for the formation of the first SMBHs, and emphasises the importance of exploring heavy mass seed scenarios.

The unexpectedly high abundance of galaxies at z &amp;gt; 11 revealed by JWST has sparked a debate on the nature of early galaxies and the physical mechanisms regulating their formation. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has begun to provide vital insights on their gas and dust content, but so far only for extreme 'blue monsters'. Here we present new, deep ALMA observations of JADES-GS-z11-0, a more typical (sub-L^*) z &amp;gt; 11 galaxy that bridges the discovery space of JWST and the Hubble Space Telescope. These data confirm the presence of the [O III] 88 &amp;mu;m line at 4.5&amp;sigma; significance, precisely at the redshift of several faint emission lines previously seen with JWST/NIRSpec, while the underlying dust continuum remains undetected (F_&amp;nu; &amp;lt; 9.0   &amp;mu; Jy), implying an obscured star formation rate (SFR) of SFR_IR ≲ 6   M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;   yr^-1 and dust mass of M_dust ≲ 1.0 × 10^6   M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; (all 3&amp;sigma;). The accurate ALMA redshift of z_[O III] = 11.1221 ± 0.0006 (≳ \! 5× refined over NIRSpec) helps confirm that redshifts measured purely from the Lyman-&amp;alpha; break, even spectroscopically, should properly take into account the effects of potential damped Lyman-&amp;alpha; absorption (DLA) systems to avoid systematic overestimates of up to &amp;Delta; z ≈ 0.5. The [O III] 88 &amp;mu;m luminosity of L_[O III] = (1.0 ± 0.3) × 10^8   L&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, meanwhile, agrees well with the scaling relation for local metal-poor dwarfs given the SFR measured by NIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI. The spatially resolved MIRI and ALMA emission also underscores that JADES-GS-z11-0 is likely to consist of two low-mass components that are undergoing strong bursts of star formation yet are already pre-enriched in oxygen (~30% solar), only 400 Myr after the Big Bang.

&lt;p&gt;
Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have suggested the existence of over-massive black holes (OMBHs) in high-redshift galaxies. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism for the formation of OMBHs, based on the accretion of globular clusters (GCs) in compact disk galaxies. We derive the conditions under which OMBHs can form, focusing on key parameters such as halo mass, redshift, and halo spin parameter. Our results show that at redshift z = 10, a halo with mass 10^11~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and a spin parameter of 0.02 can form a black hole of 1.4 × 10^8~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; through GC migration and accretion via tidal disruption events (TDEs). The resulting black hole-to-stellar mass ratio can reach ~ 0.1, corresponding to the fraction of GC mass accreted onto the black hole. This mechanism thus provides a plausible explanation for the OMBHs observed by JWST. Furthermore, by combining our model with halo mass functions and the distribution of spin parameters, we construct black hole mass functions that successfully reproduce the number densities of massive BH candidates at z ~ 5 inferred from JWST observations, and UHZ1 and GHZ9 at z ~ 10.

JWST has shed light on galaxy formation and metal enrichment within 300 Myr of the Big Bang. While luminous galaxies at z &amp;gt; 10 often show significant [O III]&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;4959, 5007 emission lines, it remains unclear whether such features are prevalent among fainter, more typical galaxies due to observational limits. We present deep imaging and spectroscopy of JADES-GS-z14-1 at z&lt;sub&gt;spec&lt;/sub&gt;=13.86^+0.04_-0.05, currently the faintest spectroscopically confirmed galaxy at z≈ 14. It serendipitously received 70.7 hours of MIRI/F770W imaging in the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), the deepest MIRI exposure for any high-redshift galaxy to date. Nonetheless, we detect only tentative F770W emission of 7.9±2.8 nJy at 2.8&amp;sigma; significance, constraining the total equivalent width of [O III]&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;4959, 5007 + H&amp;beta; to 520^+400_-380 A, weaker than most z &amp;gt; 10 galaxies with MIRI detections. This source is unresolved across 16 NIRCam bands, implying a physical radius ≲50 pc. NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy totaling 56 hours reveals no rest-frame ultraviolet emission lines above 3 &amp;sigma;. Stellar population synthesis suggests a stellar mass ~4× 10^7 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and a star formation rate ~ 2 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1. The absence of strong metal emission lines despite intense star formation suggests a gas-phase metallicity below 10% solar and potentially a high escape fraction of ionizing photons. These deep observations provide rare constraints on faint, early galaxies, tracing the onset of chemical enrichment and ionization in the early Universe.

&lt;p&gt;
Discrete symmetry-breaking phase transitions in the early universe may have caused the formation of networks of sheet-like topological defects, usually referred to as domain walls, which separate regions that have settled into different vacuum states. Field theory simulations predict the successive collapse of increasingly larger domains, which could potentially leave observable imprints in present-day large-scale structures. We use the parameter-free velocity-dependent one-scale model to provide an estimate of the final decay energy of these walls and their associated collapse rate, as a function of redshift. The energy released by collapsing walls can act as a seed for density perturbations in the background matter field, influencing structure formation. We estimate the dependence of the current mass of the resulting non-linear objects on the collapse redshift and wall tension, showing that domain walls can contribute to the formation of objects as massive as present-day galaxy clusters. Still, we confirm that the contribution of standard domain walls to structure formation is subdominant. In contrast, biased domain walls generally face much less stringent constraints on their tension, which allows for significantly higher collapse energies. Based on our analysis, we are able to show that the collapse of such biased wall networks can provide a significant contribution to structure formation, and, in particular, a mass excess at z ≳ 7 as suggested by JWST data.

&lt;p&gt;
When dense cores in molecular clouds or filamentary structures collapse and form protostars, they may undergo fragmentation and form binary or multiple systems. In this paper, we investigated the key mechanisms influencing fragmentation by comparing the physical conditions of fragmented and unfragmented dense cores (~0.1 pc) in Orion A. Utilizing archival submillimeter continuum data from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array survey of Class 0 and I protostars at a 0.''1 resolution, we identified 38 dense cores hosting single protostars and 15 cores hosting binary or multiple systems. We measured the dense cores properties with the Herschel dust temperature, Nobeyama 45m N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H^+ J=1-0, and JCMT polarization data. Our results reveal that the dense cores hosting binary/multiple systems exhibit significantly higher density and Mach number compared to those hosting single protostars, while there are no correlations between the occurrence of fragmentation and the energy ratios of turbulence and magnetic field to gravity. Our results suggest that the higher density and supersonic turbulence of the dense cores can lead to local collapse and fragmentation to form binary/multiple systems, while the magnetic field has limited influence on fragmentation in the dense cores in Orion A.

&lt;p&gt;
Intrinsically faint galaxies at z~2-3 offer critical insights into early galaxy formation, tracing low-metallicity, low-mass systems during Cosmic Noon and serving as analogs to reionization-era galaxies. We present ultra-deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of nine low-luminosity galaxies (-17 ≲ M_UV ≲ -20, M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; ≲ 10^9 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) at z~2.5 from the CECILIA program, with ~29.5 hr in G235M/F170LP and 1 hr in G395M/F290LP. Our sample includes four LAEs, three rest-UV color-selected galaxies, and two serendipitous detections &amp;ndash; providing the most sensitive rest-optical spectra of individual faint galaxies at this epoch to date. Balmer-line measurements reveal low SFRs (0.63 &amp;lt; SFR/(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1) &amp;lt; 5.43) and a broad range of dust reddening (0 &amp;lt; E(B-V) &amp;lt; 1), with SFRs systematically below those of continuum-selected galaxies. Electron densities are low (n_e ≲ 200cm^-3), and emission-line diagnostics indicate low [NII]/H&amp;alpha;, high [OIII]/H&amp;beta;, suggesting metallicities 12+log(O/H)≲8.0. We also present the first O1-BPT constraints in such faint high-redshift galaxies. Notably, two galaxies show low [OIII]/H&amp;beta; despite high Ly&amp;alpha; EWs and very low [NII]/H&amp;alpha;, consistent with the predicted turnover in this ratio at very low metallicities &amp;ndash; highlighting the need for complementary diagnostics (e.g., N2, O32) to identify metal-poor systems. Direct T_e-based abundances and expanded samples are needed to further trace metallicity and ionization trends in low-mass galaxies.

&lt;p&gt;
We present the first observations of magnetic fields in pre-planetary nebulae (PPNe) made with the POL-2 polarimeter on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). We observed the PPNe CRL 618 and OH231.8+4.2 in 850 &amp;mu;m polarized light. In both cases, we observe ordered magnetic fields that appear to arise from dusty circumstellar material that has been swept up by the passage of outflows driven by the central post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) star. CRL 618 shows a magnetic field aligned with one of the most extreme position angles of the outflowing bullets ejected from the central source. We hypothesize that polarized emission in CRL 618 may preferentially arise from material in the walls of the dust cavity opened by the ejected bullets. Conversely, OH231.8+4.2 shows a magnetic field that is aligned approximately perpendicular to the outflow direction, which may preferentially arise from an infrared-bright dense clump embedded near the base of the outflow. Despite CRL 618 being carbon-rich and OH231.8+4.2 being oxygen-rich, there is no significant difference in the polarization fractions of the two sources. This suggests that at linear resolutions ~ 10^4 au, the complexity of the magnetic field geometry on scales smaller than the beam, rather than grain composition, sets the measured polarization fraction of these sources.

We investigate the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features of T Cha, a G8-type T Tauri star that has exhibited "seesaw"-type mid-infrared continuum variability over nearly two decades due to the destruction of the disk's inner wall, using JWST/MIRI and Spitzer observations. We report the first detection of weak PAH emission at 6.2, 7.7, and 8.6 microns in the Spitzer/IRS spectrum from 2005. The inner wall destruction in the 2022 JWST epoch allowed more ultraviolet photons to reach the outer disk, increasing the flux levels of PAH bands and enabling their detection well above the continuum. The 11.2 micron PAH flux increases by a factor of three, yet its profile shape remains remarkably stable. The 6.2/11.2 micron flux ratio has increased, but the charge state of the PAH population remains 75% neutral. The PAH features exhibit a "class C" spectral profile, with redshifted peaks and broadened wings consistent with emission from low-mass T Tauri disks. A weak 12.7/11.2 micron ratio points to a lower abundance of duo- and trio-hydrogen modes, implying a predominantly zigzag carbon structure. A faint "class A" sub-component in the 6.2 and 7.7 micron bands may indicate additional PAH processing by ultraviolet radiation from accretion hotspots. Placement on PAH charge-size grids locates T Cha in the low-ionisation, small-size regime (NC ≤ 30), signifying a largely neutral PAH population across multiple epochs spanning 18 years. Through multi-epoch, high-resolution data from JWST and Spitzer, we identify T Cha as a benchmark source for probing disk evolution and PAH processing, emphasizing the potential of temporal monitoring with JWST.

The James Webb Space Telescope has discovered high luminosity galaxies that appear to be "too many" and "too massive" compared to predictions of the Standard LCDM cosmology, suggesting that star formation in the early universe is more rapid than previously anticipated. In this paper we examine in detail the following three effects which can instead provide alternative explanations for these observations: (1) a "top heavy" initial mass function (IMF) for the stars, (2) a variety of star formation histories (constant, exponentially decreasing, and peaked star formation rates), and (3) a variety of initial metallicities. Due to any of these three effects, galaxies of a given luminosity in JWST may be interpreted as having a larger stellar mass than they actually do. Our results are obtained using the Pegase stellar population code, and are presented as the ratio of the modified star formation efficiency relative to the fiducial one (which uses a Salpeter IMF and constant star formation rate). As an example, if the high-mass end of the IMF goes as M^-1.35, the star formation efficiency and inferred stellar galactic mass could be lower by a factor of ~ 10 than in the fiducial case. Our examination (keeping the star formation rate constant) of a top-heavy IMF with slope &amp;alpha; leads to a simple relation that is a good approximation to the numerical results, &amp;epsilon;(&amp;alpha;) ≈ &amp;epsilon;_fide^2.66(&amp;alpha; -2.35). Since there are more low mass galaxies than high mass galaxies, these effects may result in a large number of seemingly overly massive galaxies compared to the expectations. Thus, the effects studied in this paper may explain both puzzling observations regarding high luminosity galaxies in JWST: the apparently overly massive galaxies as well as the profusion of apparently high mass galaxies.

&lt;p&gt;
The Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionization 21 cm Signal (EDGES) has reported evidence for an absorption feature in the sky-averaged radio background near 78 MHz. A cosmological interpretation of this signal corresponds to absorption of 21 cm photons by neutral hydrogen at z ~ 17. The large depth of the signal has been shown to require an excess radio background above the CMB and/or non-standard cooling processes in the IGM. Here, we explore the plausibility of a scenario in which the EDGES signal is back-lit by an excess radio background sourced from a population of radio-loud AGN at high redshift. These AGN could also explain the unexpected abundance of UV-bright objects observed at z &amp;gt; 10 by JWST. We find that producing enough radio photons to explain the EDGES depth requires that nearly all high-z UV-bright objects down to M_UV ≳ -15 are radio-loud AGN and that the UV density of such objects declines by at most 1.5 orders of magnitude between z = 10 and 20. In addition, the fraction of X-ray photons escaping these objects must be ≲ 1&amp;percnt; of their expected intrinsic production rate to prevent the absorption signal being washed out by early IGM pre-heating. Reproducing the sharp boundaries of the absorption trough and its flat bottom requires that the UV luminosity function, the fraction of UV light produced by AGN, and the X-ray escape fraction have fine-tuned redshift dependence. We conclude that radio-loud AGN are an unlikely (although physically possible) candidate to explain EDGES because of the extreme physical properties required for them to do so.

We present a spectroscopic analysis of a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN) selected as little red dot at z = 5.3 behind the Bullet cluster (Bz5.3), based on JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec data. The detection of strong FeII, OI, and CaII triplet emission lines, along with the evidence of broad Balmer lines, provides unambiguous evidence of a broad-line region (BLR) and an accreting supermassive black hole. Notably, we report the first detection of the &amp;lambda;1304 bump (i.e., blend of OI&amp;lambda;1304 and SiII) at high redshift, a feature commonly seen in local AGNs but not yet reported in the early Universe. The OI&amp;lambda;1304/&amp;lambda;8446 photon ratio is highly suppressed (0.1-0.3), implying significant internal dust extinction, with estimated dust attenuation A_V ~ 0.4-1.0. We identify Ly&amp;beta; fluorescence as the dominant excitation mechanism of the low-ionization lines, with additional contributions from collisional excitation. High OI&amp;lambda;8446 equivalent width and weak OI&amp;lambda;7774 support this interpretation. The detection of iron emission, whether from broad permitted or narrow forbidden lines, supports the presence of a stratified BLR, as also recently proposed in local LRDs. Photoionization modeling of OI&amp;lambda;8446 and CaII further suggests the coexistence of multiple gas phases with distinct densities and ionization states, highlighting the complexity of the BLR. Bz5.3 thus offers a rare window into early AGN activity and BLR physics at early times.

JWST observations have revealed an overabundance of bright galaxies at z ≥ 9, creating apparent tensions with theoretical predictions within standard &amp;Lambda;CDM cosmology. We address this challenge using a semi-empirical approach that connects dark matter halos to observed UV luminosity through physically motivated double power-law star formation efficiency (SFE) model as a function of halo mass, redshift and perform joint Bayesian analysis of luminosity functions spanning z = 4 - 16 using combined HST and JWST data. Through systematic model comparison using information criteria (AIC, BIC, DIC), we identify the optimal framework requiring redshift evolution only in the low-mass slope parameter &amp;alpha;(z) while maintaining other SFE parameters constant. Our best-fitting model achieves excellent agreement with observations using modest, constant UV scatter &amp;sigma;_UV = 0.32 dex, significantly lower than the ≳ 1.3 dex values suggested by previous studies for z &amp;gt; 13. This reduced scatter requirement is compensated by strongly evolving star formation efficiency, with &amp;alpha; increasing toward higher redshifts, indicating enhanced star formation in low-mass halos during cosmic dawn. The model also successfully reproduces another important observational diagnostic such as effective galaxy bias across the full redshift range. Furthermore, model predictions are consistent up to a redshift of z~ 20. Our results demonstrate that JWST's early galaxy observations can be reconciled with standard cosmology through the interplay of modest stochasticity and evolving star formation physics, without invoking extreme burstiness or exotic mechanisms.

One of the most remarkable outcomes from JWST has been the exquisite UV-optical spectroscopic data for galaxies in the high-redshift Universe (z ≥ 5), enabling the use of various nebular emission lines to infer conditions of the interstellar medium. In this work, we evaluate the reliability of these diagnostics, specifically those used to recover the star formation rate (SFR), the ionising photon production efficiency, and the gas-phase oxygen abundance. We use forward-modelled galaxy spectra from idealised toy models and the FLARES cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to assess how these diagnostic lines respond to variations in the underlying stellar populations and star-dust geometry. We find that due to the clumpy nature of FLARES galaxies, they exhibit strong internal variation in age, metallicity and dust attenuation, biasing the interpretation using these diagnostics. In FLARES, the SFRD at the bright-end of the SFR function can be underestimated by as much as 30 &amp;percnt; compared to the true values. Similarly, the true ionising photon production efficiency in FLARES remains almost constant with stellar mass, while estimates using H&amp;alpha; or H&amp;beta; can underestimate it by more than 0.5 dex at the massive end (&amp;gt;10^9.5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;), introducing an artificial declining trend. The FLARES mass-metallicity relation derived from line ratios (dust corrected) exhibits a flat trend, whereas the intrinsic mass-weighted relation shows a strong positive correlation. These findings highlight the critical importance of understanding the biases introduced due to the coupling of star-dust geometry and heterogeneous stellar population when interpreting nebular emission lines at high redshift. Hence the accurate interpretation of high-redshift galaxy spectra requires careful forward modelling that accounts for realistic star-dust geometry and population variations.

We present the nebular phase spectroscopic and photometric observations of the nearby hydrogen-rich core-collapse supernova (CC-SN) 2023ixf, obtained through our JWST programs. These observations, combined with ground-based optical and near-infrared spectra, cover +252.67 - 719.96 d, creating a comprehensive, panchromatic time-series dataset spanning 0.32 - 30&amp;mu;m. In this second paper of the series, we focus on identifying key spectral emission features and tracking their evolution through the nebular phase. The JWST data reveal hydrogen emission from the Balmer to Humphreys series, as well as prominent forbidden lines from Ne, Ar, Fe, Co, and Ni. NIRSpec observations display strong emission from the first overtone and fundamental bands of carbon monoxide, which weaken with time as the ejecta cools and dust emission dominates. The spectral energy distribution shows a clear infrared excess emerging by +252.67 d peaking around 10.0&amp;mu;m, with a secondary bump at 18.0&amp;mu;m developing by +719.96 d. We suggest that this evolution could arises from multiple warm dust components. In upcoming papers in this series, we will present detailed modeling of the molecular and dust properties. Overall, this dataset significantly advances our understanding of the mid-infrared properties of CC-SNe, providing an unprecedented view of their late-time line, molecule, and dust emission.

We present an overview of the MINERVA survey, a 259.8 hour (prime) and 127 hour (parallel) Cycle 4 treasury program on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). MINERVA is obtaining 8 filter NIRCam medium band imaging (F140M, F162M, F182M, F210M, F250M, F300M, F360M, F460M) and 2 filter MIRI imaging (F1280W, F1500W) in four of the five CANDELS Extragalactic fields: UDS, COSMOS, AEGIS and GOODS-N. These fields were previously observed in Cycle 1 with 7 - 9 NIRCam filters by the PRIMER, CEERS and JADES programs. MINERVA reaches a 5&amp;sigma; depth of 28.1 mag in F300M and covers ~ 542 arcmin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, increasing the area of existing JWST medium-band coverage in at least 8 bands by ~ 7×. The MIRI imaging reaches a 5&amp;sigma; depth of 23.9 mag in F1280W and covers ~ 275 arcmin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in at least 2 MIRI filters. When combined with existing imaging, these data will provide a photometric catalog with 20-26 JWST filters (depending on field) and 26-35 filters total, including HST. This paper presents a detailed breakdown of the filter coverage, exposure times, and field layout relative to previous observations, as well as an overview of the primary science goals of the project. These include uncovering the physics of enigmatic sources hiding in current broadband catalogs, improving systematics on stellar mass functions and number densities by factors of ≳ 3, and resolved mapping of stellar mass and star formation at 1 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 6. When complete, MINERVA will become an integral part of the treasury deep field imaging datasets, significantly improving population studies with well-understood completeness, robust photometric redshifts, stellar masses, and sizes, and facilitating spectroscopic follow up for decades to come.

This study is denoted to the cosmological "angular size - redshift" test. An analysis is performed of the angular and linear sizes of galaxies from the new ASTRODEEP-JWST catalogue, which contains over 500,000 objects at high redshifts (up to ~20 photometrically determined and up to ~14 spectroscopically determined). For the calculations, 6 860 galaxies with reliably determined spectroscopic redshifts and 319,771 galaxies with known photometric redshifts were used. The linear sizes of galaxies were computed within the framework of two cosmological models - the standard (&amp;Lambda;CDM) model and one of the static models (the so-called "tired light" model). We shown that within the framework of the &amp;Lambda;CDM model, a significant evolution of the linear sizes of galaxies is observed, with the rate of the evolution closely matching the rate of the cosmic expansion. In contrast, in the static model, the characteristic linear sizes of a galaxies exhibit almost no evolution with increasing z.

&lt;p&gt;
Dusty star-forming galaxies have long been suspected to serve as the missing evolutionary bridge between the star-forming and quiescent phases of massive galaxy evolution. With the combined power of JWST and ALMA, it is now possible to use high resolution imaging in rest-optical, rest near-infrared (NIR), and rest-submm wavelengths to study the multi-wavelength morphologies tracing both the stellar populations and dust within this key phase. We present the joint analysis of JWST/NIRCam imaging in GOODS-S and mm dust emission traced by ALMA for a sample of 33 galaxies at z=1.5 to z=5.5 selected from the 1.1mm GOODS-ALMA 2.0 survey, and compare the morphologies of this population to mass and redshift selected samples of field star-forming and quiescent galaxies. The 1.1mm-selected sample are morphologically distinct from other similarly massive star-forming galaxies; we find a steeper size-wavelength gradient from 1.5-4.4&amp;mu;m, with a more dramatic decrease in size towards longer wavelengths. While the rest-NIR surface brightness profiles of the 1.1mm-selected galaxies are brighter in the inner regions relative to the field star-forming population, they are remarkably similar to the quiescent population. These morphological differences could suggest that dusty star-forming galaxies, unlike more typical star-forming galaxies, have already built up stellar mass in a severely dust-obscured core, leading to extended and clumpy morphologies at rest-optical wavelengths and more compact emission in the rest-NIR that is co-spatial with dust. If the bulge is already established, we speculate that mm-selected galaxies may imminently evolve to join their quiescent descendants.

The polar mid-infrared (MIR) emission detected from tens to hundreds of parsecs in some active galactic nuclei (AGN) has been associated with dusty winds driven away by radiation pressure. However, the physical characterization of this extended polar emission remains uncertain. Here we combine 10-21&amp;mu;m JWST/MIRI imaging observations with 7-25 &amp;mu;m MRS integral field spectroscopic observations of 6 nearby, \barD=35.4±4.6~Mpc, AGN from the GATOS Survey to quantify the nature of the extended MIR emission at ~75 pc resolution at 21~&amp;mu;m. These AGN have similar bolometric luminosities, log_10(\barL_bol~[erg s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;])=44.0±0.3, span a wide range of optical outflow rates, M&amp;#775;=0.003-0.21 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1, column densities, log_10(N_H^X-ray [cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;])=22.2-24.3, and Eddington ratios, &amp;lambda;_Edd=0.005-0.06. We find a poor correlation between the line-only and continuum-only images, indicating that the extended MIR continuum emission is spatially uncorrelated with the warm outflows associated with narrow emission lines in the 10-15 &amp;mu;m wavelength range. The 75-450~pc continuum emission has constant dust temperature, T_d=132^+7_-7 K, and mass, M_d=728^+29_-27 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. Using the conditions of energy balance between radiation pressure and gravity, we find that our AGN sample is in the gravitationally bounded regime, consistent with the lack of detection of dusty winds in our observations. At 10~&amp;mu;m, the level of line emission contribution across the NLR is correlated with the outflow kinetic energy and mass outflow rates. We find no correlation with the AGN properties. These results indicate that the radio jet may be triggering the gas outflow and line emission, while the extended dust emission is distributed in molecular clouds and/or shocked regions across the narrow line region.

We present the first JWST+NIRCam images of the giant elliptical active galaxy M87 and its jet at 0.90, 1.50, 2.77 and 3.56 &amp;mu;m. We analysed the large-scale jet structure, identifying prominent components, and determined the near-infrared spectral index. The data were calibrated using the standard JWST pipeline. We subtracted a constant background level and a smooth model of the galaxy surface brightness to isolate the jet. The total image fluxes measured in the NIRCam filters follow the infrared bump pattern seen near 1.6 &amp;mu;m in the spectral energy distribution of M87, caused by the surrounding stellar population in the galaxy. The residual jet images broadly agree with the radio to optical synchrotron power law S_&amp;lambda;&amp;prop;&amp;lambda;^&amp;alpha; with &amp;alpha;=0.7-1.0. We identified the most upstream knot L at a distance of (320±50) mas from the core. The component HST-1, at (950±50) mas from the core, is transversely resolved, and both the individual images and the spectral index map clearly indicate its double-component substructure with two elements of similar size and flux density, with centroids separated by (150±20) mas and with a significantly larger spectral index &amp;alpha; observed in the downstream component (&amp;alpha;_do=0.3) than in the upstream one (&amp;alpha;_up= -0.15). We also observe the counter-jet component located about 24 arcsec away from the nucleus.

Six-hour integration using NIRSpec prism spectroscopy (resolution R≃ 30-300), covering the spectral range 0.8-5.3~&amp;mu; m, reveals a pronounced Ly&amp;alpha;-continuum break at &amp;lambda; ≃ 1.3~&amp;mu; m, and weak optical H&amp;beta; and [OIII]&amp;lambda;4959 emission lines at z=9.625±0.002, located in the reddest part of the spectrum (&amp;lambda; &amp;gt; 5.1~&amp;mu; m). No additional ultraviolet or optical emission lines are reliably detected. A weak Balmer break is measured alongside a very blue ultraviolet slope (&amp;beta; ≤-2.5, F_&amp;lambda; ~ &amp;lambda;^&amp;beta;). Spectral fitting with \tt Bagpipes suggests the Cosmic Gems galaxy is in a post-starburst phase, making it the highest-redshift system currently observed in a mini-quenched state. Spatially resolved spectroscopy at tens pc scales shows relatively uniform features across subcomponents of the arc. These findings align well with physical properties previously derived from JWST/NIRCam photometry of the stellar clusters, now corroborated by spectroscopic evidence. In particular, five observed star clusters exhibit ages of 7-30~Myr. An updated lens model constrains the intrinsic sizes and masses of these clusters, confirming they are extremely compact and denser than typical star clusters in local star-forming galaxies. Additionally, four compact stellar systems consistent with star clusters (≲10 pc) are identified along the extended tail of the arc. A sub-parsec line-emitting HII region straddling the critical line, lacking a NIRCam counterpart, is also serendipitously detected.

&lt;p&gt;
This paper examines the reliability of the Tremaine-Weinberg (TW) method in measuring the pattern speed of barred galaxies at high redshifts. Measuring pattern speeds at high redshift may help to shed light on the time evolution of interactions between galactic bars and dark matter halos. The TW method has been extensively employed for nearby galaxies, and its accuracy in determining bar pattern speeds has been validated through numerical simulations. For nearby galaxies, the method yields acceptable results when the inclination angle of the galaxy and the position angle of the bar fall within appropriate ranges. However, the application of the TW method to high-redshift galaxies remains unexplored in both observations and simulations. For this study we generated mock observations of barred galaxies from the TNG50 cosmological simulation. These simulated observations were tailored to mimic the integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy data that the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) would capture at a redshift of z≃ 1.2. By applying the TW method to these mock observations and comparing the results with the known pattern speeds, we demonstrate that the TW method performs adequately for barred galaxies whose bars are sufficiently long to be detected by JWST at high redshifts. This work opens a new avenue for applying the TW method to investigate the properties of high-redshift barred galaxies.

&lt;p&gt;
Cosmic strings appear in many well-motivated extensions to the standard model of particle physics. If they exist, an abundant population of compact objects known as cosmic string loops permeate the Universe at all times, providing a secondary source of density perturbations that are large amplitude and non-gaussian in nature. In general, these loops are not stationary in the rest frame of the dark matter, thus their relative velocities will typically seed both spherical and filamentary overdensities in the matter era. Building upon previous work, we provide an improved framework to compute the complete halo mass function for these string seeded overdensities, valid for any loop velocity distribution. Using this mass function, we also compute the subset of halos capable of undergoing a direct collapse, forming a population of black holes with initial mass 10^4-5   M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; at high redshifts. Interestingly, for reasonable values of the string parameters, one can reproduce the abundance of "Little Red Dots" as inferred by JWST.

&lt;p&gt;
Star formation from metal-free gas, the hallmark of the first generation of Population III stars, was long assumed to occur in the very early Universe. We report the discovery of MPG-CR3 (Metal-Pristine Galaxy COSMOS Redshift 3; hereafter CR3), an extremely metal-poor galaxy at redshift z= 3.193±0.016. From JWST, VLT, and Subaru observations, CR3 exhibits exceptionally strong Ly&amp;alpha;, H&amp;alpha;, and He I &amp;lambda;10830 emission. We measure rest-frame equivalent widths of EW_0(Ly&amp;alpha;) ≈822 Angstrom and EW_0(H&amp;alpha;) ≈2814 Angstrom, among the highest seen in star-forming systems. No metal lines, e.g. [O III] &amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;4959,5007, C IV &amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;1548,1550, have statistically significant detections, placing a 2-&amp;sigma; abundance upper limit of 12+log(O/H) &amp;lt; 6.52 (Z &amp;lt; 8×10^-3 Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;). The observed Ly&amp;alpha;/H&amp;alpha; flux ratio is ≈13.9, indicating negligible dust attenuation. Spectral energy distribution modeling with Pop III stellar templates indicates a very young (~2 Myr), low-mass (M_* ≈ 6.1× 10^5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) stellar population. Further, the photometric redshifts reveal that CR3 could reside in a slightly underdense environment (&amp;delta; ≈ -0.12). CR3 provides evidence that first-generation star formation could persist well after the epoch of reionization, challenging the conventional view that pristine star formation ended by z≳6.

A key result from JWST's first cycles is that galaxy formation was well underway by z=10. The implications of these early galaxies for reionization are less clear, however. The CMB is one of the few windows into the ionization state of the IGM during reionization's first half, providing an important probe of the ionizing photon sources at those times. Meanwhile, measurements of the Lyman-&amp;alpha; forest in the spectra of high-z quasars have improved to the level of tightly constraining the timing of reionization's end. In this paper, we use radiative transfer simulations to explore how measurements of the patchy kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich (pkSZ) effect, when combined with Lyman-&amp;alpha; forest measurements, can be used to constrain the early stages of reionization and the nature of its sources. For a given source model, we find that the amplitude of the pkSZ power spectra strongly correlates with the start time of reionization, and constrains the number of ionizing photons produced by the high-z source population. Allowing for variations in the source model, this correlation is weakened by a degeneracy between the reionization history and the effects of source clustering. However, we demonstrate two potential ways of breaking this degeneracy using: (1) measurements of large-scale fluctuations in the Ly&amp;alpha; forest opacity at z=5-6, and/or; (2) the shape of the pkSZ power spectrum measured in future CMB surveys. Models with highly clustered sources yield steeper slopes in the pkSZ power around &amp;ell; = 3,000, so measurements at additional angular scales can be used to break the history-clustering degeneracy. Our results highlight how future pkSZ measurements will complement JWST observations to improve our understanding of the ionizing sources near cosmic dawn.

Over the past few years itJWST has been a major workhorse in detecting and constraining the metal enrichment of the first galaxies in the early Universe and finding the source of the ionisation of their interstellar medium. In this work, we present new deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of GS-z11-1, a galaxy at z = 11.28, in which we report the detection of multiple rest-frame UV and optical emission lines: CIII]&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;1907,09, CIV]&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;1548,51, [OII]&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;3726,29, [NeIII]&amp;lambda;3869, H&amp;gamma; and tentative evidence for HeII&amp;lambda;1640. The ionisation properties of GS-z11-1 are consistent with star formation, with potential contribution from an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We estimate a galaxy stellar mass of log(M_*/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) = 7.8±0.2 and log(SFR/(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1))= 0.32±0.11 for the fiducial SF-only models. We measured C/O from the SED modelling of C/O = 1.20±0.15 × solar. This is one of the highest C/O abundances at z&amp;gt;10, and it is consistent with either PopII and PopIII enrichment paths. Despite this source being extremely compact, with a half-light radius of 73±10 pc, we see no increased equivalent width of NIV] and NIII] emission lines as seen in some other compact sources at similar redshifts, a potential signature of second-generation stars in GCs. Overall, this galaxy exhibits low metallicity and high ionisation parameter consistent with intense star-formation or AGN activity in the early Universe, possibly observed before the enrichment by the second generation of stars in proto-globular clusters in the core of the galaxy.

Little Red Dots (LRDs) are compact, red sources discovered by JWST at high redshift (z ≳ 4), marked by distinctive "V-shaped" spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and often interpreted as rapidly accreting AGNs. Their evolution remains unclear, as identifying counterparts at lower redshifts is challenging. We present WISEA J123635.56+621424.2 (here dubbed  the Saguaro), a z=2.0145 galaxy in GOODS-North, as a possible analog of high-redshift LRDs and a potential missing link in their evolutionary path toward lower-redshift systems. It features a compact LRD-like nucleus surrounded by a face-on spiral host. Its connection to LRDs includes that: (1) its nuclear spectrum shows a clear "V-shaped" SED; and (2) when redshifted to z=7, surface brightness dimming makes the host undetectable, thus mimicking an LRD. This suggests that high-redshift LRDs may be embedded in extended hosts. To test this, we stack rest-frame UV images of 99 photometrically selected LRDs, revealing faint, diffuse emission. Stacking in redshift bins reveals mild radial growth, consistent with the expected galaxy size evolution. A simple analytic model confirms that surface brightness dimming alone can explain their compact appearance. Lastly, we show that  the Saguaro is not unique by describing similar objects from the literature at z≲3.5. Taken together, our results support a scenario in which LRDs may not be a distinct population, but could be the visible nuclei of galaxies undergoing a short-lived, AGN-dominated evolutionary phase, with their compact, red appearance driven largely by observational biases.

We introduce a new photometric mapping method for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to measure the spatial distribution of carbonaceous dust, siliceous dust and water ice by using absorption features arising from the grains in the dense interstellar medium (ISM). Employing NIRCam and MIRI imaging filters, low-resolution spectroscopic data can be obtained to measure the optical depths of the 3.0-&amp;mu;m water ice -OH feature, the 3.4-&amp;mu;m aliphatic hydrocarbon -CH feature, and the 10-&amp;mu;m silicate -SiO feature for large fields of view. This method provides extensive statistical data of the grains across wide fields in the ISM at minimal observing cost. In this study, we present its application on observational data from the literature to validate the measured optical depths and simulations to assess the accuracy of the method under various conditions. We showed that the photometric method can be employed to obtain reasonably accurate measurements of optical depth. We demonstrate that JWST optical depth maps enable the independent exploration of abundance distributions of major grain components across a wide spatial coverage in the ISM.

We present the first robust helium (He) abundance measurements in star-forming galaxies at redshifts 1.6≲ z≲ 3.3 using deep, moderate-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy from the AURORA survey. We establish a High-z HeI Sample consisting of 20 galaxies with multiple high-S/N (&amp;gt;5&amp;sigma;) HeI emission-line detections, including the critical near-infrared &amp;lambda;10833 line. This is the first study at high redshift leveraging &amp;lambda;10833 to break degeneracies between temperature, electron density, optical depth, and He^+/H^+, enabling reliable He abundance determinations in the early universe. We use a custom MCMC framework incorporating direct-method electron temperature priors, extended optical depth (&amp;tau;_&amp;lambda;3890) model grids up to densities of 10^6~cm^-3, and simultaneous fits of the physical conditions and HeI/HI line ratios to derive ionic He^+/H^+ abundances. Most of the AURORA galaxies follow the extrapolated z~0 He/H-O/H trend, indicating modest He enrichment by z~2-3. However, we identify a subpopulation of four galaxies that exhibit elevated He mass fractions (&amp;Delta; Y&amp;gt;0.03) without corresponding enhancements in N/O or &amp;alpha;-elements (~20% of the sample). This abundance pattern is inconsistent with enrichment from asymptotic giant branch stars, but favors early He enrichment from very massive stars (VMSs; M≳100 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;), which can eject He-rich, N-poor material via stellar winds and binary stripping in young stellar populations. We speculate that these elevated-He systems may represent an early phase of globular cluster (GC) formation where N enrichment is still lagging behind He production. This work demonstrates the power of JWST multi-line HeI spectroscopy for tracing early stellar feedback, enrichment pathways, and GC progenitor signatures in the high-z universe.

&lt;p&gt;
Radioastronomical observations have recently discovered PAHs of moderate size (up to 24 carbon atoms) in cold dark clouds, although it is currently unknown whether they are formed in situ through a bottom-up mechanism or from larger PAHs (20-100 carbon atoms) inherited from a previous diffuse stage in a top-down scenario. Infrared observations have recently shown that large PAHs present in UV-illuminated regions are strongly enriched in deuterium. In order to shed light on the origin of PAHs in cold clouds, we have searched for deuterated benzonitrile in the cold dark cloud TMC-1. To that purpose we have synthesized the three isomers (ortho, meta, and para) of monodeuterated benzonitrile, measured their rotational spectra across the 2-18 GHz and 75-110 GHz frequency ranges in the laboratory, and searched for them in TMC-1 using data from the QUIJOTE line survey. We did not detect any of the three species and have derived a 3sigma upper limit on the column density of each of them of 3.0e10 cm-2, meaning a fractional abundance relative to H2 of &amp;lt;3e-12. We derived a D/H ratio (which we define as the total number of D atoms with respect to the total number of H atoms present in benzonitrile) of &amp;lt;1.2 %. This value is in line with the range of D/H ratios observed for other molecules in TMC-1 (0.06-3.3 %), where deuterium enrichment is explained in terms of isotopic fractionation at low temperature. It is however below the range of D/H ratios derived for large unspecific PAHs from JWST observations of the galactic PDRs Orion Bar and M17 and the galaxies M51 and NGC3256-S (between 1% and &amp;lt;17%). Although it is not straightforward to compare the deuteration of PAHs in dark and UV-irradiated clouds, our results suggest that the population of PAHs detected in cold dark clouds does not result from the fragmentation of larger PAHs inherited from the previous diffuse stage in a top-down scenario.

Using galaxy Ly&amp;alpha; emission to probe reionization relies on establishing baseline expectations for its detectability in the absence of attenuation by neutral gas in the IGM. Towards this end, the growing numbers of z ~ 5&amp;ndash;6 star-forming galaxies spectroscopically selected by JWST provide an ideal sample for determining how Ly&amp;alpha; emission depends on galaxy properties and environment after reionization has largely completed. In this study, we use Keck LRIS to measure the Ly&amp;alpha; emission of 46 JWST-selected [OIII]-emitting galaxies over 5.3 ≲ z ≲ 6.2 in the foreground of the ultra-luminous quasar J0100+2802. Overall, we find that the fraction of galaxies detected in Ly&amp;alpha; emission is consistent with previous works; however, the fraction also varies with environment. Most notably, we find an apparent deficit of Ly&amp;alpha; in the largest group in our sample, at z ≃ 6.19, which falls within the redshift range of the quasar's highly ionized proximity zone. We speculate that the Ly&amp;alpha; emission from this group may be partly scattered by a foreground neutral island. In contrast, we detect a high rate of Ly&amp;alpha; emission in two groups at z ≃ 5.73 and z ≃ 5.78. These groups may be part of a structure that is extended along the line of sight, enhancing the transmission of Ly&amp;alpha; emission. While our sample size is limited, our results suggest that environment may play a significant role in the detectability of galaxy Ly&amp;alpha; emission even as late as z ~ 6.

Compact, low-mass galaxies with strong nebular emission are considered promising candidates for efficient ionizing photon production and escape. We present a spatially resolved analysis of 189 galaxies at redshifts z ~ 6.7-7.6 in JADES GOODS-N and GOODS-S fields and selected via JWST/NIRCam F410M filter. By employing annular photometry and spectral energy distribution fitting across rest-frame UV to optical wavelengths, we investigate the internal structure of star formation, ionizing photon production and escape, as well as the resolved star formation histories within these galaxies. We find that these galaxies exhibit compact, centrally concentrated, and bursty star formation, especially in lower-mass systems (log(M_*/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;lt;9.0). The central regions of them display extreme [OIII]+H&amp;beta; equivalent widths (&amp;gt;1000 &amp;#8491;), high ionizing photon production efficiencies ( &amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt;  ~ 10^25.6 Hz erg^-1), steep UV slopes (~ -2.3), and elevated escape fractions (f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 0.08), with all these properties peaking in the inner regions. These findings reveal outside-in growth and rising star formation histories at z~ 7, with the central regions of them playing a pivotal role in driving cosmic reionization.

The combination of the z=0-13.5 cosmic star formation history and active galactic nuclei (AGN) luminosity history as inferred by the James Webb Space Telescope is connected to the cosmic spectral energy distribution (CSED) to explore the sources of reionisation. We compute the redshift evolution of the corresponding cosmic ionising photon emissivity, the neutral fraction and the cosmic microwave background optical depth. We use the generative SED modelling code ProSpect to bracket the ionising emissivity between escape fractions of f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 - 100&amp;percnt; for both the stars and AGN. Stars alone could have achieved reionisation by z≈ 6 with f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt; ≳ 10-30&amp;percnt;, depending on the metallicity. On the other hand, AGN by themselves would have struggled to produce sufficiently many ionising photons even with f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt; = 100&amp;percnt;. A hybrid model containing both stars and AGN is explored where we find best fit (median± 1&amp;sigma;) f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt;= 12&amp;percnt; (12^+10_-11&amp;percnt;) for the stars and f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt;= 63&amp;percnt; (79^+21_-44&amp;percnt;) for the AGN, maintained at all redshifts. In essence, the joint growth of stellar mass and super massive black holes produces neither more or less ionising photons than needed to reionise ≳ 99&amp;percnt; of the intergalactic medium by z≈ 6.

Recently discovered supermassive black holes with masses of ~10^8 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; at redshifts z~9-11 in active galactic nuclei (AGN) pose severe challenges to our understanding of supermassive black hole formation. One proposed channel are rapidly accreting supermassive PopIII stars (SMSs) that form in large primordial gas halos and grow up to &amp;lt;10^6 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. They eventually collapse due to the general relativistic instability and could lead to supernova-like explosions. This releases massive and energetic ejecta that then interact with the halo medium via an optically thick shock. We develop a semi-analytic model to compute the shock properties, bolometric luminosity, emission spectrum and photometry over time. The initial data is informed by stellar evolution and general relativistic SMS collapse simulations. We find that SMS explosion light curves reach a brightness ~10^45-47 erg/s and last 10-200 years in the source frame - up to 250-3000 years with cosmic time dilation. This makes them quasi-persistent sources which vary indistinguishably to little red dots and AGN within 0.5-9 (1+z) yrs. Bright SMS explosions are observable in long-wavelength JWST filters up to z≤20 (24-26 mag) and pulsating SMSs up to z≤15. EUCLID and the Roman space telescope (RST) can detect SMS explosions at z&amp;lt;11-12. Their deep fields could constrain the SMS rate down to 10^-11Mpc^-3yr^-1, which is much deeper than JWST bounds. Based on cosmological simulations and observed star formation rates, we expect to image up to several hundred SMS explosions with EUCLID and dozens with RST deep fields.

The evolution of the supermassive Black Hole (BH) population across cosmic times remains a central unresolved issue in modern astrophysics, due to the many noticeable uncertainties in the involved physical processes. Here we tackle the problem via a semi-empirical approach with minimal assumptions and data-driven inputs. This is firmly grounded on a continuity plus Smoluchowski equation framework that allows to unitarily describe the two primary modes of BH growth: gas accretion and binary mergers. Key quantities related to the latter processes are incorporated through educated parameterizations, and then constrained in a Bayesian setup from joint observational estimates of the local BH mass function, of the large-scale BH clustering, and of the nano-Hz stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background measured from Pulsar Timimg Array (PTA) experiments. We find that the BH accretion-related parameters are strongly dependent on the local BH mass function determination: higher normalizations and flatter high-mass slopes in the latter imply lower radiative efficiencies and mean Eddington ratios with a stronger redshift evolution. Additionally, the binary BH merger rate is estimated to be a fraction ≲ 10^-1 of the galaxy merger rate derived from galaxy pairs counts by JWST, and constrained not to exceed the latter at ≳ 2&amp;sigma;. Relatedly, we highlight hints of a possible tension between current constraints on BH demographics and the interpretation of the nano-Hz GW background as predominantly caused by binary BH mergers. Specifically, we bound the latter's contribution to ≲ 30-50&amp;percnt; at ~ 3&amp;sigma;, suggesting that either systematics in the datasets considered here have been underestimated so far, or that additional astrophysical/cosmological sources are needed to explain the residual part of the signal measured by PTA experiments.

&lt;p&gt;
A majority of JWST/NIRSpec/IFU studies at high redshifts to date have focused on UV-bright or massive objects, while our understanding of low-mass galaxies at early cosmic times remains limited. In this work, we present NIRSpec/IFS high-resolution observations of two low-mass (M_* &amp;lt; 10^9  M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;), low-metallicity ([12 + log(O/H)] &amp;lt; 8) galaxies at z ~ 7.66 with evidence of hosting AGN. Using spatially-resolved maps of rest-frame optical emission lines, we find flat metallicity profiles, indicative of ISM redistribution by outflows or past merging. We identify kinematical components decoupled from galactic rotation with velocities of ~ 250 - 500  km  s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. We argue that these components are likely tracing outflows, possibly AGN-driven, for which we infer outflow rates of ~ 21 - 40  M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;  yr^-1, suggesting they may suppress future star formation. We compare our observational results to those from the new large-volume AESOPICA simulations, which fully incorporate different models of black hole growth and AGN feedback. We find that our observational results of v_out/v&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt; and M&amp;#775;_out/SFR are consistent with the AGN population in these simulations, hinting that AGN-driven feedback may contribute to quenching both in our systems and in a wider population of low-mass galaxies in the early Universe. This novel study demonstrates the necessity of deep IFU observations to decompose the complex kinematics and morphology of high-z galaxies, trace outflows, and constrain the effect of feedback in these low-mass systems.

Much of the carbonaceous dust observed in the early universe may originate from colliding wind binaries (CWBs) hosting hot, luminous Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Downstream of the shock between the stellar winds there exists a suitable environment for dust grain formation, and the orbital motion of the stars wraps this dust into richly structured spiral geometries. The Apep system is the most extreme WR-CWB in our Milky Way: two WR stars produce a complex spiral dust nebula, whose slow expansion has been linked to a gamma-ray burst progenitor. It has been unclear whether the O-type supergiant 0.7" distant from the WR+WR binary is physically associated with the system, and whether it affects the dusty nebula. Multi-epoch VLT/VISIR and JWST/MIRI observations show that this northern companion star routinely carves a cavity in the dust nebula - the first time such an effect has been observed in a CWB - which unambiguously associates the O star as a bound component to the Apep system. These observations are used together with a new geometric model to infer the cavity geometry and the orbit of the WR+WR binary, yielding the first strong constraints on wind and orbital parameters. We confirm an orbital period of over 190 years for the inner binary - nearly an order of magnitude longer than the next longest period dust-producing WR-CWB. This, together with the confirmed classification as a hierarchical triple, cements Apep as a singular astrophysical laboratory for studying colliding winds and the terminal life stages of the most massive star systems.

Carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are significant contributors of carbonaceous dust to the galactic environment, however the mechanisms and conditions for formation and subsequent evolution of dust around these stars remain open questions. Here we present JWST observations of the WR+WR colliding-wind binary Apep which reveal an intricate series of nested concentric dust shells that are abundant in detailed substructure. The striking regularity in these substructures between successive shells suggests an exactly repeating formation mechanism combined with a highly stable outflow that maintains a consistent morphology even after reaching 0.6 pc (assuming a distance of 2.4 kpc) into the interstellar medium. The concentric dust shells show subtle deviations from spherical outflow, which could reflect orbital modulation along the eccentric binary orbit or some mild degree of non-sphericity in the stellar wind. Tracking the evolution of dust across the multi-tiered structure, we measure the dust temperature evolution that can broadly be described with an amorphous carbon composition in radiative thermal equilibrium with the central stars. The temperature profile and orbital period place new distance constraints that support Apep being at a greater distance than previously estimated, reducing the line-of-sight and sky-plane wind speed discrepancy previously thought to characterise the system.

Recent JWST observations detected stellar clumps around the z=1.4 gravitationally lensed Sparkler galaxy (of stellar mass M_*~ 10^9 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;), with ages and metallicities compatible with globular clusters (GCs). However, most of their masses (&amp;gt;10^6 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) and sizes (&amp;gt;30 pc) are about 10 times those of GCs in the local Universe. To assess whether these clumps can evolve into GCs, we performed N-body simulations of their dynamical evolution from z=1.4 to z=0 (9.23 Gyr), under the effect of dynamical friction and tidal stripping. Dynamical friction is studied performing multiple runs of a clump system in a Sparkler-like spherical halo of mass M_200≃ 5× 10^11 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; (from the stellar-to-halo mass relation). For the tidal stripping, we simulated resolved clumps, orbiting in an external, static gravitational potential including the same halo as in the dynamical friction simulations and also a Sparkler-like stellar disk. Dynamical friction causes the clumps with mass &amp;gt;10^7 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; to sink into the galaxy central regions, possibly contributing to the bulge growth. In absence of tidal stripping, the mass distribution of the surviving clumps (40%) peaks at 5× 10^6 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, implying the presence of uncommonly over-massive clumps at z=0. Tidal shocks by the stellar disk strip considerable mass from low-mass clumps, even though their sizes remain larger than those of present-day GCs. When the surviving clumps are corrected for tidal stripping, their mass distribution peak shifts to 2× 10^6 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, compatible with massive GCs. Our simulations suggest that a fraction of the Sparkler clumps is expected to fall into the central regions, where they might become bulge fossil fragments or contribute to form a nuclear star cluster. The remaining clumps are too large in size to be progenitors of GCs.

We present `James Webb Space Telescope' observations of M4 &amp;ndash; the closest globular cluster &amp;ndash; that probe the lower Main Sequence down to the hydrogen-burning limit. The unveiled stellar sequence reaches much fainter luminosities than previously possible, revealing a few extremely red objects that are consistent with brown dwarfs as cool as T_eff~1000K. However, the lack of a second JWST epoch presently prevents us from verifying the cluster membership of these objects. By cross-matching our data with archival `Hubble Space Telescope' images, we are able to verify cluster membership for a subset of objects down to T_eff~3000K. The observed color distribution indicate that the lower Main Sequence of M4 is likely deficient in oxygen compared to its higher-mass post-Main Sequence members by ~0.5dex. This feature has now been observed in three different globular clusters (M4, NGC6397 and 47Tuc), suggesting a general trend. Finally, we derive the mass function of the Galactic bulge in the background of M4. The mass function was found to have the bottom-heavy slope of alpha=0.88+/-0.36 and appears to terminate at ~0.15 M_Sun, although the latter value may be overestimated due to the limited sample size.

JWST observations of quasars in the Epoch of Reionization have revealed that many lie in host galaxies that are severely undermassive relative to the supermassive black holes. It is unclear how these systems will evolve to the tight local relation between stellar mass and black hole mass. We search for companions around the z=7.08 quasar ULAS J1120+0641 using JWST/NIRCam narrow, medium, and wide-band photometry to identify [O III] emitters at the quasar redshift, and explore the potential for growth of the host galaxy through future mergers. We find 22 sources near the quasar's redshift across our two 4.4 arcmin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; fields, indicating that environment of ULAS J1120+0641 is strongly overdense in z~7.1 galaxies relative to the field. We estimate the potential future mass budget of the quasar host galaxy by summing the current stellar and gas masses of the quasar host and surrounding galaxies, correcting for incompleteness and selection effects. With no further black hole growth, ULAS J1120+0641 is unlikely to reach a M_BH/M_* ratio less than ~2.5% at z=0, still much higher than typical for local galaxies. However, such systems &amp;ndash; a quiescent black hole in a low-luminosity galaxy &amp;ndash; may have escaped detection locally if they are sufficiently distant.

Extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) at high redshifts are considered key contributors to cosmic reionization at z&amp;gt;6 due to their higher ionization efficiencies. We have identified 119 H&amp;beta; + [OIII] emitters at z~7 selected by a flux excess in the medium-band filter F410M in the public James Webb Space Telescope Cycle-1 fields. Our emitters exhibit a wide range in rest-frame H&amp;beta; + [OIII] equivalent width (EWs), 420 &amp;lt; EW_0/&amp;#8491; &amp;lt; 6850 (with the median value of ~1700 &amp;#8491;). Among them, 19 are EW_0 &amp;gt; 3000 &amp;#8491;, which represent extreme populations even in the context of recent findings with JWST. They are characterized by (i) low stellar mass (~ 3×10^7 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;), (ii) blue colors (&amp;beta;_UV~ -2.2), and (iii) low dust attenuation (A_V~ 0.1 mag). We discuss the physical mechanisms responsible for the observed high rest-frame H&amp;beta; + [OIII] EWs, including (1) photoionization by AGN, (2) stellar photoionization in the vicinity of HII regions, and (3) radiative shocks powered by outflows either from AGN or massive stars. Notably, we find 13 emitters with spatially offset H&amp;beta; + [OIII] emission compared to the UV and stellar components. Given the absence of obvious signatures of actively accreting black holes, these emitters are likely under strong feedback-driven winds from massive stars. Lastly, we report a unique overdensity of EELGs in one of the observed fields. The discovery of such a "star-bursting" overdensity supports the idea that large ionizing bubbles formed around some EEGLs in the early Universe.

&lt;p&gt;
The advent of JWST has revolutionized the study of faint satellite galaxies at z ≳ 1, enabling statistical constraints on galaxy evolution and the galaxy-halo connection in a previously unexplored mass and redshift regime. We compare satellite abundances at 1 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 3.5 from recent JWST observations with predictions from cosmological dark matter-only zoom-in simulations. We identify and quantify several sources of biases that can impact theoretical satellite counts, finding that assumptions about subhalo tidal evolution introduce the largest uncertainty in predictions for the satellite mass function. Using a flexible galaxy disruption model, we explore a range of disruption scenarios, spanning hydrodynamically motivated and idealized prescriptions, to bracket plausible physical outcomes. We show that varying galaxy durability can change the predicted satellite mass functions by a factor of ~3.5. The JWST data and our fiducial model are consistent within 1-2&amp;sigma; across the full redshift (1 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 3.5) and stellar mass (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt; 10^7~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) range probed. We find evidence that subhalos are at least as long-lived as predicted by hydrodynamic simulations. Our framework will enable robust constraints on the tidal evolution of subhalos with future observations. This work presents the first direct comparison between cosmological models and observations of the high-redshift satellite population in this low-mass regime. These results showcase JWST's emerging power to test structure formation in the first half of the Universe in a new domain and to constrain the physical processes driving the evolution of low-mass galaxies across cosmic time.

&lt;p&gt;
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled a population of enigmatic, compact sources at high redshift known as ''Little Red Dots'' (LRDs), whose physical nature remains a subject of intense debate. Concurrently, the rapid assembly of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) requires the formation of heavy seeds, for which supermassive stars (SMSs) are leading theoretical progenitors. In this work, we perform the first quantitative test of the hypothesis that LRDs are the direct observational manifestation of these primordial SMSs. We present a novel, first-principles pipeline generating synthetic spectra for a non-rotating, metal-free 10^6   M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; SMS. We establish that its luminosity (L_&amp;lambda; ≈ 1.7 × 10^44   erg   s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;   &amp;mu;m^-1 at 4050 Angstroms) provides a decisive constraint, matching prominent LRDs. Our model self-consistently reproduces their defining spectral features: the V-shaped Balmer break morphology is shown to be an intrinsic photospheric effect, while the complex line phenomenology, strong H&amp;beta; in emission with other Balmer lines in absorption arises from non-LTE effects in a single stellar atmosphere. Applying physically motivated broadening, our spectrum provides an excellent quantitative match to LRDs at both high (z=7.76) and low (z=3.55) redshift. Our model provides a simple, self-consistent physical picture for LRDs, offering a compelling alternative to multi-component obscured AGN scenarios and suggesting we may be directly witnessing the final, luminous moments of an SMBH progenitor before its ultimate collapse.

The existence of galaxies with no heavy elements is a key prediction of cosmological models. So far no "zero-metallicity", or Population III, galaxies have been identified. Here, we report the identification of an extremely metal-poor galaxy at redshift z = 5.725 ("AMORE6"), multiply imaged by a foreground galaxy cluster. JWST spectra consistently detect H&amp;beta; at both positions, but [OIII]&amp;lambda; &amp;lambda;4960,5008 remains undetected. This places a firm upper limit on its oxygen abundance, &amp;lt; 0.12 % of solar metallicity at 2&amp;sigma;, establishing itself as the most pristine object by far. AMORE6 exhibits exceptional properties that indicate the presence of pristine massive star formation. The finding of such an example at a relatively late cosmic time is surprising, but it also validates the basic ideas behind the Big Bang model.

Massive galaxy clusters act as prominent strong-lenses. Due to a combination of observational biases, cluster evolution and lensing efficiency, most of the known cluster lenses lie typically at z_l~0.2-0.7, with only a few prominent examples at higher redshifts. Here we report a first strong-lensing analysis of the massive galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0546-5345 at a redshift z_l=1.07. This cluster was first detected through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, with a high estimated mass for its redshift of M_200,c = (7.95 ± 0.92) × 10^14 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. Using recent JWST/NIRCam and archival HST imaging, we identify at least 10 secure and 6 candidate sets of multiply imaged background galaxies, which we use to constrain the mass distribution in the cluster. We derive effective Einstein radii of &amp;theta;_E= 18.1 ± 1.8 '' for a source at z_s=3, and &amp;theta;_E= 27.9 ± 2.8 '' for a source at z_s=9. The total projected mass within a 200 kpc radius around the strong-lensing region is M(&amp;lt;200 kpc) = (1.9 ± 0.3) × 10^14 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. While our results rely on photometric redshifts warranting spectroscopic follow-up, this central mass resembles that of the Hubble Frontier Fields clusters - although SPT-CL J0546-5345 is observed when the Universe was ~ 3-4 Gyr younger. Amongst the multiply-imaged sources, we identify a hyperbolic-umbilic-like configuration, and, thanks to its point-like morphology, a possible Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). If confirmed spectroscopically, it will add to just a handful of other quasars and AGN known to be multiply lensed by galaxy clusters.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have identified a class of compact galaxies at high redshifts (4 ≲ z ≲ 11), dubbed "little red dots" (LRDs). The supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of 10^5-8  M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; in LRDs favor a heavy-seed origin. We propose a mechanism for their formation: Clusters of primordial black holes, formed through long-short mode coupling on small scales in the early Universe, undergo sequential mergers over extended timescales. This mechanism can evade cosmic microwave background distortions and result in heavy-seed SMBHs via runaway mergers. We employ Monte Carlo simulations to solve the Smoluchowski coagulation equation and determine the runaway merging timescale. The resulting stochastic gravitational wave background offers a distinct signature of this process, and the forming SMBHs can be highly spinning at their formation due to the spin residual of the cluster from tidal fields. This mechanism may explain the rapidly spinning SMBHs in LRDs under the assumption of obscured active galactic nuclei.

&lt;p&gt;
We present MIRI/JWST medium resolution spectroscopy (MRS) and imaging (MIRIM) of B14-65666, a Lyman-break and interacting galaxy at redshift z=7.15. We detect the H&amp;alpha; line emission in this system, revealing a spatially-resolved structure of the H&amp;alpha; emitting gas, which consists of two distinct galaxies, E and W, at a projected distance of 0.4". Galaxy E is very compact in the rest-frame UV, while W galaxy is more extended, showing a clumpy structure reminiscent of a tidal tail. The total H&amp;alpha; luminosity implies that the system is forming stars at a Star Formation Rate (SFR) of 76±8 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1 and 30±4 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1 for E and W, respectively. The ionizing photon production efficiency is within the range measured in galaxies at similar redshifts. The high values derived for the H&amp;alpha; equivalent widths (EW) and the distinct locations of the E and W galaxies in the log(\zeta&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt;) - EW (H&amp;alpha;) plane, indicate that the system is dominated by a young (less than 10 Myr) stellar population. The overall spectral energy distribution suggests that in addition to a young stellar population, the two galaxies may have mature stellar population and very different dust attenuation. The derived SFR and stellar masses identify the two galaxies as going through a starburst phase. The kinematics of the ionized gas traced by the H&amp;alpha; line show a velocity difference of 175 ± 28 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; between the two components of B14-65666. The in-depth study of systems like B14-65666 reveal how galaxy mergers in the early Universe drive intense star formation, shape the interstellar medium, and influence the buildup of stellar mass, just 700 - 800 Myr after the Big Bang.

We report the detection of a gravitationally lensed galaxy by the nearby spiral galaxy CGCG 012-070 (z = 0.048) using Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations with the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) instrument on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The lensed galaxy is identified through the flux distributions of emission lines in the rest-frame optical, consistent with a source located at a redshift of z~2.89. The system is detected in [O III]&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;4959,5007, H&amp;beta;, and H&amp;alpha; emission lines, exhibiting line ratios typical of a star-forming galaxy. The emission-line flux distributions reveal three distinct components, which are modeled using an elliptical power-law (EPL) mass profile for the lens galaxy. This model provides a good characterization of the source and reveals a disturbed star-forming morphology consistent with those of galaxies at cosmic noon. This serendipitous discovery of a rare low-redshift strong lens highlights the critical role of IFU observations in expanding the lens census and advancing our understanding of galaxy mass profiles and evolution.

Photodissociation regions (PDRs) exhibit emission between 3-20 um known as the Aromatic Infrared Bands (AIBs), originating from small carbonaceous species such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The AIB spectra observed in Galactic PDRs, such as the Orion Bar observations by the PDRs4All JWST program, are considered a local analog for those seen in extragalactic star-forming regions. We present the Python version of PAHFIT, a spectral decomposition tool that separates the contributions by AIB subcomponents, thermal dust emission, gas lines, stellar light, and dust extinction. By fitting segments of the Orion Bar spectra, we provide a configuration to decompose JWST spectra of PDRs in detail. The resulting central wavelengths and FWHM of the AIB subcomponents are compiled into a "PDR pack" for PAHFIT. We applied PAHFIT with this PDR pack and the default continuum model to spectra of the central star forming ring of the galaxy NGC7469. We introduce an alternate dust continuum model to fit the Orion Bar spectra, as the default PAHFIT continuum model mismatches the intensity at 15-26 um. Using the PDR pack and the alternate continuum model, PAHFIT reproduces the Orion Bar spectra with residuals of a few percent, and similar performance is achieved for the NGC7469 spectra. We provide PAHFIT-based diagnostics that trace the profile variations of the 3.3, 3.4, 5.7, 6.2, and 7.7 um AIBs, and thus the photochemical evolution of the AIB carriers. The 5.7 um AIB emission originates from at least two subpopulations, one more prominent in highly irradiated environments and one preferring more shielded environments. Smaller PAHs as well as very small grains or PAH clusters both thrive in the more shielded environments of the molecular zone in the Orion Bar. Based on these new diagnostics, we quantify the similarities between the AIB profiles observed in the Orion Bar and NGC7469.

We report the discovery of a complex, density-stratified interstellar medium (ISM) in the star-forming galaxy COS-2987 at z = 6.81, revealed by the unprecedented synergy between JWST/NIRSpec IFS and ALMA observations. These observations detect key emission lines, including \oii~&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;~3727, 3730, [OIII]~4364, [OIII]~&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;~4960, 5008, [OIII] 88 \micron, as well as H&amp;alpha; and H&amp;beta;. JWST spectroscopy alone indicates ISM properties that are typical for galaxies at z~7. These include low dust extinction (A_V ≈ 0.14 mag), moderate electron density (n_e ≈ 500~cm^-3), and low gas-phase metallicity (~10&amp;percnt;). However, the strong far-infrared [OIII] 88 \micron emission detected by ALMA cannot be explained by a single-component ionized medium with uniform electron density and temperature. Instead, a two-component ISM model, comprising compact, high-temperature, high-density gas components (T_e ≈ 26,000 K; n_e ≈ 600~cm^-3) and an extended, cooler, lower-density component (T_e ≈ 8,000 K; n_e ≈ 50~cm^-3), successfully reproduces the observed line ratios of [OIII]~88~\micron/[OIII]~5008~&amp;#8491; and [OIII]~4364/[OIII]~5008~&amp;#8491;, with a volume ratio of 1 : 300 between the two components. Our results demonstrate that JWST alone probes only a fraction of the ISM and highlight the critical importance of combining JWST and ALMA to reveal the density-stratified ISM of early galaxies.

Although supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are found at the centers of most galaxies today, over 300 have now been discovered at z &amp;gt; 6, including UHZ1 at z = 10.1 and GHZ9 at z = 10.4. They are thought to form when 10^4 - 10^5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; primordial stars die as direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) at z ~ 20 - 25. While studies have shown that DCBHs should be visible at birth at z ≳ 20 in the near infrared (NIR) to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), none have considered SMBH detections at later stages growth down to z ~ 6 - 7. Here, we present continuum NIR luminosities for a BH like ULAS J1120+0641, a 1.35 × 10^9 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; quasar at z = 7.1, from a cosmological simulation for Euclid, the Roman Space Telescope (RST) and JWST bands from z = 6 - 15. We find that Euclid and RST could detect such BHs, including others like UHZ1 and GHZ9, at much earlier stages of evolution, out to z ~ 14 - 15, and that their redshifts could be confirmed spectroscopically with JWST. Synergies between these three telescopes could thus reveal the numbers of SMBHs at much higher redshifts and discriminate between their evolution pathways because Euclid and RST can capture large numbers of them in wide-field surveys for further study by JWST.

&lt;p&gt;
Observing Population III (hereafter PopIII) galaxies, the hosts of first-generation stars, remains challenging even with the JWST. The current few candidates have been identified through the combination of a prominent HeII emission and the absence of metal lines, a well-known but extremely brief signature of metal-free systems. Here, we accurately model the evolution of the emission from PopIII galaxies to increase the number of candidates in JWST observations. To achieve this, we employ a locally calibrated galaxy-formation model that self-consistently follows the star formation and chemical evolution initiated by the first stars. We find that PopIII galaxies can emit metal lines in their "self-polluted'' phase, while galaxies host only metal-free stars but the gas has been chemically-enriched by the first supernovae. In this phase, PopIII galaxies have [OIII]/H&amp;beta; ≈ 1, which opens the pool of candidates to more easily detectable sources. We predict that the high HeII emission of PopIII galaxies can last up to ≈ 20   Myrs and that it is partly maintained in the "hybrid'' phase, when PopIII and PopII stars co-exist in the host galaxy. We propose novel diagnostics involving UV metal lines to select PopIII candidates in high-z JWST surveys. In JADES, we identify 9 candidate galaxies with &amp;gt;25&amp;percnt; of their stellar mass in metal-free stars, showcasing the effectiveness of our method. Ultimately, the key to discovering PopIII galaxies could be to catch them during their first episodes of chemical enrichment.

We analyse the ro-vibrational absorption bands of various molecular cations (HCO^+, HCNH^+, and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H^+) and neutral species (HCN, HNC, and HC_3N) detected in the itJames Webb Space Telescope/Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium Resolution Spectrometer spectrum (4.9&amp;ndash;27.9 \upmum) of the local ultra luminous infrared galaxy IRAS~07251-0248. We find that the molecular absorptions are blueshifted by 160 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; relative to the systemic velocity of the target. Using local thermal equilibrium (LTE) excitation models, we derive rotational temperatures (T_rot) from 42 to 185 K for these absorption bands. This range of measured T_rot can be explained by infrared (IR) radiative pumping as a by&amp;ndash;product of the strength, effective critical density, and opacity of each molecular band. Thus, these results suggest that these absorptions originate in a warm expanding gas shell (M&amp;#775;~90&amp;ndash;330 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1), which might be the base of the larger scale cold molecular outflow detected in this source. Finally, the elevated abundance of molecular cations can be explained by a high cosmic ray ionization rate, with log(\zeta_H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/n_H  [cm^3  s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;]) in the range of -18.2 (from H_3^+) to -19.1 (inferred from HCO^+ and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H^+, which are likely tracing denser gas), consistent with a cosmic ray dominated chemistry as predicted by chemical models.

&lt;p&gt;
The z=1.14 \infty galaxy consists of two ringed nuclei with an active supermassive black hole (SMBH) in between them. The system is likely the result of a nearly face-on collision between two disk galaxies with massive bulges. In van Dokkum et al. (2025) we suggested that the SMBH may have formed from shocked and compressed gas at the collision site, in a runaway gravitational collapse. Here we test this hypothesis using newly obtained JWST NIRSpec IFU observations. We first confirm that the system has a cloud of gas in between the nuclei that is photo-ionized by an AGN-like object near its center. Next, we constrain the origin of the SMBH from its radial velocity. If it formed in the cloud its velocity should be similar to the surrounding gas, whereas it would be offset if the SMBH had escaped from one of the nuclei or were associated with a faint galaxy. We find that the radial velocity of the SMBH is within ~ 50 km/s of that of the surrounding gas, as expected if the SMBH formed within the cloud. Unexpectedly, we find that both nuclei have active SMBHs as well, as inferred from very broad H&amp;alpha; emission with FWHM ~ 3000 km/s. This rules out scenarios where the central SMBH was ejected from one of the nuclei in a gravitational recoil. Taken together, these results strengthen the hypothesis that the object at the center of the \infty galaxy is a newly formed SMBH.

&lt;p&gt;
In the era of JWST, with its unprecedented sensitivity and spectral resolution, infrared spectral surveys have revealed a rich inventory of ices, including complex organic molecules (COMs), in young stellar objects (YSOs). However, robust methods to decompose and quantify these absorption features particularly across broad spectral ranges, are still under investigation. We present INDRA (Ice-fitting with NNLS-based Decomposition and Retrieval Algorithm), a fully Python-based tool that performs continuum and silicate removal, global ice fitting using Weighted Non-Negative Least Squares (NNLS), and estimates column densities and statistical significance. We apply INDRA to NGC 1333 IRAS 2A, a target from the JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS+) program previously studied using local fitting. We derive optical depths via polynomial continuum subtraction and remove silicate absorption using a synthetic model, isolating ice features for global MIRI fitting. Our results are consistent with previous local fits, confirming simple species and COMs, and expand the inventory by identifying additional absorption features from CO2 and NH4+. We also propose the presence of organic refractories contributing up to 9.6% in the spectral region of 5-8 microns among the various ice components, whose inclusion significantly improves the global spectral fitting. These broad absorption features, extending across 5.5-11 microns, are likely produced by large, complex molecules containing carbonyl (C=O), hydroxyl (O-H), amine (N-H), and C-H bending modes. Our expanded inventory, now incorporating these organic residues, offers new insights into the chemical evolution of ices in star-forming regions and highlights the importance of global spectral fitting in constraining ice compositions.

We report the discovery of a little red dot (LRD), dubbed BiRD ('big red dot'), at z=2.33 in the field around the z=6.3 quasar SDSSJ1030+0524. Using NIRCam images, we identified it as a bright outlier in the F200W-F356W color vs F356W magnitude diagram of point sources in the field. The NIRCam/WFSS spectrum reveals the emission from HeI&amp;lambda; 10830 and PaG line, both showing a narrow and a broad (FWHM≳ 2000 kms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) component. The HeI line is affected by an absorption feature, tracing dense gas with HeI column density in the 2^3S level N~ 0.5-1.2× 10^14cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, depending on the location of the absorber, which is outflowing at the speed of &amp;Delta; v ~ -830 kms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. As observed in the majority of LRDs, BiRD does not show X-ray or radio emission. The BH mass and the bolometric luminosity, both inferred from the PaG broad component, amount to M_BH~ 10^8M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and L_bol~ 2.9× 10^45ergs&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Intriguingly, BiRD presents strict analogies with other two LRDs spectroscopically confirmed at cosmic noon, GN-28074 ("Rosetta Stone") at z=2.26 and RUBIES-BLAGN-1 at z=3.1. The blueshifted HeI absorption detected in all three sources suggests that gas outflows may be common in LRDs. We derive a first estimate of the space density of LRDs at z&amp;lt;3 based on JWST data, as a function of L_bol and BH mass. The space density is only a factor of ~ 2-3 lower than that of UV-selected quasars with comparable L_bol and z, meaning that the contribution of LRDs to the broader AGN population is also relevant at cosmic noon. A similar trend is also observed in terms of BH masses. If, as suggested by recent theories, LRDs probe the very first and rapid growth of black hole seeds, our finding may suggest that the formation of black hole seeds remains efficient at least up to cosmic noon.

The galaxy gas-phase metallicity gradients have been extensively studied over the past four decades, both in the local and high-redshift universe, as they trace the baryon cycle and growth of galaxies. With the unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity of JWST, it is now possible to measure metallicity and its radial gradients out to redshifts as high as z = 9. Here, we present a sample of 455 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies from redshifts 1.7 ≲ z ≲ 9 that are spatially resolved on sub-kiloparsec (kpc) scales by deep JWST NIRCam or NIRISS Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS). Synthesizing these new JWST observations with legacy observations from the literature, we observe that at redshift z &amp;gt; 5, galaxy centers are more metal-rich, exhibiting negative metallicity gradients of ~-0.4 dex kpc^-1. These gradients flatten over time, reaching near-zero around z ≈ 2, coinciding with the peak of the cosmic star formation rate. Beyond this point, the gradients become negative again at lower redshifts approaching z=0. This evolution likely reflects transitions in galaxy formation modes: an inside-out growth phase dominated by intense central star formation with inefficient feedback and limited gas mixing during "cosmic dawn", enhanced gas mixing due to feedback-driven wind and gas accretion at "cosmic noon", and a later phase of slow evolution and reduced feedback toward the present day. These physical processes, including gas accretion and feedback, not only regulate star and galaxy formation on a cosmic scale but also shape the evolutionary pathways of individual galaxies over cosmic time.

The study of high-redshift galaxies provides critical insights into the early stages of cosmic evolution, particularly during the so-called 'cosmic noon', when star formation activity reached its peak. Within this context, the origin of the nebular emission remains an open question. In this work, we conduct a systematic, multi-wavelength investigation of a sample of z ~ 2-4 emitters from the MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field surveys, utilising both MUSE and JWST/NIRSpec data and extending the sample presented by previous studies. We derive gas-phase metallicities and key physical properties, including electron densities, temperatures and the production rates of hydrogen- and He+-ionising photons. Our results suggest that a combination of factors-such as stellar mass, initial mass function, stellar metallicity, and stellar multiplicity-likely contributes to the origin of the observed nebular emission. Specifically, for our galaxies with higher gas-phase metallicity (12 + log(O/H) &amp;gt; 7.55), we find that models for binary population with Salpeter IMF (Mup=100 Msol) and stellar metallicity ~ 0.001 (i.e., similar to that of the gas) can reproduce the observed ionising conditions. However at lower metallicities, models for binary population with `top-heavy' initial mass function (Mup = 300 Msol) and Zstar much lower &amp;lt; Zstar) than that of the gas are required to fully account for the observed ionising photon production. These results reinforce that the ionisation keeps challenging current stellar populations, and the ionisation problem persists in the very low metallicity regime.

It has long been suggested that a fraction of the dark matter in the Universe could exist in the form of primordial black holes (PBHs) that have existed since the radiation dominated era. Recent studies have suggested that these PBHs may be the progenitors to the population of high-redshift, supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed since the launch of JWST. For the first time, we have included PBHs in cosmological simulations, to test whether PBHs can sink to the center of collapsing halos, locate dense gaseous regions and experience significant growth. We tested PBH-to-DM mass ratios of f_PBH = 10^-4 and 10^-3, with an initial PBH mass of 1000 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, as inspired by recent observational constraints. We find that at f_PBH = 10^-3, a number of PBHs were able to embed themselves in dense gas and grow to 10^4-10^5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; by z=20. These intermediate black holes (IMBHs) are possible progenitors to the highest redshift SMBH observations such as GNZ-11 (10^6 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; by z=10), outperforming light seed black hole (BH) growth seen in recent simulations without the need to invoke heavy seeding prescriptions. On the other hand, f_PBH = 10^-4 resulted in no significant BH growth, emphasizing that the ability of PBHs to act as SMBH seeds is sensitive to the true value of f_PBH in the Universe, and showing that the f_PBH =10^-4-10^-3 boundary marks the threshold above which SMBH seeding via 1000 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; PBHs becomes effective. This is the first step towards building a realistic PBH framework in cosmological simulations.

The detection of billion-solar-mass supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the first billion years of cosmic history challenges conventional theories of black hole formation and growth. Simultaneously, recent JWST observations revealing exceptionally high nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratios in galaxies at high redshifts raise critical questions about rapid chemical enrichment mechanisms operating in the early universe. Supermassive stars (SMSs) with masses of 1000 to 10000 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; are promising candidates to explain these phenomena, but existing models have so far neglected the pivotal role of stellar rotation. Here, we present the first comprehensive evolutionary models of rotating Pop III SMSs computed using the GENEC stellar evolution code, including detailed treatments of rotation-induced chemical mixing, angular momentum transport, and mass loss driven by the &amp;Omega;\Gamma limit. We demonstrate that rotation significantly enlarges the convective core and extends stellar lifetimes by up to 20%, with moderate enhancement of mass-loss rates as stars approach critical rotation thresholds. Our results further indicate that the cores of SMSs rotate relatively slowly (below ~ 200 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), resulting in dimensionless spin parameters a* &amp;lt; 0.1 for intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) remnants that are notably lower than theoretical maximum spins. These findings highlight rotation as a key factor in determining the structural evolution, chemical yields, and black hole spin properties of SMSs, providing critical insights to interpret observational signatures from the high-redshift universe.

Galikyan et al. (2025) reported a statistically significant change in galaxy spectral properties at redshift z ≃ 2.7 based on a Kolmogorov Stochasticity Parameter analysis of JWST spectroscopic data of galaxies. In this comment, we demonstrate that their result is critically driven by a single outlier in the dataset. This outlier arises from the use of a questionable redshift estimate for one spectrum. When the outlier is removed or the redshift is corrected, the claimed transition at z ≃ 2.7 disappears entirely. By independently reproducing their analysis, we demonstrate that the claimed feature is not a robust statistical signal, but an artefact of this anomalous data point.

&lt;p&gt;
The likely JWST detection of vibrationally excited H3+ emission in Orion's irradiated disk system d203-506, reported by Schroetter et al., raises an important question: is cosmic-ray ionization enhanced in disks within clustered star-forming regions, or do alternative mechanisms contribute to H3+ formation and excitation? We present a detailed model of the photodissociation region (PDR) component of a protoplanetary disk-comprising the outer disk surface and the photoevaporative wind-exposed to strong external far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation. We investigate key gas-phase reactions involving excited H2 that lead to the formation of H3+ in the PDR, including detailed state-to-state dynamical calculations of reactions H2(v&amp;gt;0) + HOC+ -&amp;gt; H3+ + CO and H2(v&amp;gt;0) + H+ -&amp;gt; H2+ + H. We also consider the effects of photoionization of vibrationally excited H2(v≥4), a process not previously included in PDR or disk models. We find that these FUV-driven reactions dominate the formation of H3+ in the PDR of strongly irradiated disks, largely independently of cosmic-ray ionization. The predicted H3+ abundance in the disk PDR peaks at x(H3+) ~ 1E-8, coinciding with regions of enhanced HOC+ and water vapor abundances, and is linked to the strength of the external FUV field (G_0). The predicted H3+ column density (~1E13 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) agrees with the presence of H3+ in the PDR of d203-506. We also find that formation pumping, resulting from exoergic reactions between excited H2 and HOC+, drive the vibrational excitation of H3+ in these regions. We expect this photochemistry to be highly active in disks where G_0 &amp;gt; 1E3. The H3+ formation pathways studied here may also be relevant in the inner disk region (near the host star), in exoplanetary ionospheres, and in the early Universe.

Observations and high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations indicate that massive star clusters form through a complex hierarchical assembly. We use simulations including post-Newtonian dynamics (the BIFROST code) and stellar evolution (the SEVN module) to investigate this collisional assembly. With a full initial stellar mass function, we study the effect of initial binary, triple and massive single stars (450 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) on the assembly, structure, and kinematics of massive (M_cl~10^6 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, N=1.8 × 10^6) star clusters. Simultaneously, intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs), potential seeds for supermassive black holes, can form and grow in our models by stellar collisions, tidal disruption events (TDEs) and black hole (BH) mergers. At a fixed cluster mass, stellar multiplicity or a high mass limit increase the numbers (up to ~ 10) and masses (up to 10^4 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) of the formed IMBHs within the first 10 Myr of cluster evolution. The TDE rates peak at \Gamma_tde~ 5 × 10^-5 yr^-1 after IMBH formation at ~ 2 Myr. In all simulations, we find gravitational wave driven mergers involving stellar BHs and IMBHs. Initial multiplicity or a high mass limit also result in IMBH-IMBH mergers. The IMBH masses correlate with the initial cluster masses, surface densities and velocity dispersions approximately as M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;prop; M_cl, M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prop;&amp;Sigma;_h^3/2 and M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prop;&amp;sigma;^3. Our results suggest the dense z~10 star clusters recently observed by the James Webb Space Telescope host IMBHs with masses above M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt; ≳ 10^4 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;.

High-redshift (z&amp;gt;2) massive quiescent galaxies are crucial tests of early galaxy formation and evolutionary mechanisms through their cosmic number densities and stellar mass functions (SMFs). We explore a sample of 743 massive (M_*&amp;gt; 10^9.5M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) quiescent galaxies from z=2-7 in over 800 arcmin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of NIRCam imaging from a compilation of public JWST fields (with a total area &amp;gt; 5 × previous JWST studies). We compute and report their cosmic number densities, stellar mass functions, and cosmic stellar mass density. We confirm a significant overabundance of massive quiescent galaxies relative to a range of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and semi-analytic models (SAMs). We find that no simulations or SAMs accurately reproduce the SMF for massive quiescent galaxies at any redshift within the interval z=2-5. This shows that none of these models' feedback prescriptions are fully capturing high-z galaxy quenching, challenging the standard formation scenarios. We find a greater abundance of lower-mass (M_*&amp;lt;10^10M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) quiescent galaxies than previously found, highlighting the importance of sSFR cuts rather than simple colour selection. We show the importance of this selection bias, alongside individual field-to-field variations caused by cosmic variance, in varying the observed quiescent galaxy SMF, especially at higher-z. We also find a steeper increase in the cosmic stellar mass density for massive quiescent galaxies than has been seen previously, with &amp;rho;_*&amp;prop; (1+z)^-7.2±0.3, indicating the dramatic increase in the importance of galaxy quenching within these epochs.

&lt;p&gt;
Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal a previously unseen population of compact red objects, known as "little red dots" (LRDs). We study a new photometrically selected sample of 124 LRDs in the redshift range z ~ 3 - 10 selected from NIRCam coverage of the CEERS, NEP-TDF, JADES and JEMS surveys. For JADES, the NEP-TDF and CEERS, we compare SED models with and without AGN components and analyse the impact of an AGN component on the goodness of fit using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). We find that whilst the &amp;chi;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the majority of models containing AGN components is improved compared to models without AGN components, we show that the BIC suggests models without AGN are a more appropriate fit to LRD SEDs, especially when MIRI data is available. We also measure LRD clustering in the CEERS field, JADES field, and NEP-TDF, where we compare the spatial distribution of LRDs and galaxies with Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of equality of distribution. We find that the neighbourhood of LRDs tends to be less dense compared to galaxies at all selections and masses and at similar redshifts. We further measure upper limit estimates for the halo masses of LRDs using abundance matching. Whilst the population of LRDs could be a mixture of several different inherent populations, as a whole it does appear that these systems are mostly hosting compact galaxies or star clusters in formation.

&lt;p&gt;
We study the Ly&amp;alpha; escape fraction, f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt;^Ly&amp;alpha; of Ly&amp;alpha; emitters (LAEs) identified by Subaru/HSC narrowband imaging at z = 2.2-6.6, using publicly available deep imaging data from HST and JWST. We perform SED fitting for 127 LAEs at 0.4 - 5.0  &amp;mu; m to estimate their physical properties robustly, and confirm that two distinct LAE populations exist: young LAEs (&amp;lt; 100 Myr) and old LAEs (&amp;gt; 100 Myr). Young LAEs are characterized by burst-like star formation activity and low dust content, significantly differing from Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at the same stellar mass, while old LAEs show similar star formation activity to LBGs, yet with lower dust content and more compact morphology in rest-UV/optical than LBGs. The f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt;^Ly&amp;alpha; of LAEs is anticorrelated with stellar mass, and this correlation is found to depend on the age of LAEs, such that old LAEs show a weaker anticorrelation than young LAEs, and tend to exhibit higher f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt;^Ly&amp;alpha; than young LAEs at a given stellar mass. This implies that Ly&amp;alpha; photons escape more efficiently from old LAEs, possibly through the low-density channels of HI and dust created by outflows. The average f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt;^Ly&amp;alpha; of young LAEs remains nearly constant at ~40% at z = 2.2-6.6, suggesting that the previously observed evolution of global f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt;^Ly&amp;alpha; of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is due to the changes in the LAE fraction among the SFGs. Converting f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt;^Ly&amp;alpha; to Lyman continuum escape fraction using empirical relations, we demonstrate that LAEs alone can supply the ionizing photons necessary for reionization at z~6, causing rapid and late reionization.

&lt;p&gt;
To better understand how galaxies assemble their structure and evolve over cosmic time, we present a new catalog of morphological measurements for over 340,000 sources spanning 0 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 12, derived from deep JWST NIRCam imaging across four major extragalactic fields (CEERS, PRIMER-UDS, PRIMER-COSMOS, GOODS) compiled in the DAWN JWST Archive (DJA). We perform two-dimensional surface brightness fitting for all galaxies in a uniform, flux-limited sample. Each galaxy is modeled with both a S\'ersic profile and a two-component (bulge and disk) decomposition, yielding consistent structural parameters - including effective radius, S\'ersic index, axis ratio, and bulge-to-total ratio (B/T). To demonstrate the scientific application of our morphology catalogs, we combined these measurements with DJA photometric redshifts, physical parameters and rest-frame colors, and investigated the relation between total, bulge and disk sizes, S\'ersic index (n_S), star formation activity, and redshift. Bulge-dominated galaxies (high n_S and B/T) predominantly occupy the quiescent region of the UVJ diagram, while disk-dominated galaxies are mostly star-forming. A significant bimodality persists, with quiescent disks and compact, bulge-dominated star-forming galaxies observed out to z &amp;gt; 3. Quiescent galaxies also show significantly higher stellar mass surface densities, nearly an order of magnitude greater at z ~ 4 than at z ~ 1. Our results confirm a strong and evolving link between morphology and star formation activity, and support a scenario in which bulge growth and quenching are closely connected. This work is a highly valuable addition to the DJA, adding a morphological dimension to this rich dataset and thus enabling a wider scientific application.

&lt;p&gt;
Ly&amp;alpha; emitters (LAEs) have now been discovered out to redshift z=13, and are valuable probes of the reionization history at redshifts beyond the reach of other currently available tracers. Most inferences of the neutral hydrogen fraction from LAE observations rely on one-point and two-point statistics like the luminosity function and the power spectrum. We present here an analysis of the bispectrum of high-redshift LAEs and demonstrate its sensitivity to the Epoch of Reionization. We use the Sherwood-Relics suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with the GPU-based radiative transfer code ATON-HE to generate realistic LAE mock catalogues for a wide range of reionization models, varying the ionization history and the source populations, including contributions of AGN to hydrogen reionization. We demonstrate that the bispectrum provides greater sensitivity than the power spectrum to both the timing and spatial morphology of reionization. Using reduced-&amp;chi;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; analysis we further show that the bispectrum also responds more strongly to variations in source population and AGN contribution, apparently more efficiently capturing morphological features missed by two-point statistics. The redshift evolution of the bispectrum reflects the increased clustering of ionizing sources at earlier epochs. The sensitivity of the bispectrum to peculiar velocities underscores the importance of velocity corrections in comparisons to observations. Our findings demonstrate that the LAE bispectrum is a powerful higher-order statistic for probing reionization through current and future LAE surveys using telescopes such as Subaru and JWST.

&lt;p&gt;
We present a new stellar dynamical measurement of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the compact elliptical galaxy NGC 4486B, based on integral field spectroscopy with JWST/NIRSpec. The two-dimensional kinematic maps reveal a resolved double nucleus and a velocity dispersion peak offset from the photometric center. Utilizing two independent methods-Schwarzschild orbit-superposition and Jeans Anisotropic Modeling-we tightly constrain the black hole mass by fitting the full line-of-sight velocity distribution. Our axisymmetric Schwarzschild models yield a best-fit black hole mass of M_BH = 3.6^+0.7_-0.7 × 10^8   M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, slightly lower but significantly more precise than previous estimates. However, since our models do not account for the non-equilibrium nature of the double nucleus, this value may represent a lower limit. Across all tested dynamical models, the inferred M_BH/M_* ratio ranges from ~ 4-13%, providing robust evidence for an overmassive SMBH in NGC 4486B. Combined with the galaxy's location deep within the Virgo Cluster, our results support the interpretation that NGC 4486B is the tidally stripped remnant core of a formerly massive galaxy. As the JWST/NIRSpec field of view is insufficient to constrain the dark matter halo, we incorporate archival ground-based long-slit kinematics extending to 5 arcsec. While this provides some leverage on the dark matter content, the constraints remain relatively weak. We place only an upper limit on the dark matter fraction, with M_DM/M_* &amp;lt; 0.5 within 1 kpc-well beyond the effective radius. The inferred black hole mass remains unchanged with or without a dark matter halo.

We present high-resolution and spatially-matched observations with JWST and ALMA of a starburst galaxy (PACS-830) at z=1.46. The NIRCam observations mainly trace the stellar light while the CO (J=5&amp;ndash;4) observations map the dense molecular gas at kpc scales. Both datasets reveal the morphology to be that of a gas/dust rich bulge with two extending arms, together resembling a grand-design spiral galaxy. The more pronounced arm contributes 21 ± 6&amp;percnt; of the total CO emission. These results demonstrate that starburst activity at high redshift can be triggered, without undergoing a highly disruptive major merger. We assess the strength and distribution of star formation using two tracers: (1) Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) emission detected at 8~&amp;mu;m (L_8) with a MIRI/F1800W image, and (2) L_IR, inferred from the CO (J=5&amp;ndash;4) map. The spatial profiles of the L_IR and L_8 are dissimilar, thus leading to a significant deficit of mid-IR (L_8) emission in the nucleus. We hypothesize that this is due to the destruction of PAH molecules by the intense ionizing radiation field or decreased emission in the photodissociation region, as seen in nearby star-forming regions and consistent with the galaxy-wide properties of distant starbursts. This study reveals spatial variations in the L_8 to L_IR ratio for the first time at z&amp;gt;1, in agreement with expectations from theory. Our analysis underscores the pivotal role of joint high-resolution observations with JWST and ALMA in discerning the different phases of the interstellar medium (ISM) and revealing internal physics in galaxy substructures.

&lt;p&gt;
One of the most puzzling discoveries by JWST is the population of high-redshift, red, and compact galaxies dubbed little red dots (LRDs). Based on broad-line diagnostics, these galaxies have been argued to host accreting 10^7-10^8 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; supermassive black holes (SMBHs), a claim with crucial consequences for our understanding of how the first black holes form and grow over cosmic time. A key feature of LRDs is their extreme X-ray weakness: analyses of individual and stacked sources have yielded non-detections or only tentative, inconclusive X-ray signals, except for a handful of individual cases. Although high obscuration is the most straightforward way to explain the X-ray weakness of LRDs, JWST rest-frame optical/UV spectra initially argued against the presence of Compton-thick gas clouds. Instead, several authors have proposed that LRDs are intrinsically X-ray weak due to super-Eddington accretion rates. In this work, we observationally test these tailored models by stacking X-ray data for 55 LRDs in the Chandra Deep Field South, accumulating a total exposure time of nearly 400 Ms. Despite reaching unprecedented X-ray depths, our stack still yields a non-detection. The corresponding upper limits are deep enough to rule out current super-Eddington accretion models, and are compatible only with extremely high levels of obscuration (N_H≳10^25 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). To explain the X-ray weakness of LRDs, we therefore speculate that the SMBHs in these systems are neither as massive nor as luminous as currently believed.

Synergies between JWST and ALMA are unveiling a population of bright, super-early (z&amp;gt;10) galaxies, including systems like GS-z14-0 (z=14.2) and GHZ2 (z=12.3) with extreme FIR line ratios ([OIII] 88 um / [CII] 158 um &amp;gt;3) that challenge galaxy formation models. To address this, we identify a synthetic analog of these sources, "Amaryllis", within the SERRA zoom-in simulations, and track its evolution from z=16 to z=7. During this period, Amaryllis grows from log(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) ~ 7.4 to 10.3, linking super-early progenitors to the massive galaxy population at the end of reionization. At z ~ 11.5, Amaryllis closely matches the observed properties of GS-z14-0, including M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;, SFR, and the luminosity of FIR ([OIII] 88 um) and UV (e.g. CIII] 1908) lines. We find that high [OIII]/[CII] ratios appear during short, merger-driven starburst episodes, when low metallicity (Z ~ 0.02 Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) and high ionization conditions (U&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 0.1) push the ISM far from equilibrium. These extreme FIR line ratios are thus transient and linked to major mergers that ignite strong ionized gas outflows. Strikingly, despite this dynamical activity, Amaryllis develops a rotation-supported gaseous disk (V/&amp;sigma; ~ 4-6) by z ~ 11, while stars remain dispersion-dominated. This coexistence of ordered gas rotation and merger-driven disturbances occurs within a massive yet typical &amp;Lambda;CDM halo, enabling disk formation even at cosmic dawn.

JWST spectroscopy has built large emission line samples at z≳4, but it has yet to confidently reveal many galaxies with the hard radiation fields commonly associated with AGN photoionization. While this may indicate a weaker UV ionizing spectrum in many z&amp;gt;4 AGNs or obscuration from dense neutral gas and dust, the complete picture remains unclear owing to the small number of deep rest-UV spectra. Here we characterize the strength of high ionization lines in 53 new galaxies observed with NIRSpec R=2700 grating spectroscopy. We present new detections of narrow NV&amp;lambda;1240 in two galaxies. One is a previously-confirmed z=6.98 Little Red Dot (LRD) with broad H&amp;beta;, and the other is a z=8.72 galaxy with a narrow line spectrum. Neither source exhibits CIV or HeII emission, indicating large NV/CIV and NV/HeII ratios that may reflect a combination of nitrogen-enhancement and resonant scattering effects. We investigate the incidence of narrow high ionization lines in a large database of 851 NIRSpec grating spectra, and we separately quantify the fraction of LRDs with narrow high ionization UV emission lines. Our results likely suggest that hard radiation fields are indeed present in a small subset of LRDs (12.5^+23.7_-10.4&amp;percnt;) and UV-selected galaxies (2.2^+1.7_-1.0&amp;percnt;) at z&amp;gt;4. The identification of narrow high ionization lines in the population of LRDs with strong Balmer absorption suggests the dense neutral hydrogen gas may not uniformly cover the nucleus. The strong NV (coupled with weak CIV and HeII) suggests that efforts to identify high ionization lines should extend down in wavelength to the NV doublet.

We confront the star formation rate in different dark matter (DM) models with UV luminosity data from JWST up to z≃25 and legacy data from HST. We find that a transition from a Salpeter population to top-heavy Pop-III stars is likely at z≃10 and that beyond z=10-15 the feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei is progressively reduced, so that at z≃25 the production of stars is almost free from any feedback. We compare fuzzy and warm DM models that suppress small-scale structures with the CDM paradigm, finding that the fuzzy DM mass &amp;gt; 4.5 × 10^-22 eV and the warm DM mass &amp;gt; 1.5  keV at the 95&amp;percnt; CL. The fits of the star formation rate parametrization do not depend strongly on the DM properties within the allowed range. We find no preference over CDM for enhanced matter perturbations associated with axion miniclusters or primordial black holes. The scale of the enhancement of the power spectrum should be &amp;gt; 27 Mpc^-1 at the 95&amp;percnt; CL, excluding axion miniclusters produced for m_a &amp;lt; 7.5 × 10^-17 eV or heavy primordial black holes that constitute a fraction f_PBH &amp;gt; Max[88 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;/m_PBH, 10^-4 (m_PBH/10^4 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;)^-0.09] of DM.

We present the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) for a parent sample of 604 galaxies at z=5.34-6.94 with \OIII doublets detected, using the deep JWST/NIRCam wide field slitless spectroscopic (WFSS) observations in 26 quasar fields. The sample incorporates the full observations of 25 quasar fields from the JWST Cycle 1 GO program ASPIRE and the quasar SDSS J0100+2802 from the JWST EIGER program. We identify 204 galaxies residing in overdense structures using the friends-of-friends (FoF) algorithm. We estimate the electron temperature of 2.0^+0.3_-0.4×10^4 K from the Hg and OIII4363 lines in the stacked spectrum, indicating a metal-poor sample with median gas phase metallicity 12+log(O/H)=7.65^+0.26_-0.15. With the most up-to-date strong line calibration based on NIRSpec observations, we find that the MZR shows a metal enhancement of ~0.2 dex at the high mass end in overdense environments. However, compared to the local Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR), our galaxy sample at z&amp;gt;5 shows a metal deficiency of ~0.2 dex relative to FMR predictions. We explain the observed trend of FMR with a simple analytical model, favoring dilution from intense gas accretion over outflow to explain the metallicity properties at z &amp;gt; 5. Those high-redshift galaxies are likely in a rapid gas accretion phase, during which their metal and gas contents are in a non-equilibrium state. According to model predictions, the protocluster members are closer to the gas equilibrium state than field galaxies and thus have higher metallicity and are closer to the local FMR. Our results suggest that the accelerated star formation during protocluster assembly likely plays a key role in shaping the observed MZR and FMR, indicating a potentially earlier onset of metal enrichment in overdense environments at z≈5-7.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discovered 79 transients out to z~4.8 through the JADES Transient Survey (JTS), but the JTS did not find any z&amp;gt;5 transients. Here, we present the first photometric evidence of a z&amp;gt;5 transient/variable source with JWST. The source, AT 2023adya, resides in a z&lt;sub&gt;spec&lt;/sub&gt;=5.274 galaxy in GOODS-N, which dimmed from m_F356W=26.05±0.02 mag to 26.24±0.02 mag in the rest-frame optical over approximately two rest-frame months, producing a clear residual signal in the difference image (m_F356W=28.01±0.17 mag; SN_var=6.09) at the galaxy center. Shorter-wavelength bands (F090W/F115W) show no rest-frame ultraviolet brightness change. Based on its rest-frame V-band absolute magnitude of M_V=-18.48 mag, AT 2023adya could be any core-collapse supernova (SN) subtype or an SN Ia. However, due to low SN Ia rates at high redshift, the SN Ia scenario is unlikely. Alternatively, AT 2023adya may be a variable active galactic nucleus (AGN). However, the JWST NIRCam/Grism spectrum shows no broad H&amp;alpha; emission line (FWHM=130±26 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), disfavoring the variable AGN scenario. It is also unlikely that AT 2023adya is a tidal disruption event (TDE) because the TDE models matching the observed brightness changes have low event rates. Although it is not possible to determine AT 2023adya's nature based on the two-epoch single-band photometry alone, this discovery indicates that JWST can push the frontier of transient/variable science past z=5 and towards the epoch of reionization.

The rates and properties of tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide valuable insights into their host galaxy central stellar densities and the demographics of their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). TDEs have been observed only at low redshifts (z ≲ 1), due to the difficulty in conducting deep time-domain surveys. In this work, we present the discovery of a high-redshift TDE candidate, HZTDE-1, in the COSMOS-Web survey with JWST's NIRCam, using a novel selection technique based on color and morphology. We first outline a methodology for identifying high-z TDEs in deep infrared imaging surveys, leveraging their unique spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and morphologies of these transients. We apply this technique to COSMOS-Web in filters F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W, and identify HZTDE-1, a transient point source relative to archival UltraVISTA infrared observations. If we assume it is a TDE, we estimate its photometric redshift to be z=5.02^+1.32_-1.11. HZTDE-1 cannot be explained by reasonable supernova or AGN models. However, we cannot rule out a superluminous supernova at z≳3. If confirmed with follow-up observations, HZTDE-1 would represent the highest-redshift TDE discovery to date, and would suggest an enhancement of the TDE rate in the high-redshift universe. Our method, which can be applied to future deep surveys with JWST and Roman, offers a pathway to identify TDEs at z&amp;gt;4 and probe black hole demographics at early cosmic times.

&lt;p&gt;
Low-mass quiescent galaxies are thought to predominantly reside in overdense regions, as environmental effects are often invoked to explain their shutdown of star formation. These longer-timescale quenching mechanisms - such as interactions with hot gas in the intracluster medium and dynamical encounters with other cluster galaxies - leave imprints on galaxy morphologies, emphasizing the importance of quantifying the structures of low-mass quiescent galaxies in galaxy clusters at z&amp;lt;0.5. Using spectrophotometric data from the UNCOVER and MegaScience programs, we present the first measurement of the quiescent size-mass relation between 7&amp;lt;log(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;lt;10 using JWST imaging, based on a sample of 1531 galaxies in the z=0.308 Abell 2744 galaxy cluster. The resulting size-mass relation has a significantly higher scatter than similar-redshift field samples, despite comparable best-fit relations in both the dwarf and intermediate-mass regimes. Both "progenitor bias", where larger, diskier low-mass galaxies enter the cluster at later epochs, and a general expansion of galaxy structure from dynamical interactions could be at play. This evolutionary framework is further supported by the tentative evidence that older low-mass quiescent galaxies in the cluster are more spheroidal. The star-formation histories derived for our cluster sample imply their formation and quenching occurs relatively late, at z&amp;lt;1.5. In this scenario, the progenitor population would have disky axis-ratio distributions at cosmic noon, in agreement with recent observations. While this leaves ample time for dynamical interactions to maintain quiescence and drive the observed subsequent morphological evolution post-quenching, the data disfavors an onset of quenching due to the environment.

&lt;p&gt;
Environmental quenching &amp;ndash; where interactions with other galaxies and/or the intra-cluster medium (ICM) suppress star formation in low-mass galaxies &amp;ndash; has been well-established as the primary driver behind the formation of the red sequence for low-mass galaxies within clusters at low redshift (z&amp;lt;1). However, it remains unclear whether these mechanisms are active at higher-redshifts in proto-cluster environments that are not yet fully virialized. In large part, this regime has remained unexplored due to observational limitations; however, JWST has recently opened a new window into the role of environmental quenching on low-mass (log(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;9.0) galaxies at cosmic noon (2 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 3). Here, we leverage the deep imaging and R~15 spectrophotometry enabled by the 20 band JWST/NIRCam data from the UNCOVER and MegaScience programs to examine environmental quenching in a newly discovered z≈2.58 proto-cluster. We compare the star formation histories (SFHs) of 19 low-mass quiescent galaxies in the proto-cluster to a matched sample of 18 in the field, and find no significant differences. This similarity extends to galaxy sizes and quenched fractions, which also show no significant differences between the two environments across the full stellar mass range (8.5&amp;lt;log(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;≤11.0). This indicates that the proto-cluster has not yet accelerated quenching relative to the field and is consistent with expectations that z&amp;gt;2 proto-clusters have yet to virialize and develop a dense enough environment required to efficiently quench low-mass galaxies.

We present the first results from MARTA (Measuring Abundances at high Redshift with the T_e Approach), a programme leveraging ultra-deep, medium-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy to probe the interstellar medium (ISM) of star-forming galaxies at z ~ 2 - 3. We report detections of one or more auroral lines, including [O III]&amp;lambda;4363, [O II]&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;7320,7330, [S II] &amp;lambda;4068, and [S III] &amp;lambda;6312 for 16 galaxies in the sample, providing measurements of multiple ionic temperatures. We tested the validity of the T[O II]-T[O III] relation at high redshift considering a total sample of 21 objects including literature data, and obtained a shallower slope than in the low-z literature. However, such a slope is consistent with low-redshift data when ultra-low metallicity objects are considered. We assessed the correlation of the T[O II]-T[O III] relationship and its scatter on different physical parameters, finding a mild correlation with the ionisation parameter and radiation field hardness, while no significant correlation with gas density. The location of high-redshift data is also consistent with the low-z literature in the T[O II]-T[S II], and T[S III]-T[O III] relations, although this conclusion is limited with low-number statistics. Finally, we leveraged our sample together with a comprehensive compilation of galaxies with [O III]&amp;lambda;4363 detections from the literature to recalibrate classical strong-line diagnostics at high redshift. MARTA represents a key addition in this space because it provides direct metallicities at moderately high oxygen abundances (12+log(O/H) ~8.0-8.4).

We present the first characterization of the Gunn-Peterson trough in high-redshift galaxies using public JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy. This enables us to derive the first galaxy-based IGM opacity measurements at the end of reionisation. Using galaxy spectra has several advantages over quasar spectra: it enables measurements of the IGM opacity in any extragalactic field over a continuous redshift range 4≲ z≲ 7, as well as measurements of the intrinsic Lyman-&amp;beta; opacity. Our novel constraints are in good agreement with state-of-the-art ground-based quasar Lyman-&amp;alpha; forest observations, and will become competitive as the number of JWST z&amp;gt;5 galaxy spectra rapidly increases. We also provide the first constraints on the uncontaminated Lyman-&amp;beta; opacity at 5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6. Finally, we demonstrate the power of JWST to connect the ionisation state of the IGM to the sources of reionisation in a single extragalactic field. We show that a previously reported galaxy overdensity and an excess of Lyman-&amp;alpha; emitters detected with JWST in GOODS-South at z=5.8-5.9 coincides with an anomalously low IGM opacity to Lyman-&amp;alpha; at this redshift. The local photo-ionisation rate excess can be fully accounted for by the cumulative ionising output of M_UV≲ -10 galaxies in the overdensity, provided they have log_10&amp;langle;  &amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt;  f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt; /  [erg^-1 Hz]&amp;rangle; ≃ 25 (e.g. log_10 &amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt;  /  [erg^-1 Hz]=25.4 and f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt;=40&amp;percnt;). Overall, this breakthrough offers a new way to connect the galaxy large-scale structure to the state of the IGM, potentially enabling us to precisely identify the sources of reionisation.

&lt;p&gt;
Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are thought to influence the evolution of their host galaxies through multi-phase feedback driven by powerful nuclear outflows. Although this mechanism is central to theoretical models of SMBH-galaxy co-evolution across cosmic time, direct observational evidence connecting nuclear winds to large-scale cold gas outflows remains limited, especially in the early universe. Here we report statistical evidence for such a connection in a sample of luminous quasars at z ~ 5.5. We compare stacked [CII] 158 &amp;mu;m emission profiles from ALMA observations, which trace galactic-scale neutral gas, for quasars with and without broad absorption lines (BALs) that indicate powerful nuclear winds on sub-kiloparsec scales. The BAL quasar stack exhibits a significant (S/N = 4.45) blueshifted broad component in the [CII] line profile, with a velocity offset of &amp;Delta; v_b = -2.1 × 10^2 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and a full width at half maximum of 1.18 × 10^3 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, whereas the non-BAL stack shows no such feature. We estimate that a few percent to one-quarter of the nuclear wind energy may be transferred to cold neutral gas on kiloparsec scales. These results suggest that BAL winds can couple to the host galaxy's interstellar medium, providing empirical support for models of multi-phase AGN feedback. This mechanism may also contribute to the observed divers ity in M_BH/M_* among luminous quasars recently identified by JWST.

The standard model of cosmology has provided a good phenomenological description of a wide range of observations both at astrophysical and cosmological scales for several decades. This concordance model is constructed by a universal cosmological constant and supported by a matter sector described by the standard model of particle physics and a cold dark matter contribution, as well as very early-time inflationary physics, and underpinned by gravitation through general relativity. There have always been open questions about the soundness of the foundations of the standard model. However, recent years have shown that there may also be questions from the observational sector with the emergence of differences between certain cosmological probes. In this White Paper, we identify the key objectives that need to be addressed over the coming decade together with the core science projects that aim to meet these challenges. These discordances primarily rest on the divergence in the measurement of core cosmological parameters with varying levels of statistical confidence. These possible statistical tensions may be partially accounted for by systematics in various measurements or cosmological probes but there is also a growing indication of potential new physics beyond the standard model. After reviewing the principal probes used in the measurement of cosmological parameters, as well as potential systematics, we discuss the most promising array of potential new physics that may be observable in upcoming surveys. We also discuss the growing set of novel data analysis approaches that go beyond traditional methods to test physical models. [Abridged]

We present deep JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging of Ion1, a previously confirmed Lyman Continuum (LyC)-emitting galaxy at z&lt;sub&gt;spec&lt;/sub&gt;=3.794. Together with existing HST imaging, these new observations from the JADES program enable a joint analysis of Ion1's LyC, rest-frame UV, stellar, and dust emission with unprecedented detail. We report the first detection of dust emission at rest-frame ~3 &amp;mu;m in a high-redshift LyC-emitting galaxy using MIRI/F1500W. Our analysis suggests a porous distribution of dust in Ion1, with regions exhibiting evidence of dust deficit coinciding both with LyC-emitting regions and with the peak of H&amp;alpha; emission. Furthermore, multi-band NIRCam imaging reveals a strong FUV-to-optical color gradient, where LyC-emitting regions appear significantly bluer than the rest of Ion1. Spatially resolved SED fitting confirms that this color gradient is primarily driven by spatially varying dust attenuation. Together, these findings suggest that Ion1's LyC emission originates from a compact star-forming complex near its stellar-light centroid, where stellar feedback carves out low HI column density channels, facilitating LyC escape. However, only a fraction of these LyC photons - specifically those along sightlines with minimal HI obscuration - ultimately escape and reach observers. This work underscores the critical role of dust and neutral gas geometry in shaping LyC escape in galaxies at high redshifts. Anisotropic LyC escape may be a common feature in the early Universe, which must be properly incorporated to constrain the Epoch of Reionization.

Motivated by JWST observations of dense, clumpy and clustered high redshift star formation, we simulate the hierarchical assembly of nine M_cl=10^6 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; star clusters using the BIFROST N-body code. Our low metallicity models (0.01Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) with post-Newtonian equations of motion for black holes include evolving populations of single, binary and triple stars. Massive stars grow by stellar collisions and collapse into intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) up to M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt;~6200 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, stellar multiplicity boosting the IMBH masses by a factor of 2&amp;ndash;3. The IMBHs tidally disrupt (TDE) ~50 stars in 10 Myr with peak TDE rates up to \Gamma~5×10^-5 yr^-1 per cluster. These IMBHs are natural seeds for supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and the hierarchical assembly frequently leads to &amp;gt;2 SMBH seeds per cluster and their rapid mergers (t&amp;lt;10 Myr). We propose that a gravitational wave (GW) driven merger of IMBHs with 1000 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; ≲ M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt; ≲ 10000 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; with comparable masses is a characteristic GW fingerprint of SMBH seed formation at redshifts z&amp;gt;10, and IMBH formation in similar environments at lower redshifts. Massive star clusters provide a unique environment for the early Universe GW studies for the next-generation GW observatories including the Einstein Telescope and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.

&lt;p&gt;
The Flashlights program with the Hubble Space Telescope imaged the six Hubble Frontier Fields galaxy clusters in two epochs and detected twenty transients. These are primarily expected to be caustic-crossing events (CCEs) where bright stars in distant lensed galaxies, typically at redshift z≈1&amp;ndash;3, get temporarily magnified close to cluster caustics. Since CCEs are generally biased toward more massive and luminous stars, they offer a unique route for probing the high end of the stellar mass function. We take advantage of the Flashlights event statistics to place preliminary constraints on the stellar initial mass function (IMF) around cosmic noon. The photometry (along with spectral information) of lensed arcs is used to infer their various stellar properties, and stellar synthesis models are used to evolve a recent stellar population in them. We estimate the microlens surface density near each arc and, together with existing lens models and simple formalism for CCEs, calculate the expected rate for a given IMF. We find that, on average, a Salpeter-like IMF (&amp;alpha;=2.35) underpredicts the number of observed CCEs by a factor of ~0.7, and a top-heavy IMF (&amp;alpha;=1.00) overpredicts by a factor of ~1.7, suggesting that the average IMF slope may lie somewhere in between. However, given the large uncertainties associated with estimating the stellar populations, these results are strongly model-dependent. Nevertheless, we introduce a useful framework for constraining the IMF using CCEs. Observations with JWST are already yielding many more CCEs and will soon enable more stringent constraints on the IMF at a range of redshifts.

&lt;p&gt;
In the current era of JWST, we continue to uncover a wealth of information about the Universe deep into the Epoch of Reionization. In this work, we use a suite of simulations with 21cmSPACE, to explore the astrophysical properties of early galaxies and their imprint on high-redshift observables. Our analysis incorporates a range of multi-wavelength datasets including UV luminosity functions (UVLFs) from HST and JWST spanning z=6-14.5, the 21-cm global signal and power spectrum limits from SARAS 3 and HERA respectively, as well as present-day diffuse X-ray and radio backgrounds. We constrain a flexible halo-mass and redshift dependent model of star-formation efficiency (SFE), defined as the fraction of gas converted into stars, and find that it is best described by minimal redshift evolution at z≈ 6-10, followed by rapid evolution at z≈10-15. Using Bayesian inference, we derive functional posteriors of the SFE, inferring that halos of mass M_h=10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; have efficiencies of ≈ 1 - 2&amp;percnt; at z≲10, ≈8&amp;percnt; at z=12 and ≈21&amp;percnt; at z=15. We also highlight the synergy between UVLFs and global 21-cm signal from SARAS 3 in constraining the minimum virial conditions required for star-formation in halos. In parallel, we find the X-ray and radio efficiencies of early galaxies to be f_X = 0.8^+9.7_-0.4 and f_r ≲ 16.9 respectively, improving upon previous works that exclude UVLF data. Our results underscore the critical role of UVLFs in constraining early galaxy properties, and their synergy with 21-cm and other multi-wavelength observations.

&lt;p&gt;
The presence of nine candidate galaxies at z=17 and z=25 discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope in relatively small sky areas, if confirmed, is virtually impossible to reconcile with the predictions of the current galaxy formation model. We show here that the implied UV luminosity density can be produced by a population of primordial black holes (PBHs) of mass M_PBH = 10^4-5   M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; residing in low-mass halos (M_h ≈ 10^7   M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;), and accreting at a moderate fraction of the Eddington luminosity, &amp;lambda;_E ≃ 0.36. These sources precede the first significant episodes of cosmic star formation. At later times, as star formation is ignited, PBH emission becomes comparable to, or subdominant with respect to, the galactic emission. This PBH+galaxy scenario reconciles the evolution of the UV luminosity function (LF) from z=25 to z=11. If ultra-early sources are powered purely by accretion, this strongly disfavours seed production mechanisms requiring the presence of stars (massive stars, Pop III stars, or clusters), or their UV radiation (direct collapse BHs), leaving PBHs as the only alternative solution available so far. Alternative explanations, such as isolated, large clusters (≈ 10^7  M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) of massive (m&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; =10^3 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) Pop III stars are marginally viable, but require extreme and unlikely conditions that can be probed via UV and far-infrared (FIR) emission lines or gravitational waves.

We present a sample of six F200W and three F277W dropout sources identified as 16&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;25 galaxy candidates using the deepest JWST/NIRCam data to date (5&amp;sigma; depths ~31.5 mag at ≥2 &amp;mu;m), provided by the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) and the Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public survey (NGDEEP). We estimate ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions and densities at z~17 and z~25. The number density of galaxies with absolute magnitudes -19&amp;lt;M_UV&amp;lt;-18 at z~17 (z~25) is a factor of 4 (25) smaller than at z~12; the luminosity density presents a similar evolution. Compared to state-of-the-art galaxy simulations, we find the need for an enhanced UV-photon production at z=17-25 in M_DM=10^8.5-9.5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; dark matter halos, provided by an increase in the star formation efficiency at early times and/or by intense compact starbursts with enhanced emissivity linked to strong burstiness, low or primordial gas metallicities, and/or a top-heavy initial mass function. There are few robust theoretical predictions for the evolution of galaxies above z~20 in the literature, however, the continuing rapid drop in the halo mass function would predict a more rapid evolution than we observe if photon production efficiencies remained constant. Our z&amp;gt;16 candidates present mass-weighted ages around 30 Myr, and attenuations A(V)&amp;lt;0.1 mag. Their average stellar mass is M_\bigstar~10^7 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, implying a stellar-to-baryon mass fraction around 10% if the emissivity increases with redshift, or significantly higher otherwise. Three candidates present very blue UV spectral slopes (&amp;beta;~-3) compatible with Pop III young (≲10 Myr) stars and/or high escape fractions of ionizing photons; the rest have &amp;beta;~-2.5 similar to z=10-12 samples.

We fit stellar population synthesis model spectra to these JWST spectra, masking out nebular emission lines, and obtain Fe-abundance ratios of [Fe/H]=-1-0 dex for 5 galaxies and upper limits of [Fe/H]~-2-0 dex for 2 galaxies. We compare these [Fe/H] values with the oxygen abundances of these galaxies (7.4&amp;lt;12+log(O/H)&amp;lt;8.4) in the same manner as previous studies of z~2-6 galaxies, and derive oxygen-to-iron abundance ratios [O/Fe]. We find that 2 out of 7 galaxies, GS-z11-0 and GN-z11, show Fe enhancements relative to O ([O/Fe]&amp;lt;0 dex), especially GS-z11-0 (z=11.12) with a Fe enhancement ([O/Fe]=-0.68_-0.55^+0.37 dex) beyond the solar-abundance ratio at ~2&amp;sigma;. Because, unlike GS-z11-0, GN-z11 (z=10.60) may be an AGN, we constrain [O/Fe] via FeII emission under the assumption of AGN and confirm that the Fe enhancement is consistent even in the case of AGN. While [O/Fe] values of most galaxies are comparable to those of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) yields, the Fe enhancements of GS-z11-0 and GN-z11 are puzzling. We develop chemical evolution models, and find that the Fe enhancements in GS-z11-0 and GN-z11 can be explained by 1) pair-instability supernovae/bright hypernovae with little contribution of CCSNe or 2) Type-Ia supernovae with short delay time (~30-50 Myr) with a top-light initial mass function.

We present the COSMOS-Web Lens Survey (COWLS), a sample of over 100 strong lens candidates from the 0.54 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; COSMOS-Web survey, discovered using exquisite James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging across four wavebands. Following two rounds of visual inspection, over 100 candidates were ranked as `high confidence' or `likely' by at least 50&amp;percnt; of inspectors. The COWLS sample has several notable properties: (i) magnified source galaxies spanning redshifts z ~ 0.1 to z ~ 9, which therefore extend into the epoch of reionisation; (ii) the highest-redshift lens galaxies known, pushing galaxy density profile evolution studies beyond z ~ 2; (iii) all lenses are distributed within a contiguous 0.54 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; region, allowing for joint strong and weak lensing analyses; and (iv) a subset exhibits lensed source emission ray-traced near the lens galaxy centers, enabling studies of supermassive black holes and dust absorption. A key innovation of our approach is the use of lens modelling to aid in identifying lenses that may otherwise be missed. This paper is accompanied by the first COWLS public release, providing JWST NIRCam imaging in four bands, lens models, pixelized source reconstructions and lens redshift estimates : https://github.com/Jammy2211/COWLS_COSMOS_Web_Lens_Survey

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has observed massive galaxies at high redshifts, which implies an earlier epoch of reionization (EoR) compared with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) results. In this paper, based on ttPlanck 2020 (NPIPE release), ttACT DR4 and ttSPT-3G data, if assumed a Harrison-Zel'dovich (HZ) primordial power spectrum in the standard cosmological model, we show that the redshift or optical depth of reionization is larger than the case of a power-law (PL) primordial power spectrum. In HZ- &amp;Lambda; CDM model, the redshift of reionization is z_reio = 9.11 ± 0.61 , which is consistent with the JWST result that z_reio ≈ 8.9 . Moreover, the cosmological tensions, i.e. Hubble (H_0) tension and S_8 tension are alleviated in HZ- &amp;Lambda; CDM case. The Hubble constant is H_0 = 70.38 ± 0.35   km/s/Mpc and the structure growth parameter is S_8 = 0.7645± 0.0094 in HZ- &amp;Lambda; CDM model. We also consider two extensions of &amp;Lambda; CDM, including &amp;Lambda; CDM + A_L and &amp;Lambda; CDM + &amp;Omega;_k models. But the extensions of &amp;Lambda; CDM with a HZ spectrum meet more serious CMB anomalies, i.e. lensing anomaly and spatial curvature anomaly as compared with the extensions of &amp;Lambda; CDM with a PL spectrum. We discuss that these two CMB anomalies may come from the degeneracy of cosmological parameters.

&lt;p&gt;
Recently, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has found early galaxies producing photons from more efficient ionization than previously assumed. This may suggest a reionization process with a larger reionization optical depth, &amp;tau;_reio, in some mild disagreement with that inferred from measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB). Intriguingly, the CMB would prefer larger values of &amp;tau;_reio, more consistent with the recent JWST hint, if the large-scale measurements (i.e. &amp;ell; &amp;lt;30) of E-mode polarization are removed. In addition, &amp;tau;_reio has an indirect correlation with today's Hubble constant H_0 in &amp;Lambda;CDM. Motivated by these interesting observations, we investigate and reveal the underlying mechanism for this correlation, using the CMB dataset without the low-&amp;ell; polarization data as a proxy for a potential cosmology with a larger &amp;tau;_reio. We further explore how this correlation may impact the Hubble tension between early and late universe measurements of H_0, in &amp;Lambda;CDM as well as two proposals to alleviate the Hubble tension: the dark radiation (DR) and early dark energy (EDE) models. We find that the Hubble tension gets further reduced mildly for almost all cases due to the larger &amp;tau;_reio and its positive correlation with H_0, with either the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data before those from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) or the DESI data.

&lt;p&gt;
The metallicity of galaxies, and its variation with galactocentric radius, provides key insights into the formation histories of galaxies and the physical processes driving their evolution. In this work, we analyze the radial metallicity gradients of star forming galaxies in the EAGLE, Illustris, IllustrisTNG, and SIMBA cosmological simulations across a broad mass (10^8.0M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;≤ M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; ≲10^12.0M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) and redshift (0≤ z≤8) range. We find that all simulations predict strong negative (i.e., radially decreasing) metallicity gradients at early cosmic times, likely due to their similar treatments of relatively smooth stellar feedback not providing sufficient mixing to quickly flatten gradients. The strongest redshift evolution occurs in galaxies with stellar masses of 10^10.0-10^11.0M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, while galaxies with stellar masses &amp;lt; 10^10M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;gt;10^11M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; exhibit weaker redshift evolution. Our results of negative gradients at high-redshift contrast with the many positive and flat gradients in the 1&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;4 observational literature. At z&amp;gt;6, the negative gradients observed with JWST and ALMA are flatter than those in simulations, albeit with closer agreement than at lower redshift. Overall, we suggest that these smooth stellar feedback galaxy simulations may not sufficiently mix their metal content radially, and that either stronger stellar feedback or additional subgrid turbulent metal diffusion models may be required to better reproduce observed metallicity gradients.

The integral-field unit mode of the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec+IFU) mounted on the James Webb Space Telescope has now enabled kinematic studies of smaller and less massive compact stellar systems in which to search for central massive black holes (BHs) than ever before. We present here the first such detection using NIRSpec+IFU in its highest resolution (R~2700) mode. We report a 3&amp;sigma; detection of a central black hole with mass  M_BH=2.2±1.1×10^6 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; in UCD736 orbiting within the Virgo galaxy cluster based on Schwarzschild's modeling of the 1D kinematic profile. The presence of such a massive BH strongly argues against a globular cluster origin of this UCD, and rather suggests a tidally stripped formation route from a former ≳10^9 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; dwarf galaxy host. Two other methods produce results consistent with Schwarzschild's modelling, but can only provide upper-limits on  M_BH. This represents the detection of a BH in the most compact (r_h≈15 pc) stellar system to date, with a  M_BH corresponding to ~9 percent of the system's stellar mass, roughly in line with previously reported UCD BH detections and comparable to the BH detected in the compact elliptical galaxy NGC4486B.

We present JWST NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy observations of the z=5.89 quasar NDWFS J1425+3254 from 0.6-5.3 microns, covering the rest-frame ultraviolet and optical at a spectral resolution of R~100. The quasar has a black hole mass of M_BH=(1.4\substack+3.1\\-1.0)×10^9 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and an Eddington ratio of L_Bol/L_Edd=0.3\substack+0.6\\-0.2, as implied from the broad Balmer H&amp;alpha; and H&amp;beta; lines. The quasar host has significant ongoing obscured star formation, as well as a quasar-driven outflow with velocity 6050\substack+460\\-630 km/s and ionised outflow rate of 1650\substack+130\\-1230M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;yr^-1. This is possibly one of the most extreme outflows in the early Universe. The data also reveal that two companion galaxies are merging with the quasar host. The north-eastern companion galaxy is relatively old and very massive, with a luminosity-weighted stellar age of 65\substack+9\\-4 Myr, stellar mass of (3.6\substack+0.6\\-0.3)×10^11 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, and star-formation rate (SFR) of ~15-30 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;yr^-1. A bridge of gas connects this companion galaxy and the host, confirming their ongoing interaction. A second merger is occurring between the quasar host and a much younger companion galaxy to the south, with a stellar age of 6.7±1.8 Myr, stellar mass of (1.9±0.4)×10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, and SFR of ~40-65 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;yr^-1. There is also another galaxy in the field, likely in the foreground at z=1.135, which could be gravitationally lensing the quasar with magnification 1&amp;lt;&amp;mu;&amp;lt;2, and, thus, &amp;lt;0.75 mag. Overall, the system is a 'train-wreck' merger of three galaxies, with star formation and extreme quasar activity that were likely triggered by these ongoing interactions.

&lt;p&gt;
Mapping the small-scale structure of the universe through gravitational lensing is a promising tool for probing the particle nature of dark matter. Curved Arc Basis (CAB) has been proposed as a local lensing formalism in galaxy clusters, with the potential to detect low-mass dark matter substructure. In this work, we analyze the cluster lens Abell S1063 in search of dark matter substructure with the CAB formalism, using multi-band imaging data from JWST. We use two different source modeling methods: shapelets and pixel-based source reconstruction based on Delaunay triangulation. We find that source modeling systematics from shapelets result in a disagreement between Curved Arc Basis parameters measured from different filters. Source modeling with Delaunay significantly alleviates this systematic, as seen in the improvement in agreement across filters. We also find that inadequate complexity in source modeling can result in convincing spurious detections of dark matter substructure from strong gravitational lenses, as seen by our &amp;Delta; BIC &amp;gt; 20 measurement of a M ~ 10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; subhalo with shapelets, a spurious detection that is not reproduced with Delaunay source modeling. We demonstrate that multi-band analysis with different JWST filters is key for disentangling source and lens model systematics from dark matter substructure detections.

&lt;p&gt;
A recent baryogenesis scenario [Phys. Rev. D 110, 023520 (2024)], rooted in a two-brane Universe model, proposed a solution to the matter-antimatter asymmetry through the dynamics of a new pseudo-scalar field. In the present paper, one investigates the phenomenological consequences of this proposal. One shows that the associated boson could persist as a relic from the early Universe, forming a subdominant component of dark matter. While its overall cosmological density is small (≈ 0.2&amp;percnt;), one demonstrates that a one-loop process facilitates an ultra-weak coupling to photons, leading to a distinctive scattering signature. One argues that this effect could produce a faint, glowing halo around massive, hot stars, characterized by a unique spectral decay. Detecting or constraining this elusive light with current and future instruments like the JWST would provide a powerful and direct observational test of the underlying braneworld dynamics and its connection to baryogenesis.

New, ultra-deep medium-width photometric coverage with JWST's NIRCam instrument provides the potential for much improved photo-z reliability at high redshifts. In this study, we conduct a systematic analysis of the JADES Origins Field, which contains 14 broad- and medium-width near-infrared bands, to assess the benefits of medium band photometry on high-z completeness and contamination rates. Using imaging reaching AB mag 29.8-30.35 depth, we test how high-z selections differ when images are artificially degraded or bands are removed. In parallel, the same experiments are conducted on simulated catalogues from the JAGUAR semi-analytic model to examine if observations can be replicated. We find sample completeness is high (80&amp;percnt;+) and contamination low (&amp;lt;4&amp;percnt;) when in the 10&amp;sigma;+ regime, even without the use of any medium-width bands. The addition of medium-width bands leads to increases in completeness (~10&amp;percnt;) but multiple bands are required to improve contamination rates due to the small redshift ranges over which they probe strong emission lines. Incidents of Balmer-Lyman degeneracy increase in the 5-7&amp;sigma; regime and this can be replicated in both simulated catalogues and degraded real data. We measure the faint-end of the UV LF at 8.5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;13.5, finding high number densities that agree with previous JWST observations. Overall, medium bands are effective at increasing completeness and reducing contamination, but investment in achieving comparable depths in the blue (&amp;lt;1.5&amp;mu;m) as achieved in the red is also found to be key to fully reducing contamination from high-z samples.

We homogeneously investigate the morphological properties of 169 galaxies at z~10-16 with deep JWST NIRCam images employing our established techniques of GALFIT modeling and uncertainty evaluation (systematics+statistics). We obtain effective radii r_e ranging 20-500 pc, with a distribution significantly broader than the scatter made by the uncertainties. We find that the r_e distribution is well described by a log-normal distribution with a mean of r_e=133^+13_-12 pc and a standard deviation of &amp;sigma;_lnr_e = 0.52 ± 0.08. The standard deviation is comparable to that of local galaxies, indicating no significant evolution over z~ 0-10. We also find that the axis ratio distribution is nearly uniform, statistically similar to that of local spirals. We estimate the virial radius r_vir from the stellar masses via the star-formation main sequence and stellar-to-halo mass relation, obtaining a stellar-to-halo size ratio r_e/r_vir = 0.015^+0.015_-0.005, which is comparable to those of star-forming galaxies in the local and low-z Universe. Our results of 1) the log-normal r_e distribution, 2) the uniform axis ratio distribution, and 3) a mean radial profile consistent with an exponential profile (n=1.3±0.6) suggest that galaxies at z~10-16 generally follow the classical galaxy disk formation scenario with a specific disk angular momentum fraction of j_d / m_d ~ 0.5-1. Interestingly, we identify two remarkable outliers GN-z11 (z&lt;sub&gt;spec&lt;/sub&gt;=10.60) and GHZ2 (z&lt;sub&gt;spec&lt;/sub&gt;=12.34) with r_e=55^+5_-6 pc and 39±11 pc, respectively, that may not be explained by disk structures but by AGN or compact star-forming galaxies merging underway in short periods of time, as reproduced in numerical simulations.

The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope has revealed a wealth of new galaxies just a few hundred Myr after the Big Bang. Some of these galaxies exhibit unusual N/O ratios that are difficult to explain with stellar populations today. While Wolf-Rayet stars in multiple-burst populations, very massive or rapidly-rotating primordial stars, general relativistic explosions of metal-enriched supermassive stars, or the precursors of globular clusters can in principle account for the nitrogen excess in the galaxies GN-z11 and CEERS 1019, no known stars or supernovae can explain the far higher N/O ratio of 0.46 in GS 3073 at redshift z = 5.55. Here we show that the extreme nitrogen abundances in GS 3073 can be produced by 1000 - 10,000 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; primordial (Pop III) stars. We find that these are the only candidates that can account for its large N/O ratios and its C/O and Ne/O ratios. GS 3073 is thus the first conclusive evidence in the fossil abundance record of the existence of supermassive Pop III stars at cosmic Dawn.

&lt;p&gt;
A recent observation by Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) mounted on NASA's New Horizons yielded the most accurate measurement of the cosmic optical background (COB). The reported COB intensity is 11.16± 1.35 nW/m^2/sr at a pivot wavelength &amp;lambda;_piv = 0.608   &amp;mu;m observed in the range  0.4   &amp;mu;m ≲ &amp;lambda; ≲ 0.9   &amp;mu;m . After subtracting the measured intensity from the deep Hubble Space Telescope count, diffused galactic light, and scattered light from bright star foregrounds, an anomalous intensity of 2.99 ± 2.03~nW/m^2/sr has been found. We considered radiatively decaying sterile neutrinos of keV mass scale, as dark matter candidate, that could contribute to this anomalous reported intensity. Using this, we derive upper bounds on the sterile-to-sterile transition magnetic moment. We find that sterile neutrinos with mass of O(keV) scale take values of the transition magnetic moment in the range 3× 10^-13 eV^-1 - 10^-9 eV^-1 to explain the anomalous intensity of 2.99± 2.03 nW/m^2/sr. % Future experiments such as, Cosmological Advanced Survey Telescope for Optical-UV Research (CASTOR), James Web Space Telescope (JWST), and Spectro-Photometer for the history of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) might help us derive a better bound on the sterile neutrinos.

&lt;p&gt;
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is discovering an increasing number of galaxies well into the early stages of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Many of these galaxies are clustered with strong Lyman alpha (Ly&amp;alpha;) emission, motivating the presence of surrounding cosmic HII regions that would facilitate Ly&amp;alpha; transmission through the intergalactic medium (IGM). Detecting these HII "bubbles" would allow us to connect their growth to the properties of the galaxies inside them. Here we develop a new forward-modeling framework to estimate the local HII region size and location from Ly&amp;alpha; spectra of galaxy groups in the early stages of the EoR. Our model takes advantage of the complementary information provided by neighboring sightlines through the IGM. Our forward models sample the main sources of uncertainty, including: (i) the global neutral fraction; (ii) EoR morphology; (iii) emergent Ly&amp;alpha; emission; and (iv) NIRSpec instrument noise. Depending on the availability of complementary nebular lines, ~ 0.006 &amp;ndash; 0.01 galaxies per cMpc^3, are required to be ≳95&amp;percnt; confident that the HII bubble location and size recovered by our method is accurate to within ~ 1 comoving Mpc. This corresponds roughly to tens of galaxies at z~7&amp;ndash;8 in ~2x2 tiled pointing with JWST NIRSpec. Such a sample is achievable with a targeted survey with completeness down to M_UV^min≲ -19 &amp;ndash; -17, depending on the over-density of the field. We test our method on 3D EoR simulations as well as misspecified equivalent width distributions, in both cases accurately recovering the HII region surrounding targeted galaxy groups.

&lt;p&gt;
We use hierarchical Bayesian modelling to calibrate a network of 32 all-sky faint DA white dwarf (DA WD) spectrophotometric standards (16.5 &amp;lt; V &amp;lt; 19.5) alongside three CALSPEC standards, from 912 &amp;#8491; to 32 &amp;mu;m. The framework is the first of its kind to jointly infer photometric zeropoints and WD parameters (surface gravity log g, effective temperature T_eff, extinction A_V, dust relation parameter R_V) by simultaneously modelling both photometric and spectroscopic data. We model panchromatic Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (HST/WFC3) UVIS and IR photometry, HST/STIS UV spectroscopy and ground-based optical spectroscopy to sub-percent precision. Photometric residuals for the sample are the lowest yet yielding &amp;lt;0.004 mag RMS on average from the UV to the NIR, achieved by jointly inferring time-dependent changes in system sensitivity and WFC3/IR count-rate nonlinearity. Our GPU-accelerated implementation enables efficient sampling via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, critical for exploring the high-dimensional posterior space. The hierarchical nature of the model enables population analysis of intrinsic WD and dust parameters. Inferred spectral energy distributions from this model will be essential for calibrating the James Webb Space Telescope as well as next-generation surveys, including Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

&lt;p&gt;
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered an overabundance of UV-bright (M_UV ≲ -20), massive galaxies at z ≳ 10 in comparison to pre-JWST theoretical predictions. Among the proposed interpretations, such excess has been explained by negligible dust attenuation conditions following radiation-driven outflows launched by young stars when a galaxy goes through a super-Eddington phase. Dust opacity decreases the classical Eddington luminosity by a (boost) factor A, thus favoring the driving of outflows by stellar radiation in compact, initially dusty galaxies. Here, we compute A as a function of the galaxy stellar mass, gas fraction, galaxy size, and metallicity (a total of 8 parameters). We find that the main dependence is on metallicity and, for the fiducial model, A ~ 1800(Z/Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;)/(1+N_H/10^23.5  cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). We apply such results to 20 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at z ≳ 10 and evaluate their modified Eddington ratio. We predict that three galaxies are in the outflow phase. Their outflows have relatively low velocities (60 -100  km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), implying that they are unlikely to escape from the system. For the remaining 17 galaxies that are not currently in the outflow phase, we calculate the past evolution of the modified Eddington ratio from their star formation history. We find that 15 of them experienced an outflow phase prior to observation during which they effectively displaced their dust to larger radii. Thus, dusty outflows driven by stellar radiation appear to contribute to the observed bright UV galaxies at z &amp;gt; 10.

We report the discovery of Alaknanda, a large (~10 kpc diameter), massive (log(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;)~10.2), candidate grand-design spiral galaxy with photometric redshift z&lt;sub&gt;phot&lt;/sub&gt;~4.05 in the UNCOVER and Medium band, Mega Science surveys with JWST. This is among the highest redshift spiral galaxies discovered with JWST. Our morphological analysis using GALFIT reveals that this galaxy is a well-formed disk, with two symmetric spiral arms that are clearly visible in the GALFIT residual. In the rest-frame near-UV and far-UV, we clearly see the beads-on-a-string pattern of star formation; in the rest-frame visible bands, each string appears as an arm. Spectral energy distribution modeling using the BAGPIPES and Prospector codes is strongly constrained by detections and flux measurements in 21 JWST and HST filters. From the BAGPIPES modeling, the stellar mass-weighted age is ~ 199 Myr, implying 50&amp;percnt; of the stars in the galaxy formed after z~4.6. This is a highly star-forming galaxy with a star formation rate (SFR) of ~ 63   M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;   yr^-1. We detect flux excesses in the F250M and F335M filters due to the presence of H-&amp;alpha;+[NII] and [OIII]+H-&amp;beta; emission line complexes respectively. Detection of a spiral galaxy at z ~ 4 indicates that massive and large spiral galaxies and disks were already in place merely 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang. Future observations with NIRSpec IFU and ALMA will be able to probe the kinematics of the galactic disk, throwing light on the possible origin of the spiral arms in this galaxy.

We study the rest-frame ultraviolet-optical color gradients of 441 galaxies at 4&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;8 by characterizing the wavelength dependence of their structural parameters derived from simultaneously fitting the seven-band NIRCam images acquired with the James Webb Space Telescope. Distinct from trends observed at lower redshifts, where most galaxies exhibit negative color gradients whereby galaxy centers are redder than their outskirts, in high-redshift galaxies positive color gradients are just as common as or even outnumber negative color gradients. Varying stellar population, dust, and active galactic nuclei can contribute to the observed color gradient. We show that for the majority of our sample, the observed color gradients principally reflect radial variations in stellar population, without strong contribution from dust reddening or contamination from active galactic nuclei. The sign and magnitude of the color profile depend systematically on the global properties of the galaxy: positive color gradients, characteristic of centrally concentrated star formation or outside-in growth, are found preferentially in galaxies of lower stellar mass, smaller size, and bluer spectral energy distribution.

[Abridged] The [OIII]_88&amp;mu; m/[CII]_158&amp;mu; m and [OIII]_88&amp;mu; m/[NII]_122&amp;mu; m luminosity ratios have shown to be promising tracers of the ionisation state and gas-phase metallicity of the ISM. Observations of galaxies at redshift z &amp;gt; 6 show peculiarly higher [OIII]_88&amp;mu; m/[CII]_158&amp;mu; m luminosity ratios compared to local sources. No model has so far successfully managed to match the observed emission from both [OIII]_88&amp;mu; m and [CII]_158&amp;mu; m as well as their ratio. We use Cloudy to model the [CII]_158&amp;mu; m, [OIII]_88&amp;mu; m, [NII]_122&amp;mu; m and [NIII]_57&amp;mu; m emission lines of Ponos: a high-resolution (m_gas = 883.4  M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) cosmological zoom-in simulation of a galaxy at redshift z = 6.5, which is post-processed using kramses-rt. We modify Carbon, Nitrogen and Oxygen abundances in our Cloudy models to obtain C/O and N/O abundance ratios respectively lower and higher than Solar, more in line with recent high-z observational constraints. We find [OIII]_88&amp;mu; m/[CII]_158&amp;mu; m luminosity ratios that are a factor of ~ 5 higher compared to models assuming solar abundances. Additionally, we find an overall better agreement of the simulation with high-z observational constraints of the [CII]_158&amp;mu; m-SFR and [OIII]_88&amp;mu; m-SFR relations. This shows that a lower C/O abundance ratio is essential to reproduce the enhanced [OIII]_88&amp;mu; m/[CII]_158&amp;mu; m luminosity ratios observed at z &amp;gt; 6. By assuming a super-solar N/O ratio, motivated by recent z &amp;gt; 6 JWST observations, our models yield an [OIII]_88&amp;mu; m/[NII]_122&amp;mu; m ratio of 1.3, which, according to current theoretical models, would be more appropriate for a galaxy with a lower ionisation parameter than the one we estimated for Ponos.

We develop a parametrised model to describe the formation and evolution of massive black holes, designed for comparisons with both electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations. Using an extended Press-Schechter formalism, we generate dark matter halo merger trees. We then seed and evolve massive black holes through parameterised prescriptions. This approach, which avoids solving differential equations, is computationally efficient, enabling us to analyse observational data and infer the parameters of our model in a fully Bayesian framework. We find that observations of the black hole luminosity function are compatible with the nHz gravitational wave signal (likely) measured by PTAs, provided we allow for an increased luminosity function at high redshift (4-7), as recently suggested by JWST observations. Our model can simultaneously reproduce the bulk of the M_*-M_BH relation at z-0, as well as its outliers, something cosmological simulations struggle to do. The inferred model parameters are consistent with expectations from observations and more complex simulations: They favour heavier black hole seeds and short delays between halo and black hole mergers, while requiring supper-Edington accretion episodes lasting a few tens of million years, which in our model are linked to galaxy mergers. We find accretion to be suppressed in the most massive black holes below z≃ 2.5, consistently with the anti-hierarchical growth hypothesis. Finally, our predictions for LISA, although fairly broad, are in agreement with previous models. Our model offers a new perspective on the apparent tensions between the black hole luminosity function and the latest JWST and PTA results. Its flexibility makes it ideal to fully exploit the potential of future gravitational wave observations of massive black hole binaries with LISA.

&lt;p&gt;
The origin of Lyman Continuum (LyC) photons responsible for reionizing the universe remains a mystery, with the fraction of escaping LyC photons from galaxies at z~ 6 to 12 being highly uncertain. While direct detection of LyC photons from this epoch is hindered by absorption from the intergalactic medium, lower redshift analogs offer a promising avenue to study LyC leakage. We present Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (HST COS) observations of five low redshift (z~ 0.3) massive starburst galaxies, selected for their high stellar mass and weak [SII] nebular emission - an indirect tracer of LyC escape. Three of the five galaxies show LyC leakage, highlighting the reliability of weak [SII] as a tracer, especially in light of recent JWST discoveries of z &amp;gt; 5 galaxies with similarly weak [SII] emission. The dust corrected LyC escape fractions, which represent the LyC photons that would escape in the absence of dust, range from 33% to 84%. However, the absolute escape fractions, which show the LyC photons escaping after passing through both neutral hydrogen absorption and dust attenuation, are significantly lower, ranging between 1% and 3%. This suggests that while the galaxies are nearly optically thin to HI, their high dust content significantly suppresses LyC photon escape. These [SII] weak, massive leakers are distinct from typical low-redshift LyC emitters, showing higher metallicity, lower ionization states, more dust extinction and higher star formation surface densities. This suggests that these galaxies constitute a distinct population, likely governed by a different mechanism facilitating LyC photon escape. We propose that the feedback-driven winds in these compact starbursts create ionized channels through which LyC photons escape, aligning with a picket-fence model.

&lt;p&gt;
We present the first spatially-resolved infrared images of supernova remnants (SNRs) in M33 with the unprecedented sensitivity and resolution of JWST. We analyze 40 SNRs in four JWST fields: two covering central and southern M33 with separate NIRCam (F335M, F444W) and MIRI (F560W, F2100W) observations, one ~5 kpc-long radial strip observed with MIRI F770W, and one covering the giant HII region NGC 604 with multiple NIRCam and MIRI broad/narrowband filters. Of the 21 SNRs in the MIRI (F560W+F2100W) field, we found three clear detections (i.e., identical infrared and H&amp;alpha; morphologies), and six partial-detections, implying a detection fraction of 43&amp;percnt; in these bands. One of the SNRs in this field, L10-080, is a potential candidate for having freshly-formed ejecta dust, based on its size and centrally-concentrated 21 &amp;mu;m emission. In contrast, only one SNR (out of 16) is detectable in the NIRCam F335M+F444W field. Two SNRs near NGC 604 have strong evidence of molecular (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emission at 4.7 &amp;mu;m, making them the farthest known SNRs with visible molecular shocks. Five SNRs have F770W observations, with the smaller younger objects showing tentative signs of emission, while the older, larger ones have voids. Multi-wavelength data indicate that the clearly-detected SNRs are also among the smallest, brightest at other wavelengths (H&amp;alpha;, radio and X-ray), have the broadest line widths (H&amp;alpha; FWHM~250-350 km/s), and the densest environments. No correlation between the JWST-detectability and local star-formation history of the SNRs is apparent.

&lt;p&gt;
A detection of the 21-cm signal power spectrum from the Epoch of Reionization is imminent, thanks to consistent advancements from telescopes such as LOFAR, MWA, and HERA, along with the development of SKA. In light of this progress, it is crucial to expand the parameter space of simulations used to infer astrophysical properties from this signal. In this work, we explore the role of cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant H_0 and the matter clustering amplitude &amp;sigma;_8, whose values as provided by measurements at different redshifts are in tension. We run N-body simulations using GADGET-4, and post-process them with the reionization simulation code POLAR, that uses L-GALAXIES to include galaxy formation and evolution properties and GRIZZLY to execute 1-D radiative transfer of ionizing photons in the intergalactic medium (IGM). We compare our results with the latest JWST observations and explore which astrophysical properties for different cosmologies are necessary to match the observed UV luminosity functions at redshifts z = 10 and 9. Additionally, we explore the impact of these parameters on the observed 21-cm signal power spectrum, focusing on the redshifts within the range of LOFAR 21-cm signal observations (z ≈ 8.5-10). Despite differences in cosmological and astrophysical parameters, our models cannot be ruled out by the current upper limits. This suggests the need for broader physical parameter spaces for inference modeling to account for all models that agree with observations. However, we also propose stronger constraining power by using a combination of galactic and IGM observables.

The James Webb Space Telescope is revolutionising our ability to understand the host galaxies and local environments of high-z quasars. Here we obtain a comprehensive understanding of the host galaxy of the z=7.08 quasar J1120+0641 by combining NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy with NIRCam photometry of the host continuum emission. Our emission-line maps reveal that this quasar host is undergoing a merger with a bright companion galaxy. The quasar host and the companion have similar dynamical masses of ~10^10M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, suggesting that this is a major galaxy interaction. Through detailed quasar subtraction and SED fitting using the NIRCam data, we obtained an estimate of the host stellar mass of M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;ast;&lt;/sub&gt;=(3.0^+2.5_-1.4)×10^9M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, with M_*=(2.7^+0.5_-0.5)×10^9M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; for the companion galaxy. Using the H&amp;beta; Balmer line we estimated a virial black hole mass of M_BH=(1.9^+2.9_-1.1)×10^9 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, J1120+0641 has an extreme black hole-stellar mass ratio of M_BH/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;ast;&lt;/sub&gt;=0.63^+0.54_-0.31, which is ~3 dex larger than expected by the local scaling relations between black hole and stellar mass. J1120+0641 is powered by an overmassive black hole with the highest reported black hole-stellar mass ratio in a quasar host that is currently undergoing a major merger. These new insights highlight the power of JWST for measuring and understanding these extreme first quasars.

&lt;p&gt;
Bursty star formation at early times can explain the surprising abundance of early UV-bright galaxies revealed by JWST but can also be a reason for the delayed formation of galactic disks in high-resolution cosmological simulations. We investigate this interplay in a cosmological simulation of an early-forming Milky Way analog with detailed modeling of the cold turbulent interstellar medium (ISM), star formation, and feedback. We find that the modeling of locally variable star formation efficiency (SFE) coupled with the ISM turbulence on the scales of star-forming regions is important for producing both early bursty evolution and early formation and survival of galactic disks. Such a model introduces a qualitatively new channel of the global star formation rate (SFR) burstiness caused by chaotic fluctuations in the average SFE due to changes in the ISM turbulence, which, in our simulation, dominates the short-term SFR variability. The average SFE stays low, close to ~ 1&amp;percnt; per freefall time, and its variation decreases when the gas disk forms, leading to only mild effects of stellar feedback on the early disk, enabling its survival. By rerunning our simulation with fixed SFE values, we explicitly show that low SFEs lead to smoother SFR histories and disk survival, while high SFEs lead to bursty SFRs and hinder disk formation. The model with variable SFE switches between these two regimes at the moment of disk formation. These trends are missing in more commonly used star formation prescriptions with fixed SFE; in particular, the prescriptions tying star formation to molecular gas should be interpreted with caution because the two are decoupled at early times, as we also show in this paper.

We investigate early, z &amp;gt; 3, galaxy formation in a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a close, early-forming Milky Way (MW) analog extracted from TNG50 simulation and resimulated with detailed modeling of cold interstellar medium (ISM) formation, coupled with on-the-fly UV radiative transfer, turbulence-regulated star formation, and stellar feedback. In our enhanced-physics simulation, the galaxy develops a bistable ISM structure (warm, with T ~ 10^4 K, and cold, with T &amp;lt; 100 K) and exhibits significantly more efficient, early, and bursty star formation than in TNG. Notably, the stellar disk of this MW progenitor forms extremely early, around z~6-7, and exhibits chemo-kinematic properties consistent with the low-metallicity population of the MW stars. The disk forms rapidly, on a timescale of ~0.2 Gyr which is significantly shorter than the timescale implied by the observable chemo-kinematic signatures of disk spinup, ~0.7 Gyr, due to the scatter in the age&amp;ndash;metallicity relation. The rotational support of the gas disk and the location of the galaxy on the main sequence are consistent with early disk galaxies observed by JWST and ALMA at z~4-7, suggesting that some of these galaxies could be progenitors of MW-like systems. Remarkably, the variation of the global star formation rate (SFR) before disk formation is similar to the observed SFR scatter at these early times. Our findings underscore the critical role of modeling a turbulent cold ISM and turbulence-regulated star formation and feedback in driving early SFR variability, while at the same time enabling early disk formation, without destroying it with overly efficient stellar feedback.

&lt;p&gt;
The relative contribution of emission from stellar sources and accretion onto supermassive black holes to reionization has been brought into focus again by the apparent high abundance of faint Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) at 4≲ z≲11 uncovered by JWST. We investigate here the contribution of these faint AGN to hydrogen and the early stages of helium reionization using the GPU-based radiative transfer code ATON-HE by post-processing a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation from the sherwood-relics suite of simulations. We study four models: two galaxy-only late-end reionization models, a QSO-assisted and a QSO-only model. In the QSO-assisted model, 1% of the haloes host AGN, with AGN luminosities scaled to contribute 17% of the total hydrogen-ionizing emissivity. In the QSO-only model, quasars account for all the hydrogen-ionizing emissivity, with 10% of the haloes hosting AGN. The SED of AGN is assumed to be a power-law with &amp;alpha;=-1.7 each with a 10 Myr lifetime. All models are calibrated to the observed mean Lyman-&amp;alpha; forest transmission at 5≲ z≲6.2. The QSO-assisted model requires an emissivity similar to the galaxy-only models and fits the observed distribution of the Lyman-&amp;alpha; optical depths well. The QSO-only model is inconsistent with the observed Lyman-&amp;alpha; optical depths distribution, and produces excessively high IGM temperatures at z≲ 5 due to an early onset of HeII reionization, unless the escape fraction of HeII-ionizing photons is assumed to be low. Our results suggest that a modest AGN contribution to reionization aligns with the Lyman-&amp;alpha; forest data, whereas an AGN dominated scenario is difficult to reconcile.

Astronomical research traditionally relies on extensive domain knowledge to interpret observations and narrow down hypotheses. We demonstrate that this process can be emulated using large language model-based agents to accelerate research workflows. We propose mephisto, a multi-agent collaboration framework that mimics human reasoning to interpret multi-band galaxy observations. mephisto interacts with the CIGALE codebase, which includes spectral energy distribution (SED) models to explain observations. In this open-world setting, mephisto learns from its self-play experience, performs tree search, and accumulates knowledge in a dynamically updated base. As a proof of concept, we apply mephisto to the latest data from the James Webb Space Telescope. mephisto attains near-human proficiency in reasoning about galaxies' physical scenarios, even when dealing with a recently discovered population of "Little Red Dot" galaxies. This represents the first demonstration of agentic research in astronomy, advancing towards end-to-end research via LLM agents and potentially expediting astronomical discoveries.

Recent observations have revealed puzzling spatial disparities between ALMA dust continuum and UV emission as seen by HST and JWST in galaxies at z=5-7 (e.g. ALPINE and REBELS surveys), compelling us to propose a physical interpretation of such offsets. We investigate these offsets using the Cosmic Dawn III (CoDa III) simulation, a state-of-the-art fully coupled radiation-hydrodynamics cosmological simulation, which incorporates a dynamical dust model. First of all, we find that our simulated dust masses, while calibrated to match observed ones, yield unrealistically large UV attenuations. In fact, the bright-end galaxy UV Luminosity function is best reproduced using only 7.5&amp;percnt; of the dust content of CoDa III galaxies. With this recalibration, we obtain populations of massive galaxies matching ALPINE and REBELS magnitudes and UV slopes, but with smaller dust masses than observed. In this framework, we also find significant dust-UV offsets in massive, UV-bright galaxies (M_DM&amp;gt; 10^11.5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, M_*&amp;gt;10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, M_AB1600&amp;lt;-21.5), reaching up to ~ 2 pkpc for the most massive systems. Our analysis reveals that these offsets primarily result from severe dust extinction in galactic centers rather than a misalignment between dust and stellar mass distributions. At the spatial resolution of CoDa III (1.65 pkpc at z=6), the dust remains in majority well-aligned with the bulk stellar component, and we predict the dust continuum should therefore align well with the stellar rest-frame NIR component, less affected by dust attenuation. This study highlights the importance of dust in shaping the appearance of early galaxies at UV wavelengths, even as early as in the Epoch of Reionization.

We report a characterization of an X-ray-detected quiescent galaxy at z=2.09, named COS-XQG1, using JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec data. This galaxy is detected in Chandra imaging, suggesting the presence of an AGN with a high black hole accretion rate of M&amp;#775;_BH=0.22±0.03  M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1. Using multi-wavelength photometry from X-ray to sub-millimeter, including the latest JWST imaging, we confirm that COS-XQG1 is massive (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; = (1.6±0.2)×10^11  M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) and quiescent (sSFR&amp;lt;10^-10  yr^-1) as reported previously, even considering the contribution from AGN emission. Noticeably, COS-XQG1 displays a broad H&amp;beta; and H&amp;alpha; emission component with a full width at half maximum of 4365^+81_-81  km  s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in its NIRSpec spectrum, which is typical of Type 1 AGNs. The line width and luminosity of the broad H&amp;alpha; emission give a black hole mass of log(M_BH/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) = 8.43±0.02  (± 0.5). With a stellar velocity dispersion measurement (&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;=238±32  km  s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), we find that this galaxy is consistent with the local relations in the M_BH - &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; and M_BH- M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; planes, which might suggest that massive quiescent galaxies at z≥2 have already been mature in terms of both stellar and black hole masses and will not evolve significantly. In addition, image 2D-decomposition analysis finds that this galaxy comprises disk and point source components. The latter is likely the composition of an AGN and a stellar bulge. Based on a comparison with numerical simulations, we expect that COS-XQG1 will evolve into a typical quiescent galaxy with lower AGN activity by redshift 0. This study shows the usefulness of X-ray-detected quiescent galaxies in investigating the co-evolution between SMBHs and galaxies in the early Universe.

We study the physical origin and spectroscopic impact of extreme nebular emission in high-redshift galaxies. The nebular continuum, which can appear during an extreme starburst, is of particular importance as it tends to redden UV slopes and has a significant contribution to the UV luminosities of galaxies. Furthermore, its shape can be used to infer the gas density and temperature of the interstellar medium. First, we provide a theoretical background, showing how different stellar populations (SPS models, initial mass functions (IMFs), and stellar temperatures) and nebular conditions impact observed galaxy spectra. We demonstrate that, for systems with strong nebular continuum emission, 1) UV fluxes can increase by up to 0.7~mag (or more in the case of hot/massive stars) above the stellar continuum, which may help reconcile the surprising abundance of bright high-redshift galaxies and the elevated UV luminosity density at z&amp;gt;10, 2) at high gas densities, UV slopes can redden from &amp;beta;&amp;lt;-2.5 to &amp;beta;~-1, 3) observational measurements of  &amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt;  are gross underestimates, and 4) UV downturns from two-photon emission can masquerade as damped Ly&amp;alpha; systems. Second, we present a dataset of 58 galaxies observed with NIRSpec on JWST at 2.5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;9.0 that are selected to have strong nebular continuum emission via the detection of the Balmer jump. Five of the 58 spectra are consistent with being dominated by nebular emission, exhibiting both a Balmer jump and a UV downturn consistent with two-photon emission. For some galaxies, this may imply the presence of hot massive stars and a top-heavy IMF. We conclude by exploring the properties of spectroscopically confirmed z&amp;gt;10 galaxies, finding that UV slopes and UV downturns are in some cases redder or steeper than expected from SPS models, which may hint at more exotic (e.g. hotter/more massive stars or AGN) ionizing sources.

&lt;p&gt;
The divide between weak and strong lensing is of course artificial, in that both regimes are manifestations of the same physical phenomenon: gravity bending the path of light. Nevertheless, these two regimes have to a large extent been treated separately, since they require different approaches. This review traces the development of methods combining weak-lensing and strong-lensing data for joint lens-mass reconstruction, with a particular emphasis on cluster lenses, where both effects occur. We conclude that so-called inverse methods have been successful in merging the two regimes insofar data analysis is concerned. However, a number of improvements seem to be needed. First, not many studies include weak lensing data beyond shear. In light of the unprecedented quality of the data of JWST and future surveys, this is a clear point of improvement. Especially so, since flexion terms have proven useful in determining sub-structures. Second, considering the amount of data available, and the complexity of non-parametric lenses, automating the processes of lens-mass reconstruction would be beneficial. Towards this end, invoking machine learning seems like a promising way forward. The silence of the literature on this latter point is in fact somewhat surprising.

Stars in galaxies form when baryons radiatively cool down and fall into gravitational wells whose mass is dominated by dark matter. Eventually, star formation quenches as gas is depleted and/or perturbed by feedback processes, no longer being able to collapse and condense. We report the first spatially resolved spectroscopic observations, using the JWST/NIRSpec IFU, of a massive, completely quiescent galaxy (Jekyll) and its neighborhood at z=3.714, when the Universe age was 10% of today's. Jekyll resides in a massive dark matter halo (with mass M_DM&amp;gt;10^12 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) and forms a galaxy pair with Hyde, which shows very intense dust-enshrouded star formation (star formation rate ~300 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;yr^-1). We find large amounts of kinematically perturbed ionized and neutral gas in the circumgalactic medium around the pair. Despite this large gas reservoir, Jekyll, which formed 10^11 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; in stars and chemically enriched early (first billion years of the Universe) and quickly (200-300 Myr), has remained quiescent for over 500 Myr. The properties of the gas found around the two galaxies are consistent with intense, AGN-induced photoionization, or intense shocks. However, with the current data no obscured or unobscured AGN is detected in the central galaxy (Jekyll) nor in the very active and dust rich star-forming galaxy (Hyde).

&lt;p&gt;
Early JWST studies reporting an unexpected abundance of massive galaxies at z ~ 5&amp;ndash;8 challenge galaxy formation models in the &amp;Lambda;CDM framework. Previous stellar mass (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;) estimates suffered from large uncertainties due to the lack of rest-frame near-infrared data. Using deep JWST/NIRCam and MIRI photometry from PRIMER, we systematically analyze massive galaxies at z ~ 3&amp;ndash;8, leveraging rest-frame ≳ 1 &amp;mu;m constraints. We find MIRI is critical for robust M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; measurements for massive galaxies at z &amp;gt; 5: excluding MIRI overestimates M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; by ~ 0.4 dex on average for M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; galaxies, with no significant effects at lower masses. This reduces number densities of M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; (10^10.3 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) galaxies by ~ 36&amp;percnt; (55&amp;percnt;). MIRI inclusion also reduces "Little Red Dot'' (LRD) contamination in massive galaxy samples, lowering the LRD fraction from ~ 32&amp;percnt; to ~ 13&amp;percnt; at M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 10^10.3 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. Assuming pure stellar origins, LRDs exhibit M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 10^9&amp;ndash;10.5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; with MIRI constraints, rarely exceeding 10^10.5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. Within standard &amp;Lambda;CDM, our results indicate a moderate increase in the baryon-to-star conversion efficiency (&amp;epsilon;) toward higher redshifts and masses at z &amp;gt; 3. For the most massive z ~ 8 galaxies, &amp;epsilon; ~ 0.3, compared to &amp;epsilon; ≲ 0.2 for typical galaxies at z &amp;lt; 3. This result is consistent with models where high gas densities and short free-fall times suppress stellar feedback in massive high-z halos.

A sizable fraction of the heavy elements synthesized by stars in galaxies condenses into sub-micron-sized solid-state particles, known as dust grains. Dust produces a wavelength-dependent attenuation, A_&amp;lambda;, of the galaxy emission, thereby significantly altering its observed properties. Locally, A_&amp;lambda; is in general the sum of a power-law and a UV feature ('bump') produced by small, carbon-based grains. However, scant information exists regarding its evolution across cosmic time. Here, leveraging data from 173 galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope in the redshift range z = 2 - 12, we report the most distant detection of the UV bump in a z ~ 7.55 galaxy (when the Universe was only ~ 700 Myr old), and show for the first time that the power-law slope and the bump strength decrease towards high redshifts. We propose that the flat A_&amp;lambda; shape at early epochs is produced by large grains newly formed in supernova ejecta, which act as the main dust factories at such early epochs. Importantly, these grains have undergone minimal reprocessing in the interstellar medium due to the limited available cosmic time. This discovery opens new perspectives in the study of cosmic dust origin and evolution.

Recent data released by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and, somewhat earlier, the data presented by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) are commonly understood as a strong indication for breaking of the canonical &amp;Lambda;CDM cosmology. It is argued in the presented work that massive primordial black holes (PBH) could seed galaxy and quasar formation in the very young universe as it has been conjectured in our paper of 1993 and resolve the tension induced by the JWST and the HST data with the standard cosmology. This point of view is presently supported by several recent works. The proposed mechanism of PBH formation leads to the log-normal mass spectrum of PBHs and predicts abundant antimatter population of our Galaxy, Milky Way. Both these predictions are in excellent agreement with astronomical observations.

We present the results of a size and structural analysis of 1395 galaxies at 0.5 ≤ z ≲ 8 with stellar masses log ≤ft(M_* / M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;gt; 9.5 within the JWST Public CEERS field that overlaps with the HST CANDELS EGS observations. We use GALFIT to fit single S\'ersic models to the rest-frame optical profile of our galaxies, which is a mass-selected sample complete to our redshift and mass limit. Our primary result is that at fixed rest-frame wavelength and stellar mass, galaxies get progressively smaller, evolving as ~ (1+z)^-0.71±0.19 up to z ~ 8. We discover that the vast majority of massive galaxies at high redshifts have low S\'ersic indices, thus do not contain steep, concentrated light profiles. Additionally, we explore the evolution of the size-stellar mass relationship, finding a correlation such that more massive systems are larger up to z ~ 3. This relationship breaks down at z &amp;gt; 3, where we find that galaxies are of similar sizes, regardless of their star formation rates and S\'ersic index, varying little with mass. We show that galaxies are more compact at redder wavelengths, independent of sSFR or stellar mass up to z ~ 3. We demonstrate the size evolution of galaxies continues up to z ~ 8, showing that the process or causes for this evolution is active at early times. We discuss these results in terms of ideas behind galaxy formation and evolution at early epochs, such as their importance in tracing processes driving size evolution, including minor mergers and AGN activity.
