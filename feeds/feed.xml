Recent JWST observations have uncovered high-redshift galaxies characterized by multiple star-forming clumps, many of which appear to be undergoing mergers. Such mergers are powerful drivers of galaxy evolution, triggering intense star formation that accelerates the formation of massive quiescent galaxies. Mergers can also expel and redistribute the metal-enriched gas from galaxies into their circum-galactic medium (CGM), regulating the chemical component of their environments and creating channels of ionized gas through which ionizing radiation escapes. Here, we report a merger of at least five galaxies, dubbed JWST's Quintet (JQ), at redshift 6.7, discovered in the JWST GOODS-South field. This system resides in a small area ~4.5''×4.5'' (24.6×24.6 pkpc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), containing over 17 galaxy-size clumps with a total stellar mass of 10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. The JQ system has a total star formation rate of 240-270 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1, placing it ~1 dex above the median star formation rate-mass main sequence at this epoch. The high mass and star formation rate of the JQ galaxies are sufficient to produce massive, inactive galaxies identified at later times, by redshift 4, suggesting this may be a progenitor event for such systems. We detect a large \foiii+H&amp;beta; emitting gaseous halo surrounding and connecting four galaxies in the JQ, consistent with the interaction between them. This indicates that the CGM of JQ is already enriched by the heavy elements generated from the galaxies through merger-induced tidal stripping or galactic outflows. Our findings offer a plausible evolutionary pathway for the formation of massive quiescent galaxies observed at lower redshifts and provide direct evidence for the metal enrichment of their environments through galaxy mergers, just 800 Myr after the Big Bang.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at redshifts of z≳ 4-7, many of which host accreting massive black holes (BHs) with BH-to-galaxy mass (M_BH/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;) ratios exceeding the local values by more than an order of magnitude. The origin of these overmassive BHs remains unclear but requires potential contributions from heavy seeds and/or episodes of super-Eddington accretion. We present a growth model coupled with dark matter halo assembly to explore the evolution of the M_BH/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; ratio under different seeding and feedback scenarios. Given the gas inflow rates in protogalaxies, BHs grow episodically at moderate super-Eddington rates and the mass ratio increases early on, despite significant mass loss through feedback. Regardless of seeding mechanisms, the mass ratio converges to a universal value ~ 0.1-0.3, set by the balance between gas feeding and star formation efficiency in the nucleus. This behavior defines an attractor in the M_BH-M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; diagram, where overmassive BHs grow more slowly than their hosts, while undermassive seeds experience rapid growth before aligning with the attractor. We derive an analytical expression for the universal mass ratio, linking it to feedback strength and halo growth. The convergence of evolutionary tracks erases seeding information from the mass ratio by z~ 4-6. Detecting BHs with ~ 10^5-6~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; at higher redshifts that deviate from convergence trend would provide key diagnostics of their birth conditions.

We measure H&amp;alpha; luminosity functions (LFs) at redshifts z ~ 4.5 and 6.3 using the JWST MAGNIF (Medium-band Astrophysics with the Grism of NIRCam In Frontier fields) survey. MAGNIF obtained NIRCam grism spectra with the F360M and F480M filters in four Frontier Fields. We identify 248 H&amp;alpha; emitters based on the grism spectra and photometric redshifts from combined HST and JWST imaging data. The numbers of the H&amp;alpha; emitters show a large field-to-field variation, highlighting the necessity of multiple fields to mitigate cosmic variance. We calculate both observed and dust-corrected H&amp;alpha; LFs in the two redshift bins. Thanks to the gravitational lensing, the measured H&amp;alpha; LFs span three orders of magnitude in luminosity, and the faint-end luminosity reaches L_H&amp;alpha; ~ 10^40.3 erg s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; at z ~ 4.5 and 10^41.5 erg s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; at z ~ 6.3, corresponding to star-formation rates (SFRs) of ~ 0.1 and 1.7 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1. We conclude no or weak redshift evolution of the faint-end slope of H&amp;alpha; LF across z≃0.4-6.3, and the comparison with the faint-end slopes of UV LF indicates stochastic star formation history among low-mass H&amp;alpha; emitters. The derived cosmic SFR densities are 0.058^+0.008_-0.006  M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1 Mpc^-3 at z ~ 4.5 and 0.025^+0.009_-0.007  M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1 Mpc^-3 at z ~ 6.3. These are approximately 2.2 times higher than previous estimates based on dust-corrected UV LFs, but consistent with recent measurements from infrared surveys. We discuss uncertainties in the H&amp;alpha; LF measurements, including those propagate from the lens models, cosmic variance, and AGN contribution.

&lt;p&gt;
The metallicity of galaxies, and its variation with galactocentric radius, provides key insights into the formation histories of galaxies and the physical processes driving their evolution. In this work, we analyze the radial metallicity gradients of star forming galaxies in the EAGLE, Illustris, IllustrisTNG, and SIMBA cosmological simulations across a broad mass (10^8.0M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;≤ M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; ≲10^12.0M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) and redshift (0≤ z≤8) range. We find that all simulations predict strong negative (i.e., radially decreasing) metallicity gradients at early cosmic times, likely due to their similar treatments of relatively smooth stellar feedback allowing for sustained inside-out growth. The strongest redshift evolution occurs in galaxies with stellar masses of 10^10.0-10^11.0M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, while galaxies with stellar masses &amp;lt; 10^10M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;gt;10^11M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; exhibit weaker redshift evolution. Our results of negative gradients at high-redshift contrast with the many positive and flat gradients in the 1&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;4 observational literature. At z&amp;gt;6, the negative gradients observed with JWST and ALMA are flatter than those in simulations, albeit with closer agreement than at lower redshift. Overall, we suggest that these smooth stellar feedback galaxy simulations may not sufficiently mix their metal content, and that either stronger stellar feedback or additional subgrid turbulent metal diffusion models may be required to better reproduce observed metallicity gradients.

Population III (Pop III) stars are the first stars in the Universe, forming from pristine, metal-free gas and marking the end of the cosmic dark ages. Their formation rate is expected to sharply decline after redshift z ≈ 15 due to metal enrichment from previous generations of stars. In this paper, we analyze 14 zoom-in simulations from the THESAN-ZOOM project, which evolves different haloes from the THESAN-1 cosmological box down to redshift z=3. The high mass resolution of up to 142 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; per cell in the gas phase combined with a multiphase model of the interstellar medium (ISM), radiative transfer including Lyman-Werner radiation, dust physics, and a non-equilibrium chemistry network that tracks molecular hydrogen, allows for a realistic but still approximate description of Pop III star formation in pristine gas. Our results show that Pop III stars continue to form in low-mass haloes ranging from 10^6 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; to 10^9 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; until the end of reionization at around z=5. At this stage, photoevaporation suppresses further star formation in these minihaloes, which subsequently merge into larger central haloes. Hence, the remnants of Pop III stars primarily reside in the satellite galaxies of larger haloes at lower redshifts. While direct detection of Pop III stars remains elusive, these results hint that lingering primordial star formation could leave observable imprints or indirectly affect the properties of high-redshift galaxies. Explicit Pop III feedback and specialized initial mass function modelling within the THESAN-ZOOM framework would further help interpreting emerging constraints from the James Webb Space Telescope.

The ratio between the stellar mass of a galaxy, M_*, and that of its central supermassive black hole (SMBH), M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt;, the "Magorrian'' relationship, traces their coevolution. JWST observations have suggested significant evolution in M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt;/M_* relative to local scaling relationships both in low-mass galaxies and in quasars at z ≥ 4. We test this possibility by (1) determining the preferred M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt;/M_* scaling relation among those proposed locally; and (2) providing uniform host galaxy stellar mass estimates. These steps reduce the prominence of the reported evolution. We then apply Monte Carlo simulations to account for observational biases. We still find a significant increase over the local scaling relation in M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt;/M_* for z ≥ 4 SMBHs in very low-mass galaxies (log(M_*/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;lt;10). However, similarly high values of M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt;/M_* are also found in low mass galaxies at z ~ 0.5 to 3 that may be common at cosmic noon. Nonetheless, galaxies with similar behavior are rare locally and not accounted for in the local scaling relations. In contrast, z ~ 6 quasars can have M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt;/M_* well above the local relation value, but they can be explained as extreme cases still within the scaling relation for their higher mass host galaxies. Black holes in some of them and in the low-mass systems may be undergoing very high accretion episodes that result in high M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt;/M_* but that will be followed by quiescent periods when growth of the host drives the systems toward more typical M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt;/M_* values.

The cosmic star formation history (CSFH) and cosmic active galactic nuclei (AGN) luminosity history (CAGNH) are self consistently presented at z = 5.5-13.5. This is achieved by analyzing galaxies detected by the James Webb Space Telescope from ≈ 400   arcmin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; fields from the PEARLS, CEERS, NGDEEP, JADES and PRIMER surveys. In particular, the combination of spectral energy distribution fitting codes, EAZY and ProSpect, are employed to estimate the photometric redshifts and astrophysical quantities of 3947 distant galaxies, from which we compute the stellar mass, star formation rate and AGN luminosity distribution functions in four redshift bins. Integrating the distribution functions, we find that the CAGNH tentatively rises by ≈ 2.2 dex over z = 5.5-13.5 compared to ≈ 1.8 dex for the CSFH, indicating that the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) tends to outpace the assembly of stellar mass. We connect our results of the CSFH and CAGNH at z=5.5-13.5 to that from z= 0-5 to determine the summary of ≳ 13 Gyr of star formation and AGN activity, from the very onset of galaxy formation to the present day.

We present subarcsecond-resolution ALMA mosaics of the Orion Bar PDR in [CI] 609 um, C2H (4-3), and C18O (3-2) emission lines, complemented by JWST images of H2 and aromatic infrared band (AIB) emission. The rim of the Bar shows very corrugated structures made of small-scale H2 dissociation fronts (DFs). The [CI] 609 um emission peaks very close (~0.002 pc) to the main H2-emitting DFs, suggesting the presence of gas density gradients. These DFs are also bright and remarkably similar in C2H emission, which traces 'hydrocarbon radical peaks' characterized by very high C2H abundances, reaching up to several x10^-7. The high abundance of C2H and of related hydrocarbon radicals, such as CH3, CH2, and CH, can be attributed to gas-phase reactions driven by elevated temperatures, the presence of C+ and C, and the reactivity of FUV-pumped H2. The hydrocarbon radical peaks roughly coincide with maxima of the 3.4/3.3 um AIB intensity ratio, a proxy for the aliphatic-to-aromatic content of PAHs. This implies that the conditions triggering the formation of simple hydrocarbons also favor the formation (and survival) of PAHs with aliphatic side groups, potentially via the contribution of bottom-up processes in which abundant hydrocarbon radicals react in situ with PAHs. Ahead of the DFs, in the atomic PDR zone (where [H]&amp;gt;&amp;gt;[H2]), the AIB emission is brightest, but small PAHs and carbonaceous grains undergo photo-processing due to the stronger FUV field. Our detection of trace amounts of C2H in this zone may result from the photoerosion of these species. This study provides a spatially resolved view of the chemical stratification of key carbon carriers in a PDR. Overall, both bottom-up and top-down processes appear to link simple hydrocarbon molecules with PAHs in molecular clouds; however, the exact chemical pathways and their relative contributions remain to be quantified.

While molecular outflows have been studied in details with radio interferometry, observations of the hotter gas in protostellar outflows at a comparable physical scale is often challenging. Combined with ALMA, JWST allows us to investigate the cold and hot gas with unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity. We present a detailed comparison between the gas distributions probed with ALMA and JWST in the primary outflow of IRAS 15398-3359. At 2000 au scale, the southwestern outflow shows four shell structures in 5&amp;ndash;10 micron continuum, whereas the submillimeter H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO emission traces two of the four shells closest to the protostar. Submillimeter emission from CS, CCH, c-C_3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and CH_3OH shows the same two shells, and the ^12CO emission covers most of the outflow region. SO and SiO only trace a condensation at the edge of the shell closest to the protostar. None of these lines observed with ALMA show the outermost shell. At 500 au scale, we find hot H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas inside the outflow cavity with JWST. The derived temperature of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is 1147±198 K within a 0\farcs5 aperture at the protostar. The foreground mass column density of dust is (1.4&amp;ndash;2.0)×10^-3 g\cdotcm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (A_v = 47&amp;ndash;66 mag) in the outflow, using the dust model from Weingartner &amp; Draine (2001). We also find an 8&amp;deg; difference between the directions toward the [Fe II] knot and the outermost shell in the MIRI image, which may be interpreted as the precession of the [Fe II] jet. The dynamical timescale of the [Fe II] knot is 10 yrs, suggesting a current event.

There is vast evidence from observations of multiple stellar populations (MPs) in globular clusters (GCs). To explore the issue theoretically, this work considers two subsolar metallicities, two ages, and two initial abundance patterns: a first population of standard &amp;alpha;-enhanced metal mixture stars and a second stellar population displaying C-N and Na-O anticorrelations chemical abundance patterns, along with an enhanced helium fraction. Analysing the predictions for these extreme compositions, we provide insights into the observability of not-resolved MPs into individual stars of GCs. We use colours and spectrophotometric indices measurable with modern facilities (e.g. Euclid, LSST, DES, JWST).

X-rays provide a robust method in identifying AGN. However, in the high-redshift Universe, their space density is relatively low, and, in combination with the small areas covered by X-ray surveys, the selected AGN are poorly sampled. Deep optical/infrared data are essential for locating counterparts and determining redshifts. In this work, we leverage the XMM-Newton 4XMM-DR11 serendipitous catalogue alongside the extensive optical Dark Energy Survey and the near-infrared VISTA Hemisphere Survey (VHS) to select one of the largest high-z X-ray AGN samples to date. Our analysis focuses on the overlapping area of these surveys, covering about 185 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In addition, we aspire to compare the properties of the X-ray AGN with the optically-selected QSOs. For sources without spectroscopic data (80%), we estimated the photometric redshifts using both SED fitting and machine-learning algorithms. Among the 65,000 X-ray sources in the 4XMM-DES-VHS area, we ended up with 833 z&amp;gt;3.5 AGN (11% having spec-z information) with high reliability and a fraction of outliers &amp;eta;&amp;lt;10%. The sample completeness is 90%, driven by the depth of DES data. Only 10% of the X-ray selected AGN are also optical QSOs and vice versa. Our findings indicate an observed absorbed fraction (log N_H~[cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;] ≥ 23) of 20-40% for the X-ray AGN, significantly higher than that of optical QSOs. X-ray AGN exhibit fainter observed optical magnitudes and brighter mid-IR magnitudes than optical QSOs. Their median rest-frame SED shapes differ notably with optical QSOs being dominated by AGN emission in the UV-optical wavelengths. While the median SEDs of X-ray AGN suggest extinction in the UV-optical range, individual sources exhibit a wide range of spectral shapes, indicating significant diversity within the population. This analysis supports that X-ray and optically-selected AGN represent distinct and complementary populations.

&lt;p&gt;
The gas-phase abundances of deuterium (D) in the local interstellar medium (ISM) exhibit considerable regional variations. Particularly, in some regions the gas-phase D abundances are substantially lower than the primordial D abundance generated in the Big Bang, after subtracting the astration reduction caused by the Galactic chemical evolution. Deuterated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules have been suggested as a potential reservoir of the D atoms missing from the gas-phase. Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope's Near Infrared Spectrograph have revealed the widespread of deuterated PAHs in the Orion Bar through their aliphatic C&amp;ndash;D emission at 4.65 &amp;mu; m and possibly aromatic C&amp;ndash;D emission at 4.4 &amp;mu; m as well. To examine the viability of deuterated PAHs as the D reservoir, we model the infrared (IR) emission spectra of small PAH molecules containing various aromatic and aliphatic D atoms in the Orion Bar. We find that small deuterated PAHs exhibit a noticeable emission band at 4.4 or 4.65 &amp;mu; m even if they contain only one aromatic or aliphatic D atom. We derive N_D,ali/N_H≈3.4&amp;percnt;, the deuteration degree of PAHs measured as the number of aliphatic D atoms (relative to H), from the observed intensity ratios of the 4.65 &amp;mu; m band to the 3.3 &amp;mu; m aromatic C&amp;ndash;H band. The deuteration degree for aromatically-deuterated PAHs is less certain as C&amp;ndash;N stretch also contributes to the observed emission around 4.4 &amp;mu; m. If we attribute it exclusively to aromatic C&amp;ndash;D, we derive an upper limit of ≈14&amp;percnt; on the deuteration degree, which is capable of accounting for an appreciable fraction of the missing D budget.

We report the discovery of an intriguing, low-mass galaxy-scale strong-lens system in the SMACS J0723.3-7327 galaxy cluster. By modeling James Webb Space Telescope imaging and Very Large Telescope Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer spectroscopic data, we find that the lens is cluster member galaxy at z=0.397 with an Einstein radius of 0&amp;prime;&amp;prime;.424 ± 0&amp;prime;&amp;prime;.012, stellar mass of M_* = (3.3 ± 0.8) × 10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, half-light radius of ~ 1 kpc, and central stellar velocity dispersion of 140 ± 6 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. This lens galaxy is one of the few strong lens galaxies known to date that have stellar mass as low as M_* ~ 10^10.5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, offering an exceptional opportunity to peek into the population of low-mass galaxies that has largely remained unexplored in the context of strong-lensing studies. This strong lens system can also assist in assessing the systematic uncertainty in the lens modeling of cluster member galaxies.

&lt;p&gt;
Luminous broad H&amp;alpha; emission and red rest-optical SEDs are the hallmark of compact Little Red Dots (LRDs), implying highly attenuated dusty starbursts and/or obscured active galactic nuclei. However, the lack of observed FIR emission has proved difficult to reconcile with the implied attenuated luminosity in these models. Here, we utilize deep new ALMA imaging, new and existing JWST/MIRI imaging, and archival Spitzer/Herschel imaging of two of the rest-optically brightest LRDs (z=3.1 and z=4.47) to place the strongest constraints on the IR luminosity in LRDs to date. The detections at &amp;lambda;_rest=1-4  &amp;mu;m imply flat slopes in the rest-IR, ruling out a contribution from hot (T≳500 K) dust. Similarly, FIR non-detections rule out any appreciable cold (T≲75 K) dust component. Assuming energy balance, these observations are inconsistent with the typical FIR dust emission of dusty starbursts and quasar torii, which usually show a mixture of cold and hot dust. Additionally, our [C_II] non-detections rule out typical dusty starbursts. We compute empirical maximum IR SEDs and find that both LRDs must have log(L_IR/L&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) ≲ 12.2 at the 3&amp;sigma; level. These limits are in tension with the predictions of rest-optical spectrophotometric fits, be they galaxy only, AGN only, or composite. It is unlikely that LRDs are highly dust-reddened intrinsically blue sources with a dust temperature distribution that conspires to avoid current observing facilities. Rather, we favor an intrinsically redder LRD SED model that alleviates the need for strong dust attenuation.

&lt;p&gt;
Outflows are a key element in the baryon cycle of galaxies, and their properties provide a fundamental test for our models of how star formation quenches in galaxies. Here we report the detection of outflowing gas in two recently quenched, massive (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;~10^10.2M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) galaxies at z=4.106 (NS_274) and z=7.276 (RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7) observed with JWST/NIRSpec. The outflows are traced by blue-shifted MgII absorption lines, and in the case of the z=4.1 system, also by FeII and NaI features. The spectra of the two sources are similar to those of local post-starburst galaxies, showing deep Balmer features and minimal star formation on 10 Myr timescales as traced by the lack of bright emission lines, also suggesting the absence of a strong and radiatively efficient AGN. The galaxies' SFHs are consistent with an abrupt quenching of star formation, which continued at rates of ~15 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;/yr averaged over 100 Myr timescales. Dedicated millimeter observations of NS_274 constrain its dust obscured SFR to &amp;lt;12 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;/yr. Under simple geometrical assumptions, we derive mass loading factors ≲1 and ~50 for the z=4.1 and z=7.3 systems, respectively, and similarly different energies carried by the outflows. Supernovae feedback can account for the mass and energy of the outflow in NS_274. However, the low mass loading factor and average gas velocity suggest that the observed outflow is unlikely to be the reason behind its quenching. SF-related processes seem to be insufficient to explain the extreme mass outflow rate of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7, which would require an additional ejective mechanism such as an undetected AGN. Finally, the average outflow velocities per unit M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;, SFR, or its surface area are consistent with those of lower-redshift post-starburst galaxies, suggesting that outflows in rapidly quenched galaxies might occur similarly across cosmic time.

&lt;p&gt;
JWST is detecting an excess of high-redshift (z≳ 10), bright galaxies challenging most theoretical predictions. To address this issue, we investigate the impact of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) on the halo mass function and UV luminosity function (LF) of super-early galaxies. We explore two key effects: (i) the enhancement of massive halos abundance due to the compact nature and spatial distribution of PBHs, and (ii) the luminosity boost, characterized by the Eddington ratio &amp;lambda;_E, due to Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) powered by matter accretion onto PBHs. We build an effective model, calibrated using data at lower redshifts (z≈ 4-9), to derive the evolution of the LF including the additional PBH contribution. Via Bayesian analysis, we find that: (a) Although a small fraction (log f_PBH ≈ -5.42) of massive (log M_PBH / M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 8.37), non-emitting (&amp;lambda;_E=0) PBHs can explain the galaxy excess via the halo abundance enhancement, this solution is excluded by CMB &amp;mu;-distortion constraints on monochromatic PBHs. (b) If PBHs power an AGN emitting at super-Eddington luminosity (&amp;lambda;_E ≈ 10), the observed LF can be reproduced by a PBH population with characteristic mass log M_PBH / M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 3.69 constituting a tiny (log f_PBH ≈ -8.16) fraction of the cosmic dark matter content. In the AGN scenario, about 75% of the observed galaxies with M_UV=-21 at z=11 should host a PBH-powered AGN and typically reside in low mass halos, M_h = 10^8-9 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. These predictions can be tested with available and forthcoming JWST spectroscopic data. We note that our analysis considers a lognormal PBH mass function and compares its parameters with monochromatic limits on PBH abundance. Further work is required to relax such limitations.

Little Red Dots (LRDs) are compact, point-like sources characterized by their red color and broad Balmer lines, which have been debated to be either dominated by active galactic nuclei (AGN) or dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). Here we report two LRDs (ID9094 and ID2756) at z&lt;sub&gt;spec&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;7, recently discovered in the JWST FRESCO GOODS-North field. Both satisfy the "v-shape" colors and compactness criteria for LRDs and are identified as Type-I AGN candidates based on their broad H&amp;beta; emission lines (full width at half maximum: 2276±492 km/s for ID9094 and 1069±239 km/s for ID2756) and narrow [OI] lines (~ 300-400 km/s). To investigate their nature, we conduct deep NOEMA follow-up observations targeting the [CII] 158&amp;mu; m emission line and the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We do not detect [CII] or 1.3 mm continuum emission for either source. Notably, in the scenario that the two LRDs were DSFGs, we would expect significant detections: &amp;gt;16&amp;sigma; for [CII] and &amp;gt;3&amp;sigma; for the 1.3 mm continuum of ID9094, and &amp;gt;5&amp;sigma; for [CII] of ID2756. Using the 3&amp;sigma; upper limits of [CII] and 1.3 mm, we perform two analyses: (1) UV-to-FIR spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with and without AGN components, and (2) comparison of their properties with the L_[CII]-SFR_tot empirical relation. Both analyses indicate that LRDs favor the presence of AGN to explain their observed properties. Our results highlight the importance of far-infrared observations for studying LRDs, a regime that remains largely unexplored.

Recent JWST observations hint at unexpectedly intense cosmic star-formation in the early Universe, often attributed to enhanced star-formation efficiencies (SFEs). Here, we analyze the SFE in THESAN-ZOOM, a novel zoom-in radiation-hydrodynamic simulation campaign of high-redshift (z ≳ 3) galaxies employing a state-of-the-art galaxy formation model resolving the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM). The halo-scale SFE (&amp;epsilon;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;ast;&lt;/sup&gt;_halo) - the fraction of baryons accreted by a halo that are converted to stars - follows a double power-law dependence on halo mass, with a mild redshift evolution above M_halo ≳ 10^9.5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. The power-law slope is roughly 1/3 at large halo masses, consistent with expectations when gas outflows are momentum-driven. At lower masses, the slope is roughly 2/3 and is more aligned with the energy-driven outflow scenario. &amp;epsilon;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;ast;&lt;/sup&gt;_halo is a factor of 2-3 larger than commonly assumed in empirical galaxy-formation models at M_halo ≲ 10^11 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. On galactic (kpc) scales, the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation of neutral gas is universal in THESAN-ZOOM, following &amp;Sigma;_SFR &amp;prop; &amp;Sigma;_gas^2, indicative of a turbulent energy balance in the ISM maintained by stellar feedback. The rise of &amp;epsilon;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;ast;&lt;/sup&gt;_halo with halo mass can be traced primarily to increasing gas surface densities in massive galaxies, while the underlying KS relation and neutral, star-forming gas fraction remain unchanged. Although the increase in &amp;epsilon;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;ast;&lt;/sup&gt;_halo with redshift is relatively modest, it is sufficient to explain the large observed number density of UV-bright galaxies at z ≳ 12. However, reproducing the brightest sources at M_UV ≲ -21 may require extrapolating the SFE beyond the halo mass range directly covered by THESAN-ZOOM.

&lt;p&gt;
We report the spectroscopic confirmation of a merging pair of massive quiescent galaxies at z=3.44. Using JWST observations, we confirm that the two galaxies lie at a projected separation of 4.5 kpc with a velocity offset of ~ 680  km  s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (&amp;delta;_z ~ 0.01). The pair resides in the core of a known rich overdensity of galaxies, dubbed the "Cosmic Vine". For both pair members, modeling of the Spectral Energy Distributions and faint rest-frame optical emission lines indicate high stellar masses (log(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;)~10.9) and suppressed star formation (log(sSFR/yr^-1)&amp;lt;-10), more than an order of magnitude below the level of the star formation main sequence at this redshift. We then explore the Illustris-TNG simulation and the GAEA and SHARK semi-analytical models to examine whether they produce a pair of massive quiescent galaxies akin to that of the Cosmic Vine. While all models produce close pairs of massive quiescent galaxies at 2&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;4 with comparable separations and velocity offsets, their predicted number densities are 10-80 times lower than our observational constraint. This discrepancy cannot be fully explained by coarse time sampling in these models or the general challenge of forming early massive quiescent galaxies in simulations. Given that &amp;gt;90&amp;percnt; of simulated pairs in the models that we analyzed merge by z=0, our findings suggest that our observed pair will likely coalesce into a single massive galaxy. The merger, occurring in the dense core of a large-scale structure, might represent a critical event in the formation of a brightest cluster galaxy and the morphological transformation of high-redshift disky quiescent galaxies into early-type ellipticals.

We present a sample of 146 high-redshift (z&amp;gt;7.5) galaxies from the CANUCS/Technicolor surveys, showcasing photometry in every wide- and medium-band NIRCam filter in addition to ancillary HST data sampling 0.4-5 &amp;mu; m (22 JWST bands out of 29 bands total). Additionally, 48 (33&amp;percnt;) galaxies in our sample meet criteria to be classified as extreme emission line galaxies, 15 (10&amp;percnt;) of which are completely missed by typical dropout selections due to faint UV emission. By fitting the SEDs covering the rest-frame UV to optical at z &amp;gt; 7.5, we investigate the dust obscuration properties, giving an unbiased view of dust buildup in high-redshift galaxies free from spectroscopic follow-up selection effects. Dust attenuation correlates with stellar mass, but more strongly with star formation rate. We find typical galaxies at z&amp;gt;7.5 have ~ 25 &amp;percnt; of their star formation obscured. However, since galaxies with higher star formation rates suffer more attenuation, ~ 50 &amp;percnt; of the total star formation rate density at 7.5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;9 is obscured. The obscured fraction drops to ~ 35 &amp;percnt; in our 9&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;12 bin, possibly due to substantial dust grain growth in the interstellar medium not having time to occur. Extrapolating the decline in dust obscuration of galaxies to higher redshifts, we infer that dust obscuration should approach zero at z &amp;gt; 15, implying that epoch as when dust first forms in bright galaxies.

&lt;p&gt;
Recent JWST observations towards Westerlund 1 revealed extensive nebular emission associated with the cluster. Given the age of the region and proximity of that material to massive stars it cannot be primordial star forming gas and the origin is uncertain. We aim to determine whether the nebular emission in Westerlund 1 could be due to ablation flows from Red Supergiant (RSG) stars embedded in the cluster wind driven by the Wolf-Rayet stars in the cluster core. We also aim to explore the efficiency of mass-loading for the RSG wind in this scenario. We use 3D hydrodynamic simulations with the scpion code to study the interaction between the cluster and RSG winds. We compare with the JWST observations by generating synthetic dust-emission maps. We find that the ablation flow morphology is consistent with the observations towards Westerlund 1, with clumps and instabilities. Synthetic observations at 11 &amp;mu;m predict fluxes in the ablation flow of ~1000-6000 MJy ster^-1 which is consistent with the unsaturated components of the JWST F1130W observations in the vicinity of the red supergiants in the region. This good agreement is achieved without any consideration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which have a known 11.3 &amp;mu;m feature that appears in the F1130W band. This suggests that the ablation flow is PAH depleted. Ablation of RSG winds can explain the observed nebulosity in Westerlund 1, at least in the vicinity of the RSGs. Further observations are encouraged to enable detailed studies of these interactions.

Stellar-mass isolated black holes (IsoBHs) wandering in interstellar medium (ISM) are expected to be abundant in our Galaxy. Recently, an IsoBH, OGLE-2011-BLG-0462, was unambiguously discovered using astrometric microlensing. We examine prospects for detecting electromagnetic signatures from an accretion flow surrounding the IsoBH. The accretion rate onto the IsoBH should be highly sub-Eddington, which leads to formation of a hot accretion flow. In this paper, we evaluate the detectability of electromagnetic signals from the hot accretion flows in two accretion states: magnetically arrested disk (MAD) and classical radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs). For the MAD scenario, we find that the optical, infrared, and X-ray signals can be detectable by the current best facilities, such as HST, JWST, and Chandra, if the IsoBH is in a warm neutral medium. In contrast, for the classical RIAF scenario, the optical and X-ray emissions are weaker than MAD scenario, leading to unobservable signals for a typical parameter set. Future follow-up observations of OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 will provide a good test for theories of accretion processes.

&lt;p&gt;
JWST has revealed a population of broad-line active galactic nuclei at z&amp;gt;4 with remarkably red colors, so-called "Little Red Dots." Ubiquitous Balmer breaks suggest that they harbor old stellar populations in massive, compact host galaxies. We present ALMA observations of three LRDs at z=3.10, 4.46, and 7.04, targeting molecular and neutral gas via CO(7-6) and [CI](2-1), respectively. We do not detect CO in any target, placing conservative limits on the host molecular gas mass ≲ 1-5×10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. We report the tentative (4.9&amp;sigma;) detection of the [CI](2-1) line in A2744-45924 (z=4.46), one of the brightest known LRDs. The [CI] line is narrow (FWHM ~ 80 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), implying a dynamical mass ≲ 10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, adopting conservative limits for the galaxy size. The dynamical mass limit is significantly lower than expected from the local M_BH-M_dyn relation, and is an order of magnitude below the stellar mass derived from SED fitting, potentially supporting a non-stellar origin of the Balmer break. These results, while tentative, paint a picture of LRDs that is markedly different than typical high-z quasars, which live in massive, gas-rich, and actively star-forming host galaxies.

&lt;p&gt;
A unique galaxy at z = 2.2, zC406690, has a striking clumpy large-scale ring structure that persists from rest UV to near-infrared, yet has an ordered rotation and lies on the star-formation main sequence. We combine new JWST/NIRCam and ALMA band 4 observations, together with previous VLT/SINFONI integral field spectroscopy and HST imaging to re-examine its nature. The high-resolution H&amp;alpha; kinematics are best fitted if the mass is distributed within a ring with total mass M_ring = 2 × 10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and radius R_ring = 4.6 kpc, together with a central undetected mass component (e.g., a "bulge") with a dynamical mass of M_bulge = 8 × 10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. We also consider a purely flux emitting ring superposed over a faint exponential disk, or a highly "cuspy" dark matter halo, both disfavored against a massive ring model. The low-resolution CO(4-3) line and 142GHz continuum emission imply a total molecular and dust gas masses of M_mol,gas = 7.1 × 10^10M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and M_dust = 3 × 10^8 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; over the entire galaxy, giving a dust-to-mass ratio of 0.7%. We estimate that roughly half the gas and dust mass lie inside the ring, and that ~ 10&amp;percnt; of the total dust is in a foreground screen that attenuates the stellar light of the bulge in the rest-UV to near-infrared. Sensitive high-resolution ALMA observations will be essential to confirm this scenario and study the gas and dust distribution.

Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed massive galaxies at very high redshift (z≃ 7-15). The question of whether the existence of such galaxies is expected in the corresponding JWST surveys has received a lot of attention, though the answer straddles areas of cosmology and complex astrophysical details of high-redshift galaxy formation. The growth rate of density fluctuations determines the amplitude of overdensities that collapse to form galaxies. Late-time modifications of growth, combined with measurements at both z~ 1 from large-scale structure and z~ 1000 from the cosmic microwave background, affect the predictions for the abundance of first galaxies in the universe. In this paper, we point out that the late-time growth rate of structure affects the statistical significance of high-redshift, high-mass objects very weakly. Consequently, if the existence and abundance of these objects are confirmed to be unexpected, the variations in the late-time growth history are unlikely to explain these anomalies.

&lt;p&gt;
The integral-field unit mode of the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec+IFU) mounted on the James Webb Space Telescope has now enabled kinematic studies of smaller and less massive compact stellar systems in which to search for central massive black holes (BHs) than ever before. We present here the first such detection using NIRSpec+IFU in its highest resolution (R~2700) mode. We report a 3&amp;sigma; detection of a central black hole with mass  M_BH=2.2±1.1×10^6 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; in UCD736 orbiting within the Virgo galaxy cluster based on Schwarzschild's modeling of the 1D kinematic profile. The presence of such a massive BH strongly argues against a globular cluster origin of this UCD, and rather suggests a tidally stripped formation route from a former ≳10^9 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; dwarf galaxy host. Two other methods produce results consistent with Schwarzschild's modelling, but can only provide upper-limits on  M_BH. This represents the detection of a BH in the most compact (r_h≈15 pc) stellar system to date, with a  M_BH corresponding to ~9 percent of the system's stellar mass, roughly in line with previously reported UCD BH detections and comparable to the BH detected in the compact elliptical galaxy NGC4486B.

By selecting galaxies detected at radio frequencies (S_3 GHz&amp;gt;11.5 &amp;mu;Jy; i.e. S/N&amp;gt;5) and with faint counterparts at NIR wavelengths (F150W&amp;gt;26.1 mag), we collect a sample of 127 likely dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). We estimate their physical properties through SED fitting, compute the first radio luminosity function for these types of sources, and their contribution to the total cosmic star formation rate density. Our analysis confirms that these sources represent a population of highly dust-obscured (&amp;langle; A_v &amp;rangle; ~3.5 mag), massive (&amp;langle; M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rangle; ~10^10.8 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) and star-forming galaxies (&amp;langle; SFR &amp;rangle;~300 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1) located at &amp;langle; z &amp;rangle;~3.6, representing the high-redshift tail of the full distribution of radio sources. Our results also indicate that these galaxies could dominate the bright end of the radio luminosity function and reach a total contribution to the cosmic star formation rate density equal to that estimated only considering NIR-bright sources at z~4.5. Finally, our analysis further confirms that the radio selection can be employed to collect statistically significant samples of DSFGs, representing a complementary alternative to the other selections based on JWST colors or detection at FIR/(sub)mm wavelengths.

Gravitational time delays offer unique, independent measurements of the Hubble constant, H_0. Precise measurements of H_0 stand as one of the most pressing challenges in modern cosmology, and to do so with time delays requires precise lens models. While much work has focused on streamlining the modeling process to keep pace with the erumpent discovery of strongly-lensed systems, a critical step toward reducing uncertainty in H_0 comes from increasing the precision of individual lens models themselves. In this work, we demonstrate that the unprecedented imaging capabilities of JWST make this goal attainable. We present the first lens model for time-delay cosmography derived from JWST data, applied to the quadruply-imaged quasar WFI2033&amp;ndash;4723. While the primary source of systematic uncertainty in time-delay cosmography is currently the mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD), the sensitivity of models to this MSD varies on how the point spread function (PSF) errors are mitigated. As the PSF is also the primary source of uncertainty in lens modeling, we focus on a comparison of different PSF modeling methods. Within the context of power-law models, we recover results in agreement with previous Hubble Space Telescope (HST)-based models, but with better precision of key lensing parameters through implementation of new PSF modeling techniques. Despite the record-holding precision of this system's HST modeling, we achieve an additional 22% increase in precision of the Fermat potential difference, directly reducing uncertainties of cosmological inference. These results would produce a 3% (1&amp;sigma; of the modeling error) shift of H_0 towards a higher value for this lens, keeping all else constant. This work substantiates the groundbreaking potential of JWST for time-delay cosmography and lays the groundwork for modeling systems previously too faint to provide meaningful constraints on H_0.

We develop a sample of 234 dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) from the A2744 and GOODS-S fields using JWST/NIRCam-selected galaxies as priors for SCUBA-2 measurements. This provides a large number of galaxies both above an 850 &amp;mu;m flux of 2 mJy (47 bright DSFGs) and below (187 faint DSFGs). It represents the largest sample of individually identified (i.e., not stacked) faint DSFGs to date. We identify a tight negative correlation between redshift and both F444W and F150W flux, suggesting that the observed NIR flux may be an effective way of selecting high-redshift DSFGs. We study the physical properties of the DSFGs through spectral energy distribution fitting and morphological analysis. Other than the lower star formation rates (SFRs) and total infrared luminosities in the faint DSFGs, the two populations have similar properties. The stellar masses do not appear to be strongly dependent on either the SFRs or the submillimeter flux. These results suggest that the faint DSFGs are drawn from the same population of galaxies as the bright DSFGs. We find a lower merger fraction (~21%) relative to previous HST-based studies.

While NGC 1514 is an elliptical, but complex, planetary nebula at optical wavelengths, it was discovered to have a pair of infrared-bright, axisymmetric rings contained within its faint outer shell during the course of the WISE all-sky survey. We have obtained JWST mid-infrared imaging and spectroscopy of the nebula through the use of simultaneous observations with the MIRI Imager and Medium Resolution Spectrometer, selecting the F770W, F1280W, and F2550W filters to match each of the MRS's three grating positions. These observations show that the rings are clearly resolved and relatively distinct structures, with both filamentary and clumpy detail throughout. There is also cloud-like material that has a turbulent appearance in the interior of the rings, particularly at the longest wavelengths, and faint ejecta-like structures just outside the ring boundaries. Despite their brightness, the emission from the rings within the three imager passbands is shown to be dominated by thermal emission from very small grains, not line emission from atomic hydrogen or forbidden atomic lines, shocked molecular hydrogen, or PAHs. The doppler velocities derived from the two brightest emission lines in the rings, however, suggest that the material from which the rings were formed was ejected during an early period of very heavy mass loss from the PN progenitor, then shaped by asymmetrical fast winds from the central binary pair.

We present JWST NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy observations of the z=5.89 quasar NDWFS J1425+3254 from 0.6-5.3 microns, covering the rest-frame ultraviolet and optical at spectral resolution R~100. The quasar has a black hole mass of M_BH=(1.4\substack+3.1\\-1.0)×10^9 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and an Eddington ratio L_Bol/L_Edd=0.3\substack+0.6\\-0.2, as implied from the broad Balmer H&amp;alpha; and H&amp;beta; lines. We find that the quasar host has significant ongoing obscured star formation, as well as a quasar-driven outflow with velocity 6050\substack+460\\-630 km/s, possibly one of the most extreme outflows in the early Universe. The data also reveals that two companion galaxies are merging with the quasar host. The north-eastern companion galaxy is relatively old and very massive, with luminosity-weighted stellar age 65\substack+9\\-4 Myr, stellar mass (3.6\substack+0.6\\-0.3)×10^11 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, and SFR &amp;lt; (16.1±1.9) M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;/yr. A bridge of gas connects this companion galaxy and the host, confirming their ongoing interaction. A second merger is occurring between the quasar host and a much younger companion galaxy to the south, with stellar age 6.7±1.8 Myr, stellar mass (1.9±0.4)×10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, and SFR &amp;lt; (93\substack+17\\-16) M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;/yr. There is also another galaxy in the field that is likely in the foreground at z=1.135, that could be gravitationally lensing the quasar with magnification 1&amp;lt;&amp;mu;&amp;lt;2, and so &amp;lt;0.75 mag. Overall, the system is a "train-wreck" merger of three galaxies, with star formation and extreme quasar activity that were likely triggered by these ongoing interactions.

While the number of detected molecules, particularly complex organic molecules, in the solid-state in astrophysical environments is still rather limited, laboratory experiments and astrochemical models predict many potential candidates. Detection of molecules in protoplanetary disks provides a bridge between the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium and the chemistry of planets and their atmospheres. The excellent spectral sensitivity, broad wavelength coverage and high spatial resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allows for making progress in exploring chemical compositions of various astrophysical environments including planet-forming disks. They are a prerequisite for probing the disk content by means of sensitive absorption studies. In this paper, we present initial results of the JWST Cycle 1 GO program 1741 on d216-0939, a highly inclined TTauri disk located in the outskirts of the Orion Nebula Cluster. We utilise the NIRSpec and MIRI integral field unit spectrographs to cover its spectrum from 1.7 to 28~&amp;mu;m. In the d216-0939 disk, we give assignments of the composition of silicate grains. We unambiguously detect solid-state features of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ^13CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO, OCN^-, and tentatively OCS; species that had been detected recently also in other circumstellar disks. For the first time in disks, we provide unique detections of ices carrying NH_4^+ and the complex organic molecule ammonium carbamate (NH_4^+NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;COO^-). The latter detections speak for a very efficient NH_3 chemistry in the disk. We also show the very important role of scattering in the analysis of observational spectra of highly inclined disks.

The cosmic 21-cm signal promises to revolutionize studies of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Radio interferometers are aiming for a preliminary, low signal-to-noise (S/N) detection of the 21-cm power spectrum. Cross-correlating 21-cm with galaxies will be especially useful in these efforts, providing both a sanity check for initial 21-cm detection claims and potentially increasing the S/N due to uncorrelated residual systematics. Here we self-consistently simulate large-scale (1 Gpc) galaxy and 21-cm fields, computing their cross-power spectra for various choices of instruments as well as survey properties. We use 1080h observations with SKA-low AA* and HERA-350 as our benchmark 21-cm observations. We create mock Lyman alpha narrow-band, slitless and slit spectroscopic surveys, using benchmarks from instruments such as Subaru HyperSupremeCam, Roman grism, VLT MOONS, ELT MOSAIC, and JWST NIRCam. We forecast the resulting S/N of the galaxy-21-cm cross power spectrum, varying the galaxy survey area, depth and level of 21-cm foreground contamination for each pair of instruments. We find that the highest S/N is achievable through slitless, wide-area spectroscopic surveys, with the proposed Roman HLS survey resulting in a 55&amp;sigma; detection of the cross power with 21-cm as observed with SKA-low AA* for our fiducial model. Narrow-band dropout surveys are unlikely to result in a detectable cross-power, due to their poor redshift localization. Slit spectroscopy can provide a high S/N detection of the cross power for SKA-low AA* observations. Specifically, the planned MOONRISE survey with MOONS on the VLT can result in a 3&amp;sigma; detection, while a survey of comparable observing time using MOSAIC on the ELT can result in a 4&amp;sigma; detection. Our results can be used to guide survey strategies, facilitating the detection of the galaxy-21-cm cross power spectrum.

Mergers play important roles in galaxy evolution at and beyond Cosmic Noon (z~3). They are found to be a trigger of active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity and a process for growing stellar mass and black hole mass. High-z radio galaxies (HzRGs=type-2 radio-loud AGN) are among the most massive galaxies known, and reside in dense environments on scales of tens of kiloparsecs to Megaparsecs. We present the first search for kpc-scale companions in a sample of four z~3.5 HzRGs, with many supporting datasets, using matched 0.2" resolution ALMA and JWST/NIRSpec integral field unit data. We discover a total of ~12 companion systems within ≲18 kpc across all four HzRG fields using two independent detection methods: peculiar [OIII]4959,5007 kinematics offset from the main (systemic) ionized gas component and [CII]158&amp;mu; m emitters. We examine the velocity fields of these companions and find evidence of disk rotation along with more complex motions. We estimate the dynamical masses of these nearby systems to be M_dyn~10^9-11 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, which may indicate a minor merger scenario. Our results indicate that these companions may be the trigger of the powerful radio-loud AGN. We discuss the roles of the discovered companion systems in galaxy evolution for these powerful jetted AGN and indicate that they may impede jet launch and deflect the jet.

&lt;p&gt;
We introduce the THESAN-ZOOM project, a comprehensive suite of high-resolution zoom-in simulations of 14 high-redshift (z&amp;gt;3) galaxies selected from the THESAN simulation volume. This sample encompasses a diverse range of halo masses, with M_halo ≈ 10^8 - 10^13~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; at z=3. At the highest-resolution, the simulations achieve a baryonic mass of 142~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and a gravitational softening length of 17~cpc. We employ a state-of-the-art multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) model that self-consistently includes stellar feedback, radiation fields, dust physics, and low-temperature cooling through a non-equilibrium thermochemical network. Our unique framework incorporates the impact of patchy reionization by adopting the large-scale radiation field topology from the parent THESAN simulation box rather than assuming a spatially uniform UV background. In total, THESAN-ZOOM comprises 60 simulations, including both fiducial runs and complementary variations designed to investigate the impact of numerical and physical parameters on galaxy properties. The fiducial simulation set reproduces a wealth of high-redshift observational data such as the stellar-to-halo-mass relation, the star-forming main sequence, the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, and the mass-metallicity relation. While our simulations slightly overestimate the abundance of low-mass and low-luminosity galaxies they agree well with observed stellar and UV luminosity functions at the higher mass end. Moreover, the star-formation rate density closely matches the observational estimates from z=3-14. These results indicate that the simulations effectively reproduce many of the essential characteristics of high-redshift galaxies, providing a realistic framework to interpret the exciting new observations from JWST.

Using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), we tentatively detect two molecular hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) fluorescent emission features in high-redshift galaxies at 2.3 and 3.1&amp;sigma;. These features consist of many blended emission lines that result from the de-excitation cascade of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules that have absorbed Lyman-Werner band photons. Our study targets galaxies at redshifts z ≥ 7 galaxies of the early Universe, as they host some of the most extreme conditions in terms of star formation, molecular gas content, and the possible presence of outflows driven by starbursts and active galactic nuclei. To enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission features in the rest-frame wavelength range of 155-191 nm, we stack JWST/NIRSpec spectra from z=7.0-13.4. These stacked spectra also exhibit atomic emission features, such as CIV emission with a P-Cygni profile, as well as CIII], OIII], and HeII. The presence of these features and the slightly blue-shifted fluorescent H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lines suggest active multiphase atomic and molecular outflows may be common at these redshifts. Our results suggest that it is possible to search for FUV fluorescent H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lines in high redshift galaxies using JWST, which would enable the characterization of interstellar radiation fields, densities, and temperatures in extreme photodissociation environments.

Lyman &amp;alpha; (Ly&amp;alpha;) emission is one of few observable features of galaxies that can trace the neutral hydrogen content in the Universe during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). To accomplish this we need an efficient way to survey for Ly&amp;alpha; emitters (LAEs) at redshifts beyond 7, requiring unbiased emission-line observations that are both sufficiently deep and wide to cover enough volume to detect them. Here we present results from PASSAGE &amp;ndash; a pure-parallel JWST/NIRISS slitless spectroscopic survey to detect Ly&amp;alpha; emitters deep into the EoR, without the bias of photometric preselection. We identify four LAEs at 7.5≤ z≤9.5 in four surveyed pointings, and estimate the luminosity function (LF). We find that the LF does show a marked decrease compared to post-reionization measurements, but the change is a factor of ≲ 10, which is less than expected from theoretical calculations and simulations, as well as observational expectations from the pre-JWST literature. Modeling of the IGM and expected \lya profiles implies these galaxies reside in ionized bubbles of ≳ 2 physical Mpc. We also report that in the four fields we detect 3,1,0,0 LAEs, which could indicate strong field-to-field variation in the LAE distribution, consistent with a patchy HI distribution at z~8. We compare the recovered LAE number counts with expectations from simulations and discuss the potential implications for reionization and its morphology.

JWST provides a view of the Universe never seen before, and specifically fine details of galaxies in deep space. JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) is a deep field survey, providing unprecedentedly detailed view of galaxies in the early Universe. The field is also in relatively close proximity to the Galactic pole. Analysis of spiral galaxies by their direction of rotation in JADES shows that the number of galaxies in that field that rotate in the opposite direction relative to the Milky Way galaxy is ~50% higher than the number of galaxies that rotate in the same direction relative to the Milky Way. The analysis is done using a computer-aided quantitative method, but the difference is so extreme that it can be noticed and inspected even by the unaided human eye. These observations are in excellent agreement with deep fields taken at around the same footprint by HST and JWST. The reason for the difference may be related to the structure of the early Universe, but it can also be related to the physics of galaxy rotation and the internal structure of galaxies. In that case the observation can provide possible explanations to other puzzling anomalies such as the Ho tension and the observation of massive mature galaxies at very high redshifts.

&lt;p&gt;
Mapping the small-scale structure of the universe through gravitational lensing is a promising tool for probing the particle nature of dark matter. Curved Arc Basis (CAB) has been proposed as a local lensing formalism in galaxy clusters, with the potential to detect low-mass dark matter substructure. In this work, we analyze the cluster lens Abell S1063 in search of dark matter substructure with the CAB formalism, using multi-band imaging data from JWST. We use two different source modeling methods: shapelets and pixel-based source reconstruction based on Delaunay triangulation. We find that source modeling systematics from shapelets result in a disagreement between Curved Arc Basis parameters measured from different filters. Source modeling with Delaunay significantly alleviates this systematic, as seen in the improvement in agreement across filters. We also find that inadequate complexity in source modeling can result in convincing spurious detections of dark matter substructure from strong gravitational lenses, as seen by our &amp;Delta; BIC &amp;gt; 20 measurement of a M ~ 10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; subhalo with shapelets, a spurious detection that is not reproduced with Delaunay source modeling. We demonstrate that multi-band analysis with different JWST filters is key for disentangling source and lens model systematics from dark matter substructure detections.

&lt;p&gt;
Context. Dense filaments/feathers are kpc-scale dusty features present in nearby main sequence galaxies. Distinct from the spiral arms, filaments constitute a major portion of dense gas concentration. They are expected to play an important role in star formation and are known to harbour star-forming regions and H II regions. Aims. We explore the origin of filaments/feathers in disc galaxies via global gravitational instability. Methods. We conduct a parameter study using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of isolated disc galaxies that are isothermal, self-gravitating and initialised in equilibrium. Our galaxies are uniquely characterised by two dimensionless parameters, the Toomre Q and the rotational Mach number, M_c = v_c/c_s (ratio of circular velocity to sound speed). We carry out simulations covering a wide range in both. Results. We find that galaxies with Q = 1 form filaments within a single rotation, while galaxies with Q ≥ 2 do not. These filaments are kpc long and are semi-regularly spaced along the azimuth. Their morphology, density contrast and formation timescale vary with M_c, with filament spacing and instability onset time both inversely proportional to M_c and the density contrast increasing with M_c. However, their growth rates in all Q = 1 galaxies are ~ 0.5~&amp;Omega;, where &amp;Omega; is the angular frequency. We compare the filament spacing in our simulations with the ones from JWST/MIRI and HST observations of nearby galaxies and find them in agreement. Conclusions. Our study suggests that self-gravity and rotation are sufficient to form filaments, even in the absence of spiral arms or magnetic fields. Their morphologies are primarily determined by M_c, which parametrises the importance of thermal versus rotational support.

Utilizing deep NIRCam/WFSS data from JWST's FRESCO program, we spectroscopically survey the 3.3 &amp;mu; m aromatic and 3.4 &amp;mu; m aliphatic C&amp;ndash;H stretching emission bands of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules in galaxies at redshifts z~0.2&amp;ndash;0.5. Unlike pre-JWST studies, largely limited to infrared (IR)-bright galaxies (L_IR≳10^11~L&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) at z≲0.1, we probe 200 galaxies down to L_IR~10^8.5&amp;ndash;10^10~L&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; well beyond the local Universe. The 3.3 &amp;mu; m emission is detected at ≥3-&amp;sigma; in 88 out of 187 galaxies, correlating tightly with galaxy IR luminosity and star formation rate (SFR) and confirming the 3.3 &amp;mu; m PAH as a viable SFR tracer. Despite a large scatter, the 3.3 &amp;mu; m-to-IR luminosity ratio (L_3.3/L_IR) exhibits a strong metallicity dependence with a drop of L_3.3/L_IR by a factor of ≳10 at 12+log(O/H)~8.4&amp;ndash;8.5 towards lower metallicities. The 3.4 &amp;mu; m emission is detected in 37 out of 159 galaxies, with the 3.4 &amp;mu; m-to-3.3 &amp;mu; m luminosity ratio (L_3.4/L_3.3) spanning from ~0.05 to ~0.58 (median ~0.19), corresponding to PAH aliphatic fractions of ~0.78%&amp;ndash;8.3% (median ~2.9%) in terms of fractional carbon atoms in aliphatic units. While L_3.4/L_3.3 does not depend significantly on redshift, stellar mass, metallicity, or galaxy morphology, it does decrease with various SFR tracers, suggesting that ultraviolet photons in active star-forming regions may strip aliphatic sidegroups from PAH molecules. Our study showcases the unique power of JWST's NIRCam/WFSS to systematically map PAH aromatic and aliphatic content in statistically significant, less-biased galaxy samples, providing critical insights into PAH chemistry and its connection to galaxy properties.

We identify galaxies hosting ionised-gas high-velocity outflows from the complete sample of medium resolution (R1000) JWST/NIRSpec MSA spectroscopy taken as part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). From a total sample of 1087 [OIII]5007 emitters we identify 40 galaxies with a blue-side broadened [OIII]5007 line at z=2.5-9. Of these, 34 are strong outflow candidates whilst 6 sources have broadening potentially driven by rotating clumps. Our outflow candidate sample is mainly composed of star-forming galaxies, including ~65% starbursts, which span the stellar mass range log10(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;)=7.5-11.0. It also includes two candidate type-2 active galactic nuclei (AGN) and a 'little red dot' (LRD). We report a median outflow velocity of 531(+146)(-159) km/s and an overall incidence rate of 3.4%. These values are significantly higher and lower respectively than recent similar works, which we accredit to the limiting resolution of the R1000 spectroscopy and a stricter outflow selection criterion. We find no correlation between the outflow velocity and the galaxy stellar mass or star-formation rate. The median ratio between outflow velocity and escape velocity is 0.77(+0.36)(-0.32), indicating that most outflows cannot escape the galaxy gravitational potentials. We do find an anti-correlation between mass loading factor and stellar mass up to M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; ~(10^10)M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, with most lowest stellar-mass M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;(10^9)M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; galaxies reaching values well above unity, as is the case for local starburst galaxies.

We report the first detections of [Ne V] 14.3 &amp;mu;m and [Ne VI] 7.7 &amp;mu;m at high confidence (S/N&amp;gt;=6) in the nuclear region of the nearby spiral galaxy M83. Emission line maps of these high ionization lines show several compact structures. Specifically, the [Ne VI] emission is located at 140 pc from the optical nucleus and appears as a point source of size ≲18 pc (FWHM =&amp;lt;0.8"). We investigate the possible source of this extreme emission through comparison with photoionization models and ancillary data. We find that photoionization models of fast radiative shocks are able to reproduce the observed high excitation emission line fluxes only for the lowest preshock density available in the library, n =0.01 cm^-3. Additionally, tailored active galactic nuclei (AGN) photoionization models assuming a two-zone structure are compatible with the observed high ionization fluxes. Our simple AGN model shows that the emission at the location of the [Ne VI] source can be the result of a cloud being ionized by the radiation cone of an AGN. We stress, however, that to definitively confirm an AGN as the main source of the observed emission, more complex modeling accounting for different geometries is required. Previously known as a purely starburst system, these new findings of the nuclear region of M83 will require a reassessment of its nature and of objects similar to it, particularly now that we have access to the unparalleled infrared sensitivity and spatial resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has opened a window on many new puzzles in the early Universe, including a population of high-redshift star clusters with extremely high stellar surface density, suggesting unique star formation conditions in the Universe's early evolution. We study the formation and evolution of these first star clusters and galaxies using an AREPO cosmological simulation box designed to resolve the intricate environments of the smallest halos hosting Population III star clusters at z ≥ 12. Our approach, which prioritizes baryonic structure identification through a friends-of-friends algorithm, provides new insights into early star cluster formation and delivers predictions directly relevant to observations. We investigate the dynamical properties of these first star clusters and use numerical and analytical methods to understand the populations of virialized and non-virialized systems. Our findings indicate that high-z star clusters in a feedback-free regime can achieve extreme surface densities, consistent with the systems detected by JWST. These results imply that JWST may have the opportunity to uncover stellar systems at high redshift whose dynamical state preserves evidence of the hierarchical structure formation process.

We analyze JWST NIRSpec+MIRI/MRS observations of the infrared (IR) Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) features in the central regions (~0.26'' at 6 micron; ~50-440 pc depending on the source) of local luminous IR galaxies. In this work, we examine the effect of nuclear obscuration on the PAH features of deeply obscured nuclei, predominantly found in local luminous IR galaxies, and we compare these nuclei with "normal'' star-forming regions. We extend previous work to include shorter wavelength PAH ratios now available with the NIRSpec+MIRI/MRS spectral range. We introduce a new diagnostic diagram for selecting deeply obscured nuclei based on the 3.3 and 6.2 micron PAH features and/or mid-IR continuum ratios at ~3 and 5 micron. We find that the PAH equivalent width (EW) ratio of the brightest PAH features at shorter wavelengths (at 3.3 and 6.2 micron) is impacted by nuclear obscuration. Although the sample of luminous IR galaxies used in this analysis is relatively small, we find that sources exhibiting a high silicate absorption feature cluster tightly in a specific region of the diagram, whereas star-forming regions experiencing lower extinction levels occupy a different area in the diagram. This demonstrates the potential of this technique to identify buried nuclei. To leverage the excellent sensitivity of the MIRI imager onboard JWST, we extend our method of identifying deeply obscured nuclei at higher redshifts using a selection of MIRI filters. Specifically, the combination of various MIRI JWST filters enables the identification of buried sources beyond the local Universe and up to z~3, where other commonly used obscuration tracers such as the 9.7 micron silicate band, are out of the spectral range of MRS. Our results pave the way for identifying distant deeply obscured nuclei with JWST.

The TRGB-SBF Project team is developing an independent distance ladder using a geometrical calibration of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) method in elliptical galaxies that can in turn be used to set the surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) distance scale independent of Cepheid variables and Type Ia supernovae. In this paper, we use JWST TRGB distances calibrated using the megamaser galaxy NGC 4258 to determine a new Cepheid-independent SBF zero point for HST. This new calibration, along with improved optical color measurements from PanSTARRS and DECam, gives an updated value of the Hubble-Lemaitre constant H_0 = 73.8 ± 0.7 ± 2.3 km/s/Mpc that is virtually identical to the previously published result based on SBF distances calibrated using Cepheids (Blakeslee et al. 2021, arxiv:2101.02221). Future improvements in the geometrical calibration of TRGB and additions to the HST SBF survey will further reduce the random and systematic uncertainties on H_0 measured using the extensive HST WFC3/IR SBF dataset. JWST observations of the Coma cluster will soon establish a foundation for the SBF calibration that will extend to much larger distances than is possible with HST.

Precise tracking of the growth in galaxy size and the evolution of merger fractions with redshift is vital for understanding the formation history of submillimeter galaxies (SMGs). This study investigates these evolutions over a broad redshift range (1 &amp;lt; z ≲ 6), using a sample of 222 SMGs with a median redshift of z = 2.61^+0.89_-0.82 identified by ALMA and JCMT, enhanced by the advanced imaging capabilities of the JWST/NIRCam and MIRI. We find significant evolution in effective radii (R_e) in rest-frame V-band (R_e &amp;prop; (1 + z)^-0.87 ± 0.08) and near-infrared (NIR) band (R_e &amp;prop; (1 + z)^-0.88 ± 0.11), with the NIR size evolution resembling that of massive star-forming galaxies at lower redshift. Visual inspections reveal a major merger fraction of 24.3 ± 3.7&amp;percnt; and an interaction fraction of up to 48.4 ± 11.1&amp;percnt;. The major merger fraction exhibits an increase from 14.7±9.1&amp;percnt; at z = 1 to 26.6± 8.4&amp;percnt; at z = 3, after which it remains approximately constant across the redshift range 3 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 6. In contrast, the interaction fraction remains relatively stable across the range 2 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 5. Our results indicate that late-stage major mergers are not the primary formation mechanism for SMGs at z&amp;lt;3, while interactions appear to play a significant role across the broader redshift range of 1&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6. Additionally, HST-based major merger identifications may overestimate the true fraction by a factor of 1.7 at z ~ 2. These findings highlight the varying roles of mergers and interactions in driving the formation of massive, dusty star-forming galaxies across different redshifts.

We reconstruct the SFHs of 7 massive (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;≳ 10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) early-type galaxies (ETGs) in the Virgo cluster by analysing their spatially resolved stellar population (SP), including their UV and H&amp;alpha; emission. As part of the VESTIGE survey, we used H&amp;alpha; images to select ETGs that show no signs of ongoing star formation. We combined VESTIGE with images from Astrosat/UVIT, GALEX and CFHT from the NGVS to analyse radial spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the FUV to the NIR. The UV emission in these galaxies is likely due to old, low mass stars in post main sequence (PMS) phases, the UV upturn. We fit the radial SEDs with novel SP models that include an old, hot stellar component of PMS stars with various temperatures and energetics. This way, we explore the main stellar parameters responsible for UV upturn stars irregardless of their evolutionary path. Standard models are not able to reproduce the galaxies' central FUV emission (SMA/R_eff≲1), while the new models well characterise it through PMS stars with temperatures T≳25000 K. All galaxies are old (mass-weighted ages ≳10 Gyr) and the most massive M49 and M87 are supersolar within SMA/R_eff≲0.2. Overall, we found flat age gradients (&amp;nabla;Log(Age)~ -0.04 - 0 dex) and shallow metallicity gradients (&amp;nabla;Log(Z)&amp;lt;-0.2 dex), except for M87 (&amp;nabla;Log(Z_M87)≃-0.45 dex). Our results show that these ETGs formed with timescales &amp;tau;≲1500 Myr, having assembled between ~40-90&amp;percnt; of their stellar mass at z~5. This is consistent with recent JWST observations of quiescent massive galaxies at high-z, which are likely the ancestors of the largest ETGs in the nearby Universe. The derived flat/shallow gradients indicate that major mergers might have contributed to the formation and evolution of these galaxies.

&lt;p&gt;
Cold and cool gas (T ≤ 10^4 K) in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and its interaction with galaxies remain poorly understood. Simulations predict that cold gas flows into galaxies through cosmic filaments, determining the disk formation and galaxy evolution. The cold gas accretion modes in the CGM and their dependence on dark matter halo mass and redshift remain puzzling. Resolving the kiloparsec-scale kinematics and dynamics of cold gas interacting with the disk, dust, and metals in different environments is particularly lacking at z &amp;gt; 2. Here we report two disturbed cold gas structures traced by ultra-strong MgII absorbers (rest-frame equivalent width Wr &amp;gt; 2 &amp;#8491;) exhibiting high kinematic velocities (&amp;gt; 500 km/s) and their environments at z ~ 4.9 and z ~ 2.6. Observations were conducted with VLT/MUSE, JWST/NIRCam, and ALMA to detect Lya and nebular emission lines, as well as dust continuum emission in the vicinity of these two absorbing gas structures. We identify two Lya emitters associated with a strong MgII absorber pair separated by ~1000 km/s at z~ 4.87. The pair exhibits relative differences in metallicity, dust content, and ionization states, suggesting internal metal and dust exchange within the ultra-large cold gas structure. For the strong MgII absorber at z = 2.5652, we detect a dusty star-forming galaxy at a projected distance of D = 38 kpc. This galaxy exhibits prominent HeI, [SIII], and Paschen&amp;gamma; lines, along with significant dust continuum. It has a star formation rate of ~ 121 +/- 33 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;/yr and likely harbors a rotating disk. These findings tentatively suggest that cold gas at high redshifts plays a critical role in driving disk formation and actively participates in the transfer of metals and dust within the overdense regions of the CGM.

&lt;p&gt;
Supernova may be the dominant channel by which dust grains accumulate in galaxies during the first Gyr of cosmic time as formation channels important for lower redshift galaxies, e.g., AGB stars and grain growth, may not have had sufficient time to take over. Supernovae (SNe) produce fewer small grains, leading to a flatter attenuation law. In this work, we fit observations of 138 spectroscopically confirmed z&amp;gt;6 galaxies adopting standard spectral energy distribution modeling assumptions and compare standard attenuation law prescriptions to that of supernova-produced dust alone. Compared to SMC dust, SNe attenuation yields up to 0.5 mag higher A_V, and 0.4 dex larger stellar masses. SNe dust attenuation also finds better fits to the rest-frame UV photometry with lower &amp;chi;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;_UV. This allows the observed UV luminosities taken from the models to be fainter by 0.2 dex on average. The systematically fainter rest-frame UV luminosities for fixed observed photometry could help resolve current tension between the ionizing photon production implied by JWST observations and the redshift evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction. Given these systematic effects and the physical constraint of cosmic time itself, pure supernova dust attenuation laws should be a standard consideration in fitting to the spectral energy distributions of z&amp;gt;6 galaxies.

We measure radial stellar age gradients in the relatively isolated gas-rich dwarf irregular WLM, combining JWST NIRCam and NIRISS imaging with six archival Hubble fields over semi-major axis equivalent distances of 0≲R_SMA≲4 kpc (≲3R_hl). Fitting lifetime star formation histories (SFHs) to resolved color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), radial age gradients are quantified using &amp;tau;_90 and &amp;tau;_50, the lookback times to form 90&amp;percnt; and 50&amp;percnt; of the cumulative stellar mass. We find that globally, the outskirts of WLM are older on average, with (&amp;delta;&amp;tau;_90, &amp;delta;&amp;tau;_50)/&amp;delta;R_SMA=(0.82^+0.10_-0.10, 1.60^+0.23_-0.22) Gyr/kpc (stat.), in good agreement with simulations. However, we also detect an azimuthal dependence of radial stellar age gradients, finding that stars on the leading edge of WLM (relative to its proper motion) are both younger and have a flatter age gradient compared to the trailing edge. This difference persists over 0.6≲R_SMA≲3.2 kpc (~0.5-2.5R_hl) and lookback times up to ~8 Gyr, and is robust to assumed stellar evolutionary model. Our results are consistent with star formation triggered by ram pressure stripping from a circumgalactic and/or intergalactic medium, suggested by recent HI observations. If confirmed, processes typifying dense environments, such as ram pressure stripping, may be more relevant to the evolution of isolated galaxies than previously thought.

We investigate early galaxy evolution by modeling self-consistently their radially-resolved evolution of gas, stars, heavy elements, and dust content. Our model successfully reproduces various observed properties of JWST-identified galaxies at z &amp;gt; 5, including sizes, stellar masses, star formation rates (SFR), metallicities, and dust-to-stellar mass ratios. We show that the star formation efficiency (SFE), f&lt;sub&gt;&amp;ast;&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;equiv; SFR/(f_b M&amp;#775;_h), is regulated by the global equilibrium between cosmological gas inflows, star formation, and gas outflows. Our model predicts f&lt;sub&gt;&amp;ast;&lt;/sub&gt; ≲ 20~&amp;percnt; for galaxies with halo masses of M_h ~ 10^11-12  M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; down to z = 5, allowing them to reach intrinsic UV magnitudes of M_UV ≲ -22~mag; when dust attenuation is ignored, the predicted UV luminosity function (LF) at z ~ 12 agrees well with observations. However, our model also suggests that these galaxies would be heavily obscured by dust, with high optical depths at 1500~&amp;#8491;~of &amp;tau;_1500 ≳ 10, causing the dust-attenuated UV LF to fall significantly below the observed one. This discrepancy highlights the need for mechanisms that mitigate strong dust attenuation, such as dust evacuation from star-forming regions and/or preferential production of large dust grains. Further exploration of these processes is essential for understanding the early stages of galaxy evolution.

We present the magnetic field in the dense material of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way, traced in 850 &amp;mu;m polarized dust emission as part of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) B-fields In STar-forming Region Observations (BISTRO) Survey. We observe a highly ordered magnetic field across the CMZ between Sgr B2 and Sgr C, which is strongly preferentially aligned with the orbital gas flows within the clouds of the CMZ. We find that the observed relative orientations are non-random at a &amp;gt;99% confidence level and are consistent with models in which the magnetic field vectors are aligned within 30^o to the gas flows in 3D. The deviations from aligned magnetic fields are most prominent at positive Galactic longitudes, where the CMZ clouds are more massive, denser, and more actively forming stars. Our observed strongly preferentially parallel magnetic field morphology leads us to hypothesize that in the absence of star formation, the magnetic field in the CMZ is entrained in the orbital gas flows around Sgr A^*, while gravitational collapse and feedback in star-forming regions can locally reorder the field. This magnetic field behavior is similar to that observed in the CMZ of the nuclear starburst galaxy NGC 253. This suggests that despite its current low star formation rate, the CMZ of the Milky Way is analogous to those of more distant, actively star-forming, galaxies.

The Athena mission entered a redefinition phase in July 2022, driven by the imperative to reduce the mission cost at completion for the European Space Agency below an acceptable target, while maintaining the flagship nature of its science return. This notably called for a complete redesign of the X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) cryogenic architecture towards a simpler active cooling chain. Passive cooling via successive radiative panels at spacecraft level is now used to provide a 50 K thermal environment to an X-IFU owned cryostat. 4.5 K cooling is achieved via a single remote active cryocooler unit, while a multi-stage Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator ensures heat lift down to the 50 mK required by the detectors. Amidst these changes, the core concept of the readout chain remains robust, employing Transition Edge Sensor microcalorimeters and a SQUID-based Time-Division Multiplexing scheme. Noteworthy is the introduction of a slower pixel. This enables an increase in the multiplexing factor (from 34 to 48) without compromising the instrument energy resolution, hence keeping significant system margins to the new 4 eV resolution requirement. This allows reducing the number of channels by more than a factor two, and thus the resource demands on the system, while keeping a 4' field of view (compared to 5' before). In this article, we will give an overview of this new architecture, before detailing its anticipated performances. Finally, we will present the new X-IFU schedule, with its short term focus on demonstration activities towards a mission adoption in early 2027.

We present an analysis of the rest-frame optical spectra of 22 [OIII]&amp;lambda;4363 detected galaxies in the redshift range 1.65 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 7.92 (with &amp;langle; z &amp;rangle; = 4.05) from JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution observations taken as part of the EXCELS survey. To supplement these high-redshift sources, we also consider a sample of 782 local [OIII]&amp;lambda;4363 detected galaxies from the DESI Early Data Release. Our analysis demonstrates that many strong-line calibrations are biased in the early Universe due to the systematic evolution in ionization conditions with redshift. However, the recently introduced \widehatR calibration mostly removes the dependence on ionization state and can be considered a largely redshift-independent calibration. In a similar spirit, we introduce a new strong-line diagnostic, \widehatRNe, which can be used to robustly estimate metallicities when the [OIII]&amp;lambda;5007 is redshifted out of the wavelength range of JWST/NIRSpec at z &amp;gt; 9.5. We also show that strong-line diagnostics using the [NII]&amp;lambda;6584 emission line are likely to be biased at high-redshift due to a moderate enhancement in the average N/O abundance ratios (at fixed O/H) in these sources. Finally, we discuss the location of our new [OIII]&amp;lambda;4363 detected galaxies at z ≃ 4 on the mass-metallicity plane and investigate the redshift evolution of the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR). We find tentative evidence for an increasing deviation from the FMR at z &amp;gt; 4 which might indicate fundamental differences in the baryon cycle at these redshifts. However, more data are required as our high-redshift constraints are still based on a relatively small sample of galaxies and the significance of the deviation is strongly dependent on the assumed form of the fundamental metallicity relation.

New, ultra-deep medium-width photometric coverage with JWST's NIRCam instrument provides the potential for much improved photo-z reliability at high redshifts. In this study, we conduct a systematic analysis of the JADES Origins Field, which contains 14 broad- and medium-width near-infrared bands, to assess the benefits of medium band photometry on high-z sample completeness and contamination rates. Using imaging with depths of AB mag 29.8-30.35, we conduct an experiment to observe how high-z selections differ when images are artificially degraded or bands are removed. In parallel, the same experiments are conducted on simulated catalogues from the JAGUAR semi-analytic model to examine if the behaviour from observations can be replicated. We find sample completeness is high (80&amp;percnt;+) and contamination low (&amp;lt;4&amp;percnt;) when in the 10&amp;sigma;+ regime, even without the use of any medium-width bands. The addition of medium-width bands leads to notable increases in completeness (~10&amp;percnt;) but multiple bands are required to improve contamination rates due to the small redshift ranges over which they probe strong emission lines. Incidents of Balmer-Lyman degeneracy increase in the 5-7&amp;sigma; regime and this can be replicated in both simulated catalogues and degraded real data. We measure the faint-end of the UV LF at 8.5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;13.5, finding high number densities that agree with previous JWST observations. Overall, medium bands are effective at increasing completeness and reducing contamination, but investment in achieving at least comparable depths in the blue (&amp;lt;1.5&amp;mu;m) as achieved in the red is also found to be key to fully reducing contamination from high-z samples.

&lt;p&gt;
We present full 3-28 micron JWST MIRI/MRS and NIRSpec/IFU spectra of the western nucleus of Arp 220, the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxy. This nucleus has long been suggested to possibly host an embedded Compton-thick AGN. Millimeter observations of the dust continuum suggest the presence of a distinct 20 pc core with a dust temperature of T_d ≳ 500~K, in addition to a 100 pc circumnuclear starburst disk. However, unambiguously identifying the nature of this core is challenging, due to the immense obscuration, the nuclear starburst activity, and the nearby eastern nucleus. With the JWST integral field spectrographs, we can, for the first time, separate the two nuclei across this full wavelength range, revealing a wealth of molecular absorption features towards the western nucleus. We analyse the rovibrational bands detected at 4-22 micron, deriving column densities and rotational temperatures for 10 distinct species. Optically thick features of C_2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, HCN and HNC suggest that this molecular gas is hidden behind a curtain of cooler dust, and indicate that the column densities of C_2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and HCN are an order of magnitude higher than previously derived from Spitzer observations. We identify a warm HCN component with rotational temperature T_rot = 330~K, which we associate with radiative excitation by the hot inner nucleus. We propose a geometry where the detected molecular gas is located in the inner regions of the starburst disk, directly surrounding the hot 20 parsec core. The chemical footprint of the western nucleus is reminiscent of that of hot cores, with additional evidence for shocks. No evidence for the presence of an AGN in the form of X-ray-driven chemistry or extreme excitation is found.

&lt;p&gt;
(Abridged) JWST observations have measured the ice composition toward two highly-extinguished field stars in the Chamaeleon I cloud. The observed extinction excess on the long-wavelength side of the H2O ice band at 3 micron has been attributed to a mixture of CH3OH with ammonia hydrates, which suggests that CH3OH ice could have formed in a water-rich environment with little CO depletion. Laboratory experiments and quantum chemical calculations suggest that CH3OH could form via the grain surface reactions CH3+OH and/or C+H2O in water-rich ices. However, no dedicated chemical modelling has been carried out thus far to test their efficiency and dependence on the astrochemical code employed. We model the ice chemistry in the Chamaeleon I cloud using a set of astrochemical codes (MAGICKAL, MONACO, Nautilus, UCLCHEM, and KMC simulations) to test the effects of the different code architectures and of the assumed ice chemistry. Our models show that the JWST ice observations are better reproduced for gas densities &amp;gt;1e5 cm-3 and collapse times &amp;gt;1e5 yr. CH3OH ice forms predominantly (&amp;gt;99%) via CO hydrogenation. The contribution of reactions CH3+OH and C+H2O, is negligible. The CO2 ice may form either via CO+OH or CO+O depending on the code. However, KMC simulations reveal that both mechanisms are efficient despite the low rate constant of the CO+O surface reaction. CH4 is largely underproduced for all codes except for UCLCHEM, for which a higher amount of atomic C is available during the initial translucent cloud phase. Large differences in the ice abundances are found at Tdust&amp;lt;12 K between diffusive and non-diffusive chemistry codes. This is due to the fact that non-diffusive chemistry takes over diffusive chemistry at such low Tdust. This could explain the rather constant ice chemical composition found in Chamaeleon I and other dense cores despite the different visual extinctions probed.

We leverage JWST data from the COSMOS-Web Survey in order to provide updated measurements on the auto-power spectrum of the now resolved Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) and its coherence with the unresolved soft Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB) observed by Chandra at z &amp;gt; 6. Maps of the CIB in the F277W and F444W NIRCam filters are constructed with sources fainter than AB mag = 25 and cross-correlated with the CXB in the [0.5-2] keV band. We find that on scales between 1 and 1000'' the CIB-CXB cross-power in both NIRCam filters is statistically significant with signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) of 4.80 and 6.20 respectively from redshifts 0 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 13. In our high-z (6 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 13) interval we find coherence in both filters with a S/N of 7.32 and 5.39 respectively. These results suggest that there are X-ray emitting galaxies resolved by JWST, including star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We fit the large-scale biasing of the IR sources producing the CIB as a function of z with results consistent with prior measurements and place constraints on the CXB flux and biasing at low- and high-z. The CXB flux measurements presented in this study suggest that approximately 94% of the [0.5-2] keV CXB is resolved, and this value is consistent within 2&amp;sigma; with the complete resolution of the [0.5-2] keV CXB.

To date, gas phase observations of sulphur in dense interstellar environments have only constrained the molecular carriers of 1% of its predicted cosmic abundance. An additional 5% is known to be locked up in molecular solids in dense clouds, leaving the main reservoir of depleted sulphur in the solid phase unknown. The spectral resolution and sensitivity of the JWST could make a substantial difference in detecting part of this missing sulphur, with its wavelength coverage that includes vibrational absorption features of the S-carriers H2S, OCS, SO2, CS2, SO, CS, and S8. The aim of this study is to determine whether these molecules may be viable candidates for detection. We carried out new laboratory measurements of the IR absorption spectra of CS2 and S8 to update the IR band strength of the most intense CS2 absorption feature at 6.8 &amp;mu;m, as well as to determine that of S8 at 20.3 &amp;mu;m for the first time. These data, along with values previously reported in the literature, allow us to evaluate which S-bearing species could be potentially detected with JWST in interstellar ices. Taking the literature abundances of the major ice species determined by previous IR observations towards starless cores, LYSOs and MYSOs, we generated simulated IR spectra using the characteristics of the instruments on the JWST. Thus, we have been able to establish a case study for three stages of the star formation process. We conclude that the detection of S-bearing molecules remains challenging. Despite these obstacles, the detection of H2S and potentially SO2 should be possible in regions with favourable physical and chemical conditions. In contrast, S8 would remain undetected. Although the sensitivity of JWST is insufficient to determine the sulphur budget in the solid state, the detection of an additional icy sulphur compound (H2S, SO2) would enable us to elevate our knowledge of sulphur chemistry.

We homogeneously investigate the morphological properties of 169 galaxies at z~10-16 with deep JWST NIRCam images employing our established techniques of GALFIT modeling and uncertainty evaluation (systematics+statistics). We obtain effective radii r_e ranging 20-500 pc, with a distribution significantly broader than the scatter made by the uncertainties. We find that the r_e distribution is well described by a log-normal distribution with a mean of r_e=133^+13_-12 pc and a standard deviation of &amp;sigma;_lnr_e = 0.52 ± 0.08. The standard deviation is comparable to that of local galaxies, indicating no significant evolution over z~ 0-10. We estimate the virial radius r_vir from the stellar masses via the star-formation main sequence and stellar-to-halo mass relation, obtaining a stellar-to-halo size ratio r_e/r_vir = 0.015^+0.015_-0.005, which is comparable to those of star-forming galaxies in the local and low-z Universe. Our results of 1) the log-normal r_e distribution, 2) the standard deviation value, and 3) a mean radial profile consistent with an exponential profile (n=1.3±0.6) suggest that galaxies at z~10-16 generally follow the classical galaxy disk formation scenario with a specific disk angular momentum fraction of j_d / m_d ~ 0.5-1. Interestingly, we identify two remarkable outliers GN-z11 (z&lt;sub&gt;spec&lt;/sub&gt;=10.60) and GHZ2 (z&lt;sub&gt;spec&lt;/sub&gt;=12.34) with r_e=55^+5_-6 pc and 39±11 pc, respectively, that may not be explained by disk structures but by AGN or compact star-forming galaxies merging underway in short periods of time, as reproduced in numerical simulations.

Rare Poisson processes (PP) during cosmic inflation can lead to signatures that are localized in position space and are not well captured by the standard two- or higher-point correlation functions of primordial density perturbations. As an example, PP can lead to localized overdense regions that are far denser than the ones produced through standard inflationary fluctuations. As a result, such overdense regions collapse earlier than expected based on the standard &amp;Lambda;CDM model and would host anomalously high-redshift galaxies. We describe some general aspects of such PP and consider a particular realization in the context of inflationary particle production. We then show that the masses and redshifts of the resulting galaxies can lie in a range discoverable by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and future surveys, while being consistent with existing constraints on the matter power spectrum and UV luminosity functions at lower redshifts.

In the centers of many galaxy clusters, the hot (~10^7 K) intracluster medium (ICM) can become dense enough that it should cool on short timescales. However, the low measured star formation rates in massive central galaxies and absence of soft X-ray lines from cooling gas suggest that most of this gas never cools - this is known as the "cooling flow problem." The latest observations suggest that black hole jets are maintaining the vast majority of gas at high temperatures. A cooling flow has yet to be fully mapped through all gas phases in any galaxy cluster. Here, we present new observations of the Phoenix cluster using the James Webb Space Telescope to map the [Ne VI] &amp;lambda;7.652&amp;mu;m emission line, allowing us to probe gas at 10^5.5 K on large scales. These data show extended [Ne VI] emission cospatial with (i) the cooling peak in the ICM, (ii) the coolest gas phases, and (iii) sites of active star formation. Taken together, these imply a recent episode of rapid cooling, causing a short-lived spike in the cooling rate which we estimate to be 5,000-23,000 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1. These data provide the first large-scale map of gas at temperatures between 10^5-10^6 K in a cluster core, and highlight the critical role that black hole feedback plays in not only regulating but also promoting cooling.

The methylidyne cation (CH^+) and the methyl cation (CH_3^+) are building blocks of organic molecules, yet their coupled formation and excitation mechanisms remain mainly unprobed. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its high spatial resolution and good spectral resolution, provides unique access to the detection of these molecules. Our goal is to use the first detection of CH^+ and CH_3^+ rovibrational emission in the Orion Bar and in the protoplanetary disk d203-506, irradiated by the Trapezium cluster, to probe their formation and excitation mechanisms and constrain the physico-chemical conditions. We use spectro-imaging acquired using both the NIRSpec and MIRI-MRS instruments to study the CH^+ and CH_3^+ spatial distribution at very small scales, and compare it to excited H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission. CH^+ and CH_3^+ emissions originate from the same region as highly excited H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Our comparison between the Bar and d203-506 reveals that both CH^+ and CH_3^+ excitation and/or formation are highly dependent on gas density. The excitation temperature of the observed CH^+ and CH_3^+ rovibrational lines is around T ~ 1500 K in the Bar and T ~ 800 K in d203-506. Moreover, the column densities derived from the rovibrational emission are less than 0.1 % of the total known (CH^+) and expected (CH_3^+) column densities. These results show that CH^+ and CH_3^+ level populations strongly deviate from ETL. CH^+ rovibrational emission can be explained by chemical formation pumping with excited H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via C^+ + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;^* = CH^+ + H. These results support a gas phase formation pathway of CH^+ and CH_3^+ via successive hydrogen abstraction reactions. However, we do not find any evidence of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;^+ emission in the JWST spectrum. Finally, observed CH^+ intensities coupled with chemical formation pumping model provide a diagnostic tool to trace the local density.

First detected in 1965, the mysterious ultraviolet (UV) extinction bump at 2175 Angstrom is the most prominent spectroscopic feature superimposed on the interstellar extinction curve. Its carrier remains unidentified over the past six decades ever since its first detection, although many candidate materials have been proposed. Widely seen in the interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way as well as several nearby galaxies, this bump was recently also detected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at the cosmic dawn in JADES-GS-z6-0, a distant galaxy at redshift z~6.71, corresponding to a cosmic age of just 800 million years after the Big Bang. Differing from that of the known Galactic and extragalactic interstellar sightlines which always peak at ~2175 Angstrom, the bump seen at z~6.71 in JADES-GS-z6-0 peaks at an appreciably longer wavelength of ~2263 Angstrom and is the narrowest among all known Galactic and extragalactic extinction bumps. Here we show that the combined electronic absorption spectra quantum-chemically computed for a number of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules closely reproduce the bump detected by JWST in JADES-GS-z6-0. This suggests that PAH molecules have already been pervasive in the Universe at an epoch when asymptotic giant branch stars have not yet evolved to make dust.

The enigmatic ultraviolet (UV) extinction bump at 2175 Angstrom, the strongest spectroscopic absorption feature superimposed on the interstellar extinction curve, has recently been detected at the cosmic dawn by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in JADES-GS-z6-0, a distant galaxy at redshift z=6.71, corresponding to a cosmic age of just 800 million years after the Big Bang. Although small graphite grains have historically long been suggested as the carrier of the 2175 Angstrom extinction bump and graphite grains are expected to have already been pervasive in the early Universe, in this work we demonstrate that small graphite grains are not responsible for the UV extinction bump seen at the cosmic dawn in JADES-GS-z6-0, as the extinction bump arising from small graphite grains is too broad and peaks at wavelengths that are too short to be consistent with what is seen in JADES-GS-z6-0.

Recently, Freedman et al. (2024) report agreement of distances derived from the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) and the J-Region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) at the 1&amp;percnt; level for both nearby galaxies with ground-based imaging (0.5-4 Mpc) as well distant galaxies with JWST imaging (7-23 Mpc). Here we compare the same ground-based JAGB distances to uniformly reduced space-based optical TRGB distances from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We uncover a significant offset between these two distance scales of &amp;Delta;&amp;mu; = 0.17 ± 0.04 (stat) ± 0.06 (sys) mag (9&amp;percnt; in distance), with the HST TRGB distances being further. Inspections of the HST color-magnitude diagrams make a compelling case that the issue lies in the underlying JAGB distances. The source of the disagreement may lie with the lower resolution or photometric calibration of the ground-based near-infrared data, a contrast to the general agreement found between JWST JAGB and other space-based, second-rung distance indicators (Cepheids, Miras, TRGB) presented within Riess et al. (2024). High-resolution, near-infrared observations from an ongoing HST program will enable the simultaneous measurement of Cepheid, JAGB, and TRGB distances in four of these nearby galaxies and allow us to investigate whether the discrepancy noted here is due to ground-based observational systematics, or something intrinsic to the JAGB method relevant for this particular sample. A resolution of this discrepancy is required if the JAGB is to be used to determine a highly precise local value of the Hubble constant.

JWST observations have uncovered a new population of red, compact objects at high redshifts dubbed 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs), which typically show broad emission lines and are thought to be dusty Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Some of their other features, however, challenge the AGN explanation, such as prominent Balmer breaks and extremely faint or even missing metal high-ionization lines, X-ray, or radio emission, including in deep stacks. Time variability is a unique test of AGN activity. Here, we exploit the z=7.045 multiply-imaged LRD A2744-QSO1, which offers a unique test of variability due to lensing-induced time delays between the three images spanning 22 yr (2.7 yr in the rest-frame), to investigate its photometric and spectroscopic variability. We find the equivalent widths (EWs) of the broad H&amp;alpha; and H&amp;beta; lines, which are independent of magnification and other systematics, to exhibit significant variations, up to 18±3 % for H&amp;alpha; and up to 22±8 % in H&amp;beta;, on a timescale of 875 d (2.4 yr) in the rest-frame. This suggests that A2744-QSO1 is indeed an AGN. We find no significant photometric variability beyond the limiting systematic uncertainties, so it currently cannot be determined whether the EW variations are due to line-flux or continuum variability. These results are consistent with a typical damped random walk (DRW) variability model for an AGN like A2744-QSO1 (M_BH=4×10^7 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) given the sparse sampling of the light-curve with the available data. Our results therefore support the AGN interpretation of this LRD, and highlight the need for further photometric and spectroscopic monitoring in order to build a detailed and reliable light-curve.

Nearby blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCDs) share similar properties with objects from the Epoch of Reionization revealed by JWST, in terms of low stellar mass, low metallicity and high specific star-formation rate. Thus, they represent ideal local laboratories for detailed multi-wavelength studies to understand their properties and the mechanisms shaping them. We report the first JWST MIRI/MRS observations of the BCD SBS 0335-052 E, analyzing MIR emission lines tracing different levels of ionization (e.g., [NeII], [SIV], [NeIII], [OIV], [NeV]) of the ionized gas. SBS 0335-052 E MIR emission is characterized by a bright point source, located in one of the youngest and most embedded stellar clusters (t~3 Myr, A_V~20), and underlying extended high-ionization emission (i.e., [OIV], [NeV]) from the surroundings of the older and less dusty stellar clusters (t&amp;lt; 20 Myr, A_V~8). From the comparison with state-of-the-art models, we can exclude shocks, X-ray binaries, and old stellar populations as the main sources of the high ionization. Interestingly, a 4-16% contribution of a ~10^5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; intermediate massive black hole (IMBH) is needed to justify the strong [NeV]/[NeII] and would be consistent with optical/UV line ratios from previous studies. However, even IMBH models cannot explain the strongest [OIV]/[NeIII]. Also, star-forming models (regardless of including X-ray binaries) struggle to reproduce even the lower ionization line ratios (e.g., [SIV]/[NeII]) typically observed in BCDs. Overall, while current models suggest the need to account for an accreting IMBH in this high-z analog, limitations still exist in predicting high-ionization emission lines (I.P. &amp;gt;54 eV) when modeling these low-metallicity environments, thus other sources of ionization cannot be fully ruled out.

Aims: The relative roles of the physical mechanisms involved in quenching galaxy star formation are still unclear. We tackle this fundamental problem with our cosmological semi-empirical model DECODE (Discrete statistical sEmi-empiriCal mODEl), designed to predict galaxy stellar mass assembly histories, from minimal input assumptions. Methods: Specifically, in this work the star formation history of each galaxy is calculated along its progenitor dark matter halo by assigning at each redshift a star formation rate extracted from a monotonic star formation rate-halo accretion rate (SFR-HAR) relation derived from abundance matching between the (observed) SFR function and the (numerically predicted) HAR function, a relation that is also predicted by the TNG100 simulation. SFRs are integrated across cosmic time to build up the mass of galaxies, which may halt their star formation following input physical quenching recipes. Results: In this work we test the popular halo quenching scenario and we find that: 1) the assumption of a monotonic relation between SFR and HAR allows to reproduce the number densities of the bulk of star-forming galaxies in the local Universe; 2) the halo quenching is sufficient to reproduce the statistics of the quenched galaxies and flat (steep) high-mass end of the SMHM relation (SMF); and 3) to align with the observed steep (flat) low-mass end of the SMHM (SMF) additional quenching processes in the least massive haloes are needed. Conclusions: DECODE is an invaluable tool and will pave the way to investigate the origin of newly observed high-redshift objects from the latest ongoing facilities such as JWST and Euclid.

We present first results from James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec), Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), and Keck Cosmic Webb Imager (KCWI) integral field spectroscopy of the powerful but highly obscured host-galaxy of the jetted radio source Cygnus A. We detect 169 infrared emission lines at 1.7&amp;ndash;27 micron and explore the kinematics and physical properties of the extended narrow-line region (NLR) in unprecedented detail. The density-stratified NLR appears to be shaped by the initial blow-out and ongoing interaction of the radio jet with the interstellar medium, creating a multi-phase bicone with a layered structure composed of molecular and ionized gas. The NLR spectrum, with strong coronal emission at kpc-scale, is well-modeled by AGN photoionization. We find evidence that the NLR is rotating around the radio axis, perhaps mediated by magnetic fields and driven by angular momentum transfer from the radio jet. The overall velocity field of the NLR is well described by 250 km/s outflow along biconical spiral flow lines, combining both rotation and outflow signatures. There is particularly bright [Fe II] 1.644 micron emission from a dense, high-velocity dispersion, photoionized clump of clouds found near the projected radio axis. Outflows of 600&amp;ndash;2000 km/s are found in bullets and streamers of ionized gas that may be ablated by the radio jet from these clouds, driving a local outflow rate of 40 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;/yr.

Hierarchical merging of galaxies plays an important role in galaxy formation and evolution. Mergers could trigger key evolutionary phases such as starburst activities and active accretion periods onto supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies. We aim to detect mergers and merger stages (pre- and post-mergers) across cosmic history and test whether it is better to detect mergers and their merger stages simultaneously or hierarchically. In addition, we want to test the impact of merger time relative to the coalescence of merging galaxies. First, we generated realistic mock JWST images of simulated galaxies selected from the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Then we trained deep learning (DL) models in the Zoobot Python package to classify galaxies into merging/non-merging galaxies and their merger stages. We used two different set-ups: (i) two-stage, in which we classify galaxies into mergers and non-mergers and then classify the mergers into pre-mergers and post-mergers, and (ii) one-stage, in which merger/non-merger and merger stages are classified simultaneously. We found that the one-stage classification set-up moderately outperforms the two-stage set-up, offering better overall accuracy and precision, particularly for the non-merger class. Pre-mergers can be classified with the highest precision in both set-ups, possibly due to the more recognisable merging features and the presence of merging companions. The image signal-to-noise ratio affects the performance of the DL classifiers, but not much after a certain threshold is crossed. Both precision and recall of the classifiers depend strongly on merger time, finding it more difficult to identify true mergers observed at stages that are more distant to coalescence. For pre-mergers, we recommend selecting mergers which will merge in the next 0.4 Gyrs, to achieve a good balance between precision and recall.

At cosmic dawn, the first stars and galaxies are believed to form from and be deeply embedded in clouds of dense, pristine gas. Here we present a study of the JWST/NIRSpec data of the most distant, spectroscopically confirmed galaxy observed to date, JADES-GS-z14-0 (GS-z14 for short), at z=14.179, combined with recent far-infrared measurements of the [OIII]-88&amp;mu;m and [CII]-158&amp;mu;m line transitions and underlying dust-continuum emission. Based on the observed prominent damped Lyman-&amp;alpha; (DLA) absorption profile, we determine a substantial neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) column density, log (N_HI / cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = 22.27^+0.08_-0.09, consistent with previous estimates though seemingly at odds with the dynamical and gas mass of the galaxy. Using various independent but complementary approaches, considering the implied neutral gas mass from the DLA measurement, the star-formation rate surface density, and the metal abundance, we demonstrate that the total gas mass of GS-z14 is of the order log (M_gas / M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) = 9.8± 0.3. This implies a substantial gas mass fraction, f_gas ≳ 0.9 and that the bulk of the interstellar medium (ISM) is in the form of HI. We show that the derived gas mass is fully consistent with the non-detection of [CII]-158&amp;mu;m, assuming an appropriate scaling to the neutral gas. The low dust-to-gas ratio, A_V/N_HI = (1.3± 0.6)× 10^-23 mag cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, derived in the line-of-sight through the DLA further indicates that the absorbing gas is more pristine than the central, star-forming regions probed by the [OIII]-88&amp;mu;m emission. These results highlight the implications for far-infrared line-detection searchers attainable with ALMA and demonstrate that the bright, relatively massive galaxy GS-z14 at z=14.179 is deeply embedded in a substantial, pristine HI gas reservoir dominating its baryonic matter content.

The selection of candidate high-redshift galaxies using the dropout technique targeting the Lyman-break signature sometimes results in very bright objects, which would be too luminous to be easily explained if they are indeed at the expected redshifts. Here we present a systematic study of very bright dropouts selected through successive bands of the NIRCam instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Using the public NIRCam data in four blank fields over 500~arcmin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 300 such objects were found. They have magnitudes in F356W &amp;lt;25.1~mag or &amp;lt;26.0~mag depending on the dropout passband, and the vast majority of them (&amp;gt;80&amp;percnt;) have very red F115W-F356W colors &amp;gt; 2.0~mag, which make them qualify as "extremely red objects'' (EROs). We focus on the 137 objects that also have mid-IR observations from the JWST MIRI instrument. The analysis of their spectral energy distributions shows that these very bright dropouts are dominated by low-redshift (z~ 1&amp;ndash;4) galaxies (≳ 67&amp;percnt;). However, a non-negligible fraction (≳ 7&amp;percnt;) could be at high redshifts. Seven of our objects have secure spectroscopic redshifts from the JWST NIRSpec identifications, and the results confirm this picture: while six are low-redshift galaxies at z≈ 3, one is a known galaxy at z=8.679 recovered in our sample. If more objects from our sample are confirmed to be at high redshifts, they could pose a severe challenge in explaining their properties, such as the extremely high star formation rates and stellar masses.

&lt;p&gt;
Synergies between the  James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST) and the  Chandra X-ray observatory have advanced the observational frontier by detecting a handful of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) beyond z ~ 10. In particular, the recent discovery of a candidate 8 × 10^7~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; black hole (BH) in the galaxy GHZ9 at z = 10.4 favors massive seed formation channels for these objects. Motivated by prospects for their detection in radio by recent studies, we estimate radio fluxes for GHZ9 and explore the possibility of their detection with the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) and next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA). We find that ngVLA should be able to detect radio emission from GHZ9 for integration times as short as 1 hr while SKA will require integration times of up to 100 hr. We also find that radio emission from the BH can be distinguished from that due to H II regions and supernovae in its host galaxy. The detection of a few hundred nJy radio signal at frequencies &amp;gt; 2 GHz will be a smoking gun for the presence of a BH in GHZ9.

&lt;p&gt;
The J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) is an overdensity of stars in the near-infrared, attributed to carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars, and recently used as a standard candle for measuring extragalactic distances and the Hubble constant. Using JWST in Cycle 2, we extend JAGB measurements to 6 hosts of 9 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) (NGC 2525, NGC 3147, NGC 3370, NGC 3447, NGC 5468, and NGC 5861), with two at D ~ 40 Mpc, all calibrated by the maser host NGC 4258. We investigate the effects of incompleteness and find that we are unable to recover a robust JAGB measurement in one of the two most distant hosts at R ~ 40 Mpc, NGC 3147. We compile all JWST JAGB observations in SNe Ia hosts, 15 galaxies hosting 18 SNe Ia, from the SH0ES and CCHP programs and employ all literature measures (mode, mean, median, model). We find no significant mean difference between these distances and those from HST Cepheids, -0.03±0.02 (stat) ± 0.05 (sys) mag. We find a difference of 0.11 ± 0.02 mag between JAGB mode measurements in the CCHP analyses of two fields in NGC 4258, a feature also seen in two SH0ES fields (see field-to-field variations in Li et al. 2024a), indicating significant field-to-field variation of JAGB measurements in NGC 4258 which produce a large absolute calibration uncertainty. Variations are also seen in the shape of the JAGB LF across galaxies so that different measures produce different values of the Hubble constant. We look for but do not (yet) find a standardizing relation between JAGB LF skew or color dependence and the apparent variation. Using the middle result of all JAGB measures to calibrate SNe Ia yields a Hubble constant of H_0 = 73.3 ± 1.4 (stat) ± 2.0 (sys) km/s/Mpc with the systematic dominated by apparent differences across NGC 4258 calibrating fields or their measures.

We present a MIRI-MRS spectrum of the high-inclination protoplanetary disk around the solar-mass (K0) star MY Lup, obtained as part of the JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey (JDISCS). The spectrum shows an unusually weak water emission spectrum for a disk around a star of its spectral type, but strong emission from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, HCN, and isotopologues of both molecules. This includes the first ever detection of C^18O^16O and H^13CN in an inner disk, as well as tentative detections of C^17O^16O and HC^15N. Slab modeling provides molecular temperatures, column densities and emitting areas of the detected molecules. The emitting molecular gas is cold compared to that of other observed protoplanetary disk spectra. We estimate the isotopologue ratios of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and HCN, albeit with significant uncertainty. We suggest that the unusual spectrum of MY Lup arises from a combination of inner disk clearing, which removes emission from warm water, and its nearly edge-on inclination, which enhances line-of-sight column densities, although unusual chemistry may also be required. MY Lup's spectrum highlights the potential to detect and measure trace isotopologues to study isotopic fractionation in protoplanetary disks; observations at higher spectral resolving power is needed to constrain the isotopologue ratios to greater precision.

With its peculiar appearance, I Zw 18 has long been considered a unique example of a young galaxy in the nearby Universe. In this paper, we summarize the observational history of this famous galaxy, discuss the controversies surrounding its evolutionary state, and present new insights gained from JWST/NIRCam observations. These recent findings shed light on one of the most intriguing mysteries in extragalactic astronomy.

We present analyses of a nitrogen-enriched star-forming galaxy, ID60001, at z=4.6928 based on JWST/NIRSpec MSA spectroscopy and NIRCam photometry. From rest-frame optical emission lines we derive the nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) abundance ratio of ID60001 to be log(N/O)=-0.76_-0.03^+0.03 ([N/O]=0.10_-0.03^+0.03), which is significantly elevated at the corresponding metallicity 12+log(O/H)=7.75_-0.01^+0.01 (Z/Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.12) compared to local counterparts. We discuss possible scenarios for elevated N/O abundance in ID60001, including pristine gas inflow, Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, and Oxygen depletion by Type II supernova winds. Based on the moderately broadened He\sc ii&amp;lambda;4686 emission line, galaxy morphology, and star-formation history, we conclude that the elevated N/O abundance of ID60001 is likely originated from massive (&amp;gt;25 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) WR stars that directly collapse into a black hole. We also stress the importance of reliable electron density measurements when deriving N/O abundance with rest-frame optical emission lines.

A distinct power-law break is apparent m_AB approximately 21 in the deep Near-Infrared PEARLS-JWST galaxy counts. The break becomes more pronounced at longer wavelengths, with the counts slope flattening smoothly with apparent magnitude in the shortest band used at 0.9 microns, trending towards an increasingly broken slope by the longest wavelength passband of JWST NIRCam, 4.4 microns. This behaviour is remarkably well predicted by the GALFORM semi-analytical model of galaxy formation. We use the model to diagnose the origin of this behaviour. We find that the features that are responsible for the break are: 1) the inherent break in the luminosity function; 2) the change in the volume element with redshift and 3) the redshift-dependent nature of the k-correction. We study the contribution to these effects by early and late-type galaxies, using as a proxy for morphology the bulge-to-total stellar mass ratio. We find that the way in which ellipticals populate the bright end of the luminosity function while spirals dominate the faint end is preserved in the galaxy number counts, with a characteristic stellar mass at the break of approximately 10^10 M_sun. We also find that the shape of the number counts is mainly driven by galaxies with relatively low redshift (z &amp;lt; 2) for the PEARLS observational limit of m_AB &amp;lt; 28. We give a comprehensive description of why the galaxy number counts in the near-infrared PEARLS-JWST observation look the way they do and which population of galaxies is dominant at each apparent magnitude.

The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope has revealed a wealth of new galaxies just a few hundred Myr after the Big Bang. Some of these galaxies exhibit unusual elemental abundances that are difficult to explain with stellar populations today. While Wolf-Rayet stars in multiple-burst populations, very massive or rapidly-rotating primordial stars, general relativistic explosions of metal-enriched supermassive stars, or the precursors of globular clusters can in principle account for the supersolar nitrogen to oxygen ratios in the galaxies GN-z11 and CEERS 1019, no known stars or supernovae can explain the far higher N/O ratio of 0.46 in GS 3073 at redshift z = 5.55. Here we show that the extreme nitrogen abundances in GS 3073 can be produced by 1000 - 10,000 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; primordial (Pop III) stars. We find that these are the only candidates that can account for its large N/O ratios and its C/O and Ne/O ratios. GS 3073 is thus the first conclusive evidence in the fossil abundance record of the existence of supermassive Pop III stars at cosmic Dawn.

The unprecedented sensitivity of the itJames Webb Space Telescope (itJWST) has revolutionized our understanding of the early universe. Among the most intriguing itJWST discoveries are red, very compact objects showing broad line emission features nicknamed as little red dots (LRDs). The discovery of LRDs has triggered great interest about their origin as either extremely starbursting galaxies or highly-obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN). Their exact nature still remains unknown. The goal of this work is to estimate the radio emission from LRDs and predict which radio surveys would detect them. To achieve these objectives, we employ the fundamental plane of black hole (BH) accretion to estimate radio emission from AGN and the stellar radio fluxes from their host galaxies. We assume a range of BH mass, X-ray luminosity (L_X) and star formation rate (SFR) to bracket the likely properties of LRDs. Our findings suggest that BH radio fluxes from LRDs are 10-100 times higher than the stellar fluxes from their host galaxies, depending on BH mass, L_X and SFR. The detection of a ~ 500 nJy signal above 2 GHz at z ≥ 5 or a ~ 2000 nJy flux at z = 3-4 would be a smoking gun for the presence of AGN provided that SFRs in the host galaxies are &amp;lt; 30~ M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; ~yr^-1. We find that LRDs are most likely radio quiet AGN otherwise would have been already detected in the current radio surveys. Our findings suggest that LRDs can be detected with the upcoming radio observatories such as ngVLA and SKA with integration times of 10-100 hrs, respectively.

Cosmic reionization represents the latest phase transition of the intergalactic medium (IGM) in the Universe. It has long been debated whether galaxies or active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are the major source of Lyman continuum (LyC) photons responsible for reionization. Previous observations slightly favored galaxies as the major ionizing source. However, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) recently discovered an unexpectedly high density of AGN candidates at high redshift, which has largely enhanced the influence of AGNs. Here we derive a definitive upper bound on the AGN contribution to reionization using the latest JWST data, and conclusively rule out AGNs as the dominant ionizing source during the epoch of reionization (EoR). We build a sample of objects (including galaxies and AGNs) in a specific redshift range between 7.15 and 7.75 that has a high completeness. Each object is then decomposed into a point-source component and an extended component in their rest-frame far-UV JWST images. Assuming all point-source components are AGNs, we obtain an absolute upper limit for the density of the AGN population. This fiducial AGN sample reaches an unprecedentedly low luminosity of M_UV ≈ -15 mag. Based on this sample, we find that AGNs can contribute at most one third of the LyC photons required to ionize the Universe in this redshift range. Our result implies that galaxies dominate the ionizing source during the EoR.

&lt;p&gt;
The phase space of stellar streams is proposed to detect dark substructure in the Milky Way through the perturbations created by passing subhalos - and thus is a powerful test of the cold dark matter paradigm and its alternatives. Using graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) data compression and simulation-based inference (SBI) on a simulated GD-1-like stream, we improve the constraint on the mass of a [10^8, 10^7, 10^6] M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; perturbing subhalo by factors of [11, 7, 3] with respect to the current state-of-the-art density power spectrum analysis. We find that the GCNN produces posteriors that are more accurate (better calibrated) than the power spectrum. We simulate the positions and velocities of stars in a GD-1-like stream and perturb the stream with subhalos of varying mass and velocity. Leveraging the feature encoding of the GCNN to compress the input phase space data, we then use SBI to estimate the joint posterior of the subhalo mass and velocity. We investigate how our results scale with the size of the GCNN, the coordinate system of the input and the effect of incomplete observations. Our results suggest that a survey with 10 × fewer stars (300 stars) with complete 6-D phase space data performs about as well as a deeper survey (3000 stars) with only 3-D data (photometry, spectroscopy). The stronger constraining power and more accurate posterior estimation motivate further development of GCNNs in combining future photometric, spectroscopic and astrometric stream observations.

We use JWST Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) observations from the the Cosmic Evolution Early Release survey (CEERS), GLASS-JWST ERS (GLASS), and JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) to measure rest-frame optical emission-line ratios of 90 galaxies at z&amp;gt;4. The stacked spectra of galaxies with and without a broad-line feature reveal a difference in the [OIII]&amp;lambda; 4363 and H&amp;gamma; ratios. This motivated our investigation of the [OIII]/H&amp;gamma; vs [NeIII]/[OII] diagram. We define two AGN/SF classification lines based on 1869 SDSS galaxies at z~0. After applying a redshift correction to the AGN/SF lines we find 76.8% of BLAGN continue to land in the AGN region of the diagnostic largely due to the [NeIII]/[OII] ratio. However, 40.2% of non-BLAGN land in the AGN region as well, this could be due to star forming galaxies having harder ionization of there are narrow line AGN which are not accounted for. This indicates the potential of the [NeIII]/[OII] ratio to continue classifying galaxies to z~6. We further inspect galaxies without broad emission lines in each region of [OIII]/H&amp;gamma; vs [NeIII]/[OII] diagram and found that they have slightly stronger CIII]&amp;lambda;1908 fluxes and equivalent width when landing in the BLAGN region. However, the cause of this higher ionization is unclear. Additionally, we find that BLAGN are characterized by a higher ionization (at constant electron temperature) compared to non-broad line galaxies.

Recent work with JWST has demonstrated its capability to identify and chemically characterize multiple populations in globular clusters down to the H-burning limit. In this study, we explore the kinematics of multiple populations in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae by combining data from JWST, HST, and Gaia. We analyzed velocity dispersion and anisotropy profiles from the cluster center out to ~10R_h. Our findings indicate that while 1G stars are isotropic, 2G stars are significantly radially anisotropic. These results align with the predictions of simulations of the dynamical evolution of clusters where 2G stars are initially more centrally concentrated than 1G stars. Furthermore, we subdivided the 2G population into two subpopulations: 2G_A and 2G_B, with the latter being more chemically extreme. We compared their dynamical profiles and found no significant differences. For the first time, we measured the degree of energy equipartition among the multiple populations of 47 Tucanae. Overall, within the analyzed radial range (~2-4R_h), both populations exhibit a low degree of energy equipartition. The most significant differences between 1G and 2G stars are observed in the tangential velocity component, where 2G stars are characterized by a stronger degree of energy equipartition than 1G stars. In the radial component, the behavior of 1G and 2G stars is more variable, with differences largely dependent on radius. Finally, our analysis reveals that the ratio of rotational velocity to velocity dispersion is larger for the 2G population, while 1G stars exhibit higher skewness in their tangential proper motions, providing further evidence of differences in the kinematic properties of the 1G and 2G populations.

Carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet binaries are a prominent source of carbonaceous dust that contribute to the dust budget of galaxies. The "textbook" example of an episodic dust producing WR binary, WR140 (HD193793), provides us with an ideal laboratory for investigating the dust physics and kinematics in an extreme environment. This study is among the first to utilize two separate JWST observations, from Cycle 1 ERS (July 2022) and Cycle 2 (Sept. 2023), to measure WR140's dust kinematics and confirm its morphology. To measure the proper motions and projected velocities of the dust shells, we performed a novel PSF subtraction to reduce the effects of the bright diffraction spikes and carefully aligned the Cycle 2 to the Cycle 1 images. At 7.7 &amp;mu;m, through the bright feature common to 16 dust shells (C1), we find an average dust shell proper motion of 390±29 mas yr^-1, which equates to a projected velocity of 2714±188 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; at a distance of 1.64 kpc. Our measured speeds are constant across all visible shells and consistent with previously reported dust expansion velocities. Our observations not only prove that these dusty shells are astrophysical (i.e., not associated with any PSF artifact) and originate from WR140, but also confirm the "clumpy" morphology of the dust shells, in which identifiable substructures within certain shells persist for at least 14 months from one cycle to the next. These results support the hypothesis that clumping in the wind collision region is required for dust production in WR binaries.

The field of high redshift galaxy formation has been revolutionised by JWST, which is yielding unprecedented insights on galaxy assembly at early times. Our key aim is to study the physical mechanisms that can explain the unexpected abundance of bright galaxies at z ≥ 11, as well as their metal enrichment and spectral properties. We also use recent data to determine the key sources of reionisation. To do so, we implement cold gas fractions and star formation efficiencies derived from the SPHINX20 high-resolution radiation-hydrodynamics simulation into DELPHI, a semi-analytic model that tracks the assembly of dark matter halos and their baryonic components from z ~ 4.5-40. In addition, we explore two different methodologies to boost galaxy luminosities at z ≥ 11: a stellar initial mass function (IMF) that becomes increasingly top-heavy with decreasing metallicity and increasing redshift (eIMF model), and star formation efficiencies that increase with increasing redshift (eSFE model). Our key findings are: (i) both the eIMF and eSFE models can explain the abundance of bright galaxies at z ≥ 11; (ii) dust attenuation plays an important role for the bright-end of the UV LF at z ≤ 11; (iii) the mass-metallicity relation is in place as early as z ~ 17 in all models although its slope is model-dependent; (iv) within the spread of both models and observations, all of our models are in good agreement with current estimates of &amp;beta; slopes at z ~ 5-17 and Balmer break strengths at z ~ 6-10; (v) in the eIMF model, galaxies at z≥12 or with M_UV≥-18 show values of  &amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt;  ~ 10^25.55~[Hz~erg^-1], twice larger than in other models; (vi) star formation in galaxies below 10^9 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; is the key driver of reionisation, providing the bulk (~ 85&amp;percnt;) of ionising photons down to its midpoint at z ~ 7.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revolutionizing our understanding of the Universe by unveiling faint, near-infrared dropouts previously beyond our reach, ranging from exceptionally dusty sources to galaxies up to redshift z ~ 14. In this paper, we identify F200W-dropout objects in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey which are absent from existing catalogs. Our selection method can effectively identify obscured low-mass (log M_* ≤ 9) objects at z ≤ 6, massive dust-rich sources up to z ~ 12, and ultra-high-redshift (z &amp;gt; 15) candidates. Primarily relying on NIRCam photometry from the latest CEERS data release and supplementing with Mid-Infrared/(sub-)mm data when available, our analysis pipeline combines multiple SED-fitting codes, star formation histories, and CosMix - a novel tool for astronomical stacking. Our work highlights three 2&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;3 dusty dwarf galaxies which have larger masses compared to the typical dusty dwarfs previously identified in CEERS. Additionally, we reveal five faint sources with significant probability of lying above z&amp;gt;15, with best-fit masses compatible with &amp;Lambda;CDM and a standard baryons-to-star conversion efficiency. Their bi-modal redshift probability distributions suggest they could also be z&amp;lt;1.5 dwarf galaxies with extreme dust extinction. We also identify a strong line emitter galaxy at z ~ 5 mimicking the near-infrared emission of a z ~ 13 galaxy. Our sample holds promising candidates for future follow-ups. Confirming ultra high-redshift galaxies or lower-z dusty dwarfs will offer valuable insights into early galaxy formation, evolution with their central black holes and the nature of dark matter, and/or cosmic dust production mechanisms in low-mass galaxies, and will help us to understand degeneracies and contamination in high-z object searches.

In response to recent observations from JWST and ALMA, we explore a new class of dynamically self-consistent models using our AGAMA/Ramses hydrodynamic N-body framework (Nexus) that mimics a plausible progenitor of the Milky Way over a wide range of disc gas fractions (f_gas = 0-100&amp;percnt;). The high gas surface densities encourage vigorous star formation, which in turn couples with the gas to drive turbulence. We show that this coupling through momentum recoil drives 'baryon sloshing,' i.e. a random walk of the baryonic potential minimum with respect to the centre of the total gravitational potential, &amp;Phi;_tot. The amplitude of the bulk motion depends on the strength of the feedback, which in turn is directly associated with f_gas. At its most extreme, when gas is the sole contributor to the disc potential (f_gas=100%), the amplitude of the walk can reach up to R≈ 5 kpc and  &amp;vert;  z &amp;vert;  ≈ 1 kpc within &amp;Phi;_tot(R,&amp;phi;,z). Consistent with observations, the disc dominates over dark matter (f_disc≳ 50%) within R_s=2.2 R_disc, where R_disc is the exponential disc scale length. For a lower f_disc and/or f_gas, the 3D sloshing amplitude and velocity are reduced. The combination of strong feedback (which unbinds the disc) and sloshing leads to the newly formed stars being dynamically heated and settling to a more spatially extended disc population. The 3D heating process is isotropic but its effects are more noticeable in  &amp;vert;  z &amp;vert;  due to the initial dynamical coldness of the star-forming disc. Such a disc has enhanced [&amp;alpha;/Fe] stellar abundances and a vertical (but no radial) gradient in stellar age and metallicity, both consistent with the Milky Way's thick stellar disc. Contrary to earlier claims, star formation in a stationary turbulent disc does not produce thick stellar discs.

We present a morphological analysis of ALMA and JWST NIRCam images of nine dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at zspec=3.09, all embedded within the cosmic web filaments at the SSA22 proto-cluster core. The ALMA 870um and 1.1mm images are obtained at spatial resolutions ranging from 0.5" to 0.05" (350 pc at z=3.09). The high-resolution images enable us to resolve inner structures traced by dust continuum, identifying compact dusty cores, clumps, and offset ridges within bars. Sersic profile fit was performed for both ALMA 870um and NIRCam F444W images at comparable resolutions (0.15"). The Sersic index measured for 870um, masking bright regions, indicates values close to unity, suggesting that dust emission arises from disks with superimposed compact core components. For the JWST F444W images (restframe 1um), the Sersic indices range between nF444W = 1-3, pointing to the coexistence of bulges and stellar disks in these DSFGs. A comparison of dust mass surface density, nF444W, and F200W-F444W color (restframe 0.5-1um) reveals diversity among the DSFGs, likely reflecting different evolutionary stages including some DSFGs with red cores, indicating ongoing rapid bulge growth phases heavily obscured by dust. The predominantly disk-like morphologies observed in most DSFGs in the proto-cluster core contrast sharply with early-type morphologies that dominate the highest density environment in the local universe. This suggests that we are witnessing the early formation of the morphology-density relation, as massive galaxies undergo rapid growth as late-type galaxies fueled by cosmic web gas filaments.

Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are a key component of galaxy evolution due to feedback on the host from its supermassive black hole. The morphology of warm, in- and outflowing dusty material can reveal the nature of the onset of feedback, AGN feeding, and the unified model of AGN. Here we use the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) to image the dense, obscuring disk and extended dusty outflow region of NGC 1068. In Fizeau imaging mode the LBTI synthesizes the equivalent resolution of a 22.8 m telescope. The 8.7 &amp;mu;m Fizeau images of NGC 1068 have an effective resolution of 47×90 mas (3.3×6.2 pc) in a 5" field of view after performing PSF deconvolution techniques described here. This is the only extragalactic source to be Fizeau imaged using the LBTI, and the images bridge the scales measured with the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI; 0.5-5 pc) and those of single telescopes such as JWST and Keck (&amp;gt;15 pc). The images detect and spatially resolve the low surface brightness mid-infrared (MIR) features in the AGN disk/wind region that are over-resolved by the VLTI. The images show strong correlation between MIR dust emission and near-infrared (NIR) emission of highly excited atomic lines observed by SINFONI. Such LBTI imaging is a precursor to infrared imaging using the upcoming generation of extremely large telescopes, with angular resolutions up to 6x better than JWST, the largest space telescope in orbit.

&lt;p&gt;
We perform an MMT/Hectospec redshift survey of the North Ecliptic Pole Wide (NEPW) field covering 5.4 square degrees, and use it to estimate the photometric redshifts for the sources without spectroscopic redshifts. By combining 2572 newly measured redshifts from our survey with existing data from the literature, we create a large sample of 4421 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the NEPW field. Using this sample, we estimate photometric redshifts of 77755 sources in the band-merged catalog of the NEPW field with a random forest model. The estimated photometric redshifts are generally consistent with the spectroscopic redshifts, with a dispersion of 0.028, an outlier fraction of 7.3%, and a bias of -0.01. We find that the standard deviation of the prediction from each decision tree in the random forest model can be used to infer the fraction of catastrophic outliers and the measurement uncertainties. We test various combinations of input observables, including colors and magnitude uncertainties, and find that the details of these various combinations do not change the prediction accuracy much. As a result, we provide a catalog of 77755 sources in the NEPW field, which includes both spectroscopic and photometric redshifts up to z~2. This dataset has significant legacy value for studies in the NEPW region, especially with upcoming space missions such as JWST, Euclid, and SPHEREx.

&lt;p&gt;
The recent detections of a large number of candidate active galactic nuclei at high redshift (i.e. z ≳ 4) has increased speculation that heavy seed massive black hole formation may be a required pathway. Here we re-implement the so-called Lyman-Werner (LW) channel model of Dijkstra et al. (2014) to calculate the expected number density of massive black holes formed through this channel. We further enhance this model by extracting information relevant to the model from the ttRenaissance simulation suite. ttRenaissance is a high-resolution suite of simulations ideally positioned to probe the high-z universe. Finally, we compare the LW-only channel against other models in the literature. We find that the LW-only channel results in a peak number density of massive black holes of approximately 10^-4  cMpc^-3 at z ~ 10. Given the growth requirements and the duty cycle of active galactic nuclei, this means that the LW-only is likely incompatible with recent JWST measurements and can, at most, be responsible for only a small subset of high-z active galactic nuclei. Other models from the literature seem therefore better positioned, at present, to explain the high frequency of massive black holes at high z.

&lt;p&gt;
We present a comprehensive study of the large-scale structure, jet and outflow morphology, and kinematics of the Class 0/I protostellar binary Ced 110 IRS4, using JWST NIRCam (F150W and F410M) and MIRI MRS observations from the JWST ERC program IceAge, along with ALMA data from the Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) program. NIRCam images, combined with ALMA continuum and CO data, reveal arc-like structures (~1100 au), suggesting a dense envelope around the protostars. We detect disk shadows from both protostars in F150W. The MIRI MRS IFU data reveal a jet from both protostars in multiple [Fe II] lines, [Ar II] 6.99 &amp;mu;m and [Ne II] 12.81 &amp;mu;m, marking the first detection of a jet from the system. The [Fe II] (5.34 &amp;mu;m) jet from Ced 110 IRS4A has a width of ≤ 51~au at the protostellar location, with a large opening angle of 23\arcdeg ± 4\arcdeg. After inclination correction, the jet velocity is 124 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, corresponding to a dynamical timescale of 25 years. The molecular H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; outflow displays a distinct morphology resembling two hemispheres placed back-to-back. The consistent H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission extent across transitions, differing from previous observations of protostellar outflows detected with JWST, suggests that MHD disk winds may not drive the observed outflow. We find that the upper limit to the width of the outflow at the protostellar location is 130 ± 10 au which is smaller than the disk diameter of 183.4 ± 0.4 au but much larger than the width of the [Fe II] jet.

&lt;p&gt;
Radiation pressure is a key mechanism by which stellar feedback disrupts molecular clouds and drives HII region expansion. This includes direct radiation pressure exerted by UV photons on dust grains, pressure associated with photoionization, and infrared (IR) radiation pressure on grains due to dust-reprocessed IR photons. We present a new method that combines high resolution mid-IR luminosities from JWST-MIRI, optical attenuation and nebular line measurements from VLT-MUSE, and HST H&amp;alpha;-based region sizes to estimate the strength of radiation pressure in ≈ 18,000 HII regions across 19 nearby star-forming galaxies. This is the most extensive and direct estimate of these terms beyond the Local Group to date. In the disks of galaxies, we find that the total reprocessed IR pressure is on average 5% of the direct UV radiation pressure. This fraction rises to 10% in galaxy centers. We expect reprocessed IR radiation pressure to dominate over UV radiation pressure in regions where L_F2100W/L_H&amp;alpha;^corr ≳ 75. Radiation pressure due to H ionizations is lower than pressure on dust in our sample, but appears likely to dominate the radiation pressure budget in dwarf galaxies similar to the Small Magellanic Cloud. The contribution from all radiation pressure terms appears to be subdominant compared to thermal pressure from ionized gas, reinforcing the view that radiation pressure is most important in compact, heavily embedded, and young regions.

&lt;p&gt;
Brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) lie deep within the largest gravitationally bound structures in existence. Though some cluster finding techniques identify the position of the BCG and use it as the cluster center, other techniques may not automatically include these coordinates. This can make studying BCGs in such surveys difficult, forcing researchers to either adopt oversimplified algorithms or perform cumbersome visual identification. For large surveys, there is a need for a fast and reliable way of obtaining BCG coordinates. We propose machine learning to accomplish this task and train a neural network to identify positions of candidate BCGs given no more information than multiband photometric images. We use both mock observations from The Three Hundred project and real ones from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and we quantify the performance. Training on simulations yields a squared correlation coefficient, R^2, between predictions and ground truth of R^2 ≈ 0.94 when testing on simulations, which decreases to R^2 ≈ 0.60 when testing on real data due to discrepancies between datasets. Limiting the application of this method to real clusters more representative of the training data, such those with a BCG r-band magnitude r_BCG ≤ 16.5, yields R^2 ≈ 0.99. The method performs well up to a redshift of at least z≈ 0.6. We find this technique to be a promising method to automate and accelerate the identification of BCGs in large datasets.

&lt;p&gt;
We introduce a prescription for estimating the flux of the 7.7 micron and 11.3 micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features from broadband JWST/MIRI images. Probing PAH flux with MIRI imaging data has advantages in field of view, spatial resolution, and sensitivity compared with MIRI spectral maps, but comparisons with spectra are needed to calibrate these flux estimations over a wide variety of environments. For 267 MIRI/MRS spectra from independent regions in the four luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) in the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS) early release science program, we derive synthetic filter photometry and directly compare estimated PAH fluxes to those measured from detailed spectral fits. We find that for probing PAH 7.7 micron, the best combination of filters is F560W, F770W, and either F1500W or F2100W, and the best for PAH 11.3 micron is F560W, F1000W, F1130W, and F1500W. The prescription with these combinations yields predicted flux densities that typically agree with values from spectral decomposition within ~7% and ~5% for PAH 7.7 and 11.3 micron, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;
We investigate the dust mass build-up and star formation efficiency of two galaxies at z&amp;gt;12, GHZ2 and GS-z14-0, by combining ALMA and JWST observations with an analytical model that assumes dust at thermal equilibrium. We obtained 3&amp;sigma; constraints on dust mass of log M_dust/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;5.0 and &amp;lt;5.3, respectively. These constraints are in tension with a high dust condensation efficiency in stellar ejecta but are consistent with models with a short metal accretion timescale at z&amp;gt;12. Given the young stellar ages of these galaxies (t_age~10 Myrs), dust grain growth via accretion may still be ineffective at this stage, though it likely works efficiently to produce significant dust in galaxies at z~7. The star formation efficiencies, defined as the SFR divided by molecular gas mass, reach ~10 Gyr^-1 in a 10 Myr timescale, aligning with the expected redshift evolution of `starburst' galaxies with efficiencies that are ~0.5&amp;ndash;1 dex higher than those in main-sequence galaxies. This starburst phase seems to be common in UV-bright galaxies at z&amp;gt;12 and is likely associated with the unique conditions of the early phases of galaxy formation, such as bursty star formation and/or negligible feedback from super-Eddington accretion. Direct observations of molecular gas tracers like [CII] will be crucial to further understanding the nature of bright galaxies at z&amp;gt;12.

&lt;p&gt;
We investigate the variability of the UV luminosity function (UVLF) at z &amp;gt; 5 using the SPICE suite of cosmological, radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, which include three distinct supernova (SN) feedback models: bursty-sn, smooth-sn, and hyper-sn. The bursty-sn model, driven by intense and episodic SN explosions, produces the highest fluctuations in the star formation rate (SFR). Conversely, the smooth-sn model, characterized by gentler SN feedback, results in minimal SFR variability. The hyper-sn model, featuring a more realistic prescription that incorporates hypernova (HN) explosions, exhibits intermediate variability, closely aligning with the smooth-sn trend at lower redshifts. These fluctuations in SFR significantly affect the M_UV - M_halo relation, a proxy for UVLF variability. Among the models, bursty-sn produces the highest UVLF variability, with a maximum value of 2.5. In contrast, the smooth-sn and hyper-sn models show substantially lower variability, with maximum values of 1.3 and 1.5, respectively. However, in all cases, UVLF variability strongly correlates with host halo mass, with lower-mass halos showing greater variability due to more effective SN feedback in their shallower gravitational wells. The bursty-sn model, though, results in higher amplitudes. Variability decreases in lower mass haloes with decreasing redshift for all feedback models. This study underscores the critical role of SN feedback in shaping the UVLF, and highlights the mass and redshift dependence of its variability, suggesting that UVLF variability may alleviate the bright galaxy tension observed by JWST at high redshifts.

Utilising JWST, ALMA and the VLA we present high angular resolution (0.06''- 0.42''), multi-wavelength (4 micron - 3cm) observations of the VLA 1623-2417 protostellar system to characterise the origin, morphology and, properties of the continuum emission. JWST observations at 4.4 micron reveal outflow cavities for VLA 1623 A and, for the first time, VLA 1623 B, as well as scattered light from the upper layers of the VLA 1623 W disk. We model the millimetre-centimetre spectral energy distributions to quantify the relative contributions of dust and ionised gas emission, calculate dust masses, and use spectral index maps to determine where optical depth hinders this analysis. In general, all objects appear to be optically thick down to ~90 GHz, show evidence for significant amounts (10's - 100's M_Earth) of large (&amp;gt;1 mm) dust grains, and are dominated by ionised gas emission for frequencies ≲15 GHz. In addition, we find evidence of unsettled millimetre dust in the inclined disk of VLA 1623 B possibly attributed to instabilities within the circumstellar disk, adding to the growing catalogue of unsettled Class 0/I disks. Our results represent some of the highest resolution observations possible with current instrumentation, particularly in the case of the VLA. However, our interpretation is still limited at low frequencies (≲22 GHz) and thus motivates the need for next-generation interferometers operating at centimetre wavelengths.

Stellar feedback is an essential step in the baryon cycle of galaxies, but it remains unconstrained beyond Cosmic Noon. We study the ionized gas kinematics, dynamical mass and gas-flow properties of a sample of 16 sub-L^&amp;sext; star-forming galaxies at 4≤ z≤7.6, using high-resolution JWST/NIRSpec observations. The emission lines are resolved, with velocity dispersions (&amp;sigma;_gas ~(km~s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)≃38-96) comparable to more massive galaxies at Cosmic Noon. From &amp;sigma;_gas and the galaxy size (r_e=400-960~pc), we estimate the dynamical mass to be log M_dyn/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;=9.25-10.25. Stellar-to-dynamical mass ratios are low (log M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M_dyn\in[-0.5,-2]) and decrease with increasing SFR surface density (&amp;Sigma;_SFR). We estimate the gas surface densities assuming a star-formation law, but the gas masses do not balance the baryon-to-dynamical mass ratios, which would require a decrease in the star-formation efficiency. We find evidence of ionized outflows in five out of the sixteen galaxies, based on the need of broad components to reproduce the emission-line wings. We only observe outflows from galaxies undergoing recent bursts of star formation SFR_10/SFR_100≥1, with elevated &amp;Sigma;_SFR and low M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M_dyn. This links high gas surface densities to increased outflow incidence and lower M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M_dyn. With moderate outflow velocities (v_flow ~(km~s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)=150-250) and mass outflow rates (M&amp;#775;_flow/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1=0.2-5), these high-redshift galaxies appear more efficient at removing baryons than low-redshift galaxies with similar M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;, showing mass loading-factors of M&amp;#775;_flow/SFR=0.04-0.4. For their given dynamical mass, the outflow velocities exceed the escape velocities, meaning that they may eventually enrich the Circumgalactic Medium.

We conduct the first systematic survey of a total of eleven optical coronal lines in the spectra of a large sample of low redshift (z &amp;lt; 0.8) Type 1 quasars observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that strong coronal line emission is rare in SDSS even in Type 1 quasars; only 885 out of 19,508 (4.5%) galaxies show at least one coronal line, with higher ionization potential lines (&amp;gt;100eV) being even rarer. The [Ne V] &amp;lambda;3426 line, which constitutes the majority of detections, is strongly correlated with the bolometric luminosity. These findings suggest that the optical coronal lines are significantly suppressed in the majority of local AGNs, possibly as a result of the presence of dust in the emitting regions. We find that the incidence of ionized outflows is significantly higher in coronal line emitters compared with non-coronal line emitters, possibly suggesting that dust destruction in outflows enhances coronal line emission in AGNs. Many coronal lines show line profiles that are broader than those of narrow lines, and are blue-shifted relative the lower ionization potential lines, suggesting outflows in the highly ionized gas. Given the limited number of detections, we do not find any statistically significant trends of detection statistics, or line ratios with black hole mass, Eddington ratio, or AGN bolometric luminosity. The catalog is publicly available and can provide a useful database of the coronal line properties of low redshift quasars that can be compared to the growing number of high-z AGNs discovered by JWST.

Globular clusters (GCs) are among the oldest and most luminous stellar systems in the Universe, offering unique insights into galaxy formation and evolution. While the physical processes behind their origin have long remained elusive, major theoretical and observational developments in the past decade have led to a new understanding of GCs as the natural outcome of high-pressure star formation in high-redshift galaxies. This review synthesizes recent advancements in our understanding of GC formation and aims to provide a comprehensive point of reference for leveraging the revolutionary capabilities of the current and upcoming generation of telescopes. The latest generation of GC models combine our understanding of their formation and destruction with advanced galaxy formation simulations. The next decade will provide the first-ever opportunity to test such models across their full evolutionary history, from GC formation at high redshift as seen with the James Webb Telescope, to snapshots of GC demographics at intermediate redshifts obtained with 30m-class telescopes, and eventually to the well-characterized GC populations observed at the present day. We identify the major questions that we should expect to address this way.

The bursty, time-variable nature of star formation in the first billion years, as revealed by JWST, drives phases of temporary quiescence in low-mass galaxies that quench after starbursts. These galaxies provide unique probes of the burstiness of early star formation and its underlying physical processes. Using the SERRA cosmological zoom-in simulations, we analyze over 200 galaxies with M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;10^9.5M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; at z~ 6-8, finding that most experience quiescent phases driven by stellar feedback, with minimal influence from environmental effects. The fraction of temporarily quiescent galaxies increases with decreasing mass and luminosity, representing the dominant population at M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;10^8M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and M_UV&amp;gt;-17. By forward modeling their spectral energy distributions, we show that they are faint (&amp;langle; M_UV&amp;rangle; = -15.6 for M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;=10^8M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;), have strong Balmer breaks (&amp;gt; 0.5) and no emission lines. Comparing our predicted fractions with JWST results, we find similar luminosity-dependent trends; however, the observed fractions of temporarily quiescent galaxies at M_UV~-20 to -19 are higher, suggesting that stronger feedback or additional mechanisms beyond supernovae may be at play. We propose searching for F200W drop-outs and satellites in the proximity (&amp;lt;5^&amp;Prime;) of massive (&amp;gt;10^10M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) galaxies as effective strategies to uncover the hidden majority of faint (M_UV&amp;gt;-17), temporarily quiescent systems, crucial for constraining early feedback processes in low-mass galaxies.

We present a study of new 7.7-11.3 &amp;mu;m data obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope Mid-InfraRed Instrument in the starburst galaxy M 82. In particular, we focus on the dependency of the integrated CO(1-0) line intensity on the MIRI-F770W and MIRI-F1130W filter intensities to investigate the correlation between CO content and the 7.7 and 11.3 &amp;mu;m features from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in M 82's outflows. To perform our analysis, we identify CO clouds using archival ^12CO(J=1-0) NOEMA moment 0 map within 2 kpc from the center of M 82, with sizes ranging between ~21 and 270 pc; then, we compute the CO-to-PAH relations for the 306 validated CO clouds. On average, the power-law slopes for the two relations in M 82 are lower than what is seen in local main-sequence spirals. In addition, there is a moderate correlation between I_CO(1-0)-I_7.7&amp;mu; m /I_11.3&amp;mu; m for most of the CO cloud groups analyzed in this work. Our results suggest that the extreme conditions in M 82 translate into CO not tracing the full budget of molecular gas in smaller clouds, perhaps as a consequence of photoionization and/or emission suppression of CO molecules due to hard radiation fields from the central starburst.

We analyze 23 spectroscopically confirmed Type-2 quasars (QSOs) selected from the WISE 22&amp;mu;m band in the SDSS Stripe 82 region, focusing on their multi-band photometry and spectral energy distributions (SEDs). These objects were selected to be IR-luminous (flux_W4 &amp;gt; 5mJy, i.e., 12.62 &amp;lt; W4 &amp;lt; 14.62  AB   magnitude), optically faint (r &amp;gt; 23) or with red color (r - W4 &amp;gt;8.38). Gemini/GNIRS observations were conducted for all 24 candidates, and 18/24 were also observed with Keck/LRIS. The observations confirm 23 to be real Type-2 QSOs in the redshift range 0.88 - 2.99 (12 are at z&amp;gt;2). We collect multi-band photometry and conduct SED fitting. The composite photometry probes the wavelength from 0.1&amp;mu;m to 10&amp;mu;m at the rest frame. The IR emission is dominated by dust torus implying an average torus luminosity for the sample of L_torus 10^46.84 erg/s. The origin of the rest-UV/optical light is not definitive, but we present three possible scenarios: scattered light, stellar emission, and the reddened accretion disk. Assuming an obscured:unobscured ratio of approximately 1:1, our targets have L_bol = 10^46.28 erg  s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; - 10^47.49 erg  s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and around SMBH masses 10^8.18 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; - 10^9.39 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, assuming they accreate at the Eddington limit. Compared to previous Type-2 AGN SEDs, our targets have a brighter dust torus and redder optical-IR color. By comparing the SED to the results from JWST `little red dots' (LRDs), we find that these IR-selected Type-2 QSOs have similar SED shapes to the LRDs. This pilot Type-2 QSO survey demonstrates that mid-IR selection is an efficient way to find luminous Type-2 QSOs at z&amp;gt;2. Finally, the composite photometry and Type-2 QSOs SED model generated by this sample provide a guide for finding more Type-2 QSOs at higher redshift.

The Lyman Alpha damping wing is seen in absorption against the spectra of high-redshift galaxies. Modeling of this wing is a way to measure the volume neutral hydrogen fraction of the Universe, as well as to measure the strength of HI absorption in the form of a damped Ly&amp;alpha; absorber (DLA). We use very high-quality ultraviolet spectra of low-z galaxies to create mock high-redshift, low-resolution spectra complete with a damping wing resulting from the IGM and HI absorption from local, dense gas to mimic current James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of the early universe. The simulated spectra are used to test the ability to recover the "true" values of the column density of the DLA (N_DLA) and the volume neutral hydrogen fraction (x_HI) of the IGM through modified stellar continuum fitting. We find that the ability to recover the true values of N_DLA and x_HI simultaneously is compromised by degeneracies between these two parameters, and the spectral shape itself at low-resolution (R~100). The root mean squared error between the recovered and true column density of the DLAs is on the order of 1 dex. This error somewhat decreases with improved resolution (R~1000), but systematically underestimates N_DLA when Ly&amp;alpha; emission is present in the mock spectra. The recovered values of x_HI are poorly constrained and do not improve substantially with the higher resolution. We recommend accounting for these sources of uncertainty and biases when using galaxies' Ly&amp;alpha; damping wings to measure the intergalactic neutral hydrogen fraction.

&lt;p&gt;
Recent observations from JWST have revealed an abundant population of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and so-called "Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) at 2≲ z ≲ 11, many of which are characterized by V-shaped UV-to-optical continua with turnovers around the Balmer limit. The physical nature of these LRDs is unclear, and it remains debated whether the peculiar spectral shape originates from AGN, compact galaxies, or both. We present the analysis of new NIRSpec-IFU data from the BlackTHUNDER JWST Large Programme and archival NIRSpec-MSA data of a lensed LRD at z=7.04. The spectra confirm the presence of a smooth Balmer break and a broad H&amp;beta; tracing the Broad Line Region (BLR) of an AGN. The small velocity dispersion of the H&amp;beta; narrow component indicates a small dynamical mass of the host galaxy of M_dyn&amp;lt;4 × 10^8~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, which implies that the stellar population cannot contribute more than 10% to the optical continuum. We show that the Balmer break can be well described by an AGN continuum absorbed by very dense (n_H~ 10^10~cm^-3) and nearly dust-free gas along our line-of-sight (possibly gas in the BLR or its surrounding). The same gas is expected to produce H&amp;beta; absorption, at a level consistent with a tentative detection (3&amp;sigma;) in the high-resolution spectrum. Such a non-stellar origin of the Balmer break may apply to other LRDs, and would alleviate the issue of extremely high stellar mass surface densities inferred in the case of a stellar interpretation of the Balmer break. We note that this is a rare case of a black hole that is overmassive relative to both the host galaxy stellar and dynamical masses. We finally report indications of variability and the first attempt of AGN reverberation mapping at such an early epoch.

&lt;p&gt;
X-ray observations of the optically selected z=6.025 QSO CFHQS J164121+375520 (hereafter J1641) revealed that its flux dropped by a factor ≳7 from 2018, when it was a bright and soft X-ray source, to 2021. Such a strong variability amplitude has not been observed before among z&amp;gt;6 QSOs, and the underlying physical mechanism was unclear. We carried out a new X-ray and rest-frame UV monitoring campaign of J1641 over 2022-2024. We detected J1641 with Chandra in the 2-7 keV band, while no significant emission is detected at softer X-ray energies, making J1641 an X-ray changing look QSO at z&amp;gt;6. Comparing with the 2018 epoch, the 0.5-2 keV flux dropped dramatically by a factor &amp;gt;20. We ascribe this behaviour to intervening, and still ongoing, obscuration by Compton-thick gas intercepting our line of sight between 2018 and 2021. The screening material could be an inner disk or a failed nuclear wind that increased their thickness. Another possibility is that we have witnessed an occultation event due to dust-free clouds located at sub-pc/pc scales, similar to those recently invoked to explain the remarkable X-ray weakness of AGN discovered by JWST. These interpretations are also consistent with the lack of strong variations of the QSO rest-frame UV lightcurve over the same period. Future monitoring of J1641 and the possible discovery of other X-ray changing look QSOs at z&amp;gt;6 will provide us with precious information about the physics of rapid supermassive black-hole growth at high redshift.

&lt;p&gt;
We present the first interferometric imaging of molecular line emission from the Ring Nebula, NGC~6720, in the form of Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations of CO J=2arrow 1 emission. The SMA ^12CO(2&amp;ndash;1) mapping data, with ~3'' spatial resolution and 2 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; velocity resolution, provide an unprecedentedly detailed, 3D view of the Ring's clumpy molecular envelope. The morphology of the velocity-integrated SMA ^12CO(2&amp;ndash;1) image closely resembles those of near-IR H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and PAH emission in JWST/NIRCam imaging of NGC~6720, with the molecular gas forming a geometrically thin layer surrounding the ionized gas imaged by HST and JWST. A simple, geometrical model of the ^12CO(2&amp;ndash;1) data shows that the intrinsic structure of NGC~6720's molecular envelope closely resembles a truncated, triaxial ellipsoid that is viewed close to pole-on, and that the dynamical age of the molecular envelope is ~6000 yr. The SMA ^12CO(2&amp;ndash;1) data furthermore reveal that filamentary features seen projected in the Ring's interior in JWST imaging are in fact fast-moving polar knots or bullets with radial velocities of ±45&amp;ndash;50 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; relative to systemic, and that the hot progenitor star remnant is positioned at the precise geometric center of the clumpy, ellipsoidal molecular shell. We assert that the Ring's molecular envelope was formed via a relatively sudden, AGB-terminating mass ejection event ~6000 yr ago, and that this ellipsoidal envelope was then punctured by fast, collimated polar outflows resulting from interactions between the progenitor and one or more companion stars. Such an evolutionary scenario may describe most molecule-rich, "Ring-like'' planetary nebulae.

&lt;p&gt;
We use the inertial-inflow model of massive star formation to describe the formation of globular clusters (GCs) in turbulent molecular clouds. A key aspect of this model is that the maximum stellar mass scales linearly with cloud mass, such that extremely massive stars (EMSs, 10^3-4 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) form in massive GCs (≳10^5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;). The total wind mass loss is dominated by accreting EMSs (aEMSs), whose wind mass-loss rates become comparable to their accretion rates (≳10^-2 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1). These winds pollute the intra-cluster medium with hot-hydrogen burning yields during GC formation. We propose a parameterised model for the evolution of the stellar mass function during GC formation (~ 1-2 Myr), accounting for gas inflow, wind mass loss and mixing of aEMS yields with pristine gas that has initial proto-GC abundances. Low-mass stars (≲1 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) form continuously from this mixed gas and their abundances resemble observed abundance trends with GC mass and metallicity, specifically: (i) the helium spread in a typical GC is small (&amp;Delta; Y ≃ 0.01) and increases with GC mass; (ii) the fraction of polluted stars increases with GC mass and metallicity; (iii) the extent of the Mg-Al anticorrelations is more pronounced in metal-poor and massive GCs. We conclude that GCs formed with a population of EMSs, that may leave behind black holes with masses above the pair-instability gap (≳120 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) and that the nitrogen-rich galaxies found by the James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST) are in the first phase of galaxy evolution, when a large fraction of star formation occurs in the form of GCs.

&lt;p&gt;
Context. The UVJ color-color diagram is a widely used diagnostic to separate star-forming and quiescent galaxies. Observational data from photometric surveys reveal a strong stellar mass trend, with higher-mass star-forming galaxies being systematically more dust-reddened. Aims. We analyze the UVJ diagram in the TNG100 cosmological simulation at cosmic noon (z≈2). Specifically, we focus on the trend between UVJ colors and mass which has not been reproduced in any cosmological simulation thus far. Methods. We applied the SKIRT dust radiative transfer code to the TNG100 simulation to generate rest-frame UVJ fluxes. These UVJ colors were then compared to observational data from several well-studied extragalactic fields from the CANDELS/3D-HST programs, augmented by recent JWST/NIRCam photometry. Results. Quiescent and low-mass (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;≲10^10.5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) galaxies at cosmic noon do not require significant levels of dust reddening, as opposed to massive (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;≳10^11 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) star-forming galaxies. An extensive range of possible dust models fall short of the required dust reddening in V-J color for massive star-forming galaxies, with the simulated galaxies being too blue by ≈0.9 mag. Conclusions. We find that only variations in the star-to-dust geometries of the simulated galaxies can yield V-J colors that are red enough to match the observations. A toy model with isolated dust screens around younger stellar populations (with ages below ~1 Gyr) can reproduce the observational data, while all conventional dust radiative transfer models (where the dust distribution follows the metals in the interstellar medium) fail to achieve the required V-J colors.

We present new JWST NIRSpec integral field unit (IFU) G395H/F290LP observations of a merging galaxy system at z=7.88, part of A2744-z7p9, the most distant protocluster to date. The IFU cube reveals [OIII] emissions in two previously known galaxies (ZD3 and ZD6) and a newly identified galaxy, ZD12, at z&lt;sub&gt;spec&lt;/sub&gt;=7.8762. One of the detected [OIII]-emitting regions has a detection of the auroral [OIII]4363, line, allowing us to derive a direct metallicity of log(O/H)+12=7.4±0.2, while metallicities in other regions are measured using strong line calibration methods. We find large deviations within the measured metallicity (&amp;Delta; log (O/H)~1), which suggests a fast chemical enrichment from intense star formation and merger-driven growth, as expected in early galaxies. Our analysis shows that metal-poor regions could easily be outshone by more enriched regions, posing a challenge for spectroscopic analysis based on integrated light (i.e., NIRSpec MSA) against identifying metal-free star formation in the early universe. NIRCam imaging reveals seven UV-bright clumps in ZD12, in the range of stellar mass log M_*/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;~7.6&amp;ndash;8.9. Four of them are unresolved (&amp;lt; 100pc) and intensely star-forming (&amp;gt;30 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1 kpc^-2), likely contributing to the scatter in metallicity by producing an ideal environment for rapid chemical cycles. Lastly, we revisit the nature of the host protocluster by including new member galaxies identified here and in the literature, and obtain local overdensity factor &amp;delta;=44_-31^+89, total halo mass M_h = 5.8_-0.3^+0.2×10^11 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, and a formal velocity dispersion of 1100±500 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

JWST provides a unique dataset to study reionization's earliest stages, promising insights into the first galaxies. Many JWST/NIRSpec prism spectra reveal smooth Lyman-alpha breaks in z&amp;gt;5 galaxies, implying damping wing scattering by neutral hydrogen. We investigate what current prism spectra imply about the intergalactic medium (IGM), and how best to use NIRSpec spectra to recover IGM properties. We use a sample of 99 z~5.5-13 galaxies with high S/N prism spectra in the public archive, including 12 at z&amp;gt;10. We analyse these spectra using damping wing sightlines from inhomogeneous reionizing IGM simulations, mapping between the distance of a source from neutral IGM and the mean IGM neutral fraction. We marginalise over absorption by local HI around galaxies, and Lyman-alpha emission. We observe a decline in the median and variance of flux around the Lyman-alpha break with increasing redshift, consistent with an increasingly neutral IGM, as ionized regions become smaller and rarer. At z≳9 the spectra become consistent with an almost fully neutral IGM. We find S/N&amp;gt;15 per pixel is required to robustly estimate IGM properties from prism spectra. We fit a sub-sample of high S/N spectra and infer mean neutral fractions x_HI=0.33^+0.18_-0.27, 0.64^+0.17_-0.23 (&amp;gt;0.70 excluding GNz11) at z ≈ 6.5, 9.3. We also investigate local HI absorption, finding median column density log_10N_HI≈10^20.8 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, comparable to z~3 Lyman-break galaxies, with no significant redshift evolution. We find galaxies showing the strongest absorption are more likely to be in close associations (&amp;lt;500 pkpc), implying enhanced absorption in massive dark matter halos. Future deep prism and grating spectroscopy of z&amp;gt;9 sources will provide tighter constraints on the earliest stages of reionization, key for understanding the onset of star formation.

&lt;p&gt;
Detecting the first generation of stars, Population III (PopIII), has been a long-standing goal in astrophysics, yet they remain elusive even in the JWST era. Here we present a novel NIRCam-based selection method for PopIII galaxies, and carefully validate it through completeness and contamination simulations. We systematically search ~500 arcmin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; across JWST legacy fields for PopIII candidates, including GLIMPSE which, assisted by gravitational lensing, has produced JWST's deepest NIRCam imaging thus far. We discover one promising PopIII galaxy candidate (GLIMPSE-16043) at z=6.50^+0.03_-0.24, a moderately lensed galaxy (mu=2.9) with an intrinsic UV magnitude of M_UV=-15.89. It exhibits key PopIII features: strong H&amp;alpha; emission (rest-frame EW 2810±550&amp;#8491;); a Balmer jump; no dust (UV slope &amp;beta;=-2.34±0.36); and undetectable metal lines (e.g., [OIII]; [OIII]/H&amp;beta;&amp;lt;0.44) implying a gas-phase metallicity of Zgas/Zsun&amp;lt;0.5%. These properties indicate the presence of a nascent, metal-deficient young stellar population (&amp;lt;5Myr) with a stellar mass of ≃10^5M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. Intriguingly, this source deviates significantly from the extrapolated UV-metallicity relation derived from recent JWST observations at z=4-10, consistent with UV enhancement by a top-heavy PopIII initial mass function or the presence of an extremely metal-poor AGN. We also derive the first observational constraints on the PopIII UV luminosity function at z~6-7. The volume density of GLIMPSE-16043 (≈10^-4 cMpc^-3) is in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions, independently reinforcing its plausibility. This study demonstrates the power of our novel NIRCam method to finally reveal distant galaxies even more pristine than the Milky Way's most metal-poor satellites, thereby promising to bring us closer to the first generation of stars than we have ever been before.

We explore the evolving relationship between galaxies and their dark matter halos from z ~ 0.1 to z ~ 12 using mass-limited angular clustering measurements in the 0.54 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the COSMOS-Web survey. This study provides the first measurements of the mass-limited two-point correlation function at z ≥ 10 and a consistent analysis spanning 13.4 Gyr of cosmic history, setting new benchmarks for future simulations and models. Using a halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework, we derive characteristic halo masses and the stellar-to-halo mass relationship (SHMR) across redshifts and stellar mass bins. Our results first indicate that HOD models fit data at z ≥ 2.5 best when incorporating a non-linear scale-dependent halo bias, boosting clustering at non-linear scales (r = 10-100 kpc). We find that galaxies at z &amp;gt; 10.5 with log(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; / M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) ≥ 8.85 are hosted by halos with M_h ~ 10^10.5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, achieving a star formation efficiency (SFE) M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; / (f_b M_h) up to 1 dex higher than at z ≤ 1. The high galaxy bias at z ≥ 8 suggests that these galaxies reside in massive halos with intrinsic high SFE. Our SHMR evolves significantly with redshift, starting high at z ≥ 10.5, decreasing until z ~ 2 - 3, then increasing again until the present. Current simulations fail to reproduce both massive high-z galaxies and this evolution, while semi-empirical models linking SFE to halo mass, accretion rates, and redshift align with our findings. We propose that z &amp;gt; 8 galaxies experience bursty star formation without significant feedback altering their growth, driving the rapid growth of massive galaxies observed by JWST. Over time, increasing feedback efficiency and exponential halo growth suppress star formation. At z ~ 2 - 3 and after, halo growth slows down while star formation continues, supported by gas reservoirs in halos.

Spiral galaxies are ubiquitous in the local Universe. However the properties of spiral arms in them are still not well studied, and there is even less information concerning spiral structure in distant galaxies. We aim to measure the most general parameters of spiral arms in remote galaxies and trace their changes with redshift. We perform photometric decomposition, including spiral arms, for 159 galaxies from the HST COSMOS and JWST CEERS and JADES surveys, which are imaged in optical and near-infrared rest-frame wavelengths. We confirm that, in our representative sample of spiral galaxies, the pitch angles increase, and the azimuthal lengths decrease with increasing redshift, implying that the spiral structure becomes more tightly wound over time. For the spiral-to-total luminosity ratio and the spiral width-to-disc scale length ratio, we find that band-shifting effects can be as significant as, or even stronger than, evolutionary effects. Additionally, we find that spiral structure becomes more asymmetric at higher redshifts.

We present 450&amp;mu;m and 850&amp;mu;m James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) observations of the Corona Australis (CrA) molecular cloud taken as part of the JCMT Gould Belt Legacy Survey (GBLS). We present a catalogue of 39 starless and protostellar sources, for which we determine source temperatures and masses using SCUBA-2 450&amp;mu;m/850&amp;mu;m flux density ratios for sources with reliable 450&amp;mu;m detections, and compare these to values determined using temperatures measured by the Herschel Gould Belt Survey (HGBS). In keeping with previous studies, we find that SCUBA-2 preferentially detects high-volume-density starless cores, which are most likely to be prestellar (gravitationally bound). We do not observe any anti-correlation between temperature and volume density in the starless cores in our sample. Finally, we combine our SCUBA-2 and Herschel data to perform SED fitting from 160-850&amp;mu;m across the central Coronet region, thereby measuring dust temperature T, dust emissivity index &amp;beta; and column density N(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) across the Coronet. We find that &amp;beta; varies across the Coronet, particularly measuring &amp;beta; = 1.55 ± 0.35 in the colder starless SMM-6 clump to the north of the B star R CrA. This relatively low value of &amp;beta; is suggestive of the presence of large dust grains in SMM-6, even when considering the effects of T-&amp;beta; fitting degeneracy and ^12CO contamination of SCUBA-2 850&amp;mu;m data on the measured &amp;beta; values.

We combine the deepest X-ray survey from the Chandra Deep Field-South (CDF-S) `7-Ms' survey with the deepest mid-infrared (5.6 &amp;mu; m) image from the JWST/MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) in the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF) to study the infrared counterparts and point-source emission of 31 X-ray sources with a median, intrinsic, rest-frame X-ray luminosity of log_10(L_Xc^0.5-7keV)=42.04±0.22 erg s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. The sample includes 24 AGN with a redshift range, as set by the X-ray detectability, of z ≃ 0.5-3. Through a multi-wavelength morphological decomposition, employing three separate classifications (visual, parametric and non-parametric) we separate (where present) the luminosity of the point-like AGN component from the remainder of the host-galaxy emission. The unprecedented mid-infrared sensitivity and imaging resolution of MIRI allows, in many cases, the direct characterisation of point-like (i.e. unresolved) components in the galaxies' emission. We establish a broad agreement between the three morphological classifications. At least 70% of the X-ray sources, including some classified as galaxies, show unresolved emission in the MIRI images, with the unresolved-to-total flux fraction at rest-frame 2&amp;mu; m ranging from ~0.2 to ~0.9. At high X-ray luminosities (log_10(L_Xc)&amp;gt;43 erg s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) we derive a consistent rest-frame near-infrared 2 &amp;mu; m point-source luminosity to that derived for local AGN, whilst at lower X-ray luminosity we identify an excess in the 2 &amp;mu; m emission compared to pre-JWST studies. We speculate this offset may be driven by a combination of Compton-thick AGN components and nuclear starburst, merger driven activity. Our observations highlight the complex nature of X-ray sources in the distant Universe and demonstrate the power of JWST/MIRI in quantifying their nuclear infrared emission. (Abridged)

Recent cosmological observations indicate a 5&amp;sigma; discrepancy between the values of the Hubble constant H_0 derived from late and early universe probes. A further possible tension at the ~ 3&amp;sigma; level arises from different measurements of &amp;sigma;_8. These measurements suggest the existence of new physics. Here, we explore several theories of modified gravity that may help to resolve these cosmological tensions. These include a family of phenomenological modified theories, where only Newton's gravitational constant and the Einstein-Boltzmann equations are affected. We consider one particular class of these theories: cosmologies with varying growth index &amp;gamma; and varying dark energy Equation of State (EoS) w_&amp;Lambda;. We also consider the normal branch of the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (nDGP) model as well as k-mouflage gravity, which involves a non-trivially coupled scalar field. Our main aim is to narrow down the modified gravity landscape by constraining each model using high-redshift JWST data. Several probes are considered in this work: Stellar Mass Function (SMF), Stellar Mass Density (SMD), Star Formation Rate Density (SFRD) and Ultra-Violet Luminosity Function (UVLF) along with the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). We find that generally, the choice of r_c≳ 10^3.5 Mpc is preferred for nDGP, while &amp;beta;~0.1, K_0≳ 0.9 is favored for k-mouflage. Moreover, in the context of phenomenological gravity, phantom-like dark energy EoS w_&amp;Lambda;≲ -1 is preferred over the quintessence.

We present an analysis of the rest-frame optical (&amp;lambda; ≃ 3100-5600  &amp;#8491;) spectrum of a log_10(M_*/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) = 8.6 star-forming galaxy at z=8.271 (EXCELS-63107) from JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution observations taken as part of the EXCELS survey. EXCELS-63107 is a compact object consistent with the size of local star-forming cluster complexes (r_e &amp;lt; 200   pc) and has an extremely steep UV continuum measured from JWST/NIRCam photometry (&amp;beta;=-3.3±0.3). The JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectrum of EXCELS-63107 is notable for its strong [OIII]&amp;lambda;4363 auroral-line emission relative to the [OIII]&amp;lambda;5007 forbidden line. Via a detailed emission-line and photoionization-modelling analysis, we find that the the observed properties of EXCELS-63107 are consistent with the presence of an ionizing source with an effective temperature of T_eff ≳ 80   000 K heating ionized gas with a density of n_e &amp;lt; 10^4   cm^-3 to a volume-averaged electron temperature of T_e ≃ 34   000 K. Crucially, we find that stellar population models assuming a standard IMF are not capable of producing the required heating. We determine an oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H)= 6.89^+0.26_-0.21 which is one of the lowest directly constrained oxygen abundances measured in any galaxy to date, and ≃ 10 × lower than is typical for z≃8 galaxies with the same stellar mass. The extremely low metallicity of EXCELS-63107 places it in a regime in which theoretical models expect a transition to a top-heavy IMF, and we speculate that a ≃ 10-30   × excess of M &amp;gt; 50   M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; stars is one plausible explanation for its observed properties. However, more exotic scenarios, such as Pop III star formation within a mildly enriched halo, are also consistent with the observations.

&lt;p&gt;
Metallicity is a crucial tracer of galaxy evolution, providing insights into gas accretion, star formation, and feedback. At high redshift, these processes reveal how early galaxies assembled and enriched their interstellar medium. In this work, we present rest-frame optical spectroscopy of 12 massive (log(M_*/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;gt;9) galaxies at z~ 6-8 from the REBELS ALMA large program, observed with JWST NIRSpec/IFU in the prism mode. These observations span emission lines from [OII]&amp;lambda;3727,9 to [SII]&amp;lambda;6716,31, providing key information on nebular dust attenuation, ionisation states, and chemical abundances. We find lower O32 ratios (average ~3.7) and [OIII]&amp;lambda;5007 equivalent widths (average EW_[OIII]~390&amp;#8491;) than are generally found in existing large spectroscopic surveys at z&amp;gt;6, indicating less extreme ionising conditions. Strong-line diagnostics suggest that these systems are some of the most metal-rich galaxies observed at z&amp;gt;6 (average Z_gas~ 0.4 Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;), including sources with near-solar oxygen abundances, in line with their high stellar masses (average logM_*/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;~9.5). Supplementing with literature sources at lower masses, we investigate the mass-metallicity and fundamental metallicity relations (MZR and FMR, respectively) over a 4 dex stellar mass range at 6&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;8. In contrast to recent studies of lower-mass galaxies, we find no evidence for negative offsets to the z=0 FMR for the REBELS galaxies. This work demonstrates the existence of chemically-enriched galaxies just ~1 Gyr after the Big Bang, and indicates that the MZR is already in place at these early times, in agreement with other recent z&amp;gt;3 studies.

We present measurements of the dust attenuation curves of 12 massive (9≲~log(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;lt;~10) Lyman-break galaxies at z=6.5-7.7 derived from James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy. The galaxies are drawn from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Reionization Era Bright Emission Line Survey (REBELS) large program. The dust attenuation curves were obtained by fitting spectral energy distribution (SED) models with a flexible dust law to the full galaxy spectra over observed wavelengths 0.6-5.3 &amp;mu;m. These attenuation curves show a range of recovered slopes (-0.39≤&amp;delta;≤0.08) that are on average slightly flatter than seen in local sources of the same stellar masses, with none exhibiting very steep slopes. Three galaxies exhibit evidence for a 2175 &amp;#8491; dust bump (&amp;gt;4&amp;sigma;) and we find SED fitting excluding the bump can overestimate derived stellar masses by up to 0.4 dex. Correcting for the dust attenuation with our best-fit attenuation curves we recover a range of intrinsic UV-slopes (-2.5≤&amp;beta;_0≤-2.2). The galaxies show moderate reddening (A_V~=~0.1-0.6 mag) and the A_V to stellar mass relation is consistent with local sources. The attenuation law slope is found to correlate with A_V, while we see no strong correlation with stellar mass, M_UV, or gas-phase metallicity. Overall, our results show little evolution in dust properties in the REBELS sources compared to the local Universe. Comparing our recovered trends to empirical models suggests that the most important factor driving the variation in the attenuation curves in our sample is the dust-star geometry, not the properties of the dust grains themselves.

&lt;p&gt;
We present a comparison of observed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) feature ratios in 19 nearby galaxies with a grid of theoretical expectations for near- and mid-infrared dust emission. The PAH feature ratios are drawn from Cycle 1 JWST observations and are measured for 7224 stellar clusters and 29176 stellar associations for which we have robust ages and mass estimates from HST five-band photometry. Though there are galaxy-to-galaxy variations, the observed PAH feature ratios largely agree with the theoretical models, particularly those that are skewed toward more ionized and larger PAH size distributions. For each galaxy we also extract PAH feature ratios for 200 pc-wide circular regions in the diffuse interstellar medium, which serve as a non-cluster/association control sample. Compared to what we find for stellar clusters and associations, the 3.3um/7.7um and 3.3um/11.3um ratios from the diffuse interstellar medium are ~ 0.10-0.15 dex smaller. When the observed PAH feature ratios are compared to the radiation field hardness as probed by the [OIII]/H&amp;beta; ratio, we find anti-correlations for nearly all galaxies in the sample. These results together suggest that the PAH feature ratios are driven by the shape intensity of the radiation field, and that the smallest PAHs &amp;ndash; observed via JWST F335M imaging &amp;ndash; are increasingly 'processed' or destroyed in regions with the most intense and hard radiation fields.

&lt;p&gt;
In recent years, observations with the JWST have started to map out the rapid metal enrichment of the early Universe, while (sub)millimeter observations have simultaneously begun to reveal the ubiquity of dust beyond z≳6. However, the pathways that led to the assembly of early dust reservoirs remain poorly quantified, and require pushing our understanding of key scaling relations between dust, gas and metals into the early Universe. We investigate the dust build-up in twelve 6.5 ≲ z ≲ 7.7 galaxies drawn from the REBELS survey that benefit from (i) JWST/NIRSpec strong-line metallicity measurements, (ii) ALMA [CII]-based redshifts and gas masses, and (iii) dust masses from single- or multi-band ALMA continuum observations. Combining these measurements, we investigate the dust-to-gas (DtG), dust-to-metal (DtM), and dust-to-stellar mass (DtS) ratios of our sample as a function of metallicity. While our analysis is limited by systematic uncertainties related to the [CII]-to-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion factor and dust temperature, we explore a wide range of possible values, and carefully assess their impact on our results. Under a fiducial set of assumptions, we find an average log(DtG) = -3.02 ± 0.23, only slightly below that of local metal-rich galaxies. On the other hand, at fixed metallicity our average log(DtS) = -2.15 ± 0.42 is significantly larger than that of low-redshift galaxies. Finally, through a comparison to various theoretical models of high-redshift dust production, we find that assembling the dust reservoirs in massive galaxies at z≈7 likely requires the combination of rapid supernova enrichment and efficient ISM dust growth.

&lt;p&gt;
The hierarchical interplay among gravity, magnetic fields, and turbulent gas flows in delivering the necessary material to form massive protostellar clusters remains enigmatic. We have performed high-resolution (beam size ~14 arcsec ≃ 0.05 pc at a distance 725 pc) 850 &amp;mu;m dust polarization and C^18O molecular line observations of Cepheus A (Cep A), the second closest massive star-forming region, using the 15-meter James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) along with the SCUBA-2/POL-2 and HARP instruments. Our key analyses reveal that (i) morphologically, all three fields&amp;ndash;gravitational (G), magnetic (B), and kinetic (K) fields&amp;ndash;are aligned with each other, and (ii) energetically, they exhibit a hierarchical relationship with gravitational (E_G) &amp;gt; magnetic (E_B) &amp;gt; kinetic (E_K). Gravity dominates in Cep A clump and, as a primary active player, dictates the other two agents. Consequently, gravity plays two active roles: (i) induces gas flows and (ii) drags B-field lines toward the gravitational trough. Since magnetic energy dominates kinetic energy, E_B &amp;gt; E_K, the "dragged-in" B-field as a secondary active player can mitigate turbulence and instabilities, thereby regularizing gas flows into a more ordered configuration. At the ~0.60 pc clump scale, these flows deliver material at a substantially high rate of ~ 2.1×10^-4 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1 toward the cluster center. Our study, for the first time, presents new insights into how B-fields and turbulent gas flows passively assist the active role of gravity in the formation of a protostellar cluster, contrasting with the standard notion that these agents primarily oppose gravitational collapse.

&lt;p&gt;
We combine infrared (IR) observations collected by the James Webb Space Telescope with optical deep images by the Hubble Space Telescope taken approximately 20 years earlier to compute proper-motion membership for the globular cluster (GC) M 4 (NGC 6121) along its entire white dwarf (WD) cooling sequence (CS). These new IR observations allow us, for only the second time in a GC, to compare WD models with observations over a wide range of wavelengths, constraining fundamental astrophysical properties of WDs. Furthermore, we investigate the presence of WDs with IR excess along the WD CS of M 4, similar to the recent study conducted on the GC NGC 6397. We also determine the age difference between M 4 and NGC 6397 by comparing the absolute F150W2 magnitudes of the luminosity function peak at the bottom of the observed WD CS, and find that M 4 is slightly younger, by 0.8+/-0.5 Gyr.

&lt;p&gt;
Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered a substantial population of high-redshift broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) characterized by moderate luminosities, weak X-ray emissions, and faint high-ionization lines, challenging conventional models of black hole growth and AGN activity. In this study, we propose that these sources are accreting at super-Eddington rates and use geometrically thick, non-advective disk models to investigate the critical roles of photon scattering, reflections, and shadowing within funnel-like structures along the disk's rotation axis. Our models predict highly collimated radiation fields, with isotropic-equivalent luminosities vastly exceeding the Eddington limit in polar directions, and significant suppression of emission at higher inclination angles due to shadowing. These effects result in altered spectral energy distributions and pronounced anisotropies in observable properties. Key features include ultra-blue UV continuum slopes (alpha=+0.5 to +0.8), bolometric correction factors varying by over an order of magnitude with orientation, and suppressed coronal X-ray emissions. The anisotropy and shadowing effects may also explain the observed faintness of broad high-ionization emission lines, as the viewing angle strongly modulates both continuum brightness and the illumination of the broad-line region. These findings indicate that super-Eddington accretion flows, shaped by thick disk geometries and anisotropic radiation fields, can naturally account for many puzzling features of JWST-discovered AGNs and provide new insights into black hole growth in the early universe.

Redshift and luminosity distributions are essential for understanding the cosmic evolution of extragalactic objects and phenomena, such as galaxies, gamma-ray bursts, and fast radio bursts (FRBs). For FRBs, these distributions are primarily estimated using the fluence and the Dispersion Measure (DM). Calibrating their joint distribution has been challenging due to a lack of accurate fluences in the intensity data of the CHIME/FRB survey. Using the baseband update of CHIME/FRB Catalog 1, we calibrate the 2D fluence-DM distribution for the first time. We find the energy distribution is described well by a Schechter function with power-law slope of -1.94^+0.14_-0.12. Testing two types of redshift evolution models suggests a likely combination of young and old formation channels. 31^+31_-21&amp;percnt; of FRB sources may track star formation, or correspondingly, FRB sources may have delay times of 1.94^+1.54_-1.31 Gyr. A pure star formation tracking population is excluded by only one model at &amp;gt; 2&amp;sigma; confidence. An updated cosmic star formation rate density evolution up to redshift 14 is constrained by compiling results from several JWST studies. Using this information, we expect next-generation radio telescopes to detect a few dozen bursts per year at z ≳ 6. A radio telescope with a system-equivalent flux density of ≤ 1 Jy (equivalent to a detection threshold of 14 mJy ms) and instantaneous sky coverage of ≳ 200 square degrees should be able to detect 1.4^+1.6_-1.0× 10^3 FRBs year^-1 at z ≳ 6 and 234^+250_-162 FRBs year^-1 at z≳ 8, which is sufficient to differentiate between reionization histories.

We explore spectroscopic and photometric methods for identifying high-redshift galaxies containing an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) with JWST observations. After demonstrating the limitations of standard optical methods, which appear ineffective in the low-metallicity environment of the early universe, we evaluate alternative diagnostic techniques using the current JWST observational capabilities. Our analysis focuses on line ratios and equivalent widths (EWs) of UV emission lines: CIV, HeII &amp;lambda;1640, OIII] &amp;lambda;1665, and CIII], and the faint optical line, HeII &amp;lambda;4686. We find that the most valuable diagnostic quantities for finding AGN are the line ratios: (CIII] + CIV) / HeII &amp;lambda;1640 and CIII] / HeII &amp;lambda;1640, as well as the EW of HeII &amp;lambda;1640. For more reliable AGN identification, the HeII &amp;lambda;1640 and OIII] &amp;lambda;1665 lines would need to be detected separately. We show that the HeII &amp;lambda;1640/H&amp;beta; ratio effectively separates AGN from star-forming galaxies, though it is contingent on a low dust content. We also show that in order to effectively use these diagnostics, future observations require longer exposure times, especially for galaxies at z &amp;gt; 6. Subsequently, we plot three real high-redshift sources on these diagrams which present strong UV emission lines. However, in order to classify them as strong AGN candidates, further study is needed due to the blending of HeII + OIII] and unreliable optical lines. Lastly, we carry out a selection process using spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with EAZY to identify strong AGN candidates in the JADES NIRCam photometry. One galaxy in our sample emerged as a strong AGN candidate, supported by both photometric selection and strong UV emission. We present a sample of similar AGN candidates in the JADES data based on this method.

&lt;p&gt;
Quiescent galaxies over 3&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6 are rare and puzzling. They formed and quenched within two billion years and simulations routinely struggle to predict their observed abundances. Developing a robust identification technique for these galaxies is crucial for constraining galaxy evolution models. Traditional rest-frame color-color selection techniques for quiescent galaxies are known to break down or require adjustments at z≳3. Recently, observed-frame color-color criteria have been established with JWST/NIRCam colors that efficiently pre-select high-redshift quiescent galaxies using only ≲1&amp;percnt; of a given sample. In this work, the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection machine-learning technique is applied to pre-select quiescent galaxies over 3&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6 using observed NIRCam colors. From a parent sample of 43,926 galaxies in JADES, we ultimately find 44 quiescent candidates from a pool of ≈2,300 galaxies. This is about five times fewer galaxies than what would be pre-selected using color-color criteria. Two-thirds of these candidates can be pre-selected from a pool as small as 247, which is about twice as efficient as existing observed-frame color selection techniques. Nearly two-thirds of the candidates are new discoveries and include quiescent galaxies with mass-weighted ages as young as ≲300 Myr. We obtain number densities in agreement with the literature at z&amp;lt;4 and find generally higher abundances at z&amp;gt;4, although our measurements are consistent within errors. This technique may be applied to other JWST surveys.

Galaxy groups with M_tot ≲ 10^14 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and up to a few tens of members are the most common galaxy environment, marking the transition between field and massive clusters. Identifying groups plays a crucial role in understanding structure formation and galaxy evolution. Modern deep surveys allow us to build well-characterized samples of groups up to the regime where structures were taking shape. We aimed to build the largest deep catalog of galaxy groups to date over the COSMOS-Web field effective area of 0.45 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, leveraging the deep high quality data of the new COSMOS-Web photometric catalog resulted from the James Webb Space Telescope observations of the COSMOS-Web field. We performed the group search with the AMICO algorithm, a linear matched filter based on an analytical model for the group signal. AMICO has already been tested in wide and deep field surveys, including COSMOS data up to z=2. In this work, we tested the algorithm performances at even higher redshift and searched for protocluster cores at z&amp;gt;2. We compiled a list of known protoclusters in COSMOS at 2 ≤ z ≤ 3.7, matched them with our detections and studied the clustering of the detected cores. We estimated purity and completeness of our sample by creating data-driven mocks with the SinFoniA code and linked signal-to-noise to purity. We detected 1678 groups in the COSMOS-Web field up to z=3.7, including lists of members extending nearly two magnitudes deeper than the previous AMICO-COSMOS catalog. 756 groups were detected with purity of 80&amp;percnt;. More than 500 groups have their redshift confirmed by assigning spectroscopic counterparts. This group catalog offers a unique opportunity to explore galaxy evolution in different environments spanning ~12 Gyr and to study groups, from the least rich population to the formation of the most massive clusters.

In this work we estimate the explosion and progenitor properties of six Type II supernovae (SNe) at 0.675 &amp;lt;= z &amp;lt;= 3.61 discovered by the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) transient survey by modeling their light curves. This high-redshift Type II SN sample allows us to compare low-redshift Type II SNe to their high-redshift counterparts. Two Type II SNe are found to have high explosion energies of 3e51 erg, while the other four Type II SNe are estimated to have typical explosion energies found in the local Universe [(0.5-2)e51 erg]. The fraction of Type II SNe with high explosion energies might be higher at high redshifts because of, e.g., lower metallicity, but it is still difficult to draw a firm conclusion because of the small sample size and potential observational biases. We found it difficult to constrain the progenitor masses for Type II SNe in our sample because of the sparse light-curve data. We found two Type II SN light curves can be better reproduced by introducing confined, dense circumstellar matter. Thus, the confined, dense circumstellar matter frequently observed in nearby Type II SNe is likely to exist in Type II SNe at high redshifts as well. Two Type II SNe are estimated to have high host galaxy extinctions, showing the ability of JWST to discover dust-obscured SNe at high redshifts. More high-redshift Type II SNe are required to investigate the differences in the properties of Type II SNe near and far, but here we show the first glimpse into the high-redshift population of Type II SNe.

&lt;p&gt;
We present integral field unit observations of the Phoenix Cluster with the JWST Mid-infrared Instrument's Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI/MRS). We focus this study on the molecular gas, dust, and star formation in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We use precise spectral modeling to produce maps of the silicate dust, molecular gas, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the inner ~50 kpc of the cluster. We have developed a novel method for measuring the optical depth from silicates by comparing the observed H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; line ratios to those predicted by excitation models. We provide updated measurements of the total molecular gas mass of 2.2^+0.4_-0.1 × 10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, which agrees with CO-based estimates, providing an estimate of the CO-to-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion factor of &amp;alpha;_CO = 0.9 ± 0.2 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; pc^-2 (K km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)^-1; an updated stellar mass of M_* = 2.6 ± 0.5 × 10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;; and star formation rates averaged over 10 and 100 Myr of &amp;langle;SFR&amp;rangle;_10 = 1340 ± 100 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1 and &amp;langle;SFR&amp;rangle;_100 = 740 ± 80 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1, respectively. The H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission seems to be powered predominantly by star formation within the central ~ 20 kpc, with no need for an extra particle heating component as is seen in other BCGs. Additionally, we find nearly an order of magnitude drop in the star formation rates estimated by PAH fluxes in cool core BCGs compared to field galaxies, suggesting that hot particles from the intracluster medium are destroying PAH grains even in the centralmost 10s of kpc.

Compact, star-forming galaxies with high star formation rate surface densities (&amp;Sigma;_SFR) are often efficient Lyman continuum (LyC) emitters at z≤ 4.5, likely as intense stellar feedback creates low-density channels that allow photons to escape. Irregular or disturbed morphologies, such as those resulting from mergers, can also facilitate LyC escape by creating anisotropic gas distributions. We investigate the influence of galaxy morphology on LyC production and escape at redshifts 5 ≤ z ≤ 7 using observations from various itJames Webb Space Telescope (JWST) surveys. Our sample consists of 436 sources, which are predominantly low-mass (~ 10^8.15 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;), star-forming galaxies with ionizing photon efficiency ( &amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt; ) values consistent with canonical expectations. Since direct measurements of f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt; are not possible during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), we predict f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt; for high-redshift galaxies by applying survival analysis to a subsample of LyC emitters from the Low-Redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS), selected to be direct analogs of reionization-era galaxies. We find that these galaxies exhibit on average modest predicted escape fractions (~ 0.04). Additionally, we assess the correlation between morphological features and LyC emission. Our findings indicate that neither  &amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt;  nor the predicted f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt; values show a significant correlation with the presence of merger signatures. This suggests that in low-mass galaxies at z ≥ 5, strong morphological disturbances are not the primary mechanism driving LyC emission and leakage. Instead, compactness and star formation activity likely play a more pivotal role in regulating LyC escape.

We investigate the behavior of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters (GCs) using photometric diagrams constructed with Euclid photometry. By employing synthetic spectra and isochrones that incorporate the chemical differences between first-population (1P) stars, resembling field stars, and second-population (2P) stars, enriched in helium and nitrogen but depleted in carbon and oxygen, we identify, from a theoretical perspective, the color-magnitude diagrams and the chromosome maps most effective at distinguishing these populations within GCs. Euclid photometry proves to be a powerful tool for identifying multiple populations among M-dwarfs, as 1P and 2P stars form distinct sequences in well-chosen photometric diagrams, driven by differences in the strength of oxygen-based molecular features, such as water vapor. To validate our theoretical findings, we analyzed Euclid photometry and astrometry of the GC NGC 6397, complemented by photometric and astrometric data from the Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope, enabling a comprehensive study of its stellar populations across a wide field of view. We find that the 1P constitutes about 30% of the M-dwarfs in NGC 6397, with the fraction of 1P stars remaining consistent across different stellar masses and throughout the entire field of view. 2P stars exhibit an [O/Fe] depletion of about 0.3 dex relative to 1P stars, and both populations display isotropic proper motions. This study represents the first comprehensive analysis of multiple populations among M-dwarfs across a wide field of view, demonstrating that Euclid photometry is a powerful instrument for investigating multiple populations in GCs.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is discovering an increasing number of galaxies well into the early stages of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Many of these galaxies are clustered with strong Lyman alpha (Ly&amp;alpha;) emission, motivating the presence of surrounding cosmic HII regions that would facilitate Ly&amp;alpha; transmission through the intergalactic medium (IGM). Detecting these HII "bubbles" would allow us to connect their growth to the properties of the galaxies inside them. Here we develop a new forward-modeling framework to estimate the local HII region size and location from Ly&amp;alpha; spectra of galaxy groups in the early stages of the EoR. Our model takes advantage of the complementary information provided by neighboring sightlines through the IGM. Our forward models sample the main sources of uncertainty, including: (i) the global neutral fraction; (ii) EoR morphology; (iii) emergent Ly&amp;alpha; emission; and (iv) NIRSpec instrument noise. Depending on the availability of complementary nebular lines, ~ 0.006 &amp;ndash; 0.01 galaxies per cMpc^3, are required to be ≳95&amp;percnt; confident that the HII bubble location and size recovered by our method is accurate to within ~ 1 comoving Mpc. This corresponds roughly to tens of galaxies at z~7&amp;ndash;8 in ~2x2 tiled pointing with JWST NIRSpec. Such a sample is achievable with a targeted survey with completeness down to M_UV^min≲ -19 &amp;ndash; -17, depending on the over-density of the field. We test our method on 3D EoR simulations as well as misspecified equivalent width distributions, in both cases accurately recovering the HII region surrounding targeted galaxy groups.

&lt;p&gt;
Globular clusters (GCs) are some of the oldest bound structures in the Universe, holding clues to the earliest epochs of star formation and galaxy assembly. However, accurate age measurements of ancient clusters are challenging due to the age-metallicity degeneracy. Here, we report the discovery of 42 compact stellar systems within the 'Relic', a massive, quiescent galaxy at z=2.53. The Relic resides in an over-density behind the Abell 2744 cluster, with a prominent tidal tail extending towards two low-mass companions. Using deep data from the UNCOVER/MegaScience JWST Surveys, we find that clusters formed in age intervals ranging from 8 Myr up to ~2 Gyr, suggesting a rich formation history starting at z~10. While the cluster-based star formation history is broadly consistent with the high past star formation rates derived from the diffuse host galaxy light, one potential discrepancy is a tentative ~2-3× higher rate in the cluster population for the past Gyr. Taken together with the spatial distribution and low inferred metallicities of these young-to-intermediate age clusters, we may be seeing direct evidence for the accretion of star clusters in addition to their early in-situ formation. The cluster masses are high, ~10^6-10^7~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, which may explain why we are able to detect them around this likely post-merger galaxy. Overall, the Relic clusters are consistent with being precursors of the most massive present-day GCs. This unique laboratory enables the first connection between long-lived, high-redshift clusters and local stellar populations, offering insights into the early stages of GC evolution and the broader processes of galaxy assembly.

&lt;p&gt;
The time-variable emission from the accretion flow of Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center, has long been examined in the radio-to-mm, near-infrared (NIR), and X-ray regimes of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, until now, sensitivity and angular resolution have been insufficient in the crucial mid-infrared (MIR) regime. The MIRI instrument on JWST has changed that, and we report the first MIR detection of Sgr A*. The detection was during a flare that lasted about 40 minutes, a duration similar to NIR and X-ray flares, and the source's spectral index steepened as the flare ended. The steepening suggests synchrotron cooling is an important process for Sgr A*'s variability and implies magnetic field strengths ~40&amp;ndash;70 Gauss in the emission zone. Observations at 1.3~mm with the Submillimeter Array revealed a counterpart flare lagging the MIR flare by ≈10 minutes. The observations can be self-consistently explained as synchrotron radiation from a single population of gradually cooling high-energy electrons accelerated through (a combination of) magnetic reconnection and/or magnetized turbulence.

We present the spectral analysis of J-138717, a post-starburst galaxy observed at z=1.8845 with JWST, for which we estimate a stellar mass M_* = 3.5±0.2×10^10M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and velocity dispersion &amp;sigma;_* = 198±10 km/s. From the fits of the NIRspec low-resolution prism and medium resolution grating spectra, we estimate an age of ~0.9 Gyr, a metallicity of ~ -0.3 dex, and a dust attenuation A_V ~ 0.7 mag. From the H&amp;alpha; and [OII] emission lines we derive a star-formation rate (SFR)~ 0.1 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1, corresponding to a specific SFR~ 4 × 10^-12 yr^-1. By reconstructing its SFH, we find that this galaxy formed most of its stellar mass quickly (0.4-0.8 Gyr) and then rapidly quenched about 0.4 Gyr lookback time. The analysis of the emission lines ([OII], [NeIII], [OIII], H&amp;alpha;, and [NII]) indicates a low-level residual star formation or a weak AGN as the ionization source. Further, the lack of evidence for ongoing outflows in both the absorption and emission lines tracing the neutral and ionized gas argues against the presence of strong AGN feedback. Thanks to the high quality of the data, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the NIR spectral indices. This is the first time NIR spectral indices have been investigated at such a high redshift. We find that the observed CO and CN indices are generally weak and in better agreement with models with a lower contribution from thermally pulsating (TP-)AGB stars, indicating that either TP-AGB stars do not contribute significantly to the spectrum of J-138717 or the prescriptions in the models for these evolved phases should be substantially improved. In general, we find that all models struggle to reproduce the NIR indices consistently, pointing to the importance of improving state-of-the-art stellar population models in the NIR, especially at young ages.

&lt;p&gt;
We compare the internal stellar structures of central galaxies in the TNG50 and TNG100 simulations and field galaxies in the CALIFA survey. The luminosity fractions of the dynamically cold, warm, and hot components in both TNG50 and TNG100 galaxies exhibit general consistency with those observed in CALIFA galaxies. For example, they all exhibit a minimum luminosity fraction of the dynamically hot component in galaxies with intermediate stellar masses, and the morphology of each orbital component in the TNG50 and TNG100 galaxies closely resembles that found in the CALIFA galaxies. We therefore use the simulations to quantify the physical origins of the different components, focusing on the dynamically hot component in TNG50. We identify three primary regimes and thus physical processes: (1) in low mass galaxies that have not experienced major mergers, stars are born with a wide range of circularity distributions and have remained relatively unchanged until the present day. Consequently, hot stars in such galaxies at redshift 0 are predominantly born hot. (2) In higher mass galaxies lacking major mergers, most stars are initially born cold but are subsequently heated through secular evolution. (3) In galaxies across the entire mass range, mergers, if they occurred, significantly increased the hot orbital fraction. As a result, the dynamically hot bulge within R_e of present-day galaxies does not indicate their past merger histories; instead, the hot stars in the outer regions are mostly heated or accreted by mergers, thus indicating galaxy merger history. The massive galaxies are initially born with cold, rotationally supported structures, consistent with recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) regarding high-redshift galaxies.

&lt;p&gt;
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently conducted observations of massive galaxies at high redshifts, revealing a notable anomaly in their star formation efficiency (SFE). Motivated by the recent identification of three ~ 10^6M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; dark star candidates, we investigate whether dark stars can be the origin of the SFE excess. It turns out that the excess can be reproduced by a group of dark stars with M ≳ 10^3  M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, because of their domination in generating primary UV radiation in high-redshift galaxies. The genesis of these dark stars is attributed to the capture of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) within a mass range of tens of GeV to a few TeV. However, if the top-heavy initial mass function of dark stars holds up to ~ 10^5M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, the relic black holes stemming from their collapse would be too abundant to be consistent with the current observations of Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). We thus suggest that just a small fraction of SFE excess may be contributed by the very massive dark stars and the majority likely originated from other reasons such as the Population III stars in view of their rather similar UV radiation efficiencies.

The formation time scales of quiescent galaxies can be estimated in two different ways: by their star formation history and by their chemistry. Previously, the methods yielded conflicting results, especially when considering &amp;alpha;-enhanced objects. This is primarily due to the time resolution limitations of very old stellar populations, which prevent accurately constraining their star formation histories. We analysed the JWST observations of the extremely massive galaxy ZF-UDS-7329 at z~3.2 and show that the higher time resolution necessary to match the chemical formation time scales using stellar population synthesis can be achieved by studying galaxies at high redshift. We compare the massive galaxy to the well-known relic galaxy NGC~1277, arguing that ZF-UDS-7329 is an early Universe example of the cores of present-day massive elliptical galaxies or, if left untouched, a relic galaxy.

We present the statistical properties of Ly&amp;alpha; emission in 586 galaxies at z=4.5-14.2, observed by multiple JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy projects, including JADES, GLASS, CEERS, and GO/DDT programs. We obtain Ly&amp;alpha; equivalent width (EW), Ly&amp;alpha; escape fraction, and ionizing photon production efficiency measurements or upper limits for these galaxies, and confirm that the Ly&amp;alpha; emitting galaxy fraction decreases towards higher redshifts. We derive Ly&amp;alpha; luminosity functions from z~ 5 to z~ 10-14 with the observed Ly&amp;alpha; EW distributions and galaxy UV luminosity functions, and find a ~3 dex decrease in number density at L_Ly&amp;alpha;=10^42-10^43 erg s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; over the redshift range. We obtain the neutral hydrogen fractions of x_HI=0.17_-0.16^+0.23, 0.63_-0.28^+0.18, 0.79_-0.21^+0.13, and 0.88_-0.13^+0.11 at z~6, 7, 8-9, and 10-14, respectively, via comparisons of the reionization models developed by semi-numerical simulations with 21cmFAST explaining the observations of Ly&amp;alpha;, UV continuum, and Planck electron optical depth. The high x_HI values over z~ 7-14 suggest a late and sharp reionization, with the primary reionization process occurring at z~ 6-7. Such a late and sharp reionization is not easily explained by either a clumpy inter-galactic medium or sources of reionization in a classical faint-galaxy or a bright-galaxy/AGN scenario, unless a very high escape fraction or AGN duty cycle is assumed at z~ 6-7.

&lt;p&gt;
The extended narrow line region (NLR) of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) provides a valuable laboratory for exploring the relationship between AGN and their host galaxies, often appearing as an ''ionization cone'' that can extend out to the very edge of the galaxy. We use new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam imaging to study the morphologies and sizes of NLRs traced by [O III] at cosmic noon (z~2-3), measurements which were previously only well-studied at z~0 with IFU spectroscopy. To determine NIRCam's ability to probe the properties of the NLR in cosmic noon galaxies, we present simulated images of AGN at z=2-3 created with archival data cubes from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) of nine nearby (z&amp;lt;0.05) AGN host galaxies with previously confirmed extended NLRs. Our simulated images show that NIRCam is able to resolve the morphologies of NLRs at z=2-3 with narrow- and medium-band observations. We then search for extended NLRs with NIRCam medium-band observations targeting the [O III] emission in twenty-seven previously identified AGN at z=2.4-3.4 in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey South (GOODS-S) field. We detect six galaxies in our observed sample with [O III] morphologies consistent with AGN ionization cones with characteristic NLR sizes of 1-2.5 kpc. Thanks to our simulated data, we can predict the effects of cosmological surface brightness dimming and instrument noise on the NLR size measurements at high redshift, which has the biasing effect of lowering the NLR size-AGN Luminosity trend that is observed at low redshift by a factor of ~ 2.

Transient astronomy in the early, high-redshift (z &amp;gt; 3) Universe is an unexplored regime that offers the possibility of probing the first stars and the Epoch of Reionization. During Cycles 1 and 2 of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program enabled one of the first searches for transients in deep images (~30 AB mag) over a relatively wide area (25 arcmin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). One transient, AT 2023adsv, was discovered with an F200W magnitude of 28.04 AB mag, and subsequent JWST observations revealed that the transient is a likely supernova (SN) in a host with z&lt;sub&gt;spec&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.613 +/- 0.001 and an inferred metallicity at the position of the SN of Z_* = 0.3 +/- 0.1 Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. At this redshift, the first detections in F115W and F150W show that AT 2023adsv had bright rest-frame ultraviolet flux at the time of discovery. The multi-band light curve of AT 2023adsv is best matched by a template of an SN IIP with a peak absolute magnitude of M_B ~ -18.3 AB mag. We find a good match to a 20 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; red supergiant progenitor star with an explosion energy of 2.0x10^51 ergs, likely higher than normally observed in the local Universe, but consistent with SNe IIP drawn from local, lower metallicity environments. AT 2023adsv is the most distant photometrically classified SN IIP yet discovered with a spectroscopic redshift measurement, and may represent a global shift in SNe IIP properties as a function of redshift.

Radio observations can provide crucial insight into the nature of a new abundant and mysterious population of dust-reddened active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), including "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). In this study, we search for radio bright sources in a large sample of ~700 JWST discovered AGN candidates (z~2-11) in the 0.144-3 GHz frequency range, utilizing deep radio imaging in COSMOS, GOODS-N, and GOODS-S. Only one source is significantly detected in our radio surveys, which is PRIMER-COS 3866 at z=4.66. Its radio properties are consistent with both an AGN and star formation origin with a spectral index of &amp;alpha;=-0.76^+0.11_-0.09 and a radio-loudness of R≈0.5. The derived brightness temperature limit of PRIMER-COS 3866 of T_b ≳ 10^3 K is too low to confirm its AGN nature. Our stacking results yield non-detections in all fields with the most constraining 3&amp;sigma; limit L_1.3GHz &amp;lt; 1.3×10^39 erg s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (rms of ~0.15 &amp;mu;Jy beam^-1 at z_median=6.1) obtained for photometrically selected AGN candidates in the COSMOS field. This result is still consistent with expectations from the empirical L_X - L_H&amp;alpha; and L_X - L_R correlations established for local AGN. We conclude that current radio observations have insufficient depth to claim JWST discovered AGN candidates are radio-weak. We project that future surveys carried out by the SKA and ngVLA should be able to obtain significant detections within a few hours, providing crucial measurements of their brightness temperature, which would allow for distinguishing between AGN and starburst-driven origins of this new abundant population.

We present a study of the size growth of the red sequence between 0.5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;3, tracing the evolution of quiescent galaxies in both effective half-light and half-mass radii using multi-wavelength JWST/NIRCam imaging provided by the PRIMER survey. Half-light radii are measured from imaging in 6 different filters for 455 quiescent galaxies with log(M_*/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;gt;10, whereas half-mass radii are derived from the F444W profiles together with the F277W-F444W color-M_*/L relation. We investigate the dependence of the ratio r_e, mass/r_e, light on redshift, stellar mass, and the wavelength used to measure r_e, light, also separating the sample into younger and older quiescent galaxies. Our data demonstrate that rest-frame infrared sizes accurately trace mass-weighted sizes while sizes measured at rest-frame optical wavelengths (0.5-0.7&amp;mu;m) are 0.1-0.2 dex larger, with only minor variations in redshift. We find that the average size of young quiescent galaxies agrees with that of old quiescent galaxies at intermediate masses, 10&amp;lt;log(M_*/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;lt;11, within their respective uncertainties in all observed-frame half-light, rest-frame half-light and half-mass radius measurements. At face value, our results point to a combination of progenitor bias and minor mergers driving the size growth of intermediate-mass quiescent galaxies at 0.5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;3. Our results further indicate that the varying contributions to the general quiescent population by young and old quiescent galaxies can mimic evolution in redshift.

&lt;p&gt;
Using JWST Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) images of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae (or NGC 104), taken at two epochs just 7 months apart, we derived proper-motion membership down to m_F322W2 ~ 27. We identified an intriguing feature at the very low-mass end of the main sequence, around ~ 0.08 solar masses, at magnitudes m_F322W2 ~ 24 and m_F150W2 ~ 25. This feature, dubbed "kink", is characterized by a prominent discontinuity in the slope of the main sequence. A similar discontinuity is seen in theoretical isochrones with oxygen-poor chemistries, related to the rapid onset of CH_4 absorption. We therefore hypothesize that the cluster hosts disproportionately more oxygen-poor stars near the bottom of the main sequence compared to the upper main sequence and the red giant branch. Our results show no strong or conclusive evidence of a rise in the brown dwarf luminosity function at faint magnitudes, in contrast to previous findings likely affected by faint red background galaxies. In our analysis, we accounted for this contamination by using proper motion membership.

Although the star formation process has been studied for decades, many important aspects of the physics involved remain unsolved. Recent advancement of instrumentation in the infrared, far-infrared and sub-millimetre wavelength regimes have contributed to a significantly improved understanding of processes in the interstellar medium (ISM) leading to star formation. The future of research on the ISM and star formation looks exciting with instruments like the JWST, ALMA, etc., already contributing to the topic by gathering high-resolution high-sensitivity data and with several larger ground- and space-bound facilities either being planned or constructed. India has a sizable number of astronomers engaged in research on topics related to the ISM and star formation. In this white paper invited by the Astronomical Society of India to prepare a vision document for Indian astronomy, we review the Indian contributions to the global understanding of the star formation process and suggest areas that require focused efforts both in creating observing facilities and in theoretical front in India, in order to improve the impact of our research in the coming decades.

We present first results of JWST Cycle 1 and 2 observations of Sgr A* using NIRCam taken simultaneously at 2.1 and 4.8 micron for a total of ~48 hours over seven different epochs in 2023 and 2024. We find correlated variability at 2.1 and 4.8 micron in all epochs, continual short-time scale (a few seconds) variability and epoch-to-epoch variable emission implying long-term ( ~days to months) variability of Sgr A*. A highlight of this analysis is the evidence for sub-minute, horizon-scale time variability of Sgr A*, probing inner accretion disk size scales. The power spectra of the light curves in each observing epoch also indicate long-term variable emission. With continuous observations, JWST data suggest that the flux of Sgr A* is fluctuating constantly. The flux density correlation exhibits a distinct break in the slope at ~3 mJy at 2.1 micron. The analysis indicates two different processes contributing to the variability of Sgr A*. Brighter emission trends towards shallower spectral indices than the fainter emission. Cross correlation of the light curves indicates for the first time, a time delay of 3 - 40 sec in the 4.8 micron variability with respect to 2.1 micron. This phase shift leads to loops in plots of flux density vs spectral index as the emission rises and falls. Modeling suggests that the synchrotron emission from the evolving, age-stratified electron population reproduces the shape of the observed light curves with a direct estimate of the magnetic field strengths in the range between 40-90 G, and upper cutoff energy, E_c, between 420 and 720 MeV.

We present the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey, a 77.2 hour Director's Discretionary Early Release Science Program. CEERS demonstrates, tests, and validates efficient extragalactic surveys using coordinated, overlapping parallel observations with the JWST instrument suite, including NIRCam and MIRI imaging, NIRSpec low (R~100) and medium (R~1000) resolution spectroscopy, and NIRCam slitless grism (R~1500) spectroscopy. CEERS targets the Hubble Space Telescope-observed region of the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) field, supported by a rich set of multiwavelength data. CEERS facilitated immediate community science in both of the extragalactic core JWST science drivers "First Light" and "Galaxy Assembly," including: 1) The discovery and characterization of large samples of galaxies at z &amp;gt;~ 10 from ~90 arcmin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of NIRCam imaging, constraining their abundance and physical nature; 2) Deep spectra of &amp;gt;1000 galaxies, including dozens of galaxies at 6&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;10, enabling redshift measurements and constraints on the physical conditions of star-formation and black hole growth via line diagnostics; 3) Quantifying the first bulge, bar and disk structures at z&amp;gt;3; and 4) Characterizing galaxy mid-IR emission with MIRI to study dust-obscured star-formation and supermassive black hole growth at z~1-3. As a legacy product for the community, the CEERS team has provided several data releases, accompanied by detailed notes on the data reduction procedures and notebooks to aid in reproducibility. In addition to an overview of the survey and quality of the data, we provide science highlights from the first two years with CEERS data.

Star-forming clumps have been found to significantly influence the star formation of gas-rich z&amp;gt;1 galaxies. Using public data from JWST/NIRCam (COSMOS-Web) and ALMA (FMOS-COSMOS), we study a sample of 32 massive (&amp;gt;10^10.5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) main-sequence galaxies at z&lt;sub&gt;spec&lt;/sub&gt;~1.5 with ~0.3 kpc resolution. We create composite morphological models consisting of bulge, disk, and clumps to fully 'deconstruct' the galaxy images. With the resulting measurements of the flux and size of these components, we find the following: (I)The combined contribution of clumps is 1-30&amp;percnt; towards the net star formation rate (SFR) of the host while contributing 1-20&amp;percnt; to its stellar mass. The clumps show a correlation between their stellar mass and SFR, but have an increased specific-SFR (sSFR) relative to the star-forming main sequence, with offsets ranging from 0≲&amp;Delta;logsSFR≲ 0.4. They feature star formation surface densities of 10^-2-10^2 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;/yr/kpc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, consistent with values observed in local star-forming and starburst galaxies. (II)The clumps span a large range of characteristic sizes (r_e~0.1-1 kpc) and stellar masses (~ 10^8.0-9.5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;). We estimate a mass-size relation (r_e&amp;prop;M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;^ 0.52±0.07) along with a stellar mass function (slope, &amp;alpha;=-1.85± 0.19), both suggesting a hierarchical nature similar to that expected in star-forming regions in local galaxies. (III)Our measurements agree with the properties of stellar clumps in z≳1 lensed systems, bridging the gap between lensed and unlensed studies by detecting structures at sub-kpc scales.(IV)Clumps are found to be preferentially located along spiral features visible primarily in the residual rest-frame near-IR images. In conclusion, we present an observation-based, coherent picture of star-forming clumps at z&amp;gt;1.

&lt;p&gt;
Recent JWST observations have revealed the prevalence of spiral structures at z &amp;gt; 1. Unlike in the local Universe, the origin and the consequence of spirals at this epoch remain unexplored. We use public JWST/NIRCam data from the COSMOS-Web survey to map spiral structures in eight massive (&amp;gt; 10^10.5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) star-forming galaxies at z&lt;sub&gt;spec&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 1.5. We present a method for systematically quantifying spiral arms at z&amp;gt;1, enabling direct measurements of flux distributions. Using rest-frame near-IR images, we construct morphological models accurately tracing spiral arms. We detect offsets (~ 0.2 - 0.8 kpc) between the rest-frame optical and near-IR flux distributions across most arms. Drawing parallels to the local Universe, we conclude that these offsets reflect the presence of density waves. For nine out of eighteen arms, the offsets indicate spiral shocks triggered by density waves. Five arms have offsets in the opposite direction and are likely associated with tidal interactions. For the remaining cases with no detected offsets, we suggest that stochastic 'clumpy' star formation is the primary driver of their formation. In conclusion, we find a multi-faceted nature of spiral arms at z &amp;gt; 1, similar to that in the local Universe.

&lt;p&gt; Jillian Bellovary &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I hypothesize a physical explanation for the "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The first star formation in the universe occurs in dense clusters, some of which may undergo runaway collapse and form an intermediate mass black hole. This process would appear as a very dense stellar system, with recurring tidal disruption events (TDEs) as stellar material is accreted by the black hole. Such a system would be compact, UV-emitting, and exhibit broad H-alpha emission. If runaway collapse is the primary mechanism for forming massive black hole seeds, this process could be fairly common and explain the large volume densities of LRDs. In order to match the predicted number density of runaway collapse clusters, the tidal disruption rate must be on the order of 10^-4 per year. A top-heavy stellar initial mass function may be required to match observations without exceeding the predicted LambdaCDM mass function. The TDE LRD hypothesis can be verified with followup JWST observations looking for TDE-like variability.

Early JWST observations have revealed substantial numbers of galaxies out to redshifts as high as z ≃ 14, reflecting a slow evolution of the galaxy UV luminosity function (LF) not anticipated by many models of galaxy evolution. It has also been discovered that fairly massive galaxies existed at early times, a finding again viewed as a challenge to our understanding of early galaxy growth or even &amp;Lambda;CDM cosmology. Here we develop and test a simple theoretical model which shows that these observations are unsurprising, but instead are arguably as expected if one assumes a non-evolving halo-mass dependent galaxy-formation efficiency consistent with that observed today. Crucially, this simple model matches the observed galaxy UV LF over the redshift range z ≃ 6-13 and the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) at z ≃ 6-8. When combined with new constraints on Lyman continuum escape and the ionizing photon production efficiency of early galaxies, our model also predicts the progress of cosmic hydrogen reionization consistent with current observational constraints. The requirement to fit both the UV LF and the GSMF breaks the degeneracy between mass-light ratio and star-formation efficiency, and our model only works if the typical mass-to-light ratio of galaxies increases systematically with redshift beyond z ≃ 6. However, at present this does not require changes to the IMF, cosmic dust, or any other new astrophysics. Rather, the current data can be reproduced simply by assuming ever-younger stellar populations consistent with a formation epoch at z ≃ 15. A key prediction of our model is thus that there should be a more rapid drop-off in the numbers of galaxy number density beyond z ≃ 15, where one can no longer appeal to ever younger ages to offset the precipitous descent of the halo mass function.

False-positive emission-line detections bias our understanding of astronomical sources; for example, falsely identifying z~3-4 passive galaxies as z&amp;gt;10 galaxies leads to incorrect number counts and flawed tests of cosmology. In this work, we provide a novel but simple tool to better quantify the detection of faint lines in interferometric data sets and properly characterize the underlying noise distribution. We demonstrate the method on three sets of archival observations of z&amp;gt;10 galaxy candidates, taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). By jackknifing the visibilities using our tool, jackknify, we create observation-specific noise realizations of the interferometric measurement set. We apply a line-finding algorithm to both the noise cubes and the real data and determine the likelihood that any given positive peak is a real signal by taking the ratio of the two sampled probability distributions. We show that the previously reported, tentative emission-line detections of these z&amp;gt;10 galaxy candidates are consistent with noise. We further expand upon the technique and demonstrate how to properly incorporate prior information on the redshift of the candidate from auxiliary data, such as from JWST. Our work highlights the need to achieve a significance of ≳ 5&amp;sigma; to confirm an emission line when searching in broad 30 GHz bandwidths. Using our publicly available method enables the quantification of false detection likelihoods, which are crucial for accurately interpreting line detections.

&lt;p&gt;
The James Webb Space Telescope has ushered in an era of abundant high-redshift observations of young stellar populations characterized by strong emission lines, motivating us to integrate nebular emission into the new Maraston stellar population model which incorporates the latest Geneva stellar evolutionary tracks for massive stars with rotation. We use the photoionization code Cloudy to obtain the emergent nebular continuum and line emission for a range of modelling parameters, then compare our results to observations on various emission line diagnostic diagrams. We carry out a detailed comparison with several other models in the literature assuming different input physics, including modified prescriptions for stellar evolution and the inclusion of binary stars, and find close agreement in the H&amp;beta;, H&amp;alpha;, [N II]&amp;lambda; 6583, and [S II]&amp;lambda; 6731 luminosities between the models. However, we find significant differences in lines with high ionization energies, such as He II&amp;lambda;1640 and [O III]&amp;lambda; 5007, due to large variations in the hard ionizing photon production rates. The models differ by a maximum of \hatQ_[O III]&amp;lambda; 5007 = 6 × 10^9  s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;   M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;^-1, where these differences are mostly caused by the assumed stellar rotation and effective temperatures for the Wolf Rayet phase. Interestingly, rotation and uncorrected effective temperatures in our single star population models alone generate [O III] ionizing photon production rates higher than models including binary stars with ages between 1 to 8 Myr. These differences highlight the dependence of derived properties from SED fitting on the assumed model, as well as the sensitivity of predictions from cosmological simulations.

&lt;p&gt;
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is unveiling the rest-frame near-IR structure of galaxies. We measure the evolution with redshift of the rest-frame optical and near-IR S\'ersic index (n), and examine the dependence on stellar mass and star-formation activity across the redshift range 0.5≤ z≤2.5. We infer rest-frame near-IR S\'ersic profiles for ≈ 15.000 galaxies in publicly available NIRCam imaging mosaics from the COSMOS-Web and PRIMER surveys. We augment these with rest-frame optical S\'ersic indices, previously measured from HST imaging mosaics. The median S\'ersic index evolves slowly or not at all with redshift, except for very high-mass galaxies (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 10^11~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;), which show an increase from n≈ 2.5 to n≈ 4 at z&amp;lt;1. High-mass galaxies have higher n than lower-mass galaxies (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;=10^9.5~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) at all redshifts, with a stronger dependence in the rest-frame near-IR than in the rest-frame optical at z&amp;gt;1. This wavelength dependence is caused by star-forming galaxies that have lower optical than near-IR n at z&amp;gt;1 (but not at z&amp;lt;1). Both at optical and near-IR wavelengths, star-forming galaxies have lower n than quiescent galaxies, fortifying the connection between star-formation activity and radial stellar mass distribution. At z&amp;gt;1 the median near-IR n varies strongly with star formation activity, but not with stellar mass. The scatter in near-IR n is higher in the green valley (0.25 dex) than on the star-forming sequence and among quiescent galaxies (0.18 dex) &amp;ndash; this trend is not seen in the optical because dust and young stars contribute to the variety in optical light profiles. Our newly measured rest-frame near-IR radial light profiles motivate future comparisons with radial stellar mass profiles of simulated galaxies as a stringent constraint on processes that govern galaxy formation.

&lt;p&gt;
The total deuterium abundance [D/H] in the universe is set by just two processes: the creation of deuterium in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis at an abundance of [D/H]=2.58±0.13×10^-5, and its destruction within stellar interiors. Measurements of the total [D/H] abundance can potentially provide a probe of Galactic chemical evolution, however, most measurements of [D/H] are only sensitive to the gas-phase deuterium, and the amount of deuterium sequestered in carbonaceous dust grains is debated. With the launch of JWST, it is now possible to measure the gas-phase [D/H] at unprecedented sensitivity and distances through observation of mid-IR lines of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and HD. We employ data from the JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS) program to measure the gas-phase [D/H] abundance with a rotation diagram analysis towards 5 nearby low-mass and 5 distant high-mass protostellar outflows. The gas-phase [D/H] varies between low-mass sources by up to a factor of ~4, despite these sources likely having formed in a region of the Galactic disk that would be expected to have nearly constant total [D/H]. Most measurements of gas-phase [D/H] from our work or previous studies produce [D/H] ≲ 1.0×10^-5, a factor of 2-4 lower than found from local UV absorption lines and as expected from Galactic chemical evolution models. The variations in [D/H] between our low-mass sources and the low [D/H] with respect to Galactic chemical evolution models suggest that our observations are not sensitive to the total [D/H]. Significant depletion of deuterium onto carbonaceous dust grains is a possible explanation, and tentative evidence of enhanced [D/H] towards shock positions with higher gas-phase Fe abundance is seen in the HH 211 outflow. Deeper observations of HD and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in shocked environments and modelling of dust-grain destruction are warranted to test for the effects of depletion.

The high-redshift UV luminosity function provides important insights into the evolution of early galaxies. JWST has revealed an unexpectedly large population of bright (M_UV ≲ -20) galaxies at z≳10, implying fundamental changes in the star forming properties of galaxies at increasingly early times. However, constraining the fainter population (M_UV ≳ -18) has been more challenging. In this work, we present the z≳9 UV luminosity function from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey. We calculate the UV luminosity function from several hundred z≳9 galaxy candidates that reach UV luminosities of M_UV~-17 in redshift bins of z~9-12 (309 candidates) and z~12-16 (63 candidates). We search for candidates at z~16-22.5 and find none. We also estimate the z~14-16 luminosity function from the z≥14 subset of the z~12-16 sample. Consistent with other measurements, we find an excess of bright galaxies that is in tension with many theoretical models, especially at z≳12. However, we also find high number densities at -18≲ M_UV ≲-17, suggesting that there is a larger population of faint galaxies than expected, as well as bright ones. From our parametric fits for the luminosity function, we find steep faint end slopes of -2.5≲&amp;alpha;≲-2.3, suggesting a large population of faint (M_UV ≳ -17) galaxies. Combined, the high normalization and steep faint end slope of the luminosity function could imply that the reionization process is appreciably underway as early as z=10.

&lt;p&gt;
Star clusters, including high-mass stars, form within hub-filament systems (HFSs). Observations of HFSs that remain unaffected by feedback from embedded stars are rare yet crucial for understanding the mass inflow process in high-mass star formation. Using the JWST NIRCAM images, Dewangan et al. 2024, reported that the high-mass protostar G11P1 is embedded in a candidate HFS (G11P1-HFS; &amp;lt;0.6 pc). Utilizing ALMA N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H^+(1-0) data, we confirm the presence of G11P1-HFS and study the dense gas kinematics. We analyzed the position-position-velocity (PPV) map and estimated on-sky velocity gradient (V_g) and gravity (F_g) vectors. The spatial distribution of gas velocity and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; column density was examined. The steep V_g of 5 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; pc^-1 and -7 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; pc^-1 toward either side of G11P1-hub, and the decreasing V_g toward the hub, identify G11P1-HFS as a small-scale HFS in its nascent phase. V_g and F_g align along the filaments, indicating gravity-driven flows. This work highlights the wiggled, funnel-shaped morphology of a HFS in PPV space, suggesting the importance of subfilaments or transverse gas flows in mass transportation to the hub.

&lt;p&gt;
We present an observational study of the S284-RE region, a low-metallicity area associated with the extended S284 HII region. A thermally supercritical filament (mass ~2402 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, length ~8.5 pc) is investigated using the Herschel column density map. The Spitzer ratio 4.5 &amp;mu;m/3.6 &amp;mu;m map traces the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; outflows in this filament, where previously reported young stellar objects (YSOs) are spatially distributed. Analysis of the YSO distribution has revealed three active star-forming clusters (YCl1, YCl2, YCl3) within the filament. YCl3 seems to be the most evolved, YCl2 the youngest, while YCl1 displays signs of non-thermal fragmentation. The JWST (F470N+F444W)/F356W ratio map reveals at least seven bipolar H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; outflows, with four (olc1&amp;ndash;olc4) in YCl1 and three (ol1&amp;ndash;ol3) in YCl2. The driving sources of these outflows are identified based on outflow geometry, ALMA continuum peaks, and YSO positions. Two ALMA continuum sources, #2 and #3, from the M-R_eff plot are recognized as potential massive star formation candidates. The ALMA continuum source #2 hosts at least three outflow-driving sources, whereas the ALMA continuum source #3 contains two. The bipolar outflow olc1, driven by an embedded object within the continuum source #2, is likely a massive protostar, as indicated by Br-&amp;alpha; and PAH emissions depicted in the JWST (F405N+F444W)/F356W ratio map. The presence of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; knots in the outflows olc1 and ol1 suggests episodic accretion. Overall, the study investigates a massive protostar candidate, driving the ~2.7 pc H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; outflow olc1 and undergoing episodic accretion.

First stars powered by dark matter (DM) heating instead of fusion can appear in the early Universe from theories of new physics. These dark stars (DSs) can be significantly larger and cooler than early Population III stars, and could seed supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We show that neutrino emission from supermassive DSs provides a novel window into probing SMBH progenitors. We estimate first DS constraints using data from Super-Kamiokande and IceCube neutrino experiments, and consistent with James Webb Space Telescope observations. Upcoming neutrino telescopes offer distinct opportunities to further explore DS properties.

&lt;p&gt;
We present a new description of the 7.7~&amp;mu;m region towards the high-mass star-forming region IRAS 23385+6053 taken from open James Webb Space Telescope Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium Resolution Spectrometer (JWST MIRI/MRS) data. This area is commonly attributed to the &amp;nu;_4 deformation mode of methane ice. For the first time gaseous and solid methane were analyzed simultaneously in IRAS 23385+6053. The band at 7.58&amp;ndash;7.8 &amp;mu;m (1320&amp;ndash;1280 cm^-1) is interpreted as a wide solid absorption methane feature overlapped by the sharp features of the methane emission. We report the detection of gaseous methane and estimate its emitting area radius~R, temperature~T and column density~N as R=2940~au, T=103^+13_-11~K, and N=0.78_+6.18^-0.64×10^17~cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, correspondingly. The ice content was analyzed with the laboratory spectra dataset of methane in different molecular environments obtained on the Ice Spectroscopy Experimental Aggregate (ISEAge). We were able to describe the wide feature of solid methane with the following laboratory spectra: CH_4~:~CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;~=~1~:~5 (at 27.4^+6.0_-10.8~K) and CH_4~:~H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O~=~1~:~10 (at 8.4^+16.4_-1.7~K) deposited at 6.7~K and warmed up at a rate of 0.5 K per minute. The derived column densities are N_CH_4(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)~=~2.97^+0.37_-0.57×10^17~cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and N_CH_4(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)~=~1.02^+0.46_-0.27×10^17~cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. According to the best fit solid methane is mostly surrounded by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rather than H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The residuals analysis reveals the unassigned region at 1283&amp;ndash;1297~cm^-1 (7.71&amp;ndash;7.79~&amp;mu;m) which is tentatively assigned to nitrous oxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) in various environments.

Dwarf galaxies are thought of as the building blocks of large galaxies such as our Milky Way. This paper presents new high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies and their intergalactic medium with the ttGIZMO code. Our simulations consider the key physical processes of galaxy evolution, such as gas cooling, chemistry, and stellar and black hole feedback. Unlike the previous work, the initial conditions of our simulations taking the dwarf galaxies of 2-5 × 10^10   M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; from the realistic cosmology simulations, ttIllustrisTNG. We further increase the original resolution of ttIllustrisTNG by a factor of ~ 100 via a particle splitting scheme. Our results show that the evolution of complex multiphase CGM and its metal content is sensitive to the redshift of dwarf galaxies. The accretion of CGM into dwarf galaxies plays a key role in providing 20 &amp;percnt; - 50 &amp;percnt; of the star-forming gas and replenishing 40 &amp;percnt; - 70 &amp;percnt; of the total mass in the galactic disk. Furthermore, the accretion history of supermassive black holes in the centers of high-z dwarf galaxies shows episodic patterns with high-accreting states close to ~ 10 &amp;percnt; of the Eddington mass accretion rate, implying the rapid growth of supermassive black holes in the early universe, which may be revealed by the coming observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope revealed a surprisingly large number of galaxies formed at high redshift. Along with strong lensing studies and nearby galaxy observations, these could challenge the standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmology with a power-law primordial power spectrum. In this study, we conduct high-resolution cosmological zoom-in dark matter-only simulations of Milky Way host size halos with a blue, tilted primordial power spectrum (P(k)&amp;prop; k^m_s with m_s&amp;gt;1 at small scales &amp;gt;1~Mpc^-1). We find that the blue-tilted subhalo mass functions can be enhanced by more than a factor of two for subhalo masses M_sub ≲ 10^10~ M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, whereas the subhalo V_max functions can be enhanced by a factor of four for maximum circular velocities V_max≲ 30 ~km/s. The blue-tilted scaled cumulative substructure fraction can be an order of magnitude higher at ~10&amp;percnt; of the virial radius. The blue-tilted subhalos also have higher central densities, since the blue-tilted subhalos reach the same V_max at a smaller distance R_max from the center. We have also verified these findings with higher-resolution simulations.

We report the detection of the [O III] auroral line in 42 galaxies within the redshift range of 3 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 10. These galaxies were selected from publicly available JWST data releases, including the JADES and PRIMALsurveys, and observed using both the low-resolution PRISM/CLEAR configuration and medium-resolution gratings. The measured electron temperatures in the high-ionization regions of these galaxies range from T_e([O III]) = 12,000 to 24,000 K, consistent with temperatures observed in local metal-poor galaxies and previous JWST studies. In 10 galaxies, we also detect the [O II] auroral line, allowing us to determine electron temperatures in the low-ionization regions, which range between T_e([O II]) = 10,830 and 20,000 K. The direct-T_e-based metallicities of our sample span from 12 + log(O/H) = 7.2 to 8.4, indicating these high-redshift galaxies are relatively metal-poor. By combining our sample with 25 galaxies from the literature, we expand the dataset to a total of 67 galaxies within 3 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 10, effectively more than doubling the previous sample size for direct-T_e based metallicity studies. This larger dataset allow us to derive empirical metallicity calibration relations based exclusively on high-redshift galaxies, using six key line ratios: R3, R2, R23, Ne3O2, O32, and O3N2. Notably, we derive a novel metallicity calibration relation for the first time using high-redshift T_e-based metallicities: \hatR = 0.18log R2 + 0.98log R3. This new calibration significantly reduces the scatter in high-redshift galaxies compared to the \hatR relation previously calibrated for low-redshift galaxies.

&lt;p&gt;
Supermassive black holes are prevalent at the centers of massive galaxies, and their masses scale with galaxy properties, increasing evidence suggesting that these trends continue to low stellar masses. Seeds are needed for supermassive black holes, especially at the highest redshifts explored by the James Webb Space Telescope. We study the hierarchical merging of galaxies via cosmological merger trees and argue that the seeds of supermassive black holes formed in nuclear star clusters via stellar black hole mergers at early epochs. Observable tracers include intermediate-mass black holes, nuclear star clusters, and early gas accretion in host dwarf galaxies, along with a potentially detectable stochastic gravitational wave background, ejection of intermediate and supermassive black holes, and consequences of a significant population of tidal disruption events and extreme-mass ratio inspirals.

&lt;p&gt;
We present JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of the z=7.152 galaxy system B14-65666, as part of the GA-NIFS survey. Line and continuum emission in this massive system (log10(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/Msol)=9.8+/-0.2) is resolved into two strong cores, two weaker clumps, and a faint arc, as seen in recent JWST/NIRCam imaging. Our dataset contains detections of [OII]3727,3729, [NeIII]3869,3968, Balmer lines (HBeta, HGamma, HDelta, HEpsilon, HZeta), [OIII]5007, and weak [OIII]4363. Each spectrum is fit with a model that consistently incorporates interstellar medium conditions (i.e., electron temperature, T_e, electron density, n_e, and colour excess, E(B-V)). The resulting line fluxes are used to constrain the gas-phase metallicity (~0.3-0.4 solar) and HBeta-based SFR (310+/-40 Msol/yr) for each region. Common line ratio diagrams (O32-R23, R3-R2, Ne3O2-R23) reveal that each line-emitting region lies at the intersection of local and high-redshift galaxies, suggesting low ionisation and higher metallicity compared to the predominantly lower-mass galaxies studied with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU so far at z&amp;gt;5.5. Spaxel-by-spaxel fits reveal evidence for both narrow (FWHM&amp;lt;400 km/s) and broad (FWHM &amp;gt;500 km/s) line emission, the latter of which likely represents tidal interaction or outflows. Comparison to ALMA [CII]158um and [OIII]88um data shows a similar velocity structure, and optical-far infrared diagnostics suggest regions of high Lyman continuum escape fraction and n_e. This source lies on the mass-metallicity relation at z&amp;gt;4, suggesting an evolved nature. The two core galaxies show contrasting properties (e.g., SFR, M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;, gas-phase metallicity), suggesting distinct evolutionary pathways. Combining the NIRSpec IFU and ALMA data sets, our analysis opens new windows into the merging system B14-65666.

We present a structural analysis of 521 galaxy candidates at 6.5 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 12.5, with SNR &amp;gt; 10&amp;sigma; in the F444W filter, taken from the EPOCHS v1 sample, consisting of uniformly reduced deep JWST NIRCam data, covering the CEERS, JADES GOOD-S, NGDEEP, SMACS0723, GLASS and PEARLS surveys. We use standard software to fit single S\'ersic models to each galaxy in the rest-frame optical and extract their parametric structural parameters (S\'ersic index, half-light radius and axis-ratio), and ttMorfometryka to measure their non-parametric concentration and asymmetry parameters. We find a wide range of sizes for these early galaxies, but with a strong galaxy-size mass correlation up to z ~ 12 such that galaxy sizes continue to get progressively smaller in the high-redshift regime, following R_e = 2.74 ± 0.49 ≤ft( 1 + z ) ^-0.79 ± 0.08 kpc. Using non-parametric methods we find that galaxy merger fractions, classified through asymmetry parameters, at these redshifts remain consistent with those in literature, maintaining a value of f_m ~ 0.12 ± 0.07 showing little dependence with redshift when combined with literature at z &amp;gt; 4. We find that galaxies which are smaller in size also appear rounder, with an excess of high axis-ratio objects. Finally, we artificially redshift a subsample of our objects to determine how robust the observational trends we see are, determining that observed trends are due to real evolutionary effects, rather than being a consequence of redshift effects.

&lt;p&gt;
As part of the guaranteed time observations program Mid-Infrared Characterization Of Nearby Iconic galaxy Centers (MICONIC), we used the medium-resolution spectrometer (MRS) of the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on board of the JWST to study the nearby merger NGC6240. We aim to characterise the dual active galactic nuclei (AGN), the ionised gas outflows and the main properties of the interstellar medium over a mapped area of 6.6"x7.7". We obtained integral field spectroscopic mid-infrared data of NGC6240, resolving both nuclei for the first time in the full 5-28&amp;mu;m spectral range. We modelled the emission lines through a kinematic decomposition, finding that the fine-structure lines in the southern (S) nucleus are broader than for the northern (N) nucleus (full width at half maximum of ≥1500 vs ~700 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; on average). High excitation lines, such as [NeV], [NeVI], and [MgV], are clearly detected in the N nucleus. In the S nucleus, the same lines can be detected but only after a decomposition of the PAH features in the integrated spectrum, due to a combination of a strong mid-IR continuum, the broad emission lines, and the intense star formation (SF). The SF is distributed all over the mapped FoV of 3.5kpc x 4.1kpc (projected), with the maximum located around the S nucleus. Both nuclear regions appear to be connected by a bridge region detected with all the emission lines. Based on the observed MRS line ratios and the high velocity dispersion (&amp;sigma;~600 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), shocks are also dominating the emission in this system. We detected the presence of outflows as a bubble north-west from the N nucleus and at the S nucleus. We estimated a ionised mass outflow rate of 1.4±0.3 M yr^-1 and 1.8±0.2 M yr^-1, respectively. Given the derived kinetic power of these outflows, both the AGN and the starburst could have triggered them. [Abridged]

Merger events are thought to be an important phase in the assembly of massive galaxies. At the same time, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) play a fundamental role in the evolution of their star formation histories. Both phenomena can be observed at work in NGC 6240, a local prototypical merger, classified as an UltraLuminous InfraRed Galaxy (ULIRG) thanks to its elevated infrared luminosity. Interestingly, NGC 6240 hosts two AGN separated by 1.5''(~ 735 pc), detected in both X-ray and radio band. Taking advantage of the unprecedented sensitivity and wavelength coverage provided by the Integral Field Unit (IFU) of the NIRSpec instrument onboard JWST, we observed the nuclear region of NGC 6240 in a FoV of 3.7'' x 3.7''(1.9 x 1.9 kpc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), to investigate gas kinematics and InterStellar Medium (ISM) properties with a high spatial resolution of ~ 0.1'' (or ~ 50 pc). We separated the different gas kinematic components through multi-Gaussian fitting and studied the excitation properties of the ISM from the NIR diagnostic diagram based on the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 1-0 S(1)/BrGamma and [Fe II]1.257micron/PaBeta lines ratios. We isolated the ionization cones of the two nuclei, and detected coronal lines emission from both of them. Using H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; line ratios, we found that the molecular hydrogen gas is excited mostly by thermal processes. We computed a hot molecular gas mass of 1.3 x 10^5 M_sun and an ionized gas mass in the range of 10^5 - 10^7 M_sun. We studied with unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity the kinematics of the molecular and ionized gas phases. We revealed the complex structure of the molecular gas and found a blueshifted outflow near the Southern nucleus, together with filaments connecting a highly redshifted H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cloud with the two nuclei. We speculate on the possible nature of this H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cloud and propose two possible scenarios: either outflowing gas, or a tidal cloud falling onto the nuclei.

The Ly&amp;alpha; emission line is a characteristic feature found in high-z galaxies, serving as a probe of cosmic reionization. While previous works present various correlations between Ly&amp;alpha; emission and physical properties of host galaxies, it is still unclear which characteristics predominantly determine the Ly&amp;alpha; emission. In this study, we introduce a neural network approach to simultaneously handle multiple properties of galaxies. The neural-network-based prediction model that identifies Ly&amp;alpha; emitters (LAEs) from six physical properties: star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass, UV absolute magnitude M_UV, age, UV slope &amp;beta;, and dust attenuation E(B-V), obtained by the SED fitting. The network is trained with galaxy samples from the VANDELS and MUSE spectroscopic surveys and achieves the performance of 77% true positive rate and 14% false positive rate. The permutation feature importance method shows that &amp;beta;, M_UV, and M_* are important for the prediction of LAEs. As an independent validation, we find that 91% of LAEs spectroscopically confirmed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have a probability of LAE higher than 70% in this model. This prediction model enables the efficient construction of a large LAE sample in a wide and continuous redshift space using only photometric data. We apply the prediction model to the JWST photometric galaxy sample and obtain Ly&amp;alpha; fraction consistent with previous studies. Moreover, we demonstrate that the difference between the distributions of LAEs predicted by the model and the spectroscopically identified LAEs provides a strong constraint on the HII bubble size.

&lt;p&gt;
We present the initial results of MEAD (Measuring Extinction and Abundances of Dust), with a focus on the dust extinction features observed in our JWST near- and mid-infrared spectra of nine diffuse Milky Way sightlines (1.2 ≤ A(V) ≤ 2.5). For the first time, we find strong correlations between the 10 &amp;mu;m silicate feature strength and the column densities of Mg, Fe and O in dust. This is consistent with the well-established theory that Mg- and Fe-rich silicates are responsible for this feature. We obtained an average stoichiometry of the silicate grains in our sample of Mg:Fe:O = 1.1:1:11.2, constraining the grain composition. We find variations in the feature properties, indicating that different sightlines contain different types of silicates. In the average spectrum of our sample, we tentatively detect features around 3.4 and 6.2 &amp;mu;m, which are likely caused by aliphatic and aromatic/olefinic hydrocarbons, respectively. If real, to our knowledge, this is the first detection of hydrocarbons in purely diffuse sightlines with A(V) ≤ 2.5, confirming the presence of these grains in diffuse environments. We detected a 3 &amp;mu;m feature toward HD073882, and tentatively in the sample average, likely caused by water ice (or solid-state water trapped on silicate grains). If confirmed, to our knowledge, this is the first detection of ice in purely diffuse sightlines with A(V) ≤ 2.5, supporting previous findings that these molecules can exist in the diffuse ISM.

&lt;p&gt;
Early JWST observations are providing growing evidence for a ubiquitous population of accreting supermassive black holes (BHs) at high redshift, many of which appear overmassive compared to the empirically-derived local scaling relation between black hole mass and host galaxy stellar mass. In this study, we leverage predictions from the semi-analytical Cosmic Archaeology Tool (CAT) to reconstruct the evolutionary pathways for this overmassive BH population, investigating how they assemble over cosmic time and interact with their host galaxies. We find that the large M_BH-M_star ratios can be explained if light and heavy BH seeds grow by short, repeated episodes of super-Eddington accretion, triggered by major galaxy mergers. On average, we find that BH-galaxy co-evolution starts in earnest only at z &amp;lt; 8, when ≃ 30&amp;percnt; of the final galaxy stellar mass has formed outside the massive black hole host. Our model suggests that super-Eddington bursts of accretion last between 0.5-3 Myr, resulting in a duty cycle of 1-4 &amp;percnt; for the target BH sample. The boost in luminosity of BHs undergoing super-Eddington accretion helps explaining the luminosity function of Active Galactic Nuclei observed by JWST. At the same time, a large population of these overmassive BHs are predicted to be inactive, with Eddington ratio &amp;lambda;_Edd &amp;lt; 0.05, in agreement with recent observations.

"Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) are an abundant high-redshift population newly discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). They are characterized by a red color in the rest-frame optical band, compact morphology, and broad Balmer emission lines (FWHM ≳ 1000~km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) that suggest an AGN nature. Using a method of pixel-by-pixel color selection and relaxing the compactness criteria, we identify three of the first dual LRD candidates in the COSMOS-Web survey with projected separations of 0.\!\!^&amp;Prime;2-0.\!\!^&amp;Prime;4 (1-2 pkpc at their photometric redshifts). A comparison between existing LRD samples and mock data reveals that the projected separations of these dual LRD candidates are unlikely to result from chance projections of objects at different redshifts. In one case (CW-B5-15958), the dual LRD includes two bright sources (m_F444W=24.3 and 24.8) with characteristic V-shape spectral energy distribution (SEDs) and photometric redshifts consistent with each other. We find that CW-B5-15958 has a faint off-centered component and a companion galaxy. In the other two dual systems, the brighter LRD exhibits a V-shape SED, while the fainter LRD (m_F444W≳26) is undetected in both F115W and F150W. These discoveries suggest that the angular auto-correlation function (ACF) of LRDs exhibits a significant excess (~3×10^2 times) on sub-arcsec (kilo-parsec) separations compared to the extrapolation of a power-law ACF of JWST-found AGNs measured over 10^&amp;Prime;-100^&amp;Prime;. Follow-up spectroscopic confirmation of their redshifts and the construction of a larger sample are essential to advance our understanding of the evolution of supermassive black holes and the importance of mergers in the early universe.

We report the discovery of an ultra-massive grand-design red spiral galaxy, named Zh\'ul\'ong (Torch Dragon), at z&lt;sub&gt;phot&lt;/sub&gt; = 5.2^+0.3_-0.2 in the JWST PANORAMIC survey, identified as the most distant bulge+disk galaxy candidate with spiral arms known to date. Zh\'ul\'ong displays an extraordinary combination of properties: 1) a classical bulge centered in a large, face-on exponential stellar disk (half-light radius of R_e = 3.7 ± 0.1   kpc), with spiral arms extending across 19 kpc; 2) a clear transition from the red, quiescent core (F150W-F444W=3.1 mag) with high stellar mass surface density (log(&amp;Sigma; M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;   kpc^-2) = 9.91_-0.09^+0.11) to the star-forming outer regions, as revealed by spatially resolved SED analysis, which indicates significant inside-out galaxy growth; 3) an extremely high stellar mass at its redshift, with log (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;)=11.03_-0.08^+0.10 comparable to the Milky Way, and an implied baryon-to-star conversion efficiency (&amp;epsilon; ~ 0.3) that is 1.5 times higher than even the most efficient galaxies at later epochs; 4) despite an active disk, a relatively modest overall star formation rate (SFR =66_-46^+89 ~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;   yr^-1), which is &amp;gt;0.5 dex below the star formation main sequence at z ~ 5.2 and &amp;gt;10 times lower than ultra-massive dusty galaxies at z=5-6. Altogether, Zh\'ul\'ong shows that mature galaxies emerged much earlier than expected in the first billion years after the Big Bang through rapid galaxy formation and morphological evolution. Our finding offers key constraints for models of massive galaxy formation and the origin of spiral structures in the early universe.

Direct-detection searches for dark matter are insensitive to dark matter particles that have large interactions with ordinary matter, which are stopped in the atmosphere or the Earth's crust before reaching terrestrial detectors. We use "dark'' calibration images taken with the HgCdTe detectors in the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to derive novel constraints on sub-GeV dark matter candidates that scatter off electrons. We supplement the JWST analysis pipeline with additional masks to remove pixels with high-energy background events. For a 0.4% subcomponent of dark matter that interacts with an ultralight dark photon, we disfavor all previously allowed parameter space at high cross sections, and constrain some parameter regions for subcomponent fractions as low as ~0.01%.

We investigate the deconvolved color profiles of 223 disk galaxies at redshifts of z=1-3 observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as part of the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science survey (CEERS). The filters were selected to approximate the rest-frame B-Y color, which is used to identify U-shaped color profiles &amp;ndash; those becoming progressively bluer with increasing radius, then turning redder beyond a specific point. We find that 36% of Type II (down-bending) disks exhibit U-shaped color profiles with a minimum at or near the disk break. In contrast, no Type I (single-exponential) disks and only 9% of Type III (up-bending) disks show such a profile. The presence of U-shaped color profiles in Type II disks likely arises from the interplay between a star-formation threshold and spiral- or bar-driven secular radial migration of older stars outward. The fraction of Type II disks exhibiting a U-shaped color profile remains almost consistent across two redshift bins, z=1-2 and z=2-3, but is significantly lower than that observed in the local Universe, likely because the secular process of radial migration at high redshift may not have had sufficient time to significantly influence the disk structure. The absence of U-shaped color profiles in Type II disks could point to rapid rather than secular radial star migration potentially caused by violent clump instabilities, transporting both younger and older stars to the outer disk. Our results provide useful constraints on the formation and evolution models of disk galaxies in the early Universe.

&lt;p&gt;
This paper presents a deep MIRI/JWST medium resolution spectroscopy (MRS) covering the rest-frame optical spectrum of the GN-z11 galaxy. The [OIII]5008 and H&amp;alpha; emission lines are detected and spectroscopically resolved. The line profiles are well-modeled by a narrow Gaussian component with intrinsic FWHMs of 189±25 and 231±52 kms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. We do not find any evidence of a dominant broad H&amp;alpha; emission line component tracing a Broad Line Region in a type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, a broad (~430-470 kms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and weak (&amp;lt; 20-30%) H&amp;alpha; line component, tracing a minor AGN contribution in the optical, cannot be ruled out completely with the sensitivity of the present data. The physical and excitation properties of the ionized gas are consistent with a low-metallicity starburst forming stars at a rate of SFR(H&amp;alpha;)=24 ±3M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;yr^-1. The electron temperature of the ionized gas is T_e(O^++)=14000±2100K, while the direct-T_e gas-phase metallicity is 12+log(O/H)=7.91±0.07 (Z=0.17±0.03Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;). The optical line ratios locate GN-z11 in the starburst or AGN region but more consistent with those of local low-metallicity starbursts and high-z luminous galaxies detected at redshifts similar to GN-z11. We conclude that the MRS optical spectrum of GN-z11 is consistent with that of a massive, compact, and low-metallicity starburst galaxy. Due to its high SFR and stellar mass surface densities, close to that of the densest stellar clusters, we speculate that GN-z11 could be undergoing a feedback-free, highly efficient starburst phase. Additional JWST data are needed to validate this scenario, and other recently proposed alternatives, to explain the existence of bright compact galaxies in the early Universe.

&lt;p&gt;
We present a study of a double-peaked Ly&amp;alpha; emitter, named LAE-11, found in the proximity zone of QSO J0910-0414 at z~6.6. We use a combination of deep photometric data from Subaru Telescope, HST, and JWST with spectroscopic data from Keck/DEIMOS, NIRCam WFSS and NIRSpec MSA to characterise the ionising and general properties of the galaxy, as well as the quasar environment surrounding it. We detect Ly&amp;alpha;, H&amp;beta;, [OIII] doublet, and H&amp;alpha; emission lines in the various spectral datasets. The presence of a double-peaked Ly&amp;alpha; line in the spectrum allows us to characterise the opening angle and lifetime of the QSO as &amp;theta;_Q&amp;gt;49.62\deg and t_Q &amp;gt; 3.8×10^5 years. LAE-11 is a fairly bright (M_UV = -19.84^+0.14_-0.16), blue galaxy with a UV slope of &amp;beta; = -2.61^+0.06_-0.08. Since the galaxy is located in a quasar-ionised region, we have a unique opportunity to measure the escape fraction of Lyman Continuum photons using the un-attenuated double-peaked Ly&amp;alpha; emission profile and its equivalent width at such high redshift. We employ diagnostics which do not rely on the detection of Ly&amp;alpha; for comparison, and find that all tracers of ionising photon leakage agree within 1&amp;sigma; uncertainty. We measure a moderate escape of Lyman Continuum photons from LAE-11 of f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt;^LyC = (8 - 33)&amp;percnt;. Detections of both H&amp;alpha; and H&amp;beta; emission lines allow for separate measurements of the ionising photon production efficiency, resulting with log( &amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt; /Hz~erg^-1) = 25.59±0.08 and 25.65±0.09, for H&amp;alpha; and H&amp;beta;, respectively. The total ionising output of LAE-11, log(f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt;^LyC &amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt; , H&amp;alpha;/Hz~erg^-1) = 24.85^+0.24_-0.34, is higher than the value of 24.3 - 24.8 which is traditionally assumed as needed to drive Reionisation forward.

The neglect of modelling both stellar and nebular emission significantly affects the derived physical properties of galaxies, particularly those with high star formation rates. While this issue has been studied, it has not been established a clear threshold for a significant impact on the estimated physical properties of galaxies due to accounting for both stellar and nebular emission. We analyse galaxies from SDSS-DR7 across a wide range of star-forming activity levels, comparing the results obtained from two spectral fitting tools: FADO (which considers both stellar and nebular continuum) and STARLIGHT (only considers the stellar continuum). A strong linear correlation is found between the rest-frame H&amp;alpha; and H&amp;beta; equivalent widths (EWs) and the optical nebular contribution, identifying these as reliable tracers. The results show that when the nebular contribution exceeds 8% (corresponding to EW(H&amp;alpha;)≃500 &amp;#8491; and EW(H&amp;beta;)≃110 &amp;#8491;), there is a significant impact on the estimation of galaxy properties, namely stellar mass, age and metallicity. Our results highlight the importance of taking into account both the stellar and nebular continuum when analysing the optical spectra of star-forming galaxies. In particular, this is a fundamental aspect for galaxies with a rest-frame EW(H&amp;alpha;)≳500 &amp;#8491; (or the scaled value of 375 &amp;#8491; for pseudo-continuum measures). At low redshifts, this mostly impacts extreme emission line galaxies, while at higher redshifts it becomes a dominant aspect given the higher star-forming activity in the younger Universe. In light of current JWST observations and future instruments designed for high-redshift observations, such as MOONS, this reveals as a critical issue to take into consideration.

We present a detailed investigation into the abundance and morphology of high redshift quenched galaxies at 3 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 7 using James Webb Space Telescope data in the NEP, CEERS and JADES fields. Within these fields, we identify 90 candidate passive galaxies using specific star formation rates modelled with the BAGPIPES SED fitting code, which is more effective at identifying recently quenched systems than the classical UVJ method. With this sample of galaxies, we find number densities broadly consistent with other works and a rapidly evolving passive fraction of high mass galaxies (log_10 (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;gt; 9.5) between 3 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 5. We find that the fraction of galaxies with low star formation rates and mass 9.5 &amp;lt; log_10 (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;lt; 10.5 decreases from ~25% at 3 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 4 to ~2% at 5 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 7. Our passive sample of galaxies is shown to exhibit more compact light profiles compared to star-forming counterparts and some exhibit traces of AGN activity through detections in either the X-ray or radio. At the highest redshifts (z &amp;gt; 6.5) passive selections start to include examples of 'little red dots' which complicates any conclusions until their nature is better understood.

We present JWST-NIRCam narrow-band, 4.05 &amp;mu;m Brackett-&amp;alpha; images of the Sgr C HII region, located in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Galaxy. Unlike any HII region in the Solar vicinity, the Sgr C plasma is dominated by filamentary structure in both Brackett-&amp;alpha; and the radio continuum. Some bright filaments, which form a fractured arc with a radius of about 1.85 pc centered on the Sgr C star-forming molecular clump, likely trace ionization fronts. The brightest filaments form a `&amp;pi;-shaped' structure in the center of the HII region. Fainter filaments radiate away from the surface of the Sgr C molecular cloud. The filaments are emitting optically thin free-free emission, as revealed by spectral index measurements from 1.28 GHz (MeerKAT) to 97 GHz (ALMA). But, the negative in-band 1 to 2 GHz spectral index in the MeerKAT data alone reveals the presence of a non-thermal component across the entire Sgr C HII region. We argue that the plasma flow in Sgr C is controlled by magnetic fields, which confine the plasma to rope-like filaments or sheets. This results in the measured non-thermal component of low-frequency radio emission plasma, as well as a plasma &amp;beta; (thermal pressure divided by magnetic pressure) below 1, even in the densest regions. We speculate that all mature HII regions in the CMZ, and galactic nuclei in general, evolve in a magnetically dominated, low plasma &amp;beta; regime.

&lt;p&gt;
By analyzing data from DESI Legacy Imaging Survey of the dwarf galaxies in the Arecibo Legacy Fast Alfa Survey, we have identified five ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) featuring central pseudo-bulges. These UDGs display blue pseudo-bulges with S\'ersic indices n&amp;lt;2.5 and effective radii spanning 300-700 pc, along with bluer thin stellar disks exhibiting low surface brightness and expansive effective radii that align with the UDG definition. The rotation velocities of these UDGs, determined using HI line widths and optical inclinations, exceed those of most dwarf galaxies of similar mass, suggesting the high halo spins or substantial dark matter halos. We propose that these UDGs likely formed through mergers of dwarf galaxies lacking old stars in their progenitors, resulting in the development of central bulge-like structures during starbursts triggered by the mergers, while also enhancing their halo spin. Subsequent gas accretion facilitated the formation of extended stellar disks. It is also worth noting the possibility that these UDGs could alternatively represent "failed L^&amp;sext; galaxies'' with massive dark matter halos but reduced star formation efficiencies. If future high-resolution HI observations confirm the presence of massive halos around these UDGs, they may have formed due to intense AGN feedback in the early universe, and may be the descendants of "little red dots'' observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, which are characterized by heightened central black hole masses and intensified accretion and feedback processes in the early universe.

We present a spectroscopic analysis of two star-forming galaxies at z~5 observed with JWST/NIRSpec as part of the Early eXtragalactic Continuum and Emission Line Science (EXCELS) survey. The detection of the C III]&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;1906,09, [O II]&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;3726,29, [O III]&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;4363,5007, and [N II]&amp;lambda;6584 nebular emission lines enables investigation of the C/O, N/O, and C/N abundance ratios using the temperature-sensitive method. The two galaxies have stellar masses of log(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; ) = 8.13±0.09 and log(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; )=8.52±0.13 and corresponding metallicities of Z~0.2Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and Z~0.3Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. These metallicities are somewhat higher than is typical for other z&amp;gt;5 galaxies with similar stellar mass and are in fact comparable to high-redshift analogue galaxies at z~0. Both galaxies display evidence for N/O enhancement with respect to the z~0 sample, with log(N/O)=-1.07±0.17 and log(N/O)=-0.86±0.15 respectively. In contrast, we find low C abundances, with log(C/O)=-0.82±0.22 and log(C/O)=-1.02±0.22, consistent with the predicted yields of core-collapse supernovae. Following the trend observed in other high-redshift sources, we find that the C/N ratios are lower at fixed O/H compared to the majority of local galaxies. In contrast to the top-heavy IMF invoked in some studies to explain low C/N ratios in metal-poor galaxies, we find, via comparison to chemical evolution models, that a standard or bottom-heavy IMF better explains the observed abundance ratios in more enriched systems due to an increase in N-enrichment from intermediate mass (4-7M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) stars. Our results demonstrate that robust measurements of CNO abundances with JWST can reveal unique enrichment pathways in galaxies as a function of both metallicity and redshift.

Previous Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of the star-forming cluster NGC 346 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) had revealed a large population of pre-main sequence (PMS) candidates, characterised by Halpha excess emission in their photometry. However, without access to spectroscopy, the nature of these objects remained unclear. Using the NIRSpec instrument on board JWST, we studied a sample of these stars, with masses in the range ~0.9-1.8 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, effective temperatures in the range 4,500-8,000 K, and PMS ages between ~0.1 and 30 Myr. Here we present the first spectra of solar-mass PMS stars in the metal-poor SMC (Z=1/8 Zsun) and discuss the physical properties of ten representative sources with good signal-to-noise ratio. The observations indicate that even the oldest of these PMS candidates are still accreting gas with typical rates of ~10^-8 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;/yr for stars older than ~10 Myr, confirming their PMS nature. The spectra also reveal near-infrared excess and molecular hydrogen excitation lines consistent with the presence of discs around these stars. These findings suggest that in a low-metallicity environment circumstellar discs can live longer than previously thought.

Most of the baryonic matter of the Universe resides in a highly-ionized gaseous intergalactic medium. This gas flows along dark-matter filaments toward galaxy superclusters, clusters, and groups until it pools around the galaxies into a circumgalactic medium. Eventually, the gas settles into the interstellar medium of the galaxies, where it fuels the successive generations of star formation that ultimately produce the stars and heavy elements that make up galaxies today. The gas has been studied for decades using absorption lines produced by Hydrogen and various ions of heavy elements in the spectra of background quasi-stellar objects (QSOs). But directly imaging the extremely faint glow of this "cosmic web" of intergalactic and circumgalactic gas has remained an elusive goal of observational cosmology. Some recent progress has been made by using imaging spectrographs to record high-redshift Ly&amp;alpha; emission, although over only very narrow fields of view. Here we report direct images of intergalactic and circumgalactic gas in the distant Universe obtained using the Condor Array Telescope that we purposely built to reach extremely low-surface-brightness sensitivities over very wide fields of view. We show that these images directly detect and characterize the imprint of Ly&amp;alpha; emission from the cosmic web at an overwhelming statistical significance. By stacking portions of the images centered on tens of thousands of galaxies of known redshift, we show that they also reveal extremely faint emission from H^0, C^3+, and Mg^+ and absorption from cosmic dust in the tenuous outskirts of the galaxies. Our results demonstrate that sensitive imaging observations can now detect and characterize emission (and absorption) from the cosmic web of intergalactic and circumgalactic gas (and dust).

&lt;p&gt;
We present the results of a study investigating the galaxy stellar-mass function (GSMF), size-mass relations and morphological properties of star-forming and quiescent galaxies over the redshift range 0.25&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;2.25, using the JWST PRIMER survey. The depth of the PRIMER near-IR imaging allows us to confirm the double Schechter function shape of the quiescent GSMF out to z≃2.0, via a clear detection of the upturn at log_10(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/ M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) ≤ 10 thought to be induced by environmental quenching. In addition to the GSMF, we confirm that quiescent galaxies can be split into separate populations at log_10(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) ≃ 10, based on their size-mass relations and morphologies. We find that low-mass quiescent galaxies have more disk-like morphologies (based on S\'ersic index, Gini coefficient and M_20 metrics) and follow a shallower size-mass relation than their high-mass counterparts. Indeed, the slope of the size-mass relation followed by low-mass quiescent galaxies is indistinguishable from that followed by star-forming galaxies, albeit with a lower normalization. Moreover, within the errors, the evolution in the median size of low-mass quiescent galaxies is indistinguishable from that followed by star-forming galaxies (R_e&amp;prop;(1+z)^-0.25±0.03), and significantly less rapid than that displayed by high-mass quiescent galaxies (R_e&amp;prop; (1+z)^-1.14± 0.03). Overall, our results are consistent with low and high-mass quiescent galaxies following different quenching pathways. The evolution of low-mass quiescent galaxies is qualitatively consistent with the expectations of external/environmental quenching (e.g. ram-pressure stripping). In contrast, the evolution of high-mass quiescent galaxies is consistent with internal/mass quenching (e.g. AGN feedback) followed by size growth driven by minor mergers.

Optically dark dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) play an essential role in massive galaxy formation at early cosmic time, however their nature remains elusive. Here we present a detailed case study of all the baryonic components of a z=4.821 DSFG, XS55. Selected from the ultra-deep COSMOS-XS 3GHz map with a red SCUBA-2 450&amp;mu;m/850&amp;mu;m colour, XS55 was followed up with ALMA 3mm line scans and spectroscopically confirmed to be at z=4.821 via detections of the CO(5-4) and [CI](1-0) lines. JWST/NIRCam imaging reveals that XS55 is a F150W-dropout with red F277W/F444W colour, and a complex morphology: a compact central component embedded in an extended structure with a likely companion. XS55 is tentatively detected in X-rays with both Chandra and XMM-Newton, suggesting an active galactic nucleus (AGN) nature. By fitting a panchromatic SED spanning NIR to radio wavelengths, we revealed that XS55 is a massive main-sequence galaxy with a stellar mass of M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;ast;&lt;/sub&gt;=(5±1)×10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and a star formation rate of SFR=540±177~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1. The dust of XS55 is optically thick in the far infrared (FIR) with a surprisingly cold dust temperature of T_dust=33±2 K, making XS55 one of the coldest DSFGs at z&amp;gt;4 known to date. This work unveils the nature of a radio-selected F150W-dropout, suggesting the existence of a population of DSFGs hosting active black holes embedded in optically thick dust.

We use hierarchical Bayesian modelling to calibrate a network of 32 all-sky faint DA white dwarf (DA WD) spectrophotometric standards (16.5 &amp;lt; V &amp;lt; 19.5) alongside the three CALSPEC standards, from 912 &amp;#8491; to 32 &amp;mu;m. The framework is the first of its kind to jointly infer photometric zeropoints and WD parameters (log g, T_eff, A_V, R_V) by simultaneously modelling both photometric and spectroscopic data. We model panchromatic HST/WFC3 UVIS and IR fluxes, HST/STIS UV spectroscopy and ground-based optical spectroscopy to sub-percent precision. Photometric residuals for the sample are the lowest yet yielding &amp;lt;0.004 mag RMS on average from the UV to the NIR, achieved by jointly inferring time-dependent changes in system sensitivity and WFC3/IR count-rate nonlinearity. Our GPU-accelerated implementation enables efficient sampling via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, critical for exploring the high-dimensional posterior space. The hierarchical nature of the model enables population analysis of intrinsic WD and dust parameters. Inferred SEDs from this model will be essential for calibrating the James Webb Space Telescope as well as next-generation surveys, including Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

Bridging theory and observations is a key task to understand galaxy formation and evolution. With the advent of state-of-the-art observational facilities, an accurate modelling of galaxy observables through radiative transfer simulations coupled to hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation must be performed. We present a novel pipeline, dubbed RTGen, based on the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RADMC-3D , and explore the impact of the physical assumptions and modelling of dust and gas phases on the resulting galaxy observables. In particular, we address the impact of the dust abundance, composition, and grain size, as well as model the atomic-to-molecular transition and study the resulting emission from molecular gas. We apply Monte Carlo radiative transfer a posteriori to determine the dust temperature in six different hydrodynamic simulations of isolated galaxies. Afterwards, we apply ray tracing to compute the spectral energy distribution, as well as continuum images and spectral line profiles. We find our pipeline to predict accurate spectral energy distribution distributions of the studied galaxies, as well as continuum and CO luminosity images, in good agreement with literature results from both observations and theoretical studies. In particular, we find the dust modelling to have an important impact on the convergence of the resulting predicted galaxy observables, and that an adequate modelling of dust grains composition and size is required. We conclude that our novel framework is ready to perform high-accuracy studies of the observables of the ISM, reaching few tens percent convergence under the studied baseline configuration. This will enable robust studies of galaxy formation, and in particular of the nature of massive clumps in high-redshift galaxies, through the generation of mock images mimicking observations from state-of-the-art facilities such as JWST and ALMA.

We present a JWST MIRI/MRS spectrum of the inner disk of WISE J044634.16-262756.1B (hereafter J0446B), an old (~34 Myr) M4.5 star but with hints of ongoing accretion. The spectrum is molecule-rich and dominated by hydrocarbons. We detect 14 molecular species (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CH_3, CH_4, C_2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ^13CCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C_2H_4, C_2H_6, C_3H_4, C_4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C_6H_6, HCN, HC_3N, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ^13CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and 2 atomic lines ([Ne II] and [Ar II]), all observed for the first time in a disk at this age. The detection of spatially unresolved H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Ne gas strongly supports that J0446B hosts a long-lived primordial disk, rather than a debris disk. The marginal H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O detection and the high C_2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; column density ratio indicate that the inner disk of J0446B has a very carbon-rich chemistry, with a gas-phase C/O ratio ≳2, consistent with what have been found in most primordial disks around similarly low-mass stars. In the absence of significant outer disk dust substructures, inner disks are expected to first become water-rich due to the rapid inward drift of icy pebbles, and evolve into carbon-rich as outer disk gas flows inward on longer timescales. The faint millimeter emission in such low-mass star disks implies that they may have depleted their outer icy pebble reservoir early and already passed the water-rich phase. Models with pebble drift and volatile transport suggest that maintaining a carbon-rich chemistry for tens of Myr likely requires a slowly evolving disk with &amp;alpha;-viscosity ≲10^-4. This study represents the first detailed characterization of disk gas at ~30 Myr, strongly motivating further studies into the final stages of disk evolution.

Recent observations by JWST have revealed supersolar ^14N abundances in galaxies at very high redshift. On the other hand, these galaxies show subsolar metallicity. The observed N/O ratios are difficult to reproduce in the framework of chemical evolution models for the Milky Way. Our aim is to reproduce these high N/O ratios with chemical evolution models assuming different histories of star formation triggering galactic winds coupled with detailed nucleosynthesis prescriptions for ^14N, ^12C, ^16O and ^56Fe. We compute several models for small galaxies (10^9  - 10^10  M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) with high star formation efficiency and strong galactic winds. These winds are assumed to be differential, carrying out mainly the products of the explosion of core-collapse supernovae. We find that only models with high star formation rates, normal initial mass function, and differential galactic winds can reproduce the observed chemical abundances. We also find that with the same assumptions about star formation and galactic winds, but with a very rapid formation resulting from fast gas infall, we can also reproduce the estimated ages of these objects. We find no necessity to invoke peculiar nucleosynthesis from Population III stars, very massive stars and supermassive stars.

We report the discovery of a large (~ 10 kpc diameter), massive (log(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) = 10.15^+0.01_-0.01), grand-design spiral galaxy with photometric redshift z&lt;sub&gt;phot&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.03 in the UNCOVER and Medium Band Mega Science surveys with JWST. This is the highest redshift spiral galaxy discovered with JWST so far. In the rest-frame near-UV and far-UV, we clearly see the beads-on-a-string pattern of star formation; in the rest-frame visible bands, each string appears as an arm. Spectral energy distribution modeling using the Bagpipes code is strongly constrained by detections and flux measurements in 21 JWST and HST filters. The stellar mass-weighted age is 228 Myr, implying that 50% of the stars in the galaxy formed after z ~ 4.5. This is a highly star-forming galaxy with a star formation rate (SFR) of 57.57^+1.80_-1.90   M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;  yr^-1. We detect strong H-&amp;alpha; + [NII] emission from the entire disk. The detection of a spiral galaxy at z ~ 4 indicates that massive and large spiral galaxies and disks were already in place merely 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang.

The majority of most luminous quasars during the epoch of reionization accrete near or above the Eddington limit, marking the vigorous growth of primitive supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, their subsequent evolution and environmental impact remain poorly characterized. We present JWST/NIRSpec prism IFU observations of HSC J2239+0207, a low-luminosity quasar at z~6.25 likely in a late stage of mass assembly with an overmassive SMBH relative to its host galaxy. Using H&amp;beta; and H&amp;alpha; broad emission lines, we estimate an SMBH mass M_BH~3×10^8~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and confirm its sub-Eddington accretion at &amp;lambda;_Edd~0.4. Strong FeII emission and a proximity zone of typical size suggest a metal-rich, highly evolved system. In the far-UV, this quasar presents strong broad-absorption-line features, indicative of high-velocity winds (&amp;nu;~10^4~km/s). Meanwhile, minimal dust reddening is inferred from the quasar continuum and broad-line Balmer decrement, suggesting little dust along the polar direction. Most interestingly, we identify a gas companion ~5 kpc from the quasar with a high [OIII]/H&amp;beta; ratio (≳10), likely representing outflowing gas blown away by AGN feedback. These results highlight HSC J2239+0207 as a likely fading quasar in transition, providing rare insights into SMBH evolution, AGN feedback, and AGN-galaxy interactions in the early Universe.

Morphological classification of galaxies becomes increasingly challenging with redshift. We apply a hybrid supervised-unsupervised method to classify ~ 14,000 galaxies in the CANDELS fields at 0.2 ≤ z ≤ 2.4 into spheroid, disk, and irregular systems. Unlike previous works, our method is applied to redshift bins of width 0.2. Comparison between models applied to a wide redshift range versus bin-specific models reveals significant differences in galaxy morphology beyond z ≥ 1 and a consistent ~ 25&amp;percnt; disagreement. This suggests that using a single model across wide redshift ranges may introduce biases due to the large time intervals involved compared to galaxy evolution timescales. Using the FERENGI code to assess the impact of cosmological effects, we find that flux dimming and smaller angular scales may lead to the misclassification of up to 18&amp;percnt; of disk galaxies as spheroids or irregulars. Contrary to previous studies, we find an almost constant fraction of disks (~ 60&amp;percnt;) and spheroids (~ 30&amp;percnt;) across redshifts. We attribute discrepancies with earlier works, which suggest a decreasing fraction of disks beyond z ~ 1, to the biases introduced by visual classification. Our claim is further strengthened by the striking agreement to the results reported by Lee et al. (2024) using an objective, unsupervised method applied to James Webb Space Telescope data. Exploring mass dependence, we observe a ~ 40&amp;percnt; increase in the fraction of massive (M_stellar ≥ 10^10.5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) spheroids with decreasing redshift, well balanced with a decrease of ~ 20&amp;percnt; in the fraction of M_stellar ≥ 10^10.5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; disks, suggesting that merging massive disk galaxies may form spheroidal systems.

Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations have unveiled that the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) were in place at z ≥ 10, a few hundred Myrs after the Big Bang. These discoveries are providing strong constraints on the seeding of BHs and the nature of the first objects in the Universe. Here, we study the impact of the freeze-out electron fractions (f_e) at the end of the epoch of cosmic recombination on the formation of the first structures in the Universe. At f_e below the current fiducial cosmic values of ~ 10^-4, the baryonic collapse is delayed due to the lack of molecular hydrogen cooling until the host halo masses are increased by one to two orders of magnitude compared to the standard case and reach the atomic cooling limit. This results in an enhanced enclosed gas mass by more than an order of magnitude and higher inflow rates of up to 0.1~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;/yr. Such conditions are conducive to the formation of massive seed BHs with ~ 10^4 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. Our results reveal a new pathway for the formation of massive BH seeds which may naturally arise from free

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed an unexpectedly high abundance of UV luminous galaxies at redshifts z≳ 10, challenging `standard' galaxy formation models. This study investigates the role of rapidly rotating (massive) stars undergoing chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) in reconciling this potential tension. These stars are more compact, hotter, and exhibit enhanced UV emission. We find that the rest-frame UV luminosity of star-forming galaxies can be significantly enhanced by a factor of ~ 3-6 when CHE stars above a minimum initial mass of m&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;,\min^CHE~ 2-10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; account for more than half of the total stellar mass following a Salpeter initial mass function. As a result, the UV luminosity functions observed at z~ 12-16 can be reproduced with less extreme values of star formation efficiency and UV luminosity stochastic variability. Our results highlight the potential of CHE in explaining the UV-bright galaxy populations detected by JWST and call for future work to explore the broader astrophysical implications of CHE and its associated phenomena in the early universe, such as gamma-ray bursts, compact object binaries, and metal enrichment.

We use the star formation rate-stellar mass relation (SFR - M_ * ) of galaxies to measure their luminosity distances as well as estimate cosmological parameters. We compile a sample of 341 high-redshift galaxies at 5 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 14 and an additional 51 galaxies at 1.8 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 3.5 from the JWST observations, which can be used to investigate the correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass, and determine their cosmological distance. The relation SFR &amp;prop;  1pt (M_ * /M_ &amp;odot; )^&amp;gamma;  can be applied to check the nonlinear correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass M_ *  of galaxies and give their distance. Additionally, it also can be used to test if the SFR - M_ *  relation depends on redshift, and the data suggest that the SFR is positively correlated with stellar mass, the SFR - M_ *  relation of the high-redshift galaxies has a redshift dependence. Finally, we combine the galaxy sample with Type Ia supernova (SNIa) data from the Pantheon compilation to test the property of dark energy, specifically addressing whether its density deviates from the constant, and give the statistical analysis results.

Recent findings from photometric and spectroscopic JWST surveys have identified examples of high-redshift galaxies at z ≳ 10. These high-z galaxies appear to form much earlier and exhibit greater UV luminosity than predicted by theoretical work. In this study, our goal is to reproduce the brightness of these sources by simulating high-redshift galaxies with virial masses M_vir = 10^9 - 10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; at z &amp;gt; 10. To achieve this, we conduct cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations, modifying baryonic sub-grid physics, and post-process our simulation results to confirm the observability of our simulated galaxies. Specifically, we enhanced star formation activity in high-redshift galaxies by either increasing the star formation efficiency up to 100&amp;percnt; or adopting a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF). Our simulation results indicate that both increasing star formation efficiency and adopting a top-heavy IMF play crucial roles in boosting the UV luminosity of high-redshift galaxies, potentially exceeding the limiting magnitude of JWST surveys in earlier epochs. Especially, the episodic starburst resulting from enhanced star formation efficiency may explain the high-redshift galaxies observed by JWST, as it evacuates dust from star-forming regions, making the galaxies more observable. We demonstrate this correlation between star formation activity and dust mass evolution within the simulated galaxies. Also, adopting a top-heavy IMF could enhance observability due to an overabundance of massive stars, although it may also facilitate rapid metal enrichment. Using our simulation results, we derive several observables such as effective radius, UV slope, and emission line rates, which could serve as valuable theoretical estimates for comparison with existing spectroscopic results and forthcoming data from the JWST NIRSpec and MIRI instruments.

&lt;p&gt;
We present a catalog of 34 new candidate (13 high confidence) isolated, young stellar systems within the Virgo galaxy cluster identified through a citizen science search of public optical and ultraviolet imaging. "Blue blobs" are a class of blue, faint, isolated, extremely low stellar mass, and metal-rich star-forming clouds embedded in the hot intracluster medium of the Virgo cluster. Only six blue blobs were known previously and here we confirm an additional six of our candidates through velocity and metallicity measurements from follow-up optical spectroscopy on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET). Our 13 high confidence candidates (including the six confirmed) have properties consistent with prior known blue blobs and are inconsistent with being low-mass galaxies. Most candidates are concentrated in relatively dense regions, roughly following filamentary structures within the cluster, but avoiding its center. Three of our candidates are likely the stellar counterparts of known 'optically dark' clouds of neutral hydrogen in the cluster, while a further four are widely separated extensions to previously known blue blobs. The properties of our new candidates are consistent with previous conclusions that blue blobs likely originated from ram pressure stripping events, however, their locations in velocity&amp;ndash;projected cluster-centric radius phase-space imply that their parent galaxies are not on their first infall into the cluster. Through our ongoing follow-up program with HET we aim to confirm additional candidates, however, detailed understanding of the stellar populations and star formation histories of blue blobs will require JWST observations.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is opening new frontiers of transient discovery and follow-up at high-redshift. Here we present the discovery of a spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernova (SN Ia; SN 2023aeax) at z=2.15 with JWST, including a NIRCam multi-band light curve. SN 2023aeax lands at the edge of traditional low-z cosmology cuts because of its blue color (peak rest-frame B-V~-0.3) but with a normal decline rate (&amp;Delta; m_15(B)~1.25), and applying a fiducial standardization with the BayeSN model we find the SN 2023aeax luminosity distance is in ~0.1&amp;sigma; agreement with &amp;Lambda;CDM. SN 2023aeax is only the second spectroscopically confirmed SN Ia in the dark matter-dominated Universe at z&amp;gt;2 (the other is SN 2023adsy), giving it rare leverage to constrain any potential evolution in SN Ia standardized luminosities. Similar to SN 2023adsy (B-V~0.8), SN 2023aeax has a fairly extreme (but opposite) color, which may be due to the small sample size or a secondary factor, such as host galaxy properties. Nevertheless, the SN 2023aeax spectrum is well-represented by normal low-z SN Ia spectra and we find no definitive evolution in SN Ia standardization with redshift. Still, the first two spectroscopically confirmed z&amp;gt;2 SNe Ia have peculiar colors and combine for a ~1&amp;sigma; distance slope relative to &amp;Lambda;CDM, though in agreement with recent SN Ia cosmological measurements.

We present an analysis of eight star-forming galaxies with &amp;langle; z &amp;rangle; = 4.0 from the JWST EXCELS survey for which we obtain robust chemical abundance estimates for the &amp;alpha;-elements O, Ne and Ar. The &amp;alpha;-elements are primarily produced via core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) which should result in &amp;alpha;-element abundance ratios that do not vary significantly across cosmic time. However, Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) models predict an excess production of Ar relative to O and Ne. The Ar/O abundance ratio can therefore be used as a tracer of the relative enrichment of CCSNe and SNe Ia in galaxies. Our sample significantly increases the number of sources with measurements of Ar/O at z &amp;gt; 2, and we find that our sample exhibits sub-solar Ar/O ratios on average, with Ar/O = 0.65 ± 0.10   (Ar/O)&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. In contrast, the average Ne/O abundance is fully consistent with the solar ratio, with Ne/O = 1.07 ± 0.12   (Ne/O)&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. Our results support a scenario in which Ar has not had time to build up in the interstellar medium of young high-redshift galaxies, which are dominated by CCSNe enrichment. We show that these abundance estimates are in good agreement with recent Milky Way chemical evolution models, and with Ar/O trends observed for planetary nebulae in the Andromeda galaxy. These results highlight the potential for using multiple element abundance ratios to constrain the chemical enrichment pathways of early galaxies with JWST.

&lt;p&gt;
We propose that modifications to the Higgs potential within a narrow atmospheric layer near the event horizon of an astrophysical black hole could significantly enhance the rate of sphaleron transitions, as well as transform the Chern-Simons number into a dynamic variable. As a result, sphaleron transitions in this region occur without suppression, in contrast to low-temperature conditions, and each transition may generate a substantially greater baryon number than would be produced by winding around the Higgs potential in Minkowski spacetime. This effect amplifies baryon number violation near the black hole horizon, potentially leading to a considerable generation of matter. Given the possibility of a departure from equilibrium during the absorption of matter and the formation of relativistic jets in supermassive black holes, we conjecture that this process could contribute to the creation of a significant amount of matter around such black holes. This phenomenon may offer an alternative explanation for the rapid growth of supermassive black holes and their surrounding galaxies in the early Universe, as suggested by recent observations from the JWST. Furthermore, this mechanism may provide insights into the low-mass gap puzzle, addressing the observed scarcity of black holes with masses near the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit.

We determine the spectroscopic properties of ~1000 ostensibly star-forming galaxies at redshifts (z=4-10) using prism spectroscopy from JWST/NIRSpec. With rest-wavelength coverage between Lya and [S II] in the optical, we stack spectra as a function of nebular conditions, and compare UV spectral properties with stellar age. This reveals UV lines of N III], N IV], C III], C IV, He II, and O III] in the average high-z galaxy. All UV lines are more intense in younger starbursts. We measure electron temperatures from the collisionally excited [O III] line ratios, finding Te=18000-22000 K for the O++ regions. We also detect a significant nebular Balmer Jump from which we estimate only Te=8000-13000 K. Accounting for typical temperature offsets between zones bearing doubly and singly ionized oxygen, these two temperatures remain discrepant by around 40%. We use the [O III] temperatures to estimate abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. We find that log(C/O) is consistently ~-1, with no evolution of C/O with metallicity or stellar age. The average spectra are mildly enhanced in Nitrogen, with higher N/O than low-z starbursts, but are less enhanced than samples of high-z galaxies with visible UV N III] and N IV]. Whatever processes produce the N-enhancement in the individual galaxies must also be ongoing, at lower levels, in the median galaxy in the early Universe. The strongest starbursts are a source of significant ionizing emission: ionizing photon production efficiencies reach 10^25.7 Hz/erg, and show multiple signatures of high Lyman continuum escape, including Mg II escape fractions nearing 100%, significant deficits in [S II] emission, high degrees of ionization, and blue UV colors.

&lt;p&gt;
JWST/MIRI images have been used to study the Fourier transform power spectra (PS) of two spiral galaxies, NGC 628 and NGC 5236, and two dwarfs, NGC 4449 and NGC 5068, at distances ranging from 4 to 10 Mpc. The PS slopes on scales larger than 200 pc range from -0.6 at 21 microns to -1.2 at 5.6 microns. These slopes for one-dimensional PS are consistent with the PS slopes observed elsewhere using HI and dust emission. They are likely related to turbulence, but they may also be viewed as a hierarchical distribution of objects having a size-luminosity relation and size distribution function. There is no evidence for a kink or steepening of the PS at some transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional turbulence on the scale of the disk thickness. This lack of a kink could be from large positional variations in the PS depending on two opposite effects: local bright sources that make the slope shallower and exponential galaxy profiles that make the slope steeper. The sources could also be confined to a layer of molecular clouds that is thinner than the HI or cool dust layers where PS kinks have been observed before. If the star formation layers observed in the mid-infrared here are too thin, then the PS kink could also be hidden in the broad tail of the JWST point spread function.

HeH^+ was the first heteronuclear molecule to form in the metal-free Universe after the Big Bang. The molecule gained significant attention following its first circumstellar detection in the young and dense planetary nebula NGC 7027. We target some hydride ions associated with the noble gases (HeH^+, ArH^+, and NeH^+) to investigate their formation in harsh environments like the nova outburst region. We use a photoionization modeling (based on previously published best-fit physical parameters) of the moderately fast ONe type nova, QU Vulpeculae 1984, and the CO type novae, RS Ophiuchi and V1716 Scorpii. Our steady-state modeling reveals a convincing amount of HeH^+, especially in the dense clump of RS Ophiuchi and V1716 Scorpii. The calculated upper limit on the surface brightness of HeH^+ transitions suggests that the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) could detect some of them, particularly in sources like RS Ophiuchi and V1716 Scorpii, which have similar physical and chemical conditions and evolution. It must be clearly noted that the sources studied are used as templates, and not as targets for observations. The detection of these lines could be useful for determining the physical conditions in similar types of systems and for validating our predictions based on new electron-impact ro-vibrational collisional data at temperatures of up to 20,000 K.

&lt;p&gt;
Galaxy mergers are a key driver of galaxy formation and evolution, including the triggering of AGN and star formation to a still unknown degree. We thus investigate the impact of galaxy mergers on star formation and AGN activity using a sample of 3,330 galaxies at z = [4.5, 8.5] from eight JWST fields (CEERS, JADES GOODS-S, NEP-TDF, NGDEEP, GLASS, El-Gordo, SMACS-0723, and MACS-0416), collectively covering an unmasked area of 189 arcmin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. We focuses on star formation rate (SFR) enhancement, AGN fraction, and AGN excess in major merger (&amp;mu; &amp;gt; 1/4) close-pair samples, defined by &amp;Delta; z &amp;lt; 0.3 and projected separations r_p &amp;lt; 100 kpc, compared to non-merger samples. We find that SFR enhancement occurs only at r_p &amp;lt; 20 kpc, with values of 0.25 ± 0.10 dex and 0.26 ± 0.11 dex above the non-merger medians for z = [4.5, 6.5] and z = [6.5, 8.5]. No other statistically significant enhancements in galaxy sSFR or stellar mass are observed at any projected separation or redshift bin. We also compare our observational results with predictions from the SC-SAM simulation and find no evidence of star formation enhancement in the simulations at any separation range. Finally, we examine the AGN fraction and AGN excess, finding that the fraction of AGNs in AGN-galaxy pairs, relative to the total AGN population, is 3.25^+1.50_-1.06 times greater than the fraction of galaxy pairs relative to the overall galaxy population at the same redshift. We find that nearly all AGNs have a companion within 100 kpc and observe an excess AGN fraction in close-pair samples compared to non-merger samples. This excess is found to be 1.26 ± 0.06 and 1.34 ± 0.06 for AGNs identified via the inferred BPT diagram and photometric SED selection, respectively.

We investigate the host galaxy properties of eight little red dots (LRDs) selected from the JWST UNCOVER survey, applying a new technique (\tt\string GalfitS) to simultaneously fit the morphology and spectral energy distribution using multi-band NIRCam images covering ~ 1-4 &amp;mu; m. We detect the host galaxy in only one LRD, MSAID38108 at z = 4.96, which has a stellar mass of log (M_*/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) = 8.66^+0.24_-0.23, an effective radius R_e=0.66^+0.08_-0.05 kpc, and a S\'ersic index n=0.71^+0.07_-0.08. No host emission centered on the central point source is found in the other seven LRDs. We derive stringent upper limits for the stellar mass of a hypothetical host galaxy by conducting realistic mock simulations that place high-redshift galaxy images under the LRDs. Based on the black hole masses estimated from the broad H&amp;alpha; emission line, the derived stellar mass limits are at least a factor of 10 lower than expected from the z ≈ 0 scaling relation between black hole mass and host galaxy stellar mass. Intriguingly, four of the LRDs (50&amp;percnt; of the sample) show extended, off-centered emission, which is particularly prominent in the bluer bands. The asymmetric emission of two sources can be modeled as stellar emission, but the nature of the other two is unclear.

&lt;p&gt;
We combine stellar mass functions and the recent first JWST-based galaxy&amp;ndash;black hole scaling relations at z=6 to for the first time compute the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass volume density at this epoch, and compare this to the integrated SMBH mass growth from the population of UV-luminous quasars at z&amp;gt;6. We show that even under very conservative assumptions almost all growth of supermassive black hole mass at z&amp;gt;6 does not take place in these UV-luminous quasars, but must occur in systems obscured through dust and/or with lower radiative efficiency than standard thin accretion disks. The `Soltan argument' is not fulfilled by the known population of bright quasars at z&amp;gt;6: the integrated SMBH mass growth inferred from these largely unobscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early Universe is by a factor ≥10 smaller than the total black hole mass volume density at z=6. This is valid under a large range of assumption about luminosity and mass functions as well as accretion modes, and is likely still at least a factor &amp;gt;2 smaller when accounting for the known obscuration fractions at this epoch. The resulting consequences are: &amp;gt;90%, possibly substantially more, of SMBH-buildup in the early Universe does not take place in luminous unobscured quasar phases, but has to occur in obscured systems, with dust absorbing most of the emitted UV&amp;ndash;visible AGN emission, potentially with accretion modes with super-Eddington specific accretion rates. This is consistent with short lifetime arguments for luminous quasar phases from quasar proximity zone studies and clustering. This would remove the empirical need for slow SMBH growth and hence exotic `high-mass seed' black holes at early cosmic time. It also predicts a large population of luminous but very obscured lower-mass quasars at z&amp;gt;6, possibly the JWST `Little Red Dots'.

We use JWST/NIRISS slitless spectroscopy from the Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public (NGDEEP) Survey to investigate the physical condition of star-forming galaxies at 1.7 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 3.4. At these redshifts, the deep NGDEEP NIRISS slitless spectroscopy covers the [O II]&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;3726,3729, [O III]&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;4959,5007, H&amp;beta; and H&amp;alpha; emission features for galaxies with stellar masses log(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;ast;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) ≳ 7, nearly a factor of a hundred lower than previous studies. We focus on the [O III]/[O II] (O_32) ratio which is primarily sensitive to the ionization state and with a secondary dependence on the gas-phase metallicity of the interstellar medium. We find significant (≳5&amp;sigma;) correlations between the O_32 ratio and galaxy properties as O_32 increases with decreasing stellar mass, decreasing star formation rate (SFR), increasing specific SFR (sSFR&amp;equiv; SFR/M_*), and increasing equivalent width (EW) of H&amp;beta; and H&amp;alpha;. These trends suggest a tight connection between the ionization parameter and these galaxy properties. Galaxies at z~2-3 exhibit a higher O_32 than local normal galaxies with the same stellar masses and SFRs, indicating that they have a higher ionization parameter and lower metallicity than local normal galaxies. In addition, we observe a mild evolutionary trend in the O_32 &amp;ndash; EW(H&amp;beta;) relation from z~0 to z≳5, where higher redshift galaxies show increased O_32 and EW, with possibly higher O_32 at fixed EW. We argue that both the enhanced recent star formation activity and the higher star formation surface density may contribute to the increase in O_32 and the ionization parameter.

We present a joint analysis of high-resolution CO(2-1) and Paschen-&amp;alpha; emission lines to trace gas dynamics and spatially resolved star formation in ASPECS-LP.3mm.06, a z=1.1 main sequence galaxy. Utilizing data from the ALMA and JWST NIRCam Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS), we explore both ionized gas and molecular gas within this galaxy. With a substantial molecular gas fraction (f_mol = 0.44 ± 0.02), ASPECS-LP.3mm.06 remains on the star-forming main sequence and adheres to the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, indicating typical gas-to-star conversion efficiency. Our analysis reveals extended structures across multiple wavelengths, suggesting regulated star formation within a stable disk. The spatially resolved star formation efficiency (SFE) and kinematic analysis indicate that ASPECS-LP.3mm.06 features a smooth mass assembly process across bulge and disk. Additionally, the galaxy exhibits modest dust extinction (A_V = 0.8), potentially linked to self-regulation during bulge formation. These findings position ASPECS-LP.3mm.06 as a prototypical galaxy, offering valuable insights into the mechanisms governing normal disk galaxy growth at z~1.

The intracluster medium (ICM) today is comprised largely of hot gas with clouds of cooler gas of unknown origin and lifespan. We analyze the evolution of cool gas (temperatures ≲10^4.5 K) in the ICM of 352 galaxy clusters from the TNG-Cluster simulations, with present-day mass ~10^14.3-15.4 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. We follow the main progenitors of these clusters over the past ~13 billion years (since z≲7) and find that, according to TNG-Cluster, the cool ICM mass increases with redshift at fixed cluster mass, implying that this cooler past of the ICM is due to more than just halo growth. The cool cluster gas at z≲0.5 is mostly located in and around satellite galaxies, while at z≳2 cool gas can also accrete via filaments from the intergalactic medium. Lower-mass and higher-redshift clusters are more susceptible to cooling. The cool ICM mass correlates with the number of gaseous satellites and inversely with the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass. The average number of gaseous satellites decreases since z=2, correlating with the decline in the cool ICM mass over cosmic time, suggesting a link between the two. Concurrently, kinetic SMBH feedback shifts the ICM temperature distribution, decreasing the cool ICM mass inside-out. At z≈0.5, the predicted \ionMg ii column densities are in the ballpark of recent observations, where satellites and other halos contribute significantly to the total \ionMg ii column density. Suggestively, a non-negligible amount of the ICM cool gas forms stars in-situ at early times, reaching ~10^2 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1 and an H&amp;alpha; surface brightness of ~10^-17 erg s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; arcsec^-2 at z≈2, detectable with Euclid and JWST.

In this Letter, we investigate the turbulence and energy injection in the extended nebulae surrounding two luminous obscured quasars, WISEA J100211.29+013706.7 (z=1.5933) and SDSS J165202.64+172852.3 (z=2.9489). Utilizing high-resolution data from the NIRSpec IFU onboard the James Webb Space Telescope, we analyze the velocity fields of line-emitting gas in and around these quasars and construct the second-order velocity structure functions (VSFs) to quantify turbulent motions across different spatial scales. Our findings reveal a notable flattening in the VSFs from ≈\!3 kpc up to a scale of 10&amp;ndash;20 kpc, suggesting that energy injection predominantly occurs at a scale ≲10 kpc, likely powered by quasar outflows and jet-driven bubbles. The extended spatial range of flat VSFs may also indicate the presence of multiple energy injection sources at these scales. For J1652, the turbulent energy in the host interstellar medium (ISM) is significantly higher than in tidally stripped gas, consistent with the expectation of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activities stirring up the host ISM. Compared to the VSFs observed on spatial scales of 10&amp;ndash;50 kpc around lower-redshift UV-bright quasars, these obscured quasars exhibit higher turbulent energies in their immediate surroundings, implying different turbulence drivers between the ISM and halo-scale gas. Future studies with an expanded sample are essential to elucidate further the extent and the pivotal role of AGNs in shaping the gas kinematics of host galaxies and beyond.

The circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a vital role in galaxy evolution, however, studying the emission from CGM is challenging due to its low surface brightness and the complexities involved in interpreting resonant lines such as Ly&amp;alpha;. The near-infrared coverage, unprecedented sensitivity, and high spatial resolution of JWST enable us to study the optical strong lines associated with the extended Ly&amp;alpha; "nebulae" at redshifts of 2&amp;ndash;3. These lines serve as diagnostic tools to infer the physical conditions in the CGM gas reservoir of these systems. In deep medium-band images taken by the JWST, we serendipitously discovered the [O III] emission from the CGM around a massive interacting galaxy system at a redshift z~2.8, known to be embedded in a bright extended (100 kpc) Ly&amp;alpha; "nebula." This is the first time that the [O III] lines have been detected from a Ly&amp;alpha; "nebula." The JWST images reveal that the CGM gas actually resides in narrow (~ 2.5 kpc) filamentary structures with strong [O III] emission, tracing the same extent as the Ly&amp;alpha; emission. An analysis of the [O III] suggests that the emitting CGM is fully ionized and is energetically dominated by mechanical heating. We also find that the density and pressure are higher than those commonly predicted by simulations of the CGM. We conclude that the observed CGM emission originates from the gas expelled by the episodic feedback processes, cooling down and enriching the CGM, while traveling a distance of at least 60 kpc. These observations demonstrate how intensive feedback processes shape gas distribution and properties in the CGM around massive halos. While access to such deep, high-resolution imaging opens up a new discovery space for investigating the CGM, it also challenges numerical simulations with respect to explaining and reproducing the exquisitely complex structures revealed by the observations.

&lt;p&gt;
Accurately quantifying the ionizing photon production efficiency ( &amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt; ) of z&amp;gt;6 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is necessary to understand their contribution to reionization. We investigate the ionizing properties of N=279 SFGs selected at z=6.9-7.6 from the JWST Cycle-1 imaging programmes; PRIMER and JADES. We use BAGPIPES to consistently infer the equivalent widths of their [OIII]+H&amp;beta; emission lines (W_&amp;lambda;) and their physical properties. To supplement our high-redshift galaxies, we measure W_&amp;lambda; photometrically for a sample of N=253 z=3.2-3.6 SFGs selected from the VANDELS spectroscopic survey. Comparing these samples, we find a strong apparent redshift evolution in their median W_&amp;lambda;, increasing from W_&amp;lambda; =310±25 &amp;#8491; in VANDELS to W_&amp;lambda; =540±25 &amp;#8491; in our JWST-based sample. In the JWST sample at z&amp;gt;7, we find that W_&amp;lambda; correlates with both stellar mass and UV luminosity, with high-mass, M_ UV-faint galaxies producing systematically weaker emission lines. Moreover, we discover a departure from the standard log-normal shape of the W_&amp;lambda; distribution, characterised by a more pronounced tail at lower W_&amp;lambda;, consistent with increasingly bursty star formation. Using W_&amp;lambda; as a proxy for  &amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt; , and UV spectral slope as a proxy for LyC escape fraction (f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt;), we find a minority of galaxies with high  &amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt;  and f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt; (e.g., log( &amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt; /erg^-1Hz)~25.6 and f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt;~0.15). However, we find that the LyC photon budget at z&amp;gt;7 is dominated by galaxies with more moderate output, close to the sample median of log( &amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt; /erg^-1Hz)~25.3 and f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt;~0.05. This is consistent with estimates for the number of LyC photons required to power reionization at z&amp;gt;7, with no evidence for over or under-production.

&lt;p&gt;
We present the first spectroscopic confirmation of a dust-obscured dwarf galaxy, CEERS-14821. The analysis is performed combining JWST NIRCam broad-band photometry and NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopic data. From the detection of multiple rest-frame optical lines, we derive that CEERS-14821 is located at z=4.883±0.003. Moreover, from a secure detection of the H_&amp;alpha; and H_&amp;beta; we derived that the galaxy has a dust extinction ranging from Av=2.2 to Av=3.3, depending on the assumed reddening law. This value is extremely large given that we estimated a low stellar mass around log(M/Mo)=8.0-8.2. Moreover, using different metallicity tracers, we verify that the galaxy is also metal-rich, with 12+log(O/H)&amp;gt;8.3. This is well above the expectation from both the mass-metallicity relation and the fundamental mass-metalliticy relation. CEERS-14821 is going through a burst of star formation, there are no indications of a strong contribution from an active galactic nuclei (f(AGN)&amp;lt;0.5 with respect to the total dust luminosity). Based on the rest-frame optical images, this source has a size compatible with galaxies of similar stellar mass and redshift. Finally, with the current data, it seems that there are galaxies closely interacting with CEERS-14821.

We present results of cosmological zoom-in simulations of a massive protocluster down to redshift z≈4 (when the halo mass is ≈10^13 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) using the SWIFT code and the EAGLE galaxy formation model, focusing on supermassive black hole (BH) physics. The BH was seeded with a mass of 10^4 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; at redshift z≈17. We compare the base model that uses an Eddington limit on the BH accretion rate and thermal isotropic feedback by the AGN, with one where super-Eddington accretion is allowed, as well as two other models with BH spin and jets. In the base model, the BH grows at the Eddington limit from z=9 to z=5.5, when it becomes massive enough to halt its own and its host galaxy's growth through feedback. We find that allowing super-Eddington accretion leads to drastic differences, with the BH going through an intense but short super-Eddington growth burst around z≈7.5, during which it increases its mass by orders of magnitude, before feedback stops further growth (of both the BH and the galaxy). By z≈4 the galaxy is only half as massive in the super-Eddington cases, and an order of magnitude more extended, with the half-mass radius reaching values of a few physical kpc instead of a few hundred pc. The BH masses in our simulations are consistent with the intrinsic BH mass-stellar mass relation inferred from high-redshift observations by JWST. This shows that galaxy formation models using the &amp;Lambda;CDM cosmology are capable of reproducing the observed massive BHs at high redshift. Allowing jets, either at super- or sub-Eddington rates, has little impact on the host galaxy properties, but leads to lower BH masses as a consequence of higher feedback efficiencies.

James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered many faint AGNs at high-z by detecting their broad Balmer lines. However, their high number density, lack of X-ray emission, and overly high black hole masses with respect to their host stellar masses suggest that they are a distinct population from general type-1 quasars. Here, we present clustering analysis of 27 low-luminosity broad-line AGNs found by JWST (JWST AGNs) at 5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6 based on cross-correlation analysis with 679 photometrically-selected galaxies to characterize their host dark matter halo (DMH) masses. From the angular and projected cross-correlation functions, we find that their typical DMH mass is log (M_halo/h^-1 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) = 11.46_-0.25^+0.19, and 11.53_-0.20^+0.15, respectively. This result implies that the host DMHs of these AGNs are ~1 dex smaller than those of luminous quasars. The DMHs of the JWST AGNs at 5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6 are predicted to grow to 10^12&amp;ndash;13 h^-1 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; at z≲3, which is comparable to that of a more luminous quasar at the same epoch. Applying the empirical stellar-to-halo mass ratio to the measured DMH mass, we evaluate their host stellar mass as log(M_*/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;)=9.48_-0.41^+0.31, and 9.60_-0.33^+0.24, which are higher than some of those estimated by the SED fitting. We also evaluate their duty cycle as f_duty=0.37_-0.15^+0.19 per cent, corresponding to ~4×10^6 yr as the lifetime of the JWST AGNs. While we cannot exclude the possibility that the JWST AGNs are simply low-mass type-1 quasars, these results suggest that the JWST AGNs are a different population from type-1 quasars and the progenitors of quasars at z≲3.

We present a rest-frame optical, spatially resolved analysis of more than 100 H&amp;alpha; emitters (HAEs) at z~2.2 in the ZFOURGE-CDFS field using NIRCam imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). The ultra-deep, high-resolution data gives us maps of the resolved emission line regions of HAEs with stellar mass ranging from 10^8 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; to 10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. An [OIII] emission-line map of each HAE is created from the flux excess in the F150W filter, leading to the discovery of a population of kiloparsec-scale compact emission line regions ("Green Seeds") with high equivalent widths (EW). We obtain a sample of 128 Green Seeds from 68 HAEs with rest-frame EW_[OIII]&amp;gt;200&amp;#8491;. Moreover, 17 of them have extremely large EW_[OIII]&amp;gt;1000&amp;#8491;, suggesting the possible Lyman continuum (LyC) leakage from these emission line regions. Embedded within the host galaxy, many Green Seeds correspond to UV star-forming clumps and H\sc ii regions, indicating elevated starburst activity in them, with specific star formation rates (sSFR) several times higher than that of the host galaxy. Based on theoretical frameworks, Green Seeds are expected to be formed through gravitational disk instability and/or galaxy mergers. Considering the stellar masses of Green Seeds, we speculate that high-mass Green Seeds may migrate toward the galactic center to build the central bulge, while low-mass Green Seeds are easily disrupted and short-lived. Besides, we propose that some Green Seeds could be the progenitors of globular clusters or ultracompact dwarf galaxies observed in the local universe.

We use James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) medium-resolution spectrometer (MRS) observations of 3C 293 (UGC 8782), CGCG 012-070 and NGC 3884 to investigate the origin of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission. These three nearby Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) hosts are known to present H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission excess relative to star-forming galaxies, as traced by the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; S(3)/PAH_11.3&amp;mu; m line ratio. We define the kinematically disturbed region (KDR) by the AGN and the virially dominated region (VDR) based on the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; line widths, using the W80 parameter. From the correlations between W80 and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; S(3)/PAH11.3&amp;mu; m, as well as the higher H2 S(5)/H2 S(3) and [Fe II]5.34 &amp;mu; m/PAH11.3&amp;mu; m ratios and flatter power-law temperature distributions observed in the KDR, we conclude that the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission in the KDR is primarily driven by shock-heated gas. For 3C 293, the KDR is co-spatial with the radio core, indicating that the origin of the shocks is the interaction of the radio jet with the interstellar medium, which is also responsible for the observed molecular and ionized gas outflows in this source. The other galaxies are weak radio sources; however, due to the lack of high-resolution radio images, we cannot rule out low-power jets as the origin of the shock-heated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Our results indicate that the excess H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission excess is associated to shock heating of the gas, generated by outflows or by the interaction of the radio jet with the ambient gas.

We present a detailed analysis of JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam observations of ZF-UDS-7329, a massive, quiescent galaxy at redshift z=3.2, which has been put forward to challenge cosmology and galaxy formation physics. We study on the impact of different star formation history (SFH) priors, stellar libraries, metallicity, and initial mass function assumptions. Our results show that ZF-UDS-7329, with a formed stellar mass of M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 10^11.4~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; (surviving mass M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;,surv ≈ 10^11.2~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) and a specific star-formation rate of sSFR ≈ 0.03 Gyr^-1, formed efficiently in the first billion years of the Universe. In agreement with previous work, we find that the spectrum is consistent with mass-weighted stellar ages of 1.3-1.8 Gyr, depending on the SFH prior used. A physically motivated rising SFH prior makes the formation history of ZF-UDS-7329 compatible with stellar mass and star-formation rate estimates of z&amp;gt;6 galaxies. Using NIRCam imaging, we identify a colour gradient indicative of an old, quiescent bulge and a younger disc component, as expected from a complex formation history. The inferred SFH is consistent a high stellar fraction of f&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;=M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/(f_b \cdot M_h) ≈ 100&amp;percnt; at z=7-12, implying an extremely high integrated star-formation efficiency. However, when considering cosmic variance and possible mergers as expected in over-dense environments &amp;ndash; as traced by ZF-UDS-7329 &amp;ndash; the stellar fractions could be reduced to f&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 50&amp;percnt;, which is more consistent with galaxy formation models and the stellar-to-halo mass relation at lower redshifts. We conclude that ZF-UDS-7329 forms extremely efficient in the early universe, but does not necessitate unseen galaxies at higher redshifts since the inferred SFR of ancestors are consistent with those seen in z&amp;gt;6 galaxies.

ASPIRE (A SPectroscopic survey of bIased halos in the Reionization Era) is a quasar legacy survey primarily using itJWST to target a sample of 25 z&amp;gt;6 quasars with NIRCam slitless spectroscopy and imaging. The first study in this series found evidence of a strong overdensity of galaxies around J0305-3150, a luminous quasar at z=6.61, within a single NIRCam pointing obtained in JWST Cycle 1. Here, we present the first results of a JWST Cycle 2 mosaic that covers 35 arcmin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with NIRCam imaging/WFSS of the same field to investigate the spatial extent of the putative protocluster. The F356W grism data targets [OIII]+H&amp;beta; at 5.3&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;7 and reveals a population of 124 line emitters down to a flux limit of 1.2×10^-18 erg s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Fifty-three of these galaxies lie at 6.5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6.8 spanning 10 cMpc on the sky, corresponding to an overdensity within a 2500 cMpc^3 volume of 12.5 ± 2.6, anchored by the quasar. Comparing to the [OIII] luminosity function from the Emission line galaxies and Intergalactic Gas in the Epoch of Reionization (EIGER) project, we find a dearth of faint [OIII] emitters at log(L/erg s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) &amp;lt; 42.3, which we suggest is consistent with either bursty star formation causing galaxies to scatter around the grism detection limit or modest suppression from quasar feedback. While we find a strong filamentary overdensity of [OIII] emitters consistent with a protocluster, we suggest that we could be insensitive to a population of older, more massive Lyman-break galaxies with weak nebular emission on scales &amp;gt;10 cMpc.

Among the remarkable strides made by JWST is the discovery of the earliest star clusters found to date. These have been proposed as early progenitors of globular clusters, which are known to come from the early stages of star formation in the Universe. This is an exciting development in modern astronomy, as it offers an opportunity to connect theoretical models of globular cluster formation to actual observations of these high-redshift structures. In this work, we aim to develop observational signatures of a star cluster formation route known as supersonically induced gas objects, which are dark matter-less gas clouds in the early Universe proposed as a potential origin of some globular clusters. For the first time, we follow the star formation process of these early Universe objects using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, including mechanical feedback. Our results suggest that the first dark matter-less star clusters are top-heavy, with a higher abundance of massive stars compared to today's clusters and extremely high stellar mass surface densities compared to the local Universe.

We present the formation histories of 19 massive (&amp;gt;3X10^10M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) quiescent (sSFR&amp;lt;0.15Gyr^-1) galaxy candidates at z~3.0-4.5 observed using JWST/NIRSpec. This completes the spectroscopic confirmation of the 24 K-selected quiescent galaxy sample from the ZFOURGE and 3DHST surveys (Schreiber et al. 2018a). Utilizing Prism 1-5&amp;mu; m spectroscopy, we confirm that all 12 sources that eluded confirmation by ground-based spectroscopy lie at z&amp;gt;3, resulting in a spectroscopically confirmed number density of ~1.4X10^-5Mpc^-3 between z~3-4. Rest-frame U-V vs V-J color selections show high effectiveness in identifying quiescent galaxies, with a purity of~90%. Our analysis shows that parametric star-formation histories (SFHs) from FAST++ and binned SFHs from Prospector on average yield consistent results, revealing diverse formation and quenching times. The oldest galaxy formed ~6X10^10M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; by z~10 and has been quiescent for over 1 Gyr at z~3.2. We detect two galaxies with ongoing star formation and six with active galactic nuclei (AGN). We demonstrate that the choice of stellar population models, stellar libraries, and nebular or AGN contributions does not significantly affect the derived average SFHs of the galaxies. We demonstrate that extending spectral fitting beyond the rest-frame optical regime reduces the inferred average star formation rates in the earliest time bins of the SFH reconstruction. The assumed SFH prior influences the star formation rate at early times, where spectral diagnostic power is limited. Simulated z~3 quiescent galaxies from IllustrisTNG, SHARK, and Magneticum broadly match the average SFHs of the observed sample but struggle to capture the full diversity, particularly at early stages. Our results emphasize the need for mechanisms that rapidly build stellar mass and quench star formation within the first billion years of the Universe.

Identifying active galactic nuclei (AGN) is extremely important for understanding galaxy evolution and its connection with the assembly of supermassive black holes (SMBH). With the advent of deep and high angular resolution imaging surveys such as those conducted with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), it is now possible to identify galaxies with a central point source out to the very early Universe. In this study, we develop a fast, accurate and precise method to identify galaxies which host AGNs and recover the intrinsic AGN contribution to the observed total light (f_AGN). We trained a deep learning (DL) based method Zoobot to estimate the fractional contribution of a central point source to the total light. Our training sample comprises realistic mock JWST images of simulated galaxies from the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We injected different amounts of the real JWST point spread function (PSF) models to represent galaxies with different levels of f_AGN. We analyse the performance of our method and compare it with results obtained from the traditional light profile fitting tool GALFIT. We find excellent performance of our DL method in recovering the injected AGN fraction f_AGN, both in terms of precision and accuracy. The mean difference between the predicted and true injected f_AGN is -0.002 and the overall root mean square error (RMSE) is 0.013. The relative absolute error (RAE) is 0.076 and the outlier (defined as predictions with RAE &amp;gt;20%) fraction is 6.5%. In comparison, using GALFIT on the same dataset, we achieve a mean difference of -0.02, RMSE of 0.12, RAE of 0.19 and outlier fraction of 19%. We applied our trained DL model to real JWST observations and found that 33% of X-ray-selected AGN and 15% of MIR-selected AGN are also identified as AGN using a cut at f_AGN &amp;gt; 0.1.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered an abundance of z&amp;gt;10 galaxies bright in the ultraviolet (UV) that has challenged traditional theoretical models at high redshifts. Recently, various new models have emerged to address this discrepancy by refining their description of star formation. Here we investigate whether modifications to the stellar initial mass function (IMF) alone can reproduce the z&amp;gt;10 UV luminosity functions (UV LFs) when the star formation rate is used as a proxy for the fraction of massive stars. We incorporate an Evolving IMF into the \sc astraeus galaxy evolution and reionisation simulation framework, which becomes increasingly top-heavy as the gas density in a galaxy rises above a given threshold. Our implementation accounts for the IMF's effects on supernova (SN) feedback, metal enrichment, and the UV and ionising emissivities. For this Evolving IMF model, we find that (i) the maximum UV luminosity enhancement is twice as large in massive galaxies (&amp;Delta; M_UV≃2.6) than those where star formation is strongly limited by SN feedback (&amp;Delta; M_UV≃1.3); (ii) it successfully reproduces the observed UV LFs at z=5-15; (iii) galaxies with top-heavy IMFs exhibit the highest star formation rates, driven by their location in local density peaks, which facilitates higher gas accretion rates; (iv) the 1&amp;sigma; variances in the UV luminosity are only slightly higher compared to when assuming a Salpeter IMF, but the 2&amp;sigma; variances are significantly increased by a factor of 1.4-2 boosting the abundance of UV-bright galaxies at z&amp;gt;10; (v) reionisation begins earlier with more extended large ionised regions and fewer smaller ones during its initial stages, though these differences diminish at lower redshifts, leading to a similar end of reionisation at z≃5.6.

We present the properties of a massive, large, dusty, metal-rich, star-forming galaxy at z&lt;sub&gt;spec&lt;/sub&gt;=6.73. GOODSN-100182 was observed with JWST/NIRSpec as part of the AURORA survey, and is also covered by public multi-wavelength HST and JWST imaging. While the large stellar mass of GOODSN-100182 (~10^10 M_sun) was indicated prior to JWST, NIRCam rest-optical imaging now reveals the presence of an extended disk (r_eff~1.5 kpc). In addition, the NIRSpec R~1000 spectrum of GOODSN-100182 includes the detection of a large suite of rest-optical nebular emission lines ranging in wavelength from [OII]3727 up to [NII]6583. The ratios of Balmer lines suggest significant dust attenuation (E(B-V)_gas=0.40+0.10/-0.09), consistent with the red rest-UV slope inferred for GOODSN-100182 (beta=-0.50+/-0.09). The star-formation rate based on dust-corrected H-alpha emission is log(SFR(H-alpha)/ M_sun/yr)=2.02+0.13/-0.14, well above the z~7 star-forming main sequence in terms of specific SFR. Strikingly, the ratio of [NII]6583/H-alpha emission suggests almost solar metallicity, as does the ratio ([OIII]5007/H-beta)/([NII]6583/H-alpha) and the detection of the faint [FeII]4360 emission feature. Overall, the excitation and ionization properties of GOODSN-100182 more closely resemble those of typical star-forming galaxies at z~2-3 rather than z~7. Based on public spectroscopy of the GOODS-N field, we find that GOODSN-100182 resides within a significant galaxy overdensity, and is accompanied by a spectroscopically-confirmed neighbor galaxy. GOODSN-100182 demonstrates the existence of mature, chemically-enriched galaxies within the first billion years of cosmic time, whose properties must be explained by galaxy formation models.

JADES-GS-z14-0 is the most distant spectroscopically confirmed galaxy yet, at z&amp;gt;14. With a UV magnitude of -20.81, it is one of the most luminous galaxies at cosmic dawn and its half-light radius of 260 pc means that stars dominate the observed UV emission. We report ALMA detection of [OIII]88&amp;mu;m line emission with a significance of 6.67&amp;sigma; and at a frequency of 223.524~GHz, corresponding to a redshift of 14.1796±0.0007, which is consistent with the candidate CIII] line detected in the NIRSpec spectrum. At this spectroscopic redshift, the Lyman-&amp;alpha; break identified with NIRSpec requires a damped Lyman-&amp;alpha; absorber with a column density of log(N_HI/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)=21.96. The total [OIII]88&amp;mu;m luminosity (log(L_[OIII]/L&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) = 8.3± 0.1) is fully consistent with the local L_[OIII]-SFR relation and indicating a gas-phase metallicity &amp;gt;0.1~Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. Using ttprospector SED modeling and combining the ALMA data with JWST observations, we find Z=0.17~Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and a non-zero escape fraction of ionizing photons (~11&amp;percnt;), which is necessary by the code to reproduce the UV spectrum. We measure an [O III]5007&amp;#8491;/[O III]88&amp;mu;m line flux ratio between 1 and 20, resulting in an upper limit to the electron density of roughly 700 cm^-3 assuming a single-cloud photoionization model. The [OIIII]88&amp;mu;m emission line is spectrally resolved, with a FWHM of 100 km/s, resulting in a dynamical mass of log(M_dyn/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) = 9.0±0.2. When compared to the stellar mass, this value represents a conservative upper limit on the gas mass fraction, which ranges from 50&amp;percnt; to 80&amp;percnt;, depending on the assumed star formation history. Past radiation-driven outflows may have cleared the galaxy from the gas, reducing the gas fraction and thus increasing the escape fraction of ionizing photons.

Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered massive galaxies at high redshifts, with their abundance significantly surpassing expectations. This finding poses a substantial challenge to both galaxy formation models and our understanding of cosmology. Additionally, discrepancies between the Hubble parameter inferred from high-redshift cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations and those derived from low-redshift distance ladder methods have led to what is known as the "Hubble tension''. Among the most promising solutions to this tension are Early Dark Energy (EDE) models. In this study, we employ an axion-like EDE model in conjunction with a universal Salpeter initial mass function to fit the luminosity function derived from JWST data, as well as other cosmological probes, including the CMB, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and the SH0ES local distance ladder. Our findings indicate that JWST observations favor a high energy fraction of EDE, f_EDE ~ 0.2 ± 0.03 , and a high Hubble constant value of H_0 ~ 74.6 ± 1.2 km/s/Mpc, even in the absence of SH0ES data. This suggests that EDE not only addresses the H_0 tension but also provides a compelling explanation for the observed abundance of massive galaxies identified by JWST.

&lt;p&gt;
The scenario of feedback-free starbursts (FFB), which predicts excessively bright galaxies at cosmic dawn as observed using JWST, may provide a natural setting for black hole (BH) growth. This involves the formation of intermediate-mass seed BHs and their runaway mergers into super-massive BHs with high BH-to-stellar mass ratios and low AGN luminosities. We present a scenario of merger-driven BH growth in FFB galaxies and study its feasibility. BH seeds form within the building blocks of the FFB galaxies, namely, thousands of compact star clusters, each starbursting in a free-fall time of a few Myr before the onset of stellar and supernova feedback. The BH seeds form by rapid core collapse in the FFB clusters, in a few free-fall times, sped up by the migration of massive stars due to the young, broad stellar mass function and stimulated by a `gravo-gyro' instability due to internal cluster rotation and flattening. BHs of 10^4 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; are expected in 10^6 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; FFB clusters within sub-kpc galactic disks at z ~ 10. The BHs then migrate to the galaxy center by dynamical friction, hastened by the compact FFB stellar galactic disk configuration. Efficient mergers of the BH seeds will produce 10^6-8 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; BHs with a BH-to-stellar mass ratio ~ 0.01 by z ~ 4-7, as observed. The growth of the central BH by mergers can overcome the bottleneck introduced by gravitational wave recoils if the BHs inspiral within a relatively cold disk or if the escape velocity from the galaxy is boosted by a wet compaction event. Such events, common in massive galaxies at high redshifts, can also help by speeding up the inward BH migration and by providing central gas to assist with the final parsec problem. The cold disk version of the FFB scenario provides a feasible route for the formation of supermassive BHs.

Massive black holes (BHs) grow by gas accretion and mergers, observable through electromagnetic (EM) and gravitational wave (GW) emission. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has detected faint active galactic nuclei (AGNs), revealing an abundant population of accreting BHs with masses of M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt;~ 10^6-8~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. This mass range overlaps with the detection scopes of space-based GW interferometers and approaches the upper bounds of the predicted mass of seed BHs. We model BH mass assembly in light of the new JWST findings to investigate their formation channels and predict merger events. Two types of seed BHs are considered: heavy seeds (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt;~ 10^2-5~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) formed in rare and overdense cosmic regions, and light seeds (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt;~ 10^1-3~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) formed as stellar remnants in less massive dark-matter halos. The BHs grow through episodic accretion and merger events, which we model by fitting the AGN luminosity function to observational data including JWST-identified AGNs at z~ 5. We find that heavy seeds alone struggle to explain quasars and faint JWST-selected AGNs simultaneously, requiring the more abundant light seeds. The observed merger rate of BHs from heavy seeds alone is limited to ≲ 10^-1~yr^-1 for major mergers at z≥5. However, the presence of light seeds increases the major merger rate by several orders of magnitude, which peaks at a total BH mass of M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt;≃ 2× 10^3~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; over 5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;10 at a rate of ~ 30~yr^-1. These events are detectable by future GW observatories such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Precise sky localization and distance measurement of those GW events, with solid angle and luminosity distance uncertainties &amp;Delta;&amp;Omega;&amp;Delta;log D_L≲ 10^-4~deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, will enable EM identification of mergers at z≥5 and multi-messenger follow-up observations.

The H&amp;alpha; nebular emission line is an optimal tracer for recent star formation in galaxies. With the advent of JWST, this line has recently become observable at z&amp;gt;3 for the first time. We present a catalog of 1013 H&amp;alpha; emitters at 3.7&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6.7 in the GOODS fields obtained from a blind search in JWST NIRCam/grism data. We make use of the FRESCO survey's 124 arcmin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of observations in GOODS-North and GOODS-South with the F444W filter, probing H&amp;alpha; at 4.9&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6.7; and the CONGRESS survey's 62 arcmin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in GOODS-North with F356W, probing H&amp;alpha; at 3.8&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;5.1. We find an overdensity with 97 sources at z~4.4 in GOODS-N and confirm previously reported overdensities at z~5.2 in GOODS-N and at z~5.4 and z~5.9 in GOODS-S. We compute the observed H&amp;alpha; luminosity functions (LFs) in three bins centered at z~4.45, 5.30, and 6.15, which are the first such measurements at z&amp;gt;3 obtained based purely on spectroscopic data, robustly tracing galaxy star formation rates (SFRs) beyond the peak of the cosmic star formation history. We compare our results with theoretical predictions from three different simulations and find good agreement at z~4-6. The UV LFs of this spectroscopically-confirmed sample are in good agreement with pre-JWST measurements obtained with photometrically-selected objects. Finally, we derive SFR functions and integrate these to compute the evolution of the cosmic star-formation rate densities across z~4-6, finding values in good agreement with recent UV estimates from Lyman-break galaxies, which imply a continuous decrease in SFR density by a factor of 3x over z~4 to z~6. Our work shows the power of NIRCam grism observations to efficiently provide new tests for early galaxy formation models based on emission line statistics.

&lt;p&gt;
We infer supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion rates and Eddington ratios as a function of SMBH/host galaxy mass and redshift with the empirical TRINITY model of dark matter halo&amp;ndash;galaxy&amp;ndash;SMBH connection. The galaxy&amp;ndash;SMBH mass and growth rate connection from TRINITY matches galaxy observables from 0&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;13 and SMBH observables from 0&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6.5. Key findings include: 1) the ratio between cosmic SMBH accretion rate and galaxy star formation rate stays constant at ~ 2× 10^-3 from z=0-4, and decreases by 2 orders of magnitude from z=4-10; 2) the average SMBH Eddington ratio &amp;eta; increases towards higher redshifts, nearly reaching &amp;eta;=1 at z~ 10; 3) at fixed redshift for z&amp;lt;3, SMBHs/galaxies with higher masses have lower &amp;eta;, consistent with AGN downsizing; 4) the average ratio of specific SMBH accretion rate (SBHAR) to average specific star formation rate (SSFR) is nearly mass-independent, with a value SBHAR/SSFR~ 1, which decreases slightly from z=10 to z=0; 5) similar to galaxies, SMBHs reach their peak efficiency to convert baryons into mass when host halos reach 10^12 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;; 6) given galaxy and SMBH growth histories from TRINITY, the local descendants of 1&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;11 overmassive JWST AGNs will remain outliers from the local SMBH mass&amp;ndash;galaxy mass relation. These findings combine to give a simple explanation for massive (10^9-10^10M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) quasars at z&amp;gt;6: at these redshifts, dark matter halos grow with an e-folding time of ~ 45 Myrs, driving similar growth rates in both galaxies and SMBHs.

This article revisits the interpretation of cosmic probes such as SNIa and BAO under a two-regions model of the universe. Standard cosmological analyses assume homogeneity, yet observations are predominantly conducted in overdense regions where matter is clustered, potentially biasing conclusions about cosmic expansion. We refine an existing two-regions framework that accounts for both overdense and underdense areas, demonstrating that the apparent acceleration of the universe, typically attributed to dark energy, can emerge as a consequence of observational bias rather than a fundamental cosmological constant. By applying this model to SNIa and BAO measurements, we show that inhomogeneities can affect redshift and distance estimates in a way that mimics cosmic acceleration. This interpretation provides a natural resolution to the coincidence problem and offers an alternative explanation for the observed tensions in Hubble constant measurements. Additionally, it may shed light on the unexpectedly early formation of galaxies observed by JWST. These findings challenge the necessity of dark energy and suggest that the observed acceleration may be an artefact of the spatial distribution of matter rather than a true universal phenomenon.

Previous as well as recent observations by ISO, Spitzer, AKARI, SOFIA, JWST etc. have revealed various characteristics of mid-infrared emission bands between 3-20 micron. Subsequently, several forms of organics including Polycylic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)/PAH-like molecules are proposed as carriers for these bands. Deuterated PAH (PAD) is one such substituted PAH, which is proposed as a potential candidate carrier for weak emission bands at 4.4 and 4.65 micron, detected towards few astronomical targets and are characteristics of aromatic and aliphatic C-D stretching modes in a PAD molecule, respectively. However, the 4.4 micron band is not widely detected. In order to validate PADs as carriers for mid-infrared emission bands, an additional alternative tool is crucial. If PAHs are deuterated, they should also possess an inherent signature from the C-D out-of-plane (C-Doop) vibrations, which are at the longer wavelength side. In this report, features due to C-Doop modes in PAHs bearing a single to multiple deuterium atoms are reported by performing quantum-chemical calculations. This paper reports that some of the C-Doop vibrations appear at the 14-19 micron range. Also, the strength of C-Doop modes is not proportional to the D/H ratio in PAHs. In addition, a moderate change in the spectra of deuterated PAHs is observed from that of the undeuterated counterparts, as deuteration would alternate the adjacency class of the C-H bonds and the symmetry of the molecule. We discuss the efficiency and usefulness of these bands to constrain the form of PAHs emitting mid-infrared emission bands.

The removal of angular momentum from protostellar systems drives accretion onto the central star and may drive the dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Winds and jets can contribute to removing angular momentum from the disk, though the dominant process remain unclear. To date, observational studies of resolved disk winds have mostly targeted highly inclined disks. We report the detection of extended H2 and [Ne II] emission toward the young stellar object SY Cha with the JWST Mid-InfraRed Instrument Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI-MRS). This is one of the first polychromatic detections of extended H2 toward a moderately inclined, i=51.1 degrees, Class II source. We measure the semi-opening angle of the H2 emission as well as build a rotation diagram to determine the H2 excitation temperature and abundance. We find a wide semi-opening angle, high temperature, and low column density for the H2 emission, all of which are characteristic of a disk wind. We derive a molecular wind mass loss rate of 3+-2e-9 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;/yr, which is high compared to the previously derived stellar accretion rate of 6.6e-10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;/yr. This suggests either that the stellar accretion and the disk wind are driven by different mechanisms or that accretion onto the star is highly variable. These observations demonstrate MIRI-MRS's utility in expanding studies of resolved disk winds beyond edge-on sources.

&lt;p&gt;
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at high redshifts of z≳ 4-7, powered by accreting black holes (BHs) with masses of ~ 10^6-8~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. One remarkable distinction of these JWST-identified AGNs, compared to their low-redshift counterparts, is that at least ~ 20&amp;percnt; of them present H&amp;alpha; and/or H&amp;beta; absorption, which must be associated with extremely dense (≳ 10^9~cm^-3) gas in the broad-line region or its immediate surroundings. These Balmer absorption features unavoidably imply the presence of a Balmer break caused by the same dense gas. In this Letter, we quantitatively demonstrate that a Balmer break can form in AGN spectra without stellar components, when the accretion disk is heavily embedded in dense neutral gas clumps with densities of ~ 10^9-11~cm^-3, where hydrogen atoms are collisionally excited to the n=2 states and effectively absorb the AGN continuum at the bluer side of the Balmer limit. The non-stellar origin of a Balmer break offers a potential solution to the large stellar masses and densities inferred for little red dots (LRDs) when assuming that their continuum is primarily due to stellar light. Our calculations indicate that the observed Balmer absorption blueshifted by a few hundreds km~s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; suggests the presence of dense outflows in the nucleus at rates exceeding the Eddington value. Other spectral features such as higher equivalent widths of broad H&amp;alpha; emission and presence of OI lines observed in high-redshift AGNs including LRDs align with the predicted signatures of a dense super-Eddington accretion disk.

We investigate the star formation-AGN connection in the Seyfert 1 NGC 7469 using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) mid-infrared spectroscopic integral field unit (IFU) data. We use the IFU data to generate maps of different emission lines present in the spectrum, such as the star formation (SF) tracer [Ne II] 12.81&amp;mu;m, and the AGN tracer [Ne V] 14.32&amp;mu;m. We can separate the AGN- and SF-dominated regions using spatially resolved mid-infrared diagnostic diagrams, and further investigate the ionization sources powering each region by constructing photoionization models. We find that the previously detected eastern wind populates an intermediary region of the diagrams, between our star-forming and AGN points. Although it is possible that the star-forming ring may inherently not be uniform, this wind also coincides with a reduction in the [Ne II] emission in the ring, which suggests that the ionization cone intersects the ring in this direction.

&lt;p&gt;
We report the spectroscopic discovery of a massive quiescent galaxy at z&lt;sub&gt;spec&lt;/sub&gt;=7.29±0.01, just ~700 Myr after the Big Bang. RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 was selected from public JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging from the PRIMER survey and observed with JWST/NIRSpec as part of RUBIES. The NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum reveals one of the strongest Balmer breaks observed thus far at z&amp;gt;6, no emission lines, but tentative Balmer and Ca absorption features, as well as a Lyman break. Simultaneous modeling of the NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum and NIRCam and MIRI photometry (spanning 0.9-18 &amp;mu; m) shows that the galaxy formed a stellar mass of log(M_*/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;)=10.23^+0.04_-0.04 before z~8, and ceased forming stars 50-100 Myr prior to the time of observation, resulting in log(sSFR/Gyr^-1)&amp;lt;-1. We measure a small physical size of 209_-24^+33 pc, which implies a high stellar mass surface density within the effective radius of log(&amp;Sigma;_*,e/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; kpc^-2)=10.85_-0.12^+0.11 comparable to the highest densities measured in quiescent galaxies at z~2-5. The 3D stellar mass density profile of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 is remarkably similar to the central densities of local massive ellipticals, suggesting that at least some of their cores may have already been in place at z&amp;gt;7. The discovery of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 has strong implications for galaxy formation models: the estimated number density of quiescent galaxies at z~7 is &amp;gt;100× larger than predicted from any model to date, indicating that quiescent galaxies have formed earlier than previously expected.

&lt;p&gt;
The radial gradient of gas-phase metallicity is a powerful probe of the chemical and structural evolution of star-forming galaxies, closely tied to disk formation and gas kinematics in the early universe. We present spatially resolved chemical and dynamical properties for a sample of 25 galaxies at 0.5 ≲ z ≲ 1.7 from the \msasd survey. These innovative observations provide 3D spectroscopy of galaxies at a spatial resolution approaching JWST's diffraction limit and a high spectral resolution of R≃2700. The metallicity gradients measured in our galaxy sample range from -0.03 to 0.02 dex~kpc^-1. Most galaxies exhibit negative or flat radial gradients, indicating lower metallicity in the outskirts or uniform metallicity throughout the entire galaxy. We confirm a tight relationship between stellar mass and metallicity gradient at z~1 with small intrinsic scatter of 0.02 dex~kpc^-1. Our results indicate that metallicity gradients become increasingly negative as stellar mass increases, likely because the more massive galaxies tend to be more "disky". This relationship is consistent with the predictions from cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations with strong stellar feedback. This work presents the effort to harness the multiplexing capability of JWST NIRSpec/MSA in slit-stepping mode to map the chemical and kinematic profiles of high-redshift galaxies in large samples and at high spatial and spectral resolution.

&lt;p&gt;
The external environments surrounding molecular clouds vary widely across galaxies such as the Milky Way, and statistical samples of clouds are required to understand them. We present the Perseus Arm Molecular Survey (PAMS), a James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) survey combining new and archival data of molecular-cloud complexes in the outer Perseus spiral arm in ^12CO, ^13CO, and C^18O (J=3-2). With a survey area of ~8 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, PAMS covers well-known complexes such as W3, W5, and NGC 7538 with two fields at &amp;ell; ≈ 110&amp;deg; and &amp;ell; ≈ 135&amp;deg;. PAMS has an effective resolution of 17 arcsec, and rms sensitivity of T_mb = 0.7-1.0 K in 0.3 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; channels. Here we present a first look at the data, and compare the PAMS regions in the Outer Galaxy with Inner Galaxy regions from the CO Heterodyne Inner Milky Way Plane Survey (CHIMPS). By comparing the various CO data with maps of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; column density from Herschel, we calculate representative values for the CO-to-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; column-density X-factors, which are X_^12 CO (3-2)=4.0×10^20 and X_^13 CO (3-2)=4.0×10^21cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (K km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)^-1 with a factor of 1.5 uncertainty. We find that the emission profiles, size-linewidth and mass-radius relationships of ^13CO-traced structures are similar between the Inner and Outer Galaxy. Although PAMS sources are slightly more massive than their Inner Galaxy counterparts for a given size scale, the discrepancy can be accounted for by the Galactic gradient in gas-to-dust mass ratio, uncertainties in the X-factors, and selection biases. We have made the PAMS data publicly available, complementing other CO surveys targeting different regions of the Galaxy in different isotopologues and transitions.

&lt;p&gt;
We use the inferred evolution of Lyman-&amp;alpha; luminosities of galaxies in the redshift range of z ~ 9-16 from the James  Webb  Space  Telescope (JWST) data to predict the power spectrum of Loeb-Rybicki haloes formed by the scattering of Lyman-&amp;alpha; photons from neutral hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium expanding with the Hubble flow, until they Doppler shift out of resonance and escape towards the observer. This leads to the formation of the so-called Loeb-Rybicki intergalactic haloes, which are expected to be prominent even before the epoch of reionization. We find excellent prospects for a statistical detection of the intensity mapping signal from the clustering of these haloes, with current and future experiments such as the JWST, SPHEREx and CDIM. We also describe the detectability of the signal in cross-correlation with the 21-cm emission from the neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium at these redshifts. We find that the cross-correlation signal should be detectable at a significance of a few to a few tens of standard deviations out to z ~ 13 and marginally out to z ~ 16, using the above experiments in combination with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA)-LOW and its pathfinder, the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA).

&lt;p&gt;
The Virgo Cluster is the nearest substantial cluster of galaxies to the Milky Way and a cornerstone of the extragalactic distance scale. Here, we present JWST/NIRCam observations that simultaneously cover the cores and halos of ten galaxies in and around the Virgo Cluster and are designed to perform simultaneous measurements of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) and surface brightness fluctuations (SBF). Seven of the targets are within the Virgo Cluster and where we are able to resolve some of the cluster's substructure, while an additional three provide important constraints on Virgo infall. The seven galaxies within Virgo itself all have SBF measurements from the Advanced Camera for Surveys Virgo Cluster Survey (ACSVCS). After adjusting the ACSVCS measurements for the offset from our new JWST TRGB measurements, we determine a distance to the Virgo Cluster of d = 16.17 ± 0.25 (stat) ± 0.47 (sys) Mpc. The work presented here is part of a larger program to develop a Population II distance scale through the TRGB and SBF that is completely independent of the prominent Cepheid + Type Ia supernova ladder. The TRGB distances to the galaxies presented here, when combined with future SBF measurements, will provide a crucial step forward for determining whether or not systematic errors can explain the well-known "Hubble tension'' or if there is significant evidence for cracks in the &amp;Lambda;CDM model.

&lt;p&gt;
\requiremediawiki-texvcCosmic Reionisation commenced when ultraviolet (UV) radiation produced in the first galaxies began illuminating the cold, neutral gas that filled the primordial Universe. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have shown that surprisingly UV-bright galaxies were in place beyond redshift z = 14, when the Universe was less than 300   Myr old. Smooth turnovers of their UV continua have been interpreted as damping-wing absorption of Lyman-&amp;alpha; (Ly&amp;alpha;), the principal hydrogen transition. However, spectral signatures encoding crucial properties of these sources, such as their emergent radiation field, largely remain elusive. Here we report spectroscopy from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) of a galaxy at redshift z = 13.0 that reveal a singular, bright emission line unambiguously identified as Ly&amp;alpha;, in addition to a smooth turnover. We observe an equivalent width of EW_Ly&amp;alpha; &amp;gt; 40   &amp;#8491; (rest frame), previously only seen at z &amp;lt; 9 where the intervening intergalactic medium (IGM) becomes increasingly ionised. Together with an extremely blue UV continuum, the unexpected Ly&amp;alpha; emission indicates the galaxy is a prolific producer and leaker of ionising photons. This suggests massive, hot stars or an active galactic nucleus (AGN) have created an early reionised region to prevent complete extinction of Ly&amp;alpha;, thus shedding new light on the nature of the earliest galaxies and the onset of Reionisation only 330   Myr after the Big Bang.

&lt;p&gt;
In this work, we spectroscopically select narrow-line AGN (NLAGN) among the ~ 300 publicly available medium-resolution spectra of the CEERS Survey. Using both traditional and newly identified emission line NLAGN diagnostics diagrams, we identified 52 NLAGN at 2≲ z≲ 9 on which we performed a detailed multiwavelength analysis. We also identified 4 new z≲ 2 broad-line AGN (BLAGN), in addition to the 8 previously reported high-z BLAGN. We found that the traditional BPT diagnostic diagrams are not suited to identify high-z AGN, while most of the high-z NLAGN are selected using the recently proposed AGN diagnostic diagrams based on the [OIII]&amp;lambda;4363 auroral line or high-ionization emission lines. We compared the emission line velocity dispersion and the obscuration of the sample of NLAGN with those of the parent sample without finding significant differences between the two distributions, suggesting a population of AGN heavily buried and not significantly impacting the host galaxies' physical properties, as further confirmed by SED-fitting. The bolometric luminosities of the high-z NLAGNs selected in this work are well below those sampled by surveys before JWST, potentially explaining the weak impact of these AGN. Finally, we investigate the X-ray properties of the selected NLAGN and of the sample of high-z BLAGN. We find that all but 4 NLAGN are undetected in the deep X-ray image of the field, as well as all the high-z BLAGN. We do not obtain a detection even by stacking the undetected sources, resulting in an X-ray weakness of ~ 1-2 dex from what is expected based on their bolometric luminosities. To discriminate between a heavily obscured AGN scenario or an intrinsic X-ray weakness of these sources, we performed a radio stacking analysis, which did not reveal any detection leaving open the questions about the origin of the X-ray weakness.

&lt;p&gt;
The James Webb Space telescope has discovered an abundant population of broad line emitters, typical signposts for Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Many of these sources have red colors and a compact appearance that has led to naming them `Little Red Dots'. In this paper we develop a detailed framework to estimate the photometry of AGN embedded in galaxies extracted from the \Obelisk cosmological simulation to understand the properties of color-selected Little Red Dots (cLRDs) in the context of the full AGN and massive black hole population. We find that using realistic spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and attenuation for AGN we can explain the shape of the cLRD SED as long as galaxies host a sufficiently luminous AGN that is not too much or too little attenuated. When attenuation is too low or too high, AGN do not enter the cLRD selection, because the AGN dominates over the host galaxy too much in blue filters, or it does not contribute to photometry anywhere, respectively. cLRDs are also characterized by high Eddington ratios, possibility super-Eddington, and/or high ratios between black hole and stellar mass.

We report the identification of two galaxy overdensities at z~5.7 in the sightline of the galaxy cluster Abell 2744. These overdensities consist of 25 and 17 member galaxies, spectroscopically confirmed with JWST NIRSpec/MSA and NIRCam/WFSS. Each overdensity has a total stellar mass of ~2×10^10 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and a star formation rate of ~200 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;/yr within a central region of radius R=2 Mpc (physical). The sensitive PRISM spectra allow us to identify six galaxies that show weak Ha+[NII] emissions within the overdensities (27±6&amp;percnt;), whereas the fraction of such galaxies is found significantly lower (6±2&amp;percnt;) in field samples of the equivalent redshift range. These weak emission line galaxies, dubbed as wELGs, exhibit a strong continuum break at 4000AA rest-frame, a characteristic feature of evolved stellar populations. The high observed fraction of wELGs in the two overdensities is consistent with the idea that high-density environments are an ideal site where galaxies can accelerate their evolutionary pace compared to field analogs. Our study pinpoints an early onset of environmental effects, already important within one billion years after the Big Bang, and provides a complementary perspective on the emergence of quenched, massive galaxies at lower redshifts. Potential contributions from black hole accretion feedback to the reduction of star formation activity are discussed, but the connection to the local environments remains unclear.

&lt;p&gt;
The use of extremely metal-deficient dwarf galaxies (XMDs) as nearby analogs for high-redshift protogalaxies is generating renewed interest due to recent JWST observations studying these protogalaxies. However, the existence of a population of unenriched galaxies at z~0 raises fundamental questions about how galaxies with such pristine gas reservoirs could be formed. To address these questions we study XMDs in the IllustrisTNG simulation. We find that XMDs at z=0 are not relics of the first galaxies, but dwarf galaxies that experience a dramatic ~0.3 dex drop in their gas-phase metallicity in the past few Gyr. We investigate possible causes of this drop in metallicity including high gas fractions, outflow efficiency or inflow/outflow rates, unique environments, pristine inflow metallicity, and inflow/SFR interactions. Of these, we find that inflow/outflow interactions, parameterized by the cumulative regional SFR experienced by inflows, has the strongest correlation with dwarf galaxy metallicity and XMD formation. In other words, inefficient gas enrichment during the short time between its accretion from the CGM and the initiation of star formation is the most important cause of XMD formation in the simulation. Observationally, we identify differences in star formation history between XMDs and non-XMDs (with XMDs having significantly decreased star formation rates on 1-5 Gyr timescales) and differences in galaxy size (with XMDs having a more extended young stellar population) as the primary differences between the two populations. These results highlight the importance of inflow enrichment efficiency as a possible driver of dwarf galaxy metallicities.

Over the last decade, the Atacama Large Millimeter Array has revealed massive, dusty star-forming galaxies at z≳5, and the James Webb Space Telescope is primed to uncover even more information about them. These observations need dust evolution theory to provide context and are excellent benchmarks to test this theory. Here, we investigate the evolution of galactic dust budget at cosmic dawn using a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations of moderately massive, high-redshift (M_star≳10^9 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;; z≳5) galaxies from the FIRE project, the highest resolution (m_b ≈ 7100  M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) of such simulations to date. Our simulations incorporate a dust evolution model that accounts for the dominant sources of dust production, growth, and destruction and follows the evolution of specific dust species, allowing it to replicate a wide range of present-day observations. We find, similar to other theoretical works, that dust growth via gas-dust accretion is the dominant producer of dust mass for these massive, z≳ 5 galaxies. However, our fiducial model produces M_dust that fall ≳1 dex below observations at any given M_star (typical uncertainties are ~1 dex), which we attribute to reduced accretion efficiencies caused by a combination of low galactic metallicities and extremely bursty star formation. Modest enhancements (i.e., within observational/theoretical uncertainties) to accretion and SNe II dust creation raise M_dust by ≲1 dex, but this still falls below observations which assume T_dust~25 K. One possibility is that inferred dust masses for z≳4 galaxies are overestimated, and recent observational/analytical works that find T_dust~50 K along with metallicity constraints tentatively support this.

We present star formation rates (SFR), the mass-metallicity relation (MZR), and the SFR-dependent MZR across redshifts 4 to 10 using 81 star-forming galaxies observed by the JWST NIRSpec employing both low-resolution PRISM and medium-resolution gratings, including galaxies from the JADES GOODS-N and GOODS-S fields, the JWST-PRIMAL Legacy Survey, and additional galaxies from the literature in Abell 2744, SMACS-0723, RXJ2129, BDF, COSMOS, and MACS1149 fields. These galaxies span a 3 dex stellar mass range of 10^7 &amp;lt; M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;ast;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 10^10, with an average SFR of 7.2 ± 1.2 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1 and an average metallicity of 12+log(O/H) = 7.91 ± 0.08. Our findings align with previous observations up to z=8 for the MZR and indicate no deviation from local universe FMR up to this redshift. Beyond z=8, we observe a significant deviation ~ 0.27 dex) in FMR, consistent with recent JWST findings. We also integrate CEERS (135 galaxies) and JADES (47 galaxies) samples with our data to study metallicity evolution with redshift in a combined sample of 263 galaxies, revealing a decreasing metallicity trend with a slope of 0.067 ± 0.013, consistent with IllustrisTNG and EAGLE, but contradicts with FIRE simulations. We introduce an empirical mass-metallicity-redshift (MZ-z relation): 12+log(O/H)=6.29 + 0.237 ×log(M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;ast;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) - 0.06 × (1+z), which accurately reproduces the observed trends in metallicity with both redshift and stellar mass. This trend underscores the "Grand Challenge'' in understanding the factors driving high-redshift galactic metallicity trends, such as inflow, outflow, and AGN/stellar feedback &amp;ndash; and emphasizes the need for further investigations with larger samples and enhanced simulations.

We present the design and observations of low resolution JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy from the Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) Cycle 1 JWST Treasury program. Targets are selected using JWST/NIRCam photometry from UNCOVER and other programs, and cover a wide range of categories and redshifts to ensure the legacy value of the survey. These categories include the first galaxies at z≳10, faint galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization (z~6-8), high redshift AGN (z≳6), Population III star candidates, distant quiescent and dusty galaxies (1≲z≲ 6), and filler galaxies sampling redshift&amp;ndash;color&amp;ndash;magnitude space from z~0.1-13. Seven NIRSpec MSA masks across the extended Abell 2744 cluster were observed, along with NIRCam parallel imaging in 8 filters (F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M, F444W, F480M) over a total area of ~26 arcmin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, overlapping existing HST coverage from programs including the Hubble Frontier Fields and BUFFALO. We successfully observed 553 objects down to m_F444W~30AB, and by leveraging mask overlaps, we reach total on-target exposure times ranging from 2.4-16.7h. We demonstrate the success rate and distribution of confirmed redshifts, and also highlight the rich information revealed by these ultradeep spectra for a subset of our targets. An updated lens model of Abell 2744 is also presented, including 14 additional spectroscopic redshifts and finding a total cluster mass of M_SL=(2.1±0.3)×10^15 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. We publicly release reduced 1D and 2D spectra for all objects observed in Summer 2023 along with a spectroscopic redshift catalog and the updated lens model of the cluster (https://jwst-uncover.github.io/DR4.html).

We present a comprehensive examination of the three latest versions of the L-Galaxies semi-analytic galaxy formation model, focusing on the evolution of galaxy properties across a broad stellar mass range (10^7\:M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;≲M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;≲10^12\:M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) from z=0 to z≃10. This study is the first to compare predictions of L-Galaxies with high-redshift observations well outside the original calibration regime, utilising multiband data from surveys such as SDSS, CANDELS, COSMOS, HST, JWST, and ALMA. We assess the models' ability to reproduce various time-dependent galaxy scaling relations for star-forming and quenched galaxies. Key focus areas include global galaxy properties such as stellar mass functions, cosmic star formation rate density, and the evolution of the main sequence of star-forming galaxies. Additionally, we examine resolved morphological properties such as the galaxy mass-size relation, alongside core (R&amp;lt;1 kpc) and effective (R&amp;lt;R_e) stellar-mass surface densities as a function of stellar mass. This analysis reveals that the L-Galaxies models are in qualitatively good agreement with observed global scaling relations up to z≃10. However, significant discrepancies exist at both low and high redshifts in accurately reproducing the number density, size, and surface density evolution of quenched galaxies. These issues are most pronounced for massive central galaxies, where the simulations underpredict the abundance of quenched systems at z≥1.5, reaching a discrepancy of a factor of 60 by z≈3, with sizes several times larger than observed. Therefore, we propose that the physical prescriptions governing galaxy quenching, such as AGN feedback and processes related to merging, require improvement to be more consistent with observational data.

We present a detailed JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam analysis of a gravitationally-lensed galaxy (&amp;mu;=17-21) at redshift 6.14 magnified by the Hubble Frontier Field galaxy cluster MACS J0416. The target galaxy is overall a typical compact and UV-faint (M_UV=-17.8) Lyman-&amp;alpha; emitter, yet the large magnification allows the detailed characterization of structures on sub-galactic scales (down to a few parsecs). Prominent optical H&amp;alpha;, H&amp;beta; and [OIII]&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;4959,5007 lines are spatially resolved with the high spectral resolution grating (G395H, R~2700), with large equivalent widths, EW(H&amp;beta;+[OIII])≳1000 &amp;#8491;, and elevated ionising photon production efficiencies log( &amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt; /erg^-1Hz)=25.2-25.7. NIRCam deep imaging reveals the presence of compact rest-UV bright regions along with individual star clusters of R_eff=3-8~pc in size and M~2\cdot10^5-5\cdot10^6~M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; in mass. These clusters are characterised by steep UV slopes, &amp;beta;_UV≲-2.5, which in some cases are associated with a dearth of line emission, indicating possible leaking of the ionizing radiation, as also supported by a Lyman-&amp;alpha; emission peaking at ~100~km~s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; from the systemic redshift. While the entire system is characterised by low-metallicity, ~0.1~Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, the NIRSpec-IFU map also reveals the presence of a low-luminosity, metal-poor region with Z≲2&amp;percnt;~Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, barely detected in NIRCam imaging; this region is displaced by &amp;gt;200~pc from one of the brightest structures of the system in UV, and would have been too faint to detect if not for the large magnification of the system.

In this study, we present a detailed multiphase analysis of HZ4, a main-sequence star-forming galaxy at z ~ 5.5, known for being a turbulent rotating disk and having a detection of a [CII] outflow in the ALMA observations. We exploit JWST/NIRSpec observations in the integral field spectroscopy mode with low- and high-spectral resolution that allow us for the first time to spatially resolve the rest-frame UV and optical emission of the galaxy to investigate the galaxy properties. In particular, the high-resolution dataset allows us to study the kinematics of the ionized gas phase, and the conditions of the interstellar medium, such as the excitation mechanism, dust attenuation, and metallicity. The lower-spectral resolution observations allow us to study the continuum emission and infer the stellar populations' ages and properties. Our findings suggest that HZ4 is a galaxy merger rather than a rotating disk as previously inferred from lower resolution [CII] data. The merger is associated with an extended broad, blueshifted emission, potentially indicative of an outflow originating from a region of intense star formation and extending up to 4 kpc. In light of these new observations we reanalyzed the ALMA data to compare the multiphase gas properties. If we interpret the broad components seen in [CII] and [OIII]&amp;lambda;5007\.A as outflows, the neutral and ionized components are co-spatial, the mass loading factor of the ionized phase is significantly lower than that of the neutral phase, aligning with trends observed in multi-phase systems at lower redshifts. Nonetheless, additional observations and larger statistical samples are essential to determine the role of mergers and outflows in the early Universe and to clarify the origin of the broad emission components observed in this system.

&lt;p&gt;
In fuzzy dark matter (FDM) cosmologies, the dark matter consists of ultralight bosons (m≲10^-20 eV). The astrophysically large de Broglie wavelengths of such particles hinder the formation of low-mass dark matter halos. This implies a testable prediction: a corresponding suppression in the faint-end of the ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF) of galaxies. Notably, recent estimates of the faint-end UVLF at z~5-9 in the Hubble Frontier Fields, behind foreground lensing clusters, probe up to five magnitudes fainter than typical ("blank-field") regions. These measurements thus far disfavor prominent turnovers in the UVLF at low luminosity, implying bounds on FDM. We fit a semi-empirical model to these and blank-field UVLF data, including the FDM particle mass as a free parameter. This fit excludes cases where the dark matter is entirely a boson of mass m&amp;lt;1.5×10^-21 eV (with 2&amp;sigma; confidence). We also present a less stringent bound deriving solely from the requirement that the total observed abundance of galaxies, integrated over all luminosities, must not exceed the total halo abundance in FDM. This more model-agnostic bound disfavors m&amp;lt;5×10^-22 eV (2&amp;sigma;). We forecast that future UVLF measurements from JWST lensing fields may probe masses several times larger than these bounds, although we demonstrate this is subject to theoretical uncertainties in modeling the FDM halo mass function.

We present new free-form and hybrid mass reconstructions of the galaxy cluster lens MACS J0416.1-2403 at z=0.396 using the lens inversion method GRALE. The reconstructions use 237 spectroscopically confirmed multiple images from Bergamini et. al. 2023 as the main input. Our primary model reconstructs images to a positional accuracy of 0.191", thus representing one of the most precise reconstructions of this lens to date. Our models find broad agreement with previous reconstructions, and identify two ~ 10^12 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; light-unaffiliated substructures. We focus on two highly magnified arcs: Spock and Mothra. Our model features a unique critical curve structure around the Spock arc with 2 crossings. This structure enables sufficient magnification across this arc to potentially explain the large number of transients as microlensing events of supergiant stars. Additionally, we develop a model of the millilens substructure expected to be magnifying Mothra, which may be a binary pair of supergiants with &amp;mu; ~ 6000. This model accounts for flexibility in the millilens position while preserving the observed flux and minimizing image position displacements along the Mothra arc. We constrain the millilens mass and core radius to ≲ 10^6 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and ≲ 17 pc, respectively, which would render it one of the smallest and most compact substructures constrained by lensing. If the millilens is dominated by wave dark matter, the axion mass is constrained to be ≲ 3.0 × 10^-21 eV. Further monitoring of this lens with JWST will uncover more transients, permitting tighter constraints on the structure surrounding these two arcs.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have revolutionized extragalactic research, particularly with the discovery of little red dots (LRD), which we propose are dust-reddened broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Their unique v-shape spectral feature observed through JWST/NIRCam challenges us to discern the relative contributions of the galaxy and AGN. We study a spectral energy distribution (SED) model for LRDs from rest-frame UV to infrared bands. We hypothesize that the incident radiation from an AGN, characterized by a typical SED, is embedded in an extended dusty medium with an extinction law similar to those seen in dense regions such as Orion Nebula or certain AGN environments. The UV-optical spectrum is described by dust-attenuated AGN emission, featuring a red optical continuum at &amp;lambda;&amp;gt;4000 A and a flat UV spectral shape established through a gray extinction curve at &amp;lambda;&amp;lt;3000 A, due to the absence of small-size grains. There is no need for additional stellar emission or AGN scattered light. In the infrared, the SED is shaped by an extended dust and gas distribution (&amp;gamma;&amp;lt;1; &amp;rho;&amp;prop; r^-&amp;gamma;) with a characteristic gas density of ≃ 10-10^3~cm^-3, which allows relatively cool dust temperatures to dominate the radiation, thereby shifting the energy peak from near- to mid-infrared bands. This model, unlike the typical AGN hot torus models, can produce an infrared SED flattening that is consistent with LRD observations through JWST MIRI. Such a density structure can arise from the coexistence of inflows and outflows during the early assembly of galactic nuclei. This might be the reason why LRDs emerge preferentially in the high-redshift universe younger than one billion years.

We analyse ultra-deep JWST observations of the galaxy JADES-GS-z9-0 at z = 9.4327, and derive detailed stellar and interstellar medium (ISM) properties of this luminous (MUV=-20.43) high-redshift system. Complementary information from NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec (both low- and medium-resolution) spectroscopy reveal a compact system (Re ~110 pc) characterised by a steeply rising star formation history, which is reflected in the inferred young stellar age (t ~ 3 Myr, light-weighted), high star-formation rate surface density (&amp;Sigma;SFR ~ 72 M yr-1 kpc-2), high ionisation parameter (log(U) ~ -1.5), low metallicity (12+log(O/H) ~ 7.5), and low carbon-over-oxygen abundance ([C/O] = -0.64). Leveraging the detection of N iii]1750 we derive nitrogen-over-oxygen abundance ([N/O] ~ 0) higher than the plateau followed by low-redshift galaxies of similar metallicity, possibly revealing the imprint from (very) massive stars on the ISM enrichment and favouring a top-heavy Initial Mass Function (IMF) scenario. Massive stars powering a hard radiation field are also required to explain the rest-frame UV line ratios, though the presence of the high-excitation [Ne v]&amp;lambda;3426 emission line possibly hints at additional ionization from an AGN. We also report the tentative detection of Ly&amp;alpha; emission in the G140M spectrum, shifted by ~450 km/s redward of the systemic redshift. Combined with a modelling of the Ly&amp;alpha; spectral break, we rule out the presence of very high column densities of neutral gas pertaining to local absorbers, as well as any extended surrounding ionised bubble, suggesting that JADES-GS-z9-0 has not yet significantly contributed to cosmic Reionization.

We present results on the emission-line properties of z=1.4-7.5 star-forming galaxies in the Assembly of Ultradeep Rest-optical Observations Revealing Astrophysics (AURORA) Cycle 1 JWST/NIRSpec program. Based on its depth, continuous wavelength coverage from 1&amp;ndash;5 microns, and medium spectral resolution (R~1000), AURORA includes detections of a large suite of nebular emission lines spanning a broad range in rest wavelength. We investigate the locations of AURORA galaxies in multiple different emission-line diagrams, including traditional "BPT" diagrams of [OIII]/Hbeta vs. [NII]/Halpha, [SII]/Halpha, and [OI]/Halpha, and the "ionization-metallicity" diagram of [OIII]/[OII] (O32) vs. ([OIII]+[OII])/Hbeta (R23). We also consider a bluer rest-frame "ionization-metallicity" diagram introduced recently to characterize z&amp;gt;10 galaxies: [NeIII]/[OII] vs. ([NeIII]+[OII])/Hdelta; as well as longer-wavelength diagnostic diagrams extending into the rest-frame near-IR: [OIII]/Hbeta vs. [SIII]/[SII] (S32); and HeI/Pagamma and [SIII]/Pagamma vs. [FeII]/Pabeta. With a significant boost in signal-to-noise and large, representative samples of individual galaxy detections, the AURORA emission-line diagrams presented here definitively confirm a physical picture in which chemically-young, alpha-enhanced, massive stars photoionize the ISM in distant galaxies with a harder ionizing spectrum at fixed nebular metallicity than in their z~0 counterparts. We also uncover previously unseen evolution prior to z~2 in the [OIII]/Hbeta vs. [NII]/Halpha diagram, which motivates deep NIRSpec observations at even higher redshift. Finally, we present the first statistical sample of rest-frame near-IR emission-line diagnostics in star-forming galaxies at high redshift. In order to truly interpret rest-frame near-IR line ratios including [FeII], we must obtain better constraints on dust depletion in the high-redshift ISM.

&lt;p&gt;
The stellar structures of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) undergo significant size growth during their mass assembly and must pass through a compaction phase as they evolve into quiescent galaxies (QGs). To shed light on the mechanisms behind this structural evolution, we study the morphology of the star-forming components of 665 SFGs at 0&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;2.5 measured using JWST/MIRI observation and compare them with the morphology of their stellar components taken from the literature. The stellar and star-forming components of most SFGs (66%) have extended disk-like structures that are aligned with each other and are of the same size. The star-forming components of these galaxies follow a mass-size relation, similar to that followed by their stellar components. At the highest mass, the optical S\'ersic index of these SFGs increases to 2.5, suggesting the presence of a dominant stellar bulge. Because their star-forming components remain disk-like, these bulges cannot have formed by secular in-situ growth. We identify a second population of galaxies lying below the MIR mass-size relation, with compact star-forming components embedded in extended stellar components (EC galaxy). These galaxies are overall rare (15%) but become more dominant (30%) at high mass (&amp;gt;10^10.5M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;). The compact star-forming components of these galaxies are also concentrated and slightly spheroidal, suggesting that this compaction phase can build dense bulge in-situ. Finally, we identify a third population of SFGs (19%), with both compact stellar and star-forming components. The density of their stellar cores resemble those of QGs and are compatible with being the descendants of EC galaxy. Overall, the structural evolution of SFGs is mainly dominated by a secular inside-out growth, which can, however, be interrupted by violent compaction phase(s) that can build dominant stellar bulges like those in massive SFGs or QGs.

&lt;p&gt;
We present JWST NIRSpec observations in IFS mode of the galaxy GS5001 at redshift z=3.47, the central member of a candidate protocluster in the GOODS-S field. The data cover a field of view (FoV) of 4''×4'' (~30×30~kpc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and were obtained as part of the GA-NIFS GTO program. The observations include both high (R~2700) and low (R~100) spectral resolution data, spanning the rest-frame wavelength ranges 3700-6780A and 1300-11850A, respectively. We analyse the spatially resolved ionised gas kinematics and interstellar medium properties, including obscuration, gas metallicity, excitation, ionisation parameter, and electron density. In addition to the main galaxy (GS5001), the NIRSpec FoV covers three components in the south, with velocities blue-shifted by -150 km/s with respect to the main galaxy, and another source in the north redshifted by ~200 km/s. Optical line ratio diagnostics indicate star formation ionisation and electron densities of ~500 cm^-3 across all sources in the FoV. The gas-phase metallicity in the main galaxy is 12+log(O/H) = 8.45±0.04, and slightly lower in the companions (12+log(O/H) = 8.34-8.42), consistent with the mass-metallicity relation at z~3. We find peculiar line ratios (high log [NII]/H&amp;alpha;, low log [OIII]/H&amp;beta;) in the northern part of GS5001. These could be attributed to either higher metallicity, or to shocks resulting from the interaction of the main galaxy with the northern source. We identify a spatially resolved outflow in the main galaxy, with an extension of about 3 kpc. We find maximum outflow velocities of ~400 km/s, an outflow mass of (1.7±0.4)× 10^8 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, a mass outflow rate of 23±5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; yr^-1 and a mass loading factor of 0.23. These properties are compatible with star formation being the driver of the outflow.

JWST is revolutionizing our view of the early Universe by pushing the boundaries of detectable galaxies and black holes in redshift (upward) and mass (downward). The Little Red Dots (LRDs), detected by several surveys at z &amp;gt; 4, present a significant interpretational challenge, as their Spectral Energy Distributions (SED) can mimic both AGN and stellar population templates. This study analyzes 19 LRDs from the JADES survey, utilizing NIRCam and MIRI photometry. By performing SED fitting across a vast parameter space, we explore a broad range of AGN fractions, defined as the ratio of the monochromatic luminosities (AGN, galaxy, and dust) over a specified wavelength range, 0.4 - 0.7 &amp;mu; m rest-frame. We find that 17 of the 19 LRDs investigated are consistent with having significant AGN contributions, with best-fitting AGN fractions ranging between 20% and 70%, while one galaxy shows a low AGN contribution (2%) and another appears to be purely star-forming. Moreover, assuming these LRDs do indeed host AGN, we can place limits on their black hole masses using the inferred AGN bolometric luminosities and adopting the Eddington limit. We find that, independent of the specific AGN fraction adopted, the LRDs' black holes are significantly overmassive relative to their host galaxies &amp;ndash; by ~ 1 dex, and up to ~ 4 dex in the most extreme cases &amp;ndash; compared to the local M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;/sub&gt; - M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; relation. The presence of overmassive black holes in the high-z Universe may provide the strongest evidence yet of heavy black hole seeding occurring during the cosmic dark ages.

&lt;p&gt;
We analyze ionized gas emission lines in deep rest-frame optical spectra of 16 quiescent galaxies at redshift 1.7&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;3.5 observed with JWST/NIRSpec by the Blue Jay survey. Robust detection of emission lines in 75&amp;percnt; of the sample indicates the presence of ongoing ionizing sources in this passive population. The H&amp;alpha; line luminosities confirm that the population is quiescent, with star formation rates that are at least ten times lower than the main sequence of star formation. The quiescent sample is clearly separate from the star-forming population in line diagnostic diagrams, and occupies a region usually populated by active galactic nuclei (AGN). Analysis of the observed line ratios, equivalent widths, and velocity dispersions leads us to conclude that in most cases the gas is ionized by AGN activity, despite the lack of X-ray detections. A subset of the sample also hosts ionized and/or neutral outflows. Our results show, for the first time using a representative sample, that low luminosity AGN are extremely common among quiescent galaxies at high redshift. These low luminosity AGN may play a key role in quenching star formation and in maintaining massive galaxies quiescent from Cosmic Noon to z~0.

Recent JWST observations have uncovered an unexpectedly large population of massive quiescent galaxies at z&amp;gt;3. Using the cosmological simulations IllustrisTNG and ASTRID, we identify analogous galaxies and investigate their abundance, formation, quenching mechanisms, and post-quenching evolution for stellar masses 9.5 &amp;lt; log_10 (M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;lt; 12. We apply three different quenching definitions and find that both simulations significantly underestimate the comoving number density of quenched massive galaxies at z ≳ 3 compared to JWST observations by up to ~ 2 dex. In both simulations, the high-z quenched massive galaxies often host overmassive central black holes above the local M_BH-M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;sext;&lt;/sub&gt; relation, implying that AGN feedback is key in quenching galaxies in the early Universe. The typical quenching timescales for these galaxies are ~ 200-600 Myr. IllustrisTNG primarily employs AGN kinetic feedback, while ASTRID relies on AGN thermal feedback at z &amp;gt; 2.3, which is less effective and has a longer quenching timescale. Although these simulations differ in many aspects, making a direct comparison challenging, our findings suggest the need for improved physical models of AGN feedback in galaxy formation simulations. At lower stellar masses, the quenched galaxies have denser local environments than the star-forming galaxies, suggesting that environmental quenching helps quench less massive galaxies. We also study the post-quenching evolution of the high-z massive quiescent galaxies and find that many experience subsequent reactivation of star formation, evolving into primary progenitors of z=0 brightest cluster galaxies.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has spectroscopically confirmed numerous galaxies at z &amp;gt; 10. While weak rest-ultraviolet emission lines have only been seen in a handful of sources, the stronger rest-optical emission lines are highly diagnostic and accessible at mid-infrared wavelengths with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) of JWST. We report the photometric detection of the distant spectroscopically confirmed galaxy JADES-GS-z14-0 at z = 14.32^+0.08_-0.20 with MIRI at 7.7 &amp;mu;m. The most plausible solution for the stellar population properties is that this galaxy contains half a billion solar masses in stars with a strong burst of star formation in the most recent few million years. For this model, at least one-third of the flux at 7.7 &amp;mu;m comes from the rest-optical emission lines H&amp;beta; and/or [OIII]&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;4959,5007. The inferred properties of JADES-GS-z14-0 suggest rapid mass assembly and metal enrichment during the earliest phases of galaxy formation.

We conduct a first comprehensive study of the Luminosity Function (LF) using a non-parametric approach. We use Gaussian Process to fit available luminosity data between redshifts z ~ 2-8. Our free-form LF in the non-parametric approach rules out the conventional Schechter function model to describe the abundance-magnitude relation at redshifts z=3 and 4. Hints of deviation from the Schechter function are also noticed at redshifts 2, 7 and 8 at lower statistical significance. Significant deviation starts for brighter ionizing sources at M_UV ≲ -21. The UV luminosity density data at different redshifts are then derived by integrating the LFs obtained from both methods with a truncation magnitude of -17. In our analysis, we also include the first 90 arcmin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; JWST/NIRCam data at z ~ 9-12. Since at larger magnitudes, we do not find major deviations from the Schechter function, the integrated luminosity density differs marginally between the two methods. Finally, we obtain the history of reionization from a joint analysis of UV luminosity density data along with the ionization fraction data and Planck observation of Cosmic Microwave Background. The history of reionization is not affected by the deviation of LFs from Schechter function at lower magnitudes. We derive reionization optical depth to be &amp;tau;_re=0.0494^+0.0007_-0.0006 and the duration between 10&amp;percnt; and 90&amp;percnt; completion of ionization process is found to be &amp;Delta; z~ 1.627^+0.059_-0.071.

&lt;p&gt;
JWST is providing constraints on the history of reionization owing to its ability to detect faint galaxies at z\gg6. Modeling this history requires understanding both the ionizing photon production rate ( &amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt; ) and the fraction of those photons that escape into the intergalactic medium (f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt;). Observational estimates of these quantities generally rely on spectroscopy for which large samples with well-defined selection functions are limited. To overcome this challenge, we present and release an implicit likelihood inference pipeline, PHOTONIOn, trained on mock photometry to predict the escaped ionizing luminosity of individual galaxies (N&amp;#775;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt;) based on photometric magnitudes and redshifts. We show that PHOTONIOn is able to reliably infer N&amp;#775;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt; from photometry. This is in contrast to traditional SED-fitting approaches which rely on f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt; prescriptions that often over-predict N&amp;#775;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt; for LyC-dim galaxies, even when given access to spectroscopic data. We have deployed PHOTONIOn on a sample of 4,559 high-redshift galaxies from the JADES Deep survey, finding gentle redshift evolutions of log_10(N&amp;#775;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt;) = (0.08±0.01)z + (51.60±0.06) and log_10(f&lt;sub&gt;esc&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;xi;&lt;sub&gt;ion&lt;/sub&gt; ) = (0.07±0.01)z + (24.12±0.07). Late-time values for the ionizing photon production rate density are consistent with theoretical models and observations. We measure the evolution of the IGM ionized fraction to find that observed populations of star-forming galaxies are capable of driving reionization in GOODS-S to completion by z~ 5.3 without the need for AGN or other exotic sources, consistent with other studies of the same field. The 20&amp;percnt; of UV-brightest galaxies (M_UV&amp;lt;-18.5) reionize 35&amp;percnt; of the survey volume, demonstrating that UV faint LyC emitters are crucial for reionization.

&lt;p&gt;
We study of the role of galaxy-galaxy interactions and disk instabilities in producing starburst activity in galaxies out to z = 4. For this, we use a sample of 387 galaxies with robust total star formation rate measurements from Herschel, gas masses from ALMA, stellar masses and redshifts from multi-band photometry, and JWST/NIRCam rest-frame optical imaging. Using mass-controlled samples, we find an increased fraction of interacting galaxies in the starburst regime at all redshifts out to z = 4. This increase correlates with star formation efficiency (SFE), but not with gas fraction. However, the correlation is weak (and only significant out to z = 2), which could be explained by the short duration of SFE increase during interaction. In addition, we find that isolated disk galaxies make up a significant fraction of the starburst population. The fraction of such galaxies with star-forming clumps ("clumpy disks") is significantly increased compared to the main-sequence disk population. Furthermore, this fraction directly correlates with SFE. This is direct observational evidence for a long-term increase of SFE maintained due to disk instabilities, contributing to the majority of starburst galaxies in our sample and hence to substantial mass growth in these systems. This result could also be of importance for explaining the growth of the most massive galaxies at z &amp;gt; 6.

We present constraints on the spacetime variation of the fine-structure constant &amp;alpha; at redshifts 2.5≤ z&amp;lt;9.5 using JWST emission-line galaxies. The galaxy sample consists of 621 high-quality spectra with strong and narrow [O III] &amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;4959,5007 doublet emission lines from 578 galaxies, including 232 spectra at z&amp;gt;5. The [O III] doublet lines are arguably the best emission lines to probe the variation in &amp;alpha;. We divide our sample into six subsamples based on redshift and calculate the relative variation &amp;Delta;&amp;alpha;/&amp;alpha; for the individual subsamples. The calculated &amp;Delta;&amp;alpha;/&amp;alpha; values are consistent with zero within 1&amp;sigma; at all redshifts, suggesting no time variation in &amp;alpha; above a level of (1-2) ×10^-4 (1&amp;sigma;) in the past 13.2 billion years. When the whole sample is combined, the constraint is improved to be &amp;Delta;&amp;alpha;/&amp;alpha; = (0.2±0.7) ×10^-4. We further test the spatial variation in &amp;alpha; using four subsamples of galaxies in four different directions on the sky. The measured &amp;Delta;&amp;alpha;/&amp;alpha; values are consistent with zero at a 1&amp;sigma; level of ~ 2×10^-4. While the constraints in this work are not as stringent as those from lower-redshift quasar absorption lines in previous studies, this work uses an independent tracer and provides the first constraints on &amp;Delta;&amp;alpha;/&amp;alpha; at the highest redshifts. With the growing number of emission-line galaxies from JWST, we expect to achieve stronger constraints in the future.

&lt;p&gt;
Context: While class II pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars have already accreted most of their mass, the continued inflow of fresh material via Bondi-Hoyle accretion acts as an additional mass reservoir for their circumstellar disks. This may explain the observed accretion rates of PMS stars, as well as observational inconsistencies in the mass and angular momentum balance of their disks. Aims: Using a new simulation that reproduces the stellar initial mass function (IMF), we want to quantify the role of Bondi-Hoyle accretion in the formation of class II disks, as well as address the prospect of its observational detection with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Methods: We studied the mass and angular momentum of the accreting gas using passively advected tracer particles in the simulation, and we carried out radiative transfer calculations of near-infrared scattering to generate synthetic JWST observations of Bondi-Hoyle trails of PMS stars. Results: Gas accreting on class II PMS stars approximately 1 Myr after their formation has enough mass and angular momentum to strongly affect the evolution of the preexisting disks. The accreted angular momentum is large enough to also explain the observed size of class II disks. The orientation of the angular momentum vector can differ significantly from that of the previously accreted gas, which may result in a significant disk warping or misalignment. We also predict that JWST observations of class II stars will be able to detect Bondi-Hoyle trails with a 80%-100% success rate with only a 2 min exposure time, depending on the filter, if stars with both an accretion rate M&amp;#775; &amp;gt; 5e-10 Msol/yr and a luminosity L &amp;gt; 0.5 Lsol are selected.

&lt;p&gt;
In less than two years of operation, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has already accelerated significantly our quest to identify active massive black holes (BHs) in the first billion years of the Universe's history. At the time of writing, about 50 AGN detections and candidates have been identified through spectroscopy, photometry, and/or morphology. Broad-line AGN are about a hundred times more numerous than the faint end of the UV-bright quasar population at z~5-6. In this paper, we compare the observational constraints on the abundance of these AGN at z~5 to the populations of AGN produced in large-scale cosmological simulations. Assuming a null fraction of obscured simulated AGN, we find that while some simulations produce more AGN than discovered so far, some others produce a similar abundance or even fewer AGN in the bolometric luminosity range probed by JWST. Keeping in mind the large uncertainty on the constraints, we discuss the implications for the theoretical modeling of BH formation and evolution in case similar constraints continue to accumulate. At the redshift of interest, the simulated AGN populations diverge the most at Lbol~1e44 erg/s (by more than a dex in the bolometric luminosity function). This regime is most affected by incompleteness in JWST surveys. However, it holds significant potential for constraining the physical processes determining the assembly of BHs (e.g., seeding, feedback from supernova and AGN) and the current abundance of broad-line AGN with &amp;gt;1e44.5 erg/s.

We investigate the X-ray properties of a sample of 71 broad line and narrow line AGN at 2&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;11 discovered by JWST in the GOODS fields, which have the deepest Chandra observations ever obtained. Despite the widespread presence of AGN signatures in their rest-optical and -UV spectra, the vast majority of them is X-ray undetected. The stacked X-ray data of the non-detected sources also results in a non-detection. The upper limit on the X-ray emission for many of these AGN is one or even two orders of magnitude lower than expected from a standard AGN SED. X-ray absorption by clouds with large (Compton-thick) column density and low dust content, such as the Broad Line Region (BLR) clouds, can explain the X-ray weakness. In this scenario the BLR covering factor should be much larger than in low-z AGN or luminous quasars; this is supported by the larger equivalent width of the broad component of H&amp;alpha; in JWST-selected AGN. We also find that the JWST-discovered AGN lack prominent, fast outflows, suggesting that, in JWST-selected AGN, dense gas lingers in the nuclear region, resulting in large covering factors. We also note that a large fraction of JWST-selected AGN matches the definition of NLSy1, typically accreting at high rates and characterized by a steep X-ray spectrum &amp;ndash; this can further contribute to their observed weakness at high-z. Finally, we discuss that the broad Balmer lines used to identify type 1 AGN cannot be ascribed to Very Massive Stars or Supernovae, although we show that some of the faintest broad lines could potentially be associated with superluminous SNe.

Over twenty years ago, Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) observations revealed an accelerating Universe expansion, suggesting a significant dark energy presence, often modelled as a cosmological constant,  &amp;Lambda; . Despite its pivotal role in cosmology, the standard &amp;Lambda;CDM model remains largely underexplored in the redshift range between distant SNIa and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). This study harnesses the James Webb Space Telescope's advanced capabilities to extend the Hubble flow mapping across an unprecedented redshift range, from  z ≈ 0  to  z ≈ 7.5 . Using a dataset of 231 HII galaxies and extragalactic HII regions, we employ the L-&amp;sigma; relation that correlates the luminosity of Balmer lines with their velocity dispersion, to define a competitive technique for measuring cosmic distances. This approach allows the mapping of the Universe expansion history over more than 12 billion years, covering 95&amp;percnt; of its age. Our analysis, using Bayesian inference, constrains the parameter space  &amp;lbrace;  h, &amp;Omega;_m, w_0 &amp;rbrace;  =  &amp;lbrace;  0.731±0.039, 0.302^+0.12_-0.069, -1.01^+0.52_-0.29 &amp;rbrace;  (statistical) for a flat Universe. Our results provide new insights into cosmic evolution and imply a lack of change in the photo-kinematical properties of the young massive ionizing clusters in HII galaxies across most of the history of the Universe.

Strong gravitational magnifications enable to detect faint background sources, resolve their internal structures, and even identify individual stars in distant galaxies. Highly magnified individual stars allow various applications, including studies of stellar populations in distant galaxies and constraining dark matter structures in the lensing plane. However, these applications have been hampered by the small number of individual stars observed, as typically one or a few stars are identified from each distant galaxy. Here, we report the discovery of more than 40 microlensed stars in a single galaxy behind Abell 370 at redshift of 0.725 when the Universe was half of its current age (dubbed "the Dragon arc''), using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations with the time-domain technique. These events are found near the expected lensing critical curves, suggesting that these are magnified stars that appear as transients from intracluster stellar microlenses. Through multi-wavelength photometry, we constrain stellar types and find that many of them are consistent with red giants/supergiants magnified by factors of hundreds. This finding reveals an unprecedented high occurrence of microlensing events in the Dragon arc, and proves that  JWST's time-domain observations open up the possibility of conducting statistical studies of high-redshift stars.

Superradiance provides a unique opportunity for investigating dark sectors as well as primordial black holes, which themselves are candidates for dark matter over a wide mass range. Using axion-like particles as an example, we show that line signals emerging from a superradiated axion cloud combined with black hole Hawking radiation in extragalactic and galactic halos, along with microlensing observations lead to complementary constraints on parameter space combinations including the axion-photon coupling, axion mass, black hole mass, and its dark matter fraction, f_PBH. For the asteroid mass range ~10^16-10^22~g, where primordial black holes can provide the totality of dark matter, we demonstrate that ongoing and upcoming observations such as SXI, JWST, and AMEGO-X will be sensitive to possible line and continuum signals, respectively, providing probes of previously inaccessible regions of f_PBH parameter space. Further complementarity from a stochastic gravitational-wave background emerging from the black hole formation mechanism is also considered.

&lt;p&gt;
We present JWST NIRCam imaging of B14-65666 ("Big Three Dragons"), a bright Lyman-break galaxy system (M_UV=-22.5 mag) at z=7.15. The high angular resolution of NIRCam reveals the complex morphology of two galaxy components: galaxy E has a compact core (E-core), surrounded by diffuse, extended, rest-frame optical emission, which is likely to be tidal tails; and galaxy W has a clumpy and elongated morphology with a blue UV slope (&amp;beta;_UV=-2.2±0.1). The flux excess, F356W-F444W, peaks at the E-core (1.05^+0.08_-0.09 mag), tracing the presence of strong [OIII] 4960,5008 &amp;#8491; emission. ALMA archival data show that the bluer galaxy W is brighter in dust continua than the redder galaxy E, while the tails are bright in [OIII] 88 &amp;mu; m. The UV/optical and sub-mm SED fitting confirms that B14-65666 is a major merger in a starburst phase as derived from the stellar mass ratio (3:1 to 2:1) and the star-formation rate, ≃1 dex higher than the star-formation main sequence at the same redshift. The galaxy E is a dusty (A_V=1.2±0.1 mag) starburst with a possible high dust temperature (≥63-68 K). The galaxy W would have a low dust temperature (≤27-33 K) or patchy stellar-and-dust geometry, as suggested from the infrared excess (IRX) and &amp;beta;_UV diagram. The high optical-to-FIR [OIII] line ratio of the E-core shows its lower gas-phase metallicity (≃0.2-0.4 Z&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) than the galaxy W. These results agree with a scenario where major mergers disturb morphology and induce nuclear dusty starbursts triggered by less-enriched inflows. B14-65666 shows a picture of complex stellar buildup processes during major mergers in the epoch of reionization.

We study the reionization of the Universe due to haloes that host galaxies undergoing bursts of star formation. By comparing the recent results from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation EAGLE at z≥ 6, we find that bursty galaxies have specific star formation rate, sSFR &amp;gt;10^-2 Myr^-1, and magnitude, M_UV≤ -17. Most of them reside in haloes of mass ~ 10^9 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; and some in more massive haloes. We then construct the models of escape fraction and find that a skewed Gaussian function with a flat tail towards the high mass end best describes the mean dependence of escape fraction on halo mass, considering the haloes hosting bursty galaxies as the primary drivers of reionization. We implement the models of escape fraction in the code 21cmFAST to study the progress of reionization and derive the evolution of the mean ionized fraction that agrees well with observations. We also calculate the brightness temperature, spin temperature, and kinetic temperature and further study the spatial fluctuations in these quantities to gain insights into the progress of reionization. We compute the 21 cm power spectrum and predict a peak in power at 180 MHz corresponding to redshift, z≈ 6.8, that is testable by the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Our findings suggest that the Universe was reionized by the haloes of ≳ 10^9 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;
The search for dual supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is of immense interest in modern astrophysics. Galaxy mergers may fuel and produce SMBH pairs. Actively accreting SMBH pairs are observed as a dual quasar, which are vital probes of SMBH growth. Dual quasars at cosmic noon are not well characterized. Gaia observations have enabled a novel technique to identify dual quasars at kpc scales, based on the small jitters of the light centroid as the two quasars vary stochastically. We present the first detailed study of a z=2.17, 0.46'', 3.8 kpc separation dual quasar, J0749+2255, using JWST/NIRSpec integral field unit spectroscopy. Identified by Gaia, J0749+2255 is one of the most distant, small separation dual quasars known. We detect the faint ionized gas of the host galaxy, traced by the narrow Ha emission. Line ratios indicate ionization from the two quasars and from intense star formation. Spectral analysis of the two quasars suggests that they have similar black hole properties, hinting at the possible synchronized accretion activity or lensed quasar images. Surprisingly, the ionized gas kinematics suggest a rotating disk rather than a disturbed system expected in a major gas-rich galaxy merger. Numerical simulations show that this is a plausible outcome of a major gas-rich galaxy merger several tens of Myr before coalescence. Whether J0749+2255 reflects an interesting phase of dual quasar evolution or is a lensed quasar remains unclear. Thus, this study underscores the challenges in definitively distinguishing between a dual and lensed quasars, with observations supporting either scenario.

&lt;p&gt;
The exceptional spectra of the most luminous z&amp;gt;10 sources observed so far have challenged our understanding of early galaxy evolution, requiring a new observational benchmark for meaningful interpretation. As such, we construct spectroscopic templates representative of high-redshift, star-forming populations, using 482 confirmed sources at z=5.0-12.9 with JWST/NIRSpec prism observations, and report on their average properties. We find z=5-11 galaxies are dominated by blue UV continuum slopes (&amp;beta;=-2.3 to -2.7) and reduced Balmer indices, characteristic of dust-poor and young systems, with a shift towards bluer slopes and younger ages with redshift. The evolution is mirrored by ubiquitous CIII] detections across all redshifts (rest-frame equivalent widths of =5-14 &amp;#8491;), which increase in strength towards early times. Rest-frame optical lines reveal elevated ratios (O32=7-31, R23=5-8, and Ne3O2=1-2) and subsolar metallicities (log O/H=7.3-7.9), typical of ionization conditions and metallicities rarely observed in z~0 populations. Within our sample, we identify 57 Ly&amp;alpha; emitters, which we stack and compare to a matched sample of nonemitters. The former are characterized by more extreme ionizing conditions with enhanced CIII], CIV, and HeII+[OIII] line emission, younger stellar populations from Balmer jumps, and a more pristine interstellar medium seen through bluer UV slopes and elevated rest-frame optical line ratios. The novel comparison illustrates important intrinsic differences between the two populations, with implications for Ly&amp;alpha; visibility. The spectral templates derived here represent a new observational benchmark with which to interpret high-redshift sources, lifting our constraints on their global properties to unprecedented heights and extending out to the earliest of cosmic times.

We utilize deep JWST NIRCam observations for the first direct constraints on the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function (GSMF) at z&amp;gt;10. Our EPOCHS v1 sample includes 1120 galaxy candidates at 6.5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;13.5 taken from a consistent reduction and analysis of publicly available deep JWST NIRCam data covering the PEARLS, CEERS, GLASS, JADES GOOD-S, NGDEEP, and SMACS0723 surveys, totalling 187 arcmin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. We investigate the impact of SED fitting methods, assumed star formation histories (SFH), dust laws, and priors on galaxy masses and the resultant GSMF. Whilst our fiducial GSMF agrees with the literature at z&amp;lt;13.5, we find that the assumed SFH model has a large impact on the GSMF and stellar mass density (SMD), finding a 0.75~dex increase in the SMD at z=10.5 between a flexible non-parametric and standard parametric SFH. Overall, we find a flatter SMD evolution at z ≥ 9 than some studies predict, suggesting a rapid buildup of stellar mass in the early Universe. We find no incompatibility between our results and those of standard cosmological models, as suggested previously, although the most massive galaxies may require a high star formation efficiency. We find that the "Little Red Dot" galaxies dominate the z=7 GSMF at high-masses, necessitating a better understanding of the relative contributions of AGN and stellar emission. We show that assuming a theoretically motivated top-heavy IMF reduces stellar mass by 0.5~dex without affecting fit quality, but our results remain consistent with existing cosmological models with a standard IMF.

&lt;p&gt;
Recent studies based on JWST data reveals that the observed number density of massive galaxies in the early Universe appears to be higher than model predictions, which may pose a serious problem to the \lcdm ~cosmology. A major limitation in many previous studies is the large uncertainty in estimating \mstar due to the lack of constraints in the rest-frame near-infrared part of the spectral energy distribution, which is critical to determining \mstar accurately. Here we use multiwavelength data from a large  JWST/MIRI survey in the PRIMER program to perform a systematic analysis of massive galaxies at z ~ 3-8, leveraging photometric constraints at rest-frame ≳ 1 &amp;mu;m. We find a significant reduction in the number and mass densities of massive galaxies at z &amp;gt; 5 compared to earlier results that did not use the MIRI photometry. Within the standard &amp;Lambda;CDM cosmology, our results require a moderate increase in the baryon-to-star conversion efficiency (&amp;epsilon;) towards higher redshifts and higher \mstar. For the most massive galaxies at z~ 8, the required &amp;epsilon; is ~ 0.3, in comparison to &amp;epsilon; ~ 0.14 for typical low-redshift galaxies. Our findings are consistent with models assuming suppressed stellar feedback due to the high gas density and the associated short free-fall time expected for massive halos at high redshifts.

The JWST discovery of "little red dots'' (LRDs) is reshaping our picture of the early Universe, yet the physical mechanisms driving their compact size and UV-optical colors remain elusive. Here we report an unusually bright LRD (z=3.1) observed as part of the RUBIES program. This LRD exhibits broad emission lines (FWHM ~4000km/s), a blue UV continuum, a clear Balmer break and a red continuum sampled out to rest 4 &amp;mu;m with MIRI. We develop a new joint galaxy and AGN model within the Prospector Bayesian inference framework and perform spectrophotometric modeling using NIRCam, MIRI, and NIRSpec/Prism observations. Our fiducial model reveals a M_*~ 10^9M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; galaxy alongside a dust-reddened AGN driving the optical emission. Explaining the rest-frame optical color as a reddened AGN requires A_v≳3, suggesting that a great majority of the accretion disk energy is re-radiated as dust emission. Yet despite clear AGN signatures, we find a surprising lack of hot torus emission, which implies that either the dust emission in this object must be cold, or the red continuum must instead be driven by a massive, evolved stellar population of the host galaxy &amp;ndash; seemingly inconsistent with the high EW broad lines (H&amp;alpha; EW ~800&amp;#8491;). The widths and luminosities of Pa&amp;beta;, Pa&amp;delta;, Pa&amp;gamma;, and H&amp;alpha; imply a modest black hole mass of M_BH~10^8M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. Additionally, we identify a narrow blue-shifted HeI absorption in G395M spectra, signaling an ionized outflow with kinetic energy up to ~1&amp;percnt; the luminosity of the AGN. The low redshift of RUBIES-BLAGN-1 combined with the depth and richness of the JWST imaging and spectroscopic observations provide a unique opportunity to build a physical model for these so-far mysterious LRDs, which may prove to be a crucial phase in the early formation of massive galaxies and their supermassive black holes.

Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed active galactic nuclei (AGN) powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with estimated masses of 10^7-10^8 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt; at redshifts z~7-9. Some reside in overmassive systems with higher AGN to stellar mass ratios than locally. Understanding how massive black holes could form so early in cosmic history and affect their environment to establish the observed relations today are some of the major open questions in astrophysics and cosmology. One model to create these massive objects is through direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) that provide massive seeds (~10^5-10^6 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;), able to reach high masses in the limited time available. We use the cosmological simulation code GIZMO to study the formation and growth of DCBH seeds in the early Universe. To grow the DCBHs, we implement a gas swallowing model set to match the Eddington accretion rate as long as the nearby gaseous environment, affected by stellar and accretion disk feedback, provides sufficient fuel. We find that to create massive AGN in overmassive systems at high redshifts, massive seeds accreting more efficiently than the fiducial Bondi-Hoyle model are needed. We assess whether the conditions for such enhanced accretion rates are realistic by considering limits on plausible transport mechanisms. We also examine various DCBH growth histories and find that mass growth is more sustained in overdense cosmological environments, where high gas densities are achieved locally. We discuss the exciting prospect to directly probe the assembly history of the first SMBHs with upcoming, ultra-deep JWST surveys.

We present the first Chandra X-ray observations of H72.97-69.39, a highly-embedded, potential super-star cluster (SSC) in its infancy located in the star-forming complex N79 of the Large Magellanic Cloud. We detect particularly hard, diffuse X-ray emission that is coincident with the young stellar objects (YSOs) identified with JWST, and the hot gas fills cavities in the dense gas mapped by ALMA. The X-ray spectra are best fit with either a thermal plasma or power-law model, and assuming the former, we show that the X-ray luminosity of L_X = (1.0 +- 0.3)e34 erg/s is a factor of ~20 below the expectation for a fully-confined wind bubble. Our results suggest that stellar wind feedback produces diffuse hot gas in the earliest stages of massive star cluster formation and that wind energy can be lost quickly via either turbulent mixing followed by radiative cooling or by physical leakage.

The identity of dark matter has been a mystery in astronomy, cosmology, and particle theory for about a century. Bessho, Ikeda, and Yin (2022), three of the current authors, proposed using the state-of-the-art infrared spectrographs, including WINERED at 6.5m Magellan Clay telescope and NIRSpec at James Webb Space Telescope, as efficient detectors for the indirect detection of dark matter with the mass around eV by measuring the line photons from the dark matter two body decays. Applying this concept, we have performed spectrographic observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) Leo V and Tucana II using WINERED by utilizing an object-sky-object nodding observation technique for background subtraction. We present the first result from this dark matter search. Employing zero consistent flux data after the sky subtraction, we have established one of the most stringent limits to date on dark matter decaying into line photons in the mass range of 1.8-2.7 eV. Our data can also be applied to constrain other spectra of photons from the dSphs.

Resolved stellar morphology of z&amp;gt;1 galaxies was inaccessible before JWST. This limitation, due to the impact of dust on rest-frame UV light, had withheld major observational conclusions required to understand the importance of clumps in galaxy evolution. Essentially independent of this issue, we use the rest-frame near-IR for a stellar-mass dependent clump detection method and determine reliable estimations of selection effects. We exploit publicly available JWST/NIRCam and HST/ACS imaging data from CEERS, to create a stellar-mass based picture of clumps in a mass-complete sample of 418 galaxies within a wide wavelength coverage of 0.5-4.6 &amp;mu;m and a redshift window of 1 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 2. We find that a near-IR detection gives access to a larger, and possibly different, set of clumps within galaxies, with those also detected in UV making up only 28&amp;percnt;. Whereas, 85&amp;percnt; of the UV clumps are found to have a near-IR counterpart. These near-IR clumps closely follow the UVJ classification of their respective host galaxies, with these hosts mainly populating the star-forming regime besides a fraction of them (16&amp;percnt;) that can be considered quiescent. The mass of the detected clumps are found to be within the range of 10^7.5-9.5 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;, therefore expected to drive gas into galaxy cores through tidal torques. The clump stellar mass function is found to have a slope of -1.50 ± 0.14, indicating a hierarchical nature similar to that of star-forming regions in the local Universe. Finally, we observe a radial gradient of increasing clump mass towards the centre of galaxies.

We present mock JWST observations for more than 250,000 different galaxies from the Astrid simulation with 3 ≤ z ≤ 6. The mock observations are made using the BPASS stellar SED model, and a simple dust model. They are then viewed through NIRCam filters, convolved with a PSF, have noise added, and are drizzled together to emulate the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey. We analyse this dataset by computing a number of morphological measures and find our catalog to have comparable statistics to similar mock catalogs, and the first release of CEERS data. We find that most of the Sersic indices of galaxies in our redshift range are lower than observed, with most having n less than one. Additionally, we observe the sizes of galaxies of all masses to increase from redshift z=6 to redshift z=3 consistent with other results. The number of galaxies in our catalog allows us to examine how relationships like the mass-size relation evolve with redshift, and compare the accuracy of a variety of traditional galaxy classification techniques (Sersic fit, Asymmetry-Concentration, and Gini-M_20) within our redshift range. We find the mass-size relation to be nearly flat at redshift z=6, and consistently increases as redshift decreases, and find the galaxy classification methods have minimal correlation with each other in our redshift range. We also investigate the impact that different stages of our imaging pipeline have on these morphological measures to determine how robust mock catalogs are to different choices at each step. Finally, we test the addition of incorporating light from AGNs into our pipeline and find that while the population of galaxies that have significant AGN luminosity is low, those galaxies do tend to have higher Sersic indices once the AGN luminosity is added, rectifying some of the systematic bias towards lower Sersic indices present in our dataset.

&lt;p&gt;
With its sensitivity in the rest-frame optical, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered active galactic nuclei (AGN), comprising both intrinsically faint and heavily reddened sources, well into the first billion years of the Universe, at z ~ 4-11. In this work, we revisit the AGN contribution to reionization given the high number densities associated with these objects. We use the DELPHI semi-analytic model, base-lined against the latest high-redshift datasets from the JWST and the Atacama Large millimetre Array (ALMA) to model early star forming galaxies and AGN. We calculate the escape fractions of ionizing radiation from both star formation and AGN and include the impact of reionization feeback in suppressing the baryonic content of low-mass galaxies in ionized regions. This model is validated against the key observables for star forming galaxy, AGN and reionization. In our  fiducial model, reionization reaches its mid-point at z ~ 6.9 and ends by z ~ 5.9. Low stellar mass (M_*≤ 10^9M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;) star forming galaxies are found to be the key drivers of the reionization process, providing about 77&amp;percnt; of the total photon budget. Despite their high numbers, high accretion rates and higher escape fractions compared to star forming galaxies at z ~ 5, AGN only provide about 23&amp;percnt; of the total reionization budget which is dominated by black holes in high stellar mass systems (with M_* ≥ 10^9M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;). This is because AGN number densities become relevant only at z ≤ 7 - as a result, AGN contribute as much as galaxies as late as z ~ 6.2, when reionization is already in its end stages. Finally, we find that even contrasting models of the AGN ionizing photon escape fraction (increasing or decreasing with stellar mass) do not qualitatively change our results.

We present the identification of 42 narrow-line active galactic nuclei (type-2 AGN) candidates in the two deepest observations of the JADES spectroscopic survey with JWST/NIRSpec. The spectral coverage and the depth of our observations allow us to select narrow-line AGNs based on both rest-frame optical and UV emission lines up to z=10. Due to the metallicity decrease of galaxies, at z&amp;gt;3 the standard optical diagnostic diagrams (N2-BPT or S2-VO87) become unable to distinguish many AGN from other sources of photoionisation. Therefore, we also use high ionisation lines, such as HeII&amp;lambda;4686, HeII&amp;lambda;1640, NeIV&amp;lambda;2422, NeV&amp;lambda;3420, and NV&amp;lambda;1240, also in combination with other UV transitions, to trace the presence of AGN. Out of a parent sample of 209 galaxies, we identify 42 type-2 AGN (although 10 of them are tentative), giving a fraction of galaxies in JADES hosting type-2 AGN of about 20±3&amp;percnt;, which does not evolve significantly in the redshift range between 2 and 10. The selected type-2 AGN have estimated bolometric luminosities of 10^41.3-44.9 erg s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and host-galaxy stellar masses of 10^7.2-9.3 M&lt;sub&gt;&amp;odot;&lt;/sub&gt;. The star formation rates of the selected AGN host galaxies are consistent with those of the star-forming main sequence. The AGN host galaxies at z=4-6 contribute ~8-30 &amp;percnt; to the UV luminosity function, slightly increasing with UV luminosity.

We study outflows in 130 galaxies with -22&amp;lt;MUV&amp;lt;-16 at z=3-9 identified in JWST NIRSpec and NIRCam WFSS data taken by the ERO, CEERS, FRESCO, GLASS, and JADES programs. We identify 30 out of the 130 galaxies with broad components of FWHM~200-700 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the emission lines of H&amp;alpha; and [OIII] that trace ionized outflows, and find no excesses from the star-formation main sequence. Four out of the 30 outflowing galaxies are Type-1 AGN whose H&amp;alpha; emission lines include line profile components as broad as FWHM&amp;gt;1000 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; while one galaxy is identified as a Type-2 AGN by high ionization emission lines. With the velocity shift and line widths of the outflow broad lines, we obtain ~80-500 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for the outflow velocities. We find that the outflow velocities are slower than low-z galaxies with similar SFRs, which may be explained by the low stellar masses of high-z galaxies. The outflow velocities of AGNs are large but not significantly different from the others. Interestingly, these outflow velocities are typically not high enough to escape from the galactic potentials, suggestive of fountain-type outflows. We estimate mass loading factors &amp;eta; to be 0.1-1 that are not particularly large, but comparable with those of z~1 outflows. The large fraction of galaxies with outflows (30% with high resolution data) provides constraints on outflow parameters, suggesting a wide opening angle of &amp;gt;45 deg and a large duty-cycle of &amp;gt;30%, which gives a picture of more frequent and spherical outflows in high-z galaxies.

Merger events can trigger gas accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) located at the centre of galaxies, and form close pairs of AGN. The fraction of AGN in pairs offers critical insights into the dynamics of galaxy interactions, SMBH growth, and their co-evolution with host galaxies. However, the identification of dual AGN is difficult, as it requires high-quality spatial and spectral data; hence, only very few pairs have been found in the distant Universe so far. This study aims to provide a first observational estimate of the fraction of dual AGN at 2&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6 by analysing a sample of 16 AGN observed with JWST/NIRSpec IFS, as part of the GA-NIFS survey. For two AGN in our sample, we also incorporate archival VLT/MUSE data to expand the search area. We searched for nearby companion galaxies and emission-line sources within the ~20x20 kpc field of view of the NIRSpec data cubes, extending up to ~50 kpc using the MUSE data cubes. We analysed the spectra of such emitters to determine their physical and kinematic properties. We report the serendipitous discovery of a triple AGN and four dual AGN (two of which considered as candidates), with projected separations in the range 3-28 kpc. Their AGN classification is mainly based on standard optical emission line flux ratios, as observed with JWST/NIRSpec, and is complemented with additional multi-wavelength diagnostics. The identification of these 3-5 multiple AGN out of the 16 AGN systems in GA-NIFS (i.e. ~20-30%) suggests they might be more common than previously thought based on other observational campaigns. Moreover, our inferred fraction of dual AGN moderately exceeds predictions from cosmological simulations that mimic our observational criteria (~10%). This work highlights the exceptional capabilities of NIRSpec for detecting distant dual AGN, and prompts new investigations to constrain their fraction across cosmic time.

&lt;p&gt;
With the wavelength coverage, sensitivity, and high spatial resolution of JWST, it is now possible to peer through the dust attenuation to probe the rest-frame near infrared (NIR) and stellar structures of extremely dusty galaxies at cosmic noon (z~1-3). In this paper we leverage the combined ALMA and JWST/HST coverage in Abell 2744 to study the multiwavelength (0.5-4.4&amp;mu;m) structures of 11 sub-millimeter (sub-mm) detected galaxies at z~0.9-3.5 that are fainter than bright "classical" sub-mm galaxies (SMGs); 7 of which are detected in deep X-ray data. While these objects reveal a diversity of structures and sizes, all are smaller and more concentrated towards longer wavelengths. Of the X-ray-detected objects, only two show evidence for appreciable AGN flux contributions (at ≳2&amp;mu;m). Excluding the two AGN-dominated objects, the smaller long wavelength sizes indicate that their rest-frame NIR light profiles, inferred to trace their stellar mass profiles, are more compact than their optical profiles. The sub-mm detections and visible dust lanes suggest centrally-concentrated dust is a key driver of the observed color gradients. Further, we find that more concentrated galaxies tend to have lower size ratios (rest-frame NIR to optical); this suggests that the galaxies with the most compact light distributions also have the most concentrated dust. The 1.2mm flux densities and size ratios of these 9 objects suggest that both total dust quantity and geometry impact these galaxies' multiwavelength structures. Upcoming higher resolution 1.2mm ALMA imaging will facilitate joint spatially-resolved analysis and will directly test the dust distributions within this representative sub-mm population.

We study the co-evolution of dark matter halos, galaxies and supermassive black holes using an empirical galaxy evolution model from z=0 &amp;ndash; 10. We demonstrate that by connecting dark matter structure evolution with simple empirical prescriptions for baryonic processes, we are able to faithfully reproduce key observations in the relation between galaxies and their supermassive black holes. By assuming a physically-motivated, direct relationship between the galaxy and supermassive black hole properties to the mass of their host halo, we construct expressions for the galaxy stellar mass function, galaxy UV luminosity function, active black hole mass function and quasar bolometric luminosity function. We calibrate the baryonic prescriptions using a fully Bayesian approach in order to reproduce observed population statistics. The obtained parametrizations are then used to study the relation between galaxy and black hole properties, as well as their evolution with redshift. The galaxy stellar mass &amp;ndash; UV luminosity relation, black hole mass &amp;ndash; stellar mass relation, black hole mass &amp;ndash; AGN luminosity relation, and redshift evolution of these quantities obtained from the model are qualitatively consistent with observations. Based on these results, we present upper limits on the expected number of sources for z=5 up to z=15 for scheduled JWST and itEuclid surveys, thus showcasing that empirical models can offer qualitative as well as quantitative prediction in a fast, easy and flexible manner that complements more computationally expensive approaches.

Dual-phase xenon time projection chamber (TPC) detectors offer heightened sensitivities for dark matter detection across a spectrum of particle masses. To broaden their capability to low-mass dark matter interactions, we investigated the light and charge responses of liquid xenon (LXe) to sub-keV nuclear recoils. Using neutron events from a pulsed Adelphi Deuterium-Deuterium neutron generator, an in situ calibration was conducted on the LUX detector. We demonstrate direct measurements of light and charge yields down to 0.45 keV and 0.27 keV, respectively, both approaching single quanta production, the physical limit of LXe detectors. These results hold significant implications for the future of dual-phase xenon TPCs in detecting low-mass dark matter via nuclear recoils.

Aims. We analyze whether the effects of secular perturbations, originating from a substellar companion, on the dust dynamics in a debris disk can be investigated with spatially resolved observations. Methods. We numerically simulated the collisional evolution of narrow and eccentric cold planetesimal belts around a star of spectral type A3V that are secularly perturbed by a companion that orbits either closer to or farther from the star than the belt. Based on the resulting spatial dust distributions, we simulated spatially resolved maps of their surface brightness in the K, N, and Q bands and at wavelengths of 70&amp;mu;m and 1300&amp;mu;m. Results. Assuming a nearby debris disk seen face-on, we find that the brightness distribution varies significantly with observing wavelength, for example between the N and Q band. This can be explained by the varying relative contribution of the emission of the smallest grains near the blowout limit. The orbits of both the small grains that form the halo and the large grains close to the parent belt precess due to the secular perturbations induced by a companion orbiting inward of the belt. The halo, being composed of older grains, trails the belt. The magnitude of the trailing decreases with increasing perturber mass and hence with increasing strength of the perturbation, a trend we recovered in synthetic maps of surface brightness by fitting ellipses to lines of constant brightness. Systems with an outer perturber do not show a uniform halo precession since the orbits of small grains are strongly altered. We identified features of the brightness distributions suitable for distinguishing between systems with a potentially detectable inner or outer perturber, especially with a combined observation with JWST/MIRI in the Q band tracing small grain emission and with ALMA at mm wavelengths tracing the position of the parent planetesimal belt.

Reason for   corrigendum: The original article has a typo in the sensitivity of JWST/MIRI   at 10$\mu$m and an error in the calculation of its sensitivity at 21$\mu$m.   The required exposure times at 21$\mu$m are shorter than stated. The main   conclusions are not affected &lt;/p&gt;

Infrared spectroscopy has been developed significantly. In particular, infrared photons can be measured with high spectral and angular resolution in state-of-art spectrographs. They are sensitive to monochromatic photons due to the decay and annihilation of particles beyond the Standard Model, such as dark matter (DM), while insensitive to background photons that form a continuous spectrum. In this paper, we study the indirect detection of the DM decaying into infrared light using infrared spectrographs. In particular, we show that serious thermal and astrophysical noises can be overcome. As concrete examples, the Warm INfrared Echelle spectrograph to Realize Extreme Dispersion and sensitivity (WINERED) installed at the Magellan Clay 6.5m telescope and Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) at the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are discussed. We show that a few hours of measurements of a faint dwarf spheroidal galaxy with WINERED (NIRSpec-like spectrograph) in the Magellan telescope (JWST) can probe an axion-like particle DM in the mass range m_&amp;phi;=1.8 - 2.7 eV (0.5-4 eV) with a photon coupling g_&amp;phi;&amp;gamma;&amp;gamma;≳ 10^-11 GeV^-1. Complemental approaches, taking advantage of the high resolutions, such as the measurement of the Doppler shift of the signal photon lines and the possible search of the DM decay around the Milky Way galaxy center with Infrared Camera and Spectrograph (IRCS) at 8.2m Subaru telescope, are also presented.
