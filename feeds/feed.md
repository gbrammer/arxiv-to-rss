### 1) [2506.21442](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21442v1): Low-metallicity massive single stars with rotation. III. Source of ionization and C-IV emission in I Zw 18

<p>
Chemically-homogeneously evolving stars have been proposed to account for several exotic phenomena, including gravitational-wave emissions and gamma-ray bursts. Here we study whether these stars can explain the metal-poor dwarf galaxy, I Zwicky 18. We apply our synthetic spectral models from Paper II to (i) establish a classification sequence for these hot stars, (ii) predict the photonionizing flux and the strength of emission lines from a IZw18-like stellar population, and (iii) compare our predictions to available observations of this galaxy. Adding two new models computed with PoWR, we report (i) these stars to follow a unique sequence of classes: O-&gt;WN-&gt;WO (i.e. without ever being WC). From our population synthesis with standard assumptions, we predict that (ii) the source of the UV C-IV and other emission bumps is a couple dozen WO-type Wolf-Rayet stars (not WC as previously assumed) which are the result of chem.-hom. evolution, while these, combined with the rest of the O-star population, account for the He-II ionizing flux and spectral hardness. Contrasting our results against published optical and UV data and accounting for different aperture sizes and spatial regions probed by the observations, we find that (iii) our models are highly consistent with them. Since our "massive Pop II stars" might just as well exist in early star-forming regions, our findings have implications for upcoming JWST surveys; and given that our results apply for binary populations too as long as the same fraction (10%) of the systems evolves chem. homogeneously, we conclude that the stellar progenitors of gravitational waves may very well exist today in IZw18.

### 2) [2506.21320](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21320v1): Probing Obscured Star Formation in Galaxy Clusters Using JWST Medium Band Images: 3.3μm PAH Emitter Sample in Abell 2744

<p> Cheng Cheng, Xin Wang, Piaoran Liang, Fengwu Sun, Edo Ibar, Malte Brinch, Haojing Yan, Jia-Sheng Huang, Jun Li, Juan Molina </p>
<p>
Star-forming galaxies in galaxy clusters play a crucial role in understanding the advanced stages of galaxy evolution within dense environments. We present a sample of 3.3&mu;m PAH-bright galaxies in the Abell 2744 (A2744) galaxy cluster. Using F430M medium band images, we select PAH emitters in the galaxy cluster, which capture the 3.3&mu;m PAH emission at the redshift of A2744. Our multi-wavelength study demonstrates consistent star formation rates (SFRs) derived from PAH emission and SED fitting, indicating the 3.3 &mu;m PAH flux estimated from medium band image alone can reveal the entirety of star formation, immune to dust obscuration. We find that the PAH emitters are located in relatively low mass surface density regions of A2744, with SFRs aligning with the field star-forming main sequence at z=0.3. The PAH emission morphologies show more asymmetry than that of the F444W image when asymmetry index &gt; 0.4. With these results, we suggest that these star-forming galaxies in A2744 are in the stage of falling into the cluster from the field, and have not been quenched yet. We further explore a potential link between these galaxies and cosmic filaments being accreted onto the cluster, which may channel gas inflows to fuel star formation. JWST medium-band imaging provides a powerful new tool for identifying heavily dust-obscured star-forming populations. Future HI and low-J CO observations should be prioritized to resolve the cold gas kinematics and star formation processes in these systems, which would directly test the role of environmental stripping versus filamentary gas supply.

### 3) [2506.21187](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21187v1): A Joint JWST and HST View of Omega Centauri: Multiple Stellar Populations and Their Kinematics

<p> T. Ziliotto, A. P. Milone, G. Cordoni, A. F. Marino, M. V. Legnardi, E. Dondoglio, E. Bortolan, F. Muratore </p>
<p>
We combine F115W and F277W images collected with the Near Infrared Camera of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with multi-band, multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of Omega Centauri to investigate its multiple stellar populations and internal kinematics. Our study focuses on a region spanning ~0.9 to ~2.3 half-light radii from the cluster center, largely unexplored by HST and JWST. Using chromosome maps, we identify the principal populations along the upper main sequence and among M-dwarfs, distinguishing lower-stream (LS) stars, chemically akin to first-generation globular cluster stars with similar metallicities, and upper-stream (US) stars, enriched in helium and nitrogen but oxygen-poor. Both streams also host subpopulations with varying metallicities. We find radially anisotropic motions, with US stars exhibiting significantly stronger anisotropy than LS stars. Subdividing the US into extreme and intermediate light-element populations reveals a gradient in anisotropy, with intermediate stars lying between the LS and extreme US populations. However, metal-rich and metal-poor stars within each stream show moderate kinematic differences. The LS stars show higher angular momentum and dispersion compared to US stars, and also exhibit stronger systemic rotation and tangential proper-motion skewness, further highlighting their kinematic divergence. Finally, leveraging a mass range of ~0.15 - 0.7 solar masses, we detect a low degree of energy equipartition for all cluster stars, which decreases with radial distance from the cluster center.

### 4) [2506.21026](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21026v1): Balmer Decrement and IRX Break in Tracing Dust Attenuation at Scales of Individual Star-forming Regions in NGC 628

<p> Man Qiao, Mingfeng Liu, Zongfei Lyu, Shuang Liu, Chao Yang, Dong Dong Shi, Fangxia An, Zhizheng Pan, Wenhao Liu, Binyang Liu, Run Wen, Yu Heng Zhang, Xian Zhong Zheng </p>
<p>
We investigate the relationships between infrared excess (IRX=L_IR/L_UV) and Balmer decrement (H&alpha;/H&beta;) as indicators of dust attenuation for 609 H \small II regions at scales of ~ 50-200 pc in NGC 628, utilizing data from AstroSat, James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). Our findings indicate that about three fifths of the sample H \small II regions reside within the regime occupied by local star-forming galaxies (SFGs) along the dust attenuation correlation described by their corresponding color excess parameters E(B-V)_IRX = 0.51 E(B-V)_H&alpha;/H&beta;. Nearly 27&percnt; of the sample exhibits E(B-V)_IRX&gt; E(B-V)_H&alpha;/H&beta;, while a small fraction (~ 13&percnt;) displays significantly lower E(B-V)_IRX compared to E(B-V)_H&alpha;/H&beta;. These results suggest that the correlation between the two dust attenuation indicators no longer holds for spatially resolved H \small II regions. Furthermore, the ratio of E(B-V)_IRX to E(B-V)_H&alpha;/H&beta; remains unaffected by various physical parameters of the H \small II regions, including star formation rate (SFR), SFR surface density, infrared luminosity (L_IR), L_IR surface density, stellar mass, gas-phase metallicity, circularized radius, and the distance to galactic center. We argue that the ratio is primarily influenced by the evolution of surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) of the star-forming regions, transitioning from an early dense and thick phase to the late blown-away stage.

### 5) [2506.20896](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20896v1): Blowing star formation away in AGN Hosts (BAH) &ndash; III: Feeding and feedback in 3C\:293 observed with JWST NIRSpec

<p>
We use JWST/NIRSpec observations of the radio galaxy 3C 293 to map the emission, extinction, and kinematics of hot molecular and ionized gas, as well as stellar kinematics, within the inner ~ 2 kpc. The stellar velocity field is well described by a rotating disk model, with its kinematical center offset by ~ 0.5 arcsec from the continuum peak. The hot molecular gas is traced by the H<sub>2</sub>2.12&mu;m emission line, and the ionized gas by [Fe II]1.64&mu;m and Pa&alpha;. The gas presents three main kinematic components: a rotating disk seen as a narrow component (&sigma; ~ 100 kms<sup>-1</sup>); a blueshifted broad outflow (&sigma; ~ 250 kms<sup>-1</sup>); and a fast ionized outflow as a very broad component (&sigma; ~ 640 kms<sup>-1</sup>). Extinction maps reveal high A_V values, up to ~ 35, spatially coincident with dust lanes seen in optical images. In addition to the disk and outflows components, inflows along the dust lanes are detected in H<sub>2</sub> gas, with a mass inflow rate of M&#775;_in ~ 8 x 10^-3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1, comparable to the AGN accretion rate. For the outflows, we derive peak mass-outflow rates of 0.14 ± 0.04 M<sub>&odot;</sub>yr^-1 (molecular) and 5.5 ± 1.44 M<sub>&odot;</sub>yr^-1 (ionized). The outflow, driven by the radio jet, has a kinetic power of 4.5% of the jet power - enough to suppress star formation. Our results highlight 3C 293's turbulent post-merger history and JWST's unique capability to probe dust-obscured AGN.

### 6) [2506.20767](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20767v1): The Importance of the Population III Initial Mass Function in Determining the Characteristics of the Earliest Galaxies

<p> Richard Sarmento, Evan Scannapieco </p>
<p>
We use large-scale cosmological simulations to study the prospect of observing Population III (Pop III) bright galaxies with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). To quantify the impact of radiative transfer (RT), we compare a simulation that includes moment-based RT with one in which RT is handled approximately. Both simulations include a subgrid model of turbulent mixing, which is essential in tracking the formation of Pop III stars. We find that RT has a minor impact on our results and that the overall star formation rate densities for both simulations are in fair agreement with observations and other simulations. While our overall galaxy luminosity functions are consistent with current high-redshift observations, we predict a drop of a factor of at least 6 in detectable galaxy counts at z = 14 as compared to z = 12 at M_ab ≤ -16. Modeling Pop III stars according to a lognormal, top-heavy initial mass function (IMF), we find that these stars contribute no more than about 1 percent of the flux of potentially detectable lensed galaxies at z = 12-14 with M_ab ≤ -15. This is because a top-heavy Pop III IMF results in 99 percent of Pop III stellar mass being recycled within 10 Myr, well before the approx. 30 Myr timescale on which galaxies recover from supernova feedback and heating. These effects conspire to quickly extinguish Pop III star formation, making their detection difficult even for JWST.

### 7) [2506.20732](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20732v1): James Webb Space Telescope observations of the white dwarf cooling sequence of 47 Tucanae

<p> M. Salaris, M. Scalco, L. R. Bedin, S. Cassisi </p>
<p>
We present a study of the white dwarf (WD) cooling sequence of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae (47 Tuc or NGC 104) using deep infrared observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). By combining these data with ultra-deep optical imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) taken ~12 years earlier, we derived precise proper motions (PMs) and isolated a clean sample of WD cluster members. We estimated the cluster's age by comparing the observed WD cooling sequence luminosity function (LF), derived from JWST photometry, with theoretical models, obtaining a value of 11.8 +/- 0.5 Gyr, in agreement with main sequence turn-off ages, and ages determined from the masses and radii of two eclipsing binaries in the cluster. The age determined from the infrared LF is consistent with the optical LF based on the HST photometry. However, small discrepancies exist between the shape of the observed and theoretical LFs. To investigate these differences, we tested the cooling times of WD models populating the bright part of the observed cooling sequence against a semi-empirical calibration from the literature, based on bright WDs in 47 Tuc, finding agreement within less than 2 sigma. A more detailed analysis of dynamical effects and the impact of multiple stellar populations on the WD mass distribution in the observed field will be essential for addressing this discrepancy in future studies.

### 8) [2506.20479](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20479v1): The MALATANG survey: Dense gas distribution on sub-kiloparsec scales across the disk of M82

Mark Rawlings, Amelie Saintonge, Yi-Chen Sun, Jing Zhou </p>
<p>
We present observations of HCN J=4-3 and HCO^+ J=4-3 lines obtained with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as part of the MALATANG survey, combined with archival HCN J=1-0 and HCO^+ J=1-0 data from the Green Bank Telescope, to study the spatial distribution and excitation conditions of dense molecular gas in the disk of M82. We detect HCN J=4-3 and HCO^+ J=4-3 emission within the central region (&lt; 500 pc) of the galaxy, while the J=1-0 emission lines exhibit a more extended spatial distribution (&gt; 700 pc). The dense gas shows a clear double-lobed structure in both spatial distribution and kinematics, with the HCN and HCO^+ J=4-3 lines in the southwest lobe blueshifted by ~ 40 km/s relative to the J=1-0 lines. The HCN J=4-3/1-0 and HCO^+ J=4-3/1-0 line-luminosity ratios range from 0.09 to 0.53 and from 0.14 to 0.87, respectively, with mean values of 0.18 +/- 0.04 and 0.36 +/- 0.06. The HCN ratio is lower than the typical average observed in nearby star-forming galaxies, whereas the HCO^+ ratio is comparatively higher, suggesting that the high-J HCN emission in M82 is significantly sub-thermally excited. Spatially, the peak values of the J=4-3/1-0 ratios are found in the northwest region of M82, coinciding with the galaxy-scale outflow. Elevated HCN/HCO^+ ratios are also detected in roughly the same area, potentially tracing local excitation enhancements driven by the outflow. The HCN/HCO^+ J=4-3 ratio across all detected regions ranges from 0.19 to 1.07 with a mean value of 0.41 +/- 0.11, which is significantly lower than the average J=1-0 ratio of 0.76 +/- 0.08. Both ratios are significantly lower than the average values observed in nearby star-forming galaxies, which could be related to the relatively low gas density and the presence of an extended photo-dissociation region in M82.

This paper provides an overview of the spectroscopic data obtained by the JWST Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) program 1192, "The Physics and Chemistry of PDR Fronts", including an inventory of the spatially resolved dust, gas, and molecular content in the Horsehead nebula and the NW filament of NGC~7023. We demonstrate the unique capability of this high spatial resolution data set to elucidate the evolution of gas and dust at the interface between stars and their natal clouds at the scale at which the physics and chemistry occur. The Disassociation Regions (PDRs) in the Horsehead nebula and the North West (NW) filament of NGC 7023 were mapped with a spectral resolution 1000-3000 and a spatial resolution of ~2e-4 pc between 0.97-28um. Spectra extracted from template regions yield a large number of atomic, ionized, and molecular lines. Full line lists and extracted spectra for all 10 regions are provided through CDS. Absorption from H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, and CO ices are identified in 3 regions in NGC 7023. In this overview, we have focused on the spectral region between 3 and 5 um which is dominated by emission from aromatic and aliphatic carbon bonds to illustrate the power of the data set. We confirm the entrainment of aromatic carbonaceous species in the photo-evaporative flow from the PDR surface into the H \scii region in the Horsehead. No aliphatic emission is present in the outflow, indicating the complete removal of aliphatic bonds when exposed to strong UV fields. There is a clear detection of deuterium substitution in the carbon bonds. Aliphatic D-substitution is more efficient relative to aromatic D-substitution, ranging from N_D/N_H ~ 0.1-0.3 for aliphatics compared to ~0.03 for the aromatics.

### 10) [2506.20436](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20436v1): Nucleosynthesis and the chemical enrichment of galaxies

<p> Chiaki Kobayashi </p>
<p>
Stars are fossils that retain the history of their host galaxies. Carbon and heavier elements are created inside stars and are ejected when they die. From the spatial distribution of elements in galaxies, it is therefore possible to constrain the physical processes during galaxy formation and evolution. This approach, Galactic archaeology, has been popularly used for our Milky Way Galaxy thanks to a vast amount of data from the Gaia satellite and multi-object spectrographs, and now can also be applied to very distant galaxies with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) - extra-galactic archaeology. In these studies the most important factor is the input stellar physics, namely nucleosynthesis yields and binary physics, which predominantly determine the model predictions. In this review I give a summary of stellar nucleosynthesis, and how they are tested with the observations in the Milky Way. Then I show how chemical enrichment of galaxies can be calculated, and show some results with the latest nucleosynthesis yields.

The dusty interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way is distributed in a complex, cloudy structure. It is fundamental to the radiation balance within the Milky Way, provides a reaction surface to form complex molecules, and is the feedstock for future generations of stars and planets. The life cycle of interstellar dust is not completely understood, and neither are its structure nor composition. The abundance, composition, and structure of dust in the diffuse ISM can be determined by combining infrared, optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy. JWST enables measurement of the faint absorption of ISM dust grains against bright stars at kiloparsec distances across the infrared spectrum. Here we present an overview of the project `Webb Investigation of Silicates, Carbons, and Ices' (WISCI) along with interpretation of two targets, GSC 08152-02121 and CPD-59 5831. Observations of 12 WISCI target stars were taken by JWST, the Hubble Space Telescope, Himalayan Chandra Telescope, and the Very Large Telescope. We use these to characterize the targets' spectral types and calculate their line-of-sight extinction parameters, A_V and R_V. We find absorption in the JWST spectra of GSC 08152-02121, and CPD-59 5831 associated with carbonaceous dust around 3.4 and 6.2 micron and amorphous silicates at 9.7 micron. In GSC 08152-02121 we also find indications of absorption by trapped water around 3 micron. This first look from WISCI demonstrates the line-of-sight variability within the sample, and the program's potential to identify and correlate features across ultraviolet to mid-infrared wavelengths.

### 12) [2506.19901](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19901v1): Discovery of Diffuse Radio Emission in a Massive z=1.709 Cool Core Cluster: A Candidate Radio Mini-Halo

<p>
Clusters of galaxies host spectacular diffuse radio sources, extending over scales from 100 kpc to several Mpcs. These sources, with extremely faint surface brightness (&mu;Jy/arcsec^2 level), are not tied to individual galaxies but trace synchrotron emission from large-scale magnetic fields and relativistic particles within the intracluster environment. Here, we report the discovery of a candidate radio mini-halo in SpARCS104922.6+564032.5, the most distant cool-core galaxy cluster identified to date at z=1.709, using deep LOFAR 120-168 MHz observations. We show that this emission originates from diffuse cluster-associated processes rather than unresolved AGN or star-forming galaxies. The diffuse radio emission coincides spatially with the X-ray emission of the hot intracluster medium and has a radio power of P_150~MHz=49.8^+14.7_-11.7 ×10^24 W Hz^-1, exhibiting striking similarities to low-redshift radio mini-halos. This discovery doubles the redshift of previously known mini-halos, challenging models of inverse Compton losses and indicating the presence of strong magnetic fields, enhanced turbulence in high-redshift clusters, or active hadronic processes that require a cosmic ray-to-thermal energy ratio of 0.07 within 200 kpc, assuming a clumped distribution with spatial correlations among the gas, cosmic rays, and magnetic field that partially compensate for cosmological redshift dimming. It further implies that magnetic fields are efficiently amplified to ~10~&mu;G levels within a Mpc^3 volume during the epoch of cluster formation before z~2. These findings provide critical insights into high-redshift cluster physics and emphasize the transformative potential of next-generation radio surveys, such as those with the SKA and ngVLA, in exploring the early evolution of galaxy clusters.

### 13) [2506.19721](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19721v1): MUSE-DARK-I: Dark matter halo properties of intermediate-z star-forming galaxies

<p> B. I. Ciocan, N. F. Bouché, J. Fensch, W. Mercier, D. Krajnović, J. Richard, T. Contini, A. Jeanneau </p>

[Abridged] We analyse the dark matter (DM) halo properties of 127 0.3&lt;z&lt;1.5 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) down to low stellar masses (7&lt;log(Mstar/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;11), using data from the MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field Survey and photometry from HST and JWST. We employ a 3D forward modelling approach to analyse the morpho-kinematics of our sample, enabling measurement of individual rotation curves out to 2-3 times the effective radius. We perform a disk-halo decomposition with a 3D parametric model that includes stellar, gas, and DM components, with pressure support corrections. We validate our methodology on mock data cubes generated from idealised disk simulations. We select the best-fitting DM model among six density profiles, including the Navarro-Frenk-White and the generalised alpha-beta-gamma profile of Di Cintio et al. (2014, DC14). Our Bayesian analysis shows that DC14 performs as well as or better than the other profiles in &gt;65% of the sample. We find that the kinematically inferred stellar masses agree with values from SED fitting. We find that 89% of galaxies have DM fractions &gt;50%. For 70% of SFGs, we infer a DM inner slope, gamma &lt; 0.5, indicating cored DM profiles, but no correlation is found between gamma and star formation rate of the sample. The stellar- and concentration-mass relations agree with theoretical expectations, but with larger scatter. We confirm the anticorrelation between halo scale radius and DM density. The halo scale radii and DM surface densities increase with Mstar, while DM densities stay constant. We find tentative evidence of an evolution of the DM density with z, which suggests that the DM halos of intermediate-z systems are denser than those of local galaxies. In contrast, the halo scale radii are z-invariant.

### 14) [2506.19589](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19589v1): Black Holes in the Red-sequence Elliptical Galaxies at Redshifts ~ 0.7-2.5: Not Dark Energy Source but Remanants of Little Red Dots

<p> Lei Lei, Ze-Fan Wang, Yi-Ying Wang, Lei Feng, Yi-Zhong Fan </p>
<p>
The nature of dark energy remains one of the most profound mysteries in modern cosmology. One intriguing proposal is that black holes (BHs) could be the astrophysical source of dark energy through a cosmological coupling mechanism, and strong evidence has been claimed via analyzing the growth of the black hole masses in the red-sequence elliptical galaxies at redshifts ≤ 2.5. In this work, with a group of very high redshift AGNs detected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in the red-sequence elliptical galaxies, we show that the possibility of BHs being the astrophysical source of dark energy has been rejected at a confidence level exceeding 10&sigma;. Moreover, it turns out that the Little Red Dots recently discovered by JWST, characterized by the low accretion rates, can naturally evolve into the red-sequence elliptical galaxies hosting the relatively low mass black holes at the redshifts of ~ 0.7-2.5, without the need of black hole cosmological coupling.

### 15) [2506.18993](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18993v1): Direct Collapse pre-SMBH Objects as Lyα Emitters

<p> Yang Luo, Isaac Shlosman </p>
<p>
Direct Collapse scenario to form the supermassive black hole (SMBH) seeds offers the most promising way to explain the origin of quasars at z&gt;7. Assuming atomic primordial gas, can Ly&alpha; photons escape from the central regions of the collapse and serve as a diagnostic for the detection of these pre-SMBH objects? Models assuming spherical collapse have found these photons to be trapped and destroyed. We use Ly&alpha; radiation transfer within the inflow-outflow geometry, based on earlier zoom-in cosmological modeling involving radiation transfer and magnetic forces. Adopting geometry that includes ongoing disky and spherical accretion, and formation of bi-conical outflow funnel, we obtain formation of a dense radiatively-driven expanding shell. The Ly&alpha; transfer is performed through a Monte Carlo algorithm, accounting for destruction of Ly&alpha; photons and emergence of two-photon emission. We find that substantial fraction of Ly&alpha; photons can escape through the funnel, and calculate the line profiles, the line peak velocity shift, asymmetry and cuspiness, by varying basic model parameters. The escaping Ly&alpha; emission is anisotropic, and sensitive to overall inflow-outflow geometry. The escaping fraction of Ly&alpha; radiation exceeds 95% from a z=10 pre-SMBH object &ndash; in principle detectable by the JWST NIRSpec in the MOS mode, during ~ 10^4seconds for a 10&sigma; signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, comparisons with line shapes from high-z galaxies and quasars allow to separate them from pre-SMBH objects based on the line asymmetry &ndash; the pre-SMBH line show a profound asymmetry and extended red tail.

### 16) [2506.18413](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18413v1): The role of environment on the evolution of disc galaxies density profiles New insights from simulations and comparison to Euclid data

<p> M. Mondelin, F. Bournaud, J-C. Cuillandre, P. Hennebelle </p>
<p>
Galactic discs are known to have exponential radial profiles in luminosity and stellar surface density in their bright inner regions. Nonetheless, their faint outer regions often display a break, with either a down-bending or an up-bending profile. Recent Euclid Early Release Observations show that down-bending breaks are scarce in the Perseus cluster, as already suspected in Virgo. We use hydrodynamic simulations of disc galaxies interacting with a Perseus-like cluster. We show that Type II profiles (down-bending) can be rapidly eroded by the cluster tidal field on a 1 Gyr timescale, while Type III (up-bending) and Type I (no break) profiles remain largely unaffected. Type II profiles are eroded through dynamical processes, including tidal stirring of stars by the cluster potential and triggering of star formation in the outer disc. Our simulations show that observations of disc breaks across environments and cosmic epochs are consistent with a coherent evolutionary picture. At high redshift, JWST reveals early break structures in isolated environments. At low redshift, field disc galaxies retain these breaks, while dense clusters, as observed by Euclid in Perseus, show significant alterations. Our findings support a scenario in which down-bending profiles result from internal processes during early formation phases and are later modified by environmental effects in clusters. This interpretation does not require additional mechanisms such as ram-pressure stripping or star formation threshold variations to explain the observed evolution of down-bending breaks.

### 17) [2506.18351](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18351v1): Unveiling Galaxy Structures: Systematic Analysis of Bulge+Disk Decomposition Using Simulated JWST/NIRCam Observations

<p> Zhengxin Tang, Xuheng Ding, Boris S. Kalita, Lilan Yang </p>
<p>
Characterizing and accurately decomposing galaxies into structural components, such as bulges and disks, is essential for understanding galaxy formation and evolution, particularly at high redshift, where galaxies are compact and faint. Leveraging the unparalleled resolution and sensitivity of JWST and imaging data from CEERs program, we simulate galaxies with bulge+disk components and assess the effectiveness of single and double S\'ersic model fittings, respectively. We first evaluate the performance of single S\'ersic fits, and find it can recover total magnitudes (i.e., within 0.5 mag), and size (i.e., within 0.2 dex), down to 27 mag. The features that emerged in the residual map can properly reflect the underlying two-component structures. We also show that S\'ersic indices can serve as proxies for the bulge-to-total flux ratio (B/T). For double S\'ersic models, we find comparable accuracy in recovering bulge and disk magnitudes (i.e., within 0.5 mag), and effective radius (i.e., within 0.2 dex), down to 26 mag. To quantitatively determine whether a double S\'ersic model better describes our two-component systems compared to a single S\'ersic profile, we evaluate the Bayesian Information Criterion for both model configurations. To extend the applicability of our results to other NIRCam programs, we evaluate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the simulated galaxies and find that model parameters are reliably reproduced when the SNR exceeds 10. Our work demonstrates the detailed morphological measurement uncertainties using single and double S\'ersic models, which provides an essential reference for future JWST/NIRCam-based morphological studies, especially for high-redshift galaxies.

<p>
We present initial results from the 4.8 GHz Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) survey of the JWST North Ecliptic Pole Time-Domain Field (TDF). From 106 radio sources found in the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations in the TDF, we detected 12 sources (11% detection rate) at 3.3 &mu;Jy rms sensitivity and 4 mas resolution. Most detections exhibit pc-scale emission (less than 40 pc) with high VLBA/VLA flux density ratios and brightness temperatures exceeding 10^5 K, confirming non-thermal AGN activity. Spectral indices (&gt; -0.5) correlate with higher VLBA/VLA flux ratios, consistent with synchrotron emission from AGN coronae or jets. In the majority of our sources star formation contributes less than 50% of the total VLBA radio emission, with a few cases where the emission is almost entirely AGN-driven. Although the radio emission from radio quiet AGN is thought to be primarily driven by star formation, our VLBA observations confirm that there is also often a contribution at various levels from black hole driven AGN. Eight VLBA detections have JWST/NIRCam counterparts, predominantly early-type, bulge-dominated galaxies, which we use to get an estimate of the redshift and star formation rate (SFR). WISE colors indicate that VLBA detections are either AGN or intermediate-disk-dominated systems, while VLBA non-detections correspond to extended, star-forming galaxies. We compare SFRs derived from previous SCUBA-2 850 &mu;m observations with new JWST-based estimates, and discuss the observed discrepancies, highlighting JWST's improved capability to disentangle AGN activity from star formation.

### 19) [2506.17641](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17641v1): Dark Bondi Accretion Aided by Baryons and the Origin of JWST Little Red Dots

<p> Wei-Xiang Feng, Hai-Bo Yu, Yi-Ming Zhong </p>
<p>
The gravothermal core collapse of self-interacting dark matter halos provides a compelling mechanism for seeding supermassive black holes in the early Universe. In this scenario, a small fraction of a halo, approximately 1&percnt; of its mass, collapses into a dense core, which could further evolve into a black hole. We demonstrate that this process can account for the origin of JWST little red dots (LRDs) observed at redshifts z~4-11, where black holes with masses of 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub> can form within 500 Myr after the formation of host halos with masses of 10^9  M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Even if the initial collapse region triggering general-relativistic instability has a mass on the order of one solar mass, the resulting seed can grow into an intermediate-mass black hole via Eddington accretion of baryonic gas. Subsequently, it can continue to grow into a supermassive black hole through dark Bondi accretion of dark matter particles. In this scenario, the majority of the black hole's mass originates from dark matter accretion rather than baryonic matter, naturally explaining the overmassive feature of LRDs.

### 20) [2506.17584](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17584v1): Outflowing shocked gas dominates the NIR H<sub>2</sub> emission from the dual AGN NGC6240

<p>
[Abridged] We present a multi-line study of the kinematics of the molecular and ionised gas phases in the central 2 kpc of NGC6240, based on JWST/NIRSpec and ALMA observations. We devised a new spectral-line fitting approach to de-blend rotating and non-rotating gas components, which is better tailored to the extreme feedback mechanisms at work in NGC6240. We find that ~65% of the Pa&alpha;, H<sub>2</sub>, and [FeII] line fluxes within the NIRSpec field of view arise from gas components that are kinematically decoupled from the stars. The NIR H<sub>2</sub> lines show the most deviation from the stars, with peak emission between the two rotating stellar structures. The PAH 3.3&mu;m feature does not follow the NIR H<sub>2</sub> morphology, indicating that the latter does not trace PDRs. In the non-rotating gas components, we identify a biconical wind launched from the northern AGN, expanding along the minor axis of stellar rotation. This wind is dominated by ionised gas and, although it entrains some H<sub>2</sub>, it does not show a H<sub>2</sub>/PAH enhancement, suggesting either high UV irradiation or expansion along a relatively gas-free path. Furthermore, we find bright non-rotating gas emission between the two AGN and around the southern AGN, which we interpret as due to an outflow launched from the southern nucleus, coinciding with the molecular outflow previously studied in cold (sub-)millimeter tracers. The strong H<sub>2</sub>/PAH enhancement measured in this region, coextensive with high velocity redshifted gas (v~900 km s<sup>-1</sup>), suggests that the shocks responsible for the high H<sub>2</sub>/PAH ratios are due to the outflow rather than to the collision of media during the merger. Our results show that the bulk of the NIR line emission in NGC6240 is decoupled from the stars, and that most of the warm H<sub>2</sub> is shock-excited and embedded in a powerful outflow, where it coexists with colder molecular gas.

### 21) [2506.17476](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17476v1): Signatures of BH seeding on the M_\displaystyle &bull;-σ relation: Predictions from the BRAHMA simulations

<p> Jonathan Kho, Aklant K. Bhowmick, Paul Torrey, Alex M. Garcia, Niusha Ahvazi, Laura Blecha, Mark Vogelsberger </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has identified a large population of supermassive (10^6-10^8~M<sub>&odot;</sub>) black holes (BHs) in the early universe (z ~ 4-7). Current measurements suggest that many of these BHs exhibit higher BH-to-stellar mass ratios than local populations, opening a new window into the earliest stages of BH-galaxy coevolution and offering the potential to place tight constraints on BH seeding and growth in the early universe. In this work, we use the BRAHMA simulations to investigate the impact of BH seeding on the M<sub>&bull;</sub>-&sigma; relation. These simulations adopt heavy ~10^5~M<sub>&odot;</sub> seeds and systematically varied BH seeding models, resulting in distinct predictions for seed abundances. We find that different seed models lead to different normalizations of the M<sub>&bull;</sub>-&sigma; relation at higher redshifts (z &gt; 2) across all &sigma;, and at low redshift for systems with low &sigma; (50~km s<sup>-1</sup> ≲ &sigma; ≲ 80~km s<sup>-1</sup>). The most lenient seed model also shows negligible evolution in the M<sub>&bull;</sub>-&sigma; relation across redshift, while more restrictive models have substantially lower normalization on the M<sub>&bull;</sub>-&sigma; relation for high &sigma; (~ 100~km s<sup>-1</sup>) at high redshifts, and evolve upward toward the local relation. We demonstrate that the M<sub>&bull;</sub>-&sigma; evolution is a direct consequence of merger-dominated BH growth in low mass galaxies (≲ 10^9~M<sub>&odot;</sub>) and accretion dominated BH growth in high mass (≳10^9~M<sub>&odot;</sub>) galaxies. Furthermore, the scatter in the M<sub>&bull;</sub>-&sigma; relation is larger for the more restrictive models due to the inability of many BHs to grow significantly beyond their seed mass.

### 22) [2506.17400](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17400v1): Metal-polluted PopIII galaxies and How to Find Them

<p> Elka Rusta, Stefania Salvadori, Viola Gelli, Daniel Schaerer, Alessandro Marconi, Ioanna Koutsouridou, Stefano Carniani </p>
<p>
Observing Population III (PopIII) galaxies, the hosts of first-generation stars, remains challenging even with the JWST. The current few candidates have been identified through the combination of a prominent HeII emission and the absence of metal lines, a well-known but extremely brief signature of metal-free systems. Here, we accurately model the evolution of the emission from PopIII galaxies to increase the number of candidates in JWST observations. To achieve this, we employ a locally calibrated galaxy-formation model that self-consistently follows the star formation and chemical evolution initiated by the first stars. We find that PopIII galaxies can emit metal lines in their "self-polluted'' phase, while galaxies host only metal-free stars but the gas has been chemically-enriched by the first supernovae. In this phase, PopIII galaxies have [OIII]/H&beta; ≈ 1, which opens the pool of candidates to more easily detectable sources. We predict that the high HeII emission of PopIII galaxies can last up to ≈ 20   Myrs and that it is partly maintained in the "hybrid'' phase, when PopIII and PopII stars co-exist in the host galaxy. We propose novel diagnostics involving UV metal lines to select PopIII candidates in high-z JWST surveys. In JADES, we identify 9 candidate galaxies with &gt;25&percnt; of their stellar mass in metal-free stars, showcasing the effectiveness of our method. Ultimately, the key to discovering PopIII galaxies could be to catch them during their first episodes of chemical enrichment.

<p>
We present the nebular attenuation curves and dust covering fractions for 24 redshift z=1.5-4.4 star-forming galaxies using multiple Balmer and Paschen lines from the JWST/AURORA survey. Nebular reddening derived from Paschen lines exceeds that from Balmer lines for at least half the galaxies in the sample when assuming the commonly-adopted Galactic extinction curve, implying the presence of optically-thick star formation. The nebular attenuation curves exhibit a broad range of normalizations (Rv ~ 3.2-16.4). Motivated by the offsets in reddening deduced from the Balmer and Paschen lines, and the high Rv values for the individual nebular attenuation curves, both of which suggest variations in the dust-stars geometry, we propose a model with a subunity dust covering fraction (fcov). Fitting such a model to the HI recombination line ratios indicates fcov ~ 0.6-1.0. The normalizations of the nebular attenuation curves, Rv, are driven primarily by fcov and the mix of optically-thick and thin OB associations. Thus, the diversity of nebular attenuation curves can be accommodated by assuming dust grain properties similar to that of Milky Way sightlines but with a subunity covering fraction of dust. Integrated measurements of multiple Balmer and Paschen lines can be used to place novel constraints on the dust covering fraction towards OB associations. These, in turn, provide new avenues for exploring the role of dust and gas covering fraction in a number of relevant aspects of high-redshift galaxies, including the impact of stellar feedback on ISM porosity and the escape of Ly-alpha and Lyman continuum radiation.

We analyze the ro-vibrational absorption bands of various molecular cations (HCO^+, HCNH^+, and N<sub>2</sub>H^+) and neutral species (HCN, HNC, and HC_3N) detected in the JWST/MIRI MRS spectrum (4.9-27.9 &mu;m) of the local ultra luminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) IRAS~07251-0248. We find that the molecular absorptions are blueshifted by 160 km s<sup>-1</sup> relative to the systemic velocity of the target. Using local thermal equilibrium (LTE) excitation models, we derive rotational temperatures (T_rot) from 42 to 185 K for these absorption bands. This range of measured T_rot can be explained by infrared (IR) radiative pumping as a byproduct of the strength, effective critical density, and opacity of each molecular band. Thus, these results suggest that these absorptions originate in a warm expanding gas shell (M&#775;~90-330 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1), which might be the base of the larger scale cold molecular outflow detected in this source. Finally, the elevated abundance of molecular cations (H_3^+, HCO^+, HCNH^+, and N<sub>2</sub>H^+) can be explained by a high cosmic ray ionization rate, with log(\zeta_H<sub>2</sub>/n_H  [cm^3 s<sup>-1</sup>]) in the range of -19.1 to -18.2, consistent with a cosmic ray dominated chemistry as predicted by chemical models.

We probe galactic-scale outflows in star-forming galaxies at z≳2.5 drawn from the JWST/NIRSpec AURORA program.

We measure ISM kinematics from Fe II and Mg II absorption features in 41 and 43 galaxies, respectively, and examine how these kinematics correlate with galaxy properties. We find that galaxies with outflows tend to have higher stellar masses, and that maximum outflow velocities increase with stellar mass, SFR, &beta;, E(B-V), and A_V. We also find that Mg II emission is more common in galaxies with lower masses, higher sSFRs, and less dust. These trends are consistent with those in star-forming galaxies at z&lt;2 when using the same outflow tracers, suggesting that the feedback from star formation has played a persistent role in shaping galaxy evolution over cosmic time. We also directly compare near-UV and far-UV features in the same NIRSpec spectrum for a z=5.19 galaxy, finding consistent ISM kinematics and demonstrating that different tracers yield comparable measurements. We also detect Na D absorption in 10 galaxies, which have higher stellar mass, SFR, and dust attenuation compared to galaxies without Na D absorption, which is consistent with z~0 studies. The broad continuum coverage and sensitivity of NIRSpec will enable future studies with larger samples, allowing for robust tests of these trends across a wider dynamic range of galaxy properties.

<p>
While bursty star formation in low-mass galaxies has been observed in local populations and reproduced in simulations, the dormant phase of the burst cycle has not been well studied beyond the local Universe due to observational limitations. We present a unique sample of 41 JWST PRISM spectra of low-mass galaxies (M<sub>&sext;</sub> &lt; 10^9.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) at cosmic noon (1&lt;z&lt;3), uniformly selected on F200W magnitude and precise photometric redshifts enabled by 20-band JWST photometry from the UNCOVER and MegaScience surveys. The spectra reveal numerous strong Balmer breaks, which are negatively correlated with the galaxies' H&alpha; equivalent width. By comparing these observations to synthetic samples of spectra generated using a simple parametrization of bursty star formation histories, we show that star formation in low-mass galaxies at cosmic noon is likely dominated by burst cycles with long timescales (≳ 100 Myr) and large deviations below the star-forming main sequence (≳ 0.8 dex). Our results suggest that galaxies in this population&ndash;at least those within our detection limits&ndash;should not be classified solely by their current star formation rates, but instead viewed as a unified population undergoing dynamic movement above and below the star-forming main sequence. The derived constraints demonstrate that long-timescale fluctuations are important for this class of galaxies, indicating that galaxy-scale gas cycles&ndash;rather than molecular-cloud-scale stochasticity&ndash;are the primary regulators of star formation variability in low-mass galaxies at cosmic noon.

### 27) [2506.16145](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16145v1): Measurements of the z=4-10 X-ray Luminosity Function: the high space density of moderate-luminosity, obscured AGN

<p> C. L. Barlow-Hall, J. Aird </p>
<p>
SMBHs are theorised to undergo significant growth in the early Universe, however, the X-ray Luminosity Function (XLF), used as a principal tracer of the SMBH accretion density, lacks observational constraints at z&gt;6, until now. We present new measurements of the z=4-10 XLF at intermediate luminosities, taking advantage of recent deep near-IR imaging from UltraVISTA that enables us to identify galaxies and AGN at high redshifts within which we identify X-ray sources using Chandra COSMOS data. We first performed a cross-match to a deep Chandra source list, for which the X-ray sensitivity can be accurately quantified, before exploiting available X-ray data further through direct extraction of X-ray counts at the positions of COSMOS2020 galaxies. With the resulting z=4-10 X-ray AGN sample, comprised of 21 blind detections and 11 directly extracted detections, we have measured the early space density of AGN, at moderate-luminosities where the majority of early SMBH growth occurred. These measurements reveal higher space-densities than expected, based on the extrapolation of XLF models from lower redshifts. Whilst our measured space densities at z=4-5 are consistent with model predictions, at z=5-7 we find space densities of the order of 10× the extrapolated model predictions and could be as high as 220× the model extrapolations at z=7-10. In addition, we find evidence that a large fraction of the early AGN population are heavily obscured, with an obscured fraction of 0.982^+0.007_-0.008; correcting for this obscuration further increases the measured space densities. Comparing to recent JWST results, these measurements begin to bridge the gap between the bright-end of the quasar luminosity function and the latest JWST observations of very early, low-luminosity AGN, indicating a larger fraction of the first galaxies play host to rapidly growing SMBH than previously thought.

The mass assembly and chemical enrichment of the first galaxies provide key insights into their star-formation histories and the earliest stellar populations at cosmic dawn. Here we compile and utilize new, high-quality spectroscopic JWST/NIRSpec Prism observations from the JWST archive. We extend the wavelength coverage beyond the standard pipeline cutoff up to 5.5&mu;m, enabling a detailed examination of the rest-frame optical emission-line properties for galaxies at z≈ 10. The improved calibration allows us to detect H&beta; and the [OIII]&lambda;&lambda; 4959,5007 doublet and resolve the auroral [OIII]&lambda; 4363 line for the 11 galaxies in our sample (z=9.3-10.0) to obtain direct T_e-based metallicity measurements. We find that all galaxies show high ionisation fields and electron temperatures, with derived metallicities in the range 12+log (O/H) = 7.1 - 8.3, consistent with previous strong-line diagnostics at high-z. We derive an empirical relation for M_UV and 12+log(O/H) at z≈ 10, useful for future higher-z studies, and show that the sample galaxies are `typical' star-forming galaxies though with relatively high specific star-formation rates and with evidence for bursty star formation. Combining the rest-frame optical line analysis and detailed UV to optical SED modelling, we determine the mass-metallicity relation and the fundamental-metallicity relation of the sample, pushing the redshift frontier of these measurements to z=10. These results, together with literature measurements, point to a gradually decreasing MZR at higher redshifts, with a break in the FMR at z≈ 3, decreasing to metallicities ≈ 3× lower at z=10 than observed during the majority of cosmic time at z=0-3, likely caused by massive pristine gas inflows diluting the observed metal abundances during early galaxy assembly at cosmic dawn.

### 29) [2506.15618](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15618v1): The Infinity Galaxy: a Candidate Direct-Collapse Supermassive Black Hole Between Two Massive, Ringed Nuclei

<p> Pieter van Dokkum, Gabriel Brammer, Josephine F. W. Baggen, Michael A. Keim, Priyamvada Natarajan, Imad Pasha </p>
<p>
We report the discovery of an unusual z=1.14 object, dubbed the \infty galaxy, in JWST imaging of the COSMOS field. Its rest-frame near-IR light is dominated by two compact nuclei with stellar masses of ~ 10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and a projected separation of 10 kpc. Both nuclei have a prominent ring or shell around them, giving the galaxy the appearance of a figure eight or an \infty symbol. The morphology resembles that of the nearby system II Hz 4, where the head-on collision of two galaxies with parallel disks led to the formation of collisional rings around both of their bulges. Keck spectroscopy, VLA radio data, and Chandra X-ray data show that the \infty galaxy hosts an actively accreting supermassive black hole (SMBH), with quasar-like radio and X-ray luminosity. Remarkably, the SMBH is not associated with either of the two nuclei, but is in between them in both position and radial velocity. Furthermore, from excess emission in the NIRCAM F150W filter we infer that the SMBH is embedded in an extended distribution of H&alpha;-emitting gas, with a rest-frame equivalent width ranging from 400 - 2000 Angstrom. The gas spans the entire width of the system and was likely shocked and compressed at the collision site, in a galaxy-scale equivalent of what happened in the bullet cluster. We suggest that the SMBH formed within this gas in the immediate aftermath of the collision, when it was dense and highly turbulent. If corroborated with simulations and follow-up JWST spectroscopy, this would demonstrate that `direct' SMBH formation by a runaway gravitational collapse is possible in extreme conditions.

### 30) [2506.15358](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15358v1): Expanding the Ice Inventory of NGC 1333 IRAS 2A with INDRA using JWST Observations: Tracing Organic Refractories and Beyond

<p>
In the era of JWST, with its unprecedented sensitivity and spectral resolution, infrared spectral surveys have revealed a rich inventory of ices, including complex organic molecules (COMs), in young stellar objects (YSOs). However, robust methods to decompose and quantify these absorption features particularly across broad spectral ranges, are still under investigation. We present INDRA (Ice-fitting with NNLS-based Decomposition and Retrieval Algorithm), a fully Python-based tool that performs continuum and silicate removal, global ice fitting using Weighted Non-Negative Least Squares (NNLS), and estimates column densities and statistical significance. We apply INDRA to NGC 1333 IRAS 2A, a target from the JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS+) program previously studied using local fitting. We derive optical depths via polynomial continuum subtraction and remove silicate absorption using a synthetic model, isolating ice features for global MIRI fitting. Our results are consistent with previous local fits, confirming simple species and COMs, and expand the inventory by identifying additional absorption features from CO2 and NH4+. We also propose the presence of organic refractories contributing up to 9.6% in the spectral region of 5-8 microns among the various ice components, whose inclusion significantly improves the global spectral fitting. These broad absorption features, extending across 5.5-11 microns, are likely produced by large, complex molecules containing carbonyl (C=O), hydroxyl (O-H), amine (N-H), and C-H bending modes. Our expanded inventory, now incorporating these organic residues, offers new insights into the chemical evolution of ices in star-forming regions and highlights the importance of global spectral fitting in constraining ice compositions.

<p>
As part of the N2CLS Survey, we have identified a remarkable overdensity of ten bright dusty star-forming galaxies at z~5.2 in the GOODS-N field. Three of these galaxies, N2GN_1_01, 06, and 23 (known as GN10, HDF850.1, and S3, respectively), had previously been spectroscopically confirmed as members of the exceptional large-scale structure at z~5.1-5.3, which is notably elongated along the line of sight, spanning 30 cMpc. We present the spectroscopic confirmation of N2GN_1_13 at z<sub>spec</sub>=5.182, a massive dusty star-forming galaxy identified through targeted NOEMA observations, and N2GN_1_61 at z<sub>spec</sub>=5.201, revealed using JWST/FRESCO data. In addition to these five spectroscopically confirmed members, we identify five further candidates with photometric redshifts consistent with the overdense structure. These galaxies are massive (with a median stellar mass of 10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) and highly obscured (with a median A_V of 2.9), caught in a short-lived yet extreme starburst phase at z~5.2. Their high SFRs (with a median of 680 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1), efficient baryon to stellar mass conversion (&epsilon;<sub>&sext;</sub>&gt;20%), substantial gas reservoir and dust content, suggest rapid evolution and imminent quenching. Six of these galaxies reside in overdense filaments, while the remaining four may trace new distinct structures which will have to be spectroscopically confirmed. These few dusty galaxies dominate the star formation within the overdensity, contributing more than the numerous H_&alpha; emitters, and surpassing the cosmic average star formation rate density for this epoch. Their properties suggest an accelerated evolution that current models and simulations have difficulty reproducing.

<p>
We present a kinematical study of the ionized and molecular gas in the central region (~7-14"~100-200pc) of the nearby radio galaxy Cen A. We used JWST/MIRI MRS 5-28&mu;m observations taken as part of the MIR Characterization of Nearby Iconic galaxy Centers (MICONIC) of the MIRI EC. The two gas phases present contrasting morphologies and kinematics. The brightest emission from the ionized gas, traced with a range of IP lines ([Fe II] to [Ne VI]), is extended along the direction of the radio jet. We also detected emission from low IP emission lines and H<sub>2</sub> transitions in the galaxy disk. Both gas phases present rotational motions but also complex kinematics. The observations reveal several ionized gas kinematical features that are consistent with simulation predictions of a jet-driven bubble and outflow interacting with the galaxy ISM. These include broad components in the nuclear line profiles (&sigma;~600km/s), high velocities (~ +1000, -1400km/s) confined within the nuclear region, velocities of hundreds of km/s in several directions in the central 2", and enhanced velocity dispersions perpendicular to the radio jet. Moreover, we find evidence of shock excitation in the nuclear region based on MIR line ratios. We compared the ionized gas mass outflow rate with Cen A's AGN luminosity and radio jet power and demonstrate that both mechanisms provide sufficient energy to launch the outflow. The noncircular motions observed in the H<sub>2</sub> lines can be reproduced with either a warped rotating disk model or a radial component. The latter might be to related to gas streamers detected in cold molecular gas. There is no clear indication of a fast nuclear H<sub>2</sub> outflow, only a weak blueshifted component. This could be due to a relatively low nuclear warm H<sub>2</sub> column density and/or the limited geometrical coupling of Cen A's inner radio jet with the circumnuclear disk of the galaxy.

<p>
To advance research on galaxies in the era of large-scale sky surveys, we introduce GalaxyGenius, a Python package designed to produce synthetic galaxy images tailored to different telescopes based on hydrodynamical simulations. The package comprises three main modules: data preprocessing, ideal data cube generation, and mock observation. Specifically, the preprocessing module extracts necessary properties of star and gas particles for a selected subhalo from hydrodynamical simulations and creates the execution file for the following radiative transfer procedure. Subsequently, building on the above information, the ideal data cube generation module executes a widely-used radiative transfer project, specifically the SKIRT, to perform the SED assignment for each particle and the radiative transfer procedure to produce an IFU-like ideal data cube. Lastly, the mock observation module takes the ideal data cube and applies the throughputs of aiming telescopes while also incorporating the relevant instrumental effects, point spread functions (PSFs), and background noise to generate desired mock observational images of galaxies. To showcase the outcomes of GalaxyGenius, We create a series of mock images of galaxies based on the IllustrisTNG and EAGLE simulations for both space and ground-based surveys spanning from the ultraviolet to infrared wavelength coverages, including CSST, Euclid, HST, JWST, Roman, and HSC. GalaxyGenius offers a flexible framework developed to generate mock galaxy images with customizable recipes. These generated images can serve as valuable references for verifying and validating new approaches in astronomical research, and they can also act as training sets for deep learning relevant studies where real observational data are insufficient.

### 34) [2506.14273](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14273v2): The ejection and detectability of high- and hyper-velocity stars by compact object binaries in globular clusters

<p> Fraser A. Evans, Steffani M. Grondin, Claire S. Ye, Jeremy Webb, Alexander Laroche, Jo Bovy </p>
<p>
The dense cores of Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) play host to a variety of dynamical encounters between stellar objects, which can accelerate stars to velocities high enough to escape the GC. The most extreme examples of these encounters are interactions between single GC stars and binaries including at least one compact object. These interactions can result in ejection velocities of up to several hundred km  s<sup>-1</sup>, approaching or even exceeding the escape velocity of the Galaxy itself. In order to study whether these interactions contribute to the Galactic population of hypervelocity stars (stars moving faster than the Galactic escape speed), we combine Monte Carlo N-body GC simulations, observations of Galactic GCs, and a particle spray code to generate realistic populations of stars which have escaped from Milky Way GCs following star + compact object binary (S+COB) interactions. We find that over the last 500 Myr, S+COB interactions have likely ejected ~6300 stars from Galactic GCs, of which 839_-67^+70 have present-day velocities exceeding 500  km  s<sup>-1</sup>. Using mock photometric observations, we find that 290_-23^+28 ejected stars are detectable in Gaia Data Release 3, however, only 1_-1^+2 stars faster than 500  km  s<sup>-1</sup> are detectable. Even so, we show that observational prospects in the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time are more optimistic, and future detected fast extratidal GC stars will serve as a useful probe of GC cores.

<p> Gijs Vermariën, Thomas G. Bisbas, Serena Viti, Yue Zhao, Xuefei Tang, Rahul Ravichandran </p>
<p>
Computational astrochemical models are essential for helping us interpret and understand the observations of different astrophysical environments. In the age of high-resolution telescopes such as JWST and ALMA, the substructure of many objects can be resolved, raising the need for astrochemical modeling at these smaller scales, meaning that the simulations of these objects need to include both the physics and chemistry to accurately model the observations. The computational cost of the simulations coupling both the three-dimensional hydrodynamics and chemistry is enormous, creating an opportunity for surrogate models that can effectively substitute the chemical solver. In this work we present surrogate models that can replace the original chemical code, namely Latent Augmented Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. We train these surrogate architectures on three datasets of increasing physical complexity, with the last dataset derived directly from a three-dimensional simulation of a molecular cloud using a Photodissociation Region (PDR) code, 3D-PDR. We show that these surrogate models can provide speedup and reproduce the original observable column density maps of the dataset. This enables the rapid inference of the chemistry (on the GPU), allowing for the faster statistical inference of observations or increasing the resolution in hydrodynamical simulations of astrophysical environments.

### 36) [2506.14141](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14141v1): Spectral Properties of Irradiated Circumbinary Disks around Binary Black Holes Governed by Hydrogen Opacities Dependent on Temperature and Density

<p> Saemi Bang, Atsuo T. Okazaki, Kimitake Hayasaki </p>
<p>
We study the thermal and spectral properties of irradiated circumbinary disks (CBDs) around binary black holes (BBHs), using analytic, hydrogen-based opacity models that capture key dependencies on temperature, density, and ionization. We solve the vertically hydrostatic energy balance equations with Rosseland mean opacities from free-free absorption, bound-free absorption, and electron scattering processes, combined with ionization fractions derived by the Saha equation. Four opacity models are considered, including a reference model with no physical opacity, constructed by Lee et al. (2024), and three physically motivated alternatives. The midplane temperature profiles show significant variation across models, while the surface temperature remains largely unchanged in regions dominated by viscous heating. Opacity effects become pronounced in the outer disk, where irradiation reprocessing shapes the IR-optical continuum. Inclusion of bound-free opacity introduces a noticeable flattening and a mid-frequency peak in the spectral energy distribution. We also compute spectra of a triple disk system including the CBD and two accreting minidisks. The high-frequency peak arises from the hot minidisks, while the low-frequency excess originates from irradiated outer CBD layers. By comparing model spectra with detection limits of Subaru, JWST, and Swift, we find that systems within ~10 Mpc may show detectable IR excess from the CBD. Our results highlight the need for accurate opacity modeling to interpret electromagnetic signatures of black hole mergers and support future integration of opacity tables with metallicity.

### 37) [2506.14117](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14117v1): JWST Reveals a Likely Jellyfish Galaxy at z=1.156

<p>
We report the discovery of COSMOS2020-635829 as a likely jellyfish galaxy undergoing to ram pressure stripping in a (proto)cluster at z &gt; 1. High-resolution imaging from the James Webb Space Telescope reveals a symmetric stellar disk coupled to a unilateral tail of star-forming knots to the south. We show that these extra-planar continuum sources are embedded within an ionized gas tail that is kinematically connected to the disk of COSMOS2020-635829. Likely representing the highest-redshift discovery of a ram pressure stripped ionized gas tail. The tail sources are characterized by extremely young stellar populations (≲ 100 Myr), have stellar masses of ~10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, and star formation rates of 0.1&ndash;1 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1. This work reinforces the notion that ram pressure stripping can perturb group and cluster galaxies at z &gt; 1 and likely contributes to environmental quenching even near Cosmic Noon.

<p>
Clumps in the rest-frame UV emission of galaxies have been observed for decades. Since the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), a large population is detected in the rest-frame near-infrared (NIR), raising questions about their formation mechanism. We investigate the presence and properties of NIR over-densities (hereafter substructures) in star-forming and quiescent galaxies at 1 &lt; z &lt; 4 to understand their link to the evolution of their host galaxy. We identify substructures in JWST/NIRCam F277W and F444W residual images at a rest-frame wavelength of 1 um. The fraction of galaxies with substructures with M<sub>&sext;</sub> &gt; 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> has been steadily decreasing with cosmic time from 40% at z = 4 to 10% at z = 1. Clumps, the main small substructures in the rest-frame NIR, are the most common type and are much fainter (2% of the flux) than similar UV clumps in the literature. Nearly all galaxies at the high-mass end of the main sequence (MS), starburst, and green valley regions have substructures. However, we do not find substructures in low-mass galaxies in the green valley and red sequence. Although massive galaxies on the MS and in the green valley have a 40% probability of hosting multiple clumps, the majority of clumpy galaxies host only a single clump. The fraction of clumpy galaxies in the rest-frame NIR is determined by the stellar mass and SFR of the host galaxies. Its evolution with redshift is due to galaxies moving towards lower SFRs at z &lt; 2 and the build-up of low-mass galaxies in the green valley and red sequence. Based on their spatial distribution in edge-on galaxies, we infer that most of substructures are produced in-situ via disk fragmentation. Galaxy mergers may still play an important role at high stellar masses, especially at low SFR.

### 39) [2506.13864](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13864v2): Dark Matter Freeze-In and Small-Scale Observables: Novel Mass Bounds and Viable Particle Candidates

<p> Francesco D'Eramo, Alessandro Lenoci, Ariane Dekker </p>
<p>
The suppression of cosmological structure at small scales is a key signature of dark matter (DM) produced via freeze-in in the low-mass regime. We present a comprehensive analysis of its impact, incorporating recent constraints from Milky Way satellite counts, strong gravitational lensing with JWST data, and the Lyman-&alpha; forest. We adopt a general strategy to translate existing warm dark matter (WDM) bounds into lower mass limits for a broad class of DM candidates characterized by quasi-thermal phase space distributions. The benefits of this approach include computational efficiency and the ability to explore a wide range of models. We derive model-independent bounds for DM produced via two-body decays, scatterings, and three-body decays, and apply the framework to concrete scenarios such as the Higgs portal, sterile neutrinos, axion-like particles, and the dark photon portal. Results from specific models confirm the validity of the model-independent analysis.

### 40) [2506.13852](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13852v1): Overmassive black holes in the early Universe can be explained by gas-rich, dark matter-dominated galaxies

<p>
JWST has revealed the apparent evolution of the black hole (BH)-stellar mass (M_BH-M<sub>&ast;</sub>) relation in the early Universe, while remaining consistent the BH-dynamical mass (M_BH-M_dyn) relation. We predict BH masses for z&gt;3 galaxies in the high-resolution THESAN-ZOOM simulations by assuming the M_BH-M_dyn relation is fundamental. Even without live BH modelling, our approach reproduces the JWST-observed M_BH distribution, including overmassive BHs relative to the local M_BH-M<sub>&ast;</sub> relation. We find that M_BH/M<sub>&ast;</sub> declines with M<sub>&ast;</sub>, evolving from ~0.1 at M<sub>&ast;</sub>=10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> to ~0.01 at M<sub>&ast;</sub>=10^10.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. This trend reflects the dark matter (f_DM) and gas fractions (f_gas), which decrease with M<sub>&ast;</sub> but show little redshift evolution down to z=3, resulting in small M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M_dyn ratios and thus overmassive BHs in low-mass galaxies. We use ttProspector-derived stellar masses and star-formation rates to infer f_gas across 48,022 galaxies in JADES at 3&lt;z&lt;9, finding excellent agreement with our simulation. Our results demonstrate that overmassive BHs would naturally result from a fundamental M_BH-M_dyn relation and be typical of the gas-rich, dark matter-dominated nature of low-mass, high-redshift galaxies. Such overmassive, rapidly growing BHs may strongly influence the earliest stages of galaxy formation.

### 41) [2506.13858](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13858v1): Not-quite-primordial black holes

<p> Wenzer Qin, Soubhik Kumar, Priyamvada Natarajan, Neal Weiner </p>
<p>
We propose a new mechanism for the formation of seeds of supermassive black holes at early cosmic epochs. Enhanced density fluctuations with amplitudes that are not large enough to form primordial black holes post-inflation can still lead to collapsed dark matter halos at very early times. For halos forming prior to 1+z ≈ 200, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is energetic enough to suppress the formation of molecular hydrogen, hence preventing cooling and fragmentation, as a consequence of which baryons falling into the potential well of the halo may undergo "direct collapse" into a black hole. We show using a few illustrative models how this mechanism may account for the abundance of high-redshift black holes inferred from observations by the James Webb Space Telescope while remaining consistent with current limits from CMB spectral distortions. Limits on the primordial power spectrum are also derived by requiring that the universe not reionize too early.

We present 21 infrared transients found in our three-epoch, four-band NIRCam observations covering 14.16 arcmin<sup>2</sup> in the Spitzer IRAC Dark Field (IDF), taken by the JWST Prime Extragalactic Areas for Reionization and Lensing Science (PEARLS) program in Cycle 1 with a time cadence of ~6 months. A separate HST program provided complementary ACS optical imaging contemporaneous with the second and third epochs of the NIRCam observations. Spectroscopic identifications were carried out for three transients using the NIRSpec instrument. One of them was confirmed to be a Type Ia supernova at z=1.63, while the other two had their host galaxies identified at z=2.64 and 1.90, respectively. Combining these redshifts with the photometric redshifts of the host galaxies in the rest of the sample, we find that the transients are either in a "mid-z" group at z&gt;1.6 with M_V &lt; -16.0 mag or a "low-z" group at z&lt;0.4 with M_H &gt; -14.0 mag. The mid-z transients are consistent with various types of supernovae. In contrast, by their luminosities, the low-z transients fall in the range of the so-called "gap transients'' between those of supernovae and classical novae. While they might contain some known types of gap transients (e.g., supernova impostors and luminous red novae), there could also be new kinds of transients. To reveal their nature, we will need a long-term, multi-band NIRCam monitoring program with a higher cadence and prompt NIRSpec follow-up spectroscopy. Being in the continuous viewing zone of the JWST, the IDF is an ideal field for such a future program.

<p>
We report the discovery of a little red dot (LRD), dubbed BiRD ('big red dot'), at z=2.33 in the field around the z=6.3 quasar SDSSJ1030+0524. Using NIRCam images, we identified it as a bright outlier in the F200W-F356W color vs F356W magnitude diagram of point sources in the field. The NIRCam/WFSS spectrum reveals the emission from HeI&lambda; 10830 and PaG line, both showing a narrow and a broad (FWHM≳ 2000 kms<sup>-1</sup>) component. The HeI line is affected by an absorption feature, tracing dense gas with HeI column density in the 2^3S level N~ 0.5-1.2× 10^14cm<sup>2</sup>, depending on the location of the absorber, which is outflowing at the speed of &Delta; v ~ -830 kms<sup>-1</sup>. As observed in the majority of LRDs, BiRD does not show X-ray or radio emission. The BH mass and the bolometric luminosity, both inferred from the PaG broad component, amount to M_BH~ 10^8M<sub>&odot;</sub> and L_bol~ 2.9× 10^45ergs<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Intriguingly, BiRD presents strict analogies with other two LRDs spectroscopically confirmed at cosmic noon, GN-28074 ("Rosetta Stone") at z=2.26 and RUBIES-BLAGN-1 at z=3.1. The blueshifted HeI absorption detected in all three sources suggests that gas outflows may be common in LRDs. We derive a first estimate of the space density of LRDs at z&lt;3 based on JWST data, as a function of L_bol and BH mass. The space density is only a factor of ~ 2-3 lower than that of UV-selected quasars with comparable L_bol and z, meaning that the contribution of LRDs to the broader AGN population is also relevant at cosmic noon. A similar trend is also observed in terms of BH masses. If, as suggested by recent theories, LRDs probe the very first and rapid growth of black hole seeds, our finding may suggest that the formation of black hole seeds remains efficient at least up to cosmic noon.

<p>
The gas-phase metallicity gradients of galaxies have been extensively studied over the past four decades both in the local and high-redshift universe, as they trace the baryon cycle and growth of galaxies. With the unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), it is now possible to measure metallicity and its radial gradients out to redshifts as high as z = 9. Here, we present a sample of 456 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies from redshifts 1.5 ≲ z ≲ 9 that are spatially resolved on sub-kiloparsec (kpc) scales by deep JWST NIRCam or NIRISS Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS). Synthesizing these new JWST observations with legacy observations from the literature, we observe that at redshift z &gt; 5, galaxy centers are more metal-rich, exhibiting negative metallicity gradients of ~-0.4 dex kpc^-1. These gradients flatten over time, reaching near-zero around z ≈ 2, coinciding with the peak of the cosmic star formation rate. Beyond this point, the gradients become negative again at lower redshifts approaching z=0. This evolution likely reflects transitions in galaxy formation modes: an inside-out growth phase dominated by intense central star formation with inefficient feedback and limited gas mixing during "cosmic dawn", enhanced gas mixing due to feedback-driven wind and gas accretion at "cosmic noon", and a later phase of slow evolution and reduced feedback toward the present day. These physical processes including gas accretion and feedback not only regulate star and galaxy formation on cosmic scale, but also shape the evolutionary pathways of individual galaxies over cosmic time.

### 45) [2506.12130](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12130v1): Biases in stellar masses of JWST high-z quasar host galaxies caused by quasar subtraction

<p> Sabrina Berger, Madeline A. Marshall, J. Stuart B. Wyithe, Tiziana di Matteo, Yueying Ni, Stephen M. Wilkins, Minghao Yue </p>
<p>
JWST has enabled a new era of understanding high-z galaxy and black hole evolution with more than 30 high-z quasar host galaxy detections. Many of these observations imply galaxies with black holes that are overmassive compared to their low-z counterparts. However, the bright quasar point source removal may cause significant biases in these stellar mass measurements. We develop a simulation-based inference method to disentangle the quasar host galaxy stellar mass measurements from observational biases during the point source removal. We use the BlueTides simulation to generate mock images and perform point source removal on thousands of simulated high-z quasar host galaxies, constructing corrected host magnitude posteriors. We find that JWST photometry tends to either correctly recover or modestly misestimate host magnitudes, with a maximum magnitude underestimate of 0.21 mag. With our corrected magnitude posteriors, we perform SED fitting on each quasar host galaxy and compare the stellar mass measurement before and after the correction. We find that stellar mass estimates are generally robust, or overestimated by ≤0.3 dex. We also find that the stellar masses of a subset of hosts (J1120+0641, J0844-0132, J0911+0152, and J1146-0005) remain unconstrained, as key photometric bands provide only flux upper limits. Understanding these biases is essential to uncovering the evolutionary pathways of high-z quasars with their hosts.

<p>
Uncovering bright quasars' host galaxies at cosmic noon is challenging because of the high contrast between the quasar and its host and redshifted light, making them primarily visible in the infrared. We present JWST NIRSpec integral field unit (IFU) observations of six extremely red quasars (ERQs) at z=2.4-2.9 and two dust-obscured quasars at lower redshifts. Using image decomposition across the spectral range, we successfully separate quasar and host galaxy continuum emission, model host morphologies, and extract spectra. The ERQs and obscured quasars have compact host galaxies with half-light radii of 1.4-2.9 kpc and stellar masses of 10^10.6-10.9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Their stellar masses are consistent with the average stellar mass of quasar hosts as expected from abundance matching and clustering analysis. Most of the quasars in our sample exhibit significant spatial offsets (0.4-1.3 kpc) between the quasar and host galaxy, potentially caused by post-merger dynamics or non-uniform dust obscuration. The ERQs reside 0.5-2 dex above the local black hole-stellar mass relation, similar to other heavily obscured populations such as HotDOGs, optically selected quasars at cosmic noon, and high-redshift SMBH candidates identified with JWST. However, this "over-massive" feature might be attributed to selection bias. Compared to HST-based studies, our JWST measurements reveal more compact host galaxies, smaller Sersic indices, and lower stellar masses, likely because of improved resolution, more accurate modeling, and minimal line contamination. These findings highlight the unique capabilities of JWST IFU in revealing quasar host galaxy properties and potential evolutionary stages of obscured quasars at cosmic noon.

<p>
The formation of the first stars and galaxies marked the onset of cosmic structure and chemical enrichment, yet direct observations of such primordial systems remain elusive. Here we present James Webb Space Telescope spectroscopic observations of LAP1-B, an ultra-faint galaxy at redshift z<sub>spec</sub>=6.625 +/-0.001, corresponding to a cosmic age of 800 million years after the Big Bang, strongly magnified by gravitational lensing. LAP1-B exhibits a gas-phase oxygen abundance of (4.2 +/- 1.8) x 10^-3 times the solar value, making it the most chemically primitive galaxy ever identified at any epoch to date. The galaxy displays an exceptionally hard ionizing radiation field, which is inconsistent with chemically enriched stellar populations or accreting black holes, but consistent with theoretical predictions for zero-metallicity stars. It also shows an elevated carbon-to-oxygen abundance ratio for its metallicity in the interstellar medium, matching nucleosynthetic yields expected from stellar population formed in the absence of initial metals. The lack of detectable stellar continuum constrains the stellar mass to &lt;2700 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, while the dynamical mass, derived from emission-line kinematics, exceeds the combined stellar and gas mass by more than two orders of magnitude, indicating the presence of a dominant dark matter halo. These observations establish LAP1-B as the most chemically primitive star-forming galaxy yet identified, offering a rare window into the earliest stages of galaxy formation.

<p>
The study of high-redshift galaxies provides critical insights into the early stages of cosmic evolution, particularly during the so-called 'cosmic noon', when star formation activity reached its peak. Within this context, the origin of the nebular emission remains an open question. In this work, we conduct a systematic, multi-wavelength investigation of a sample of z ~ 2-4 emitters from the MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field surveys, utilising both MUSE and JWST/NIRSpec data and extending the sample presented by previous studies. We derive gas-phase metallicities and key physical properties, including electron densities, temperatures and the production rates of hydrogen- and He+-ionising photons. Our results suggest that a combination of factors-such as stellar mass, initial mass function, stellar metallicity, and stellar multiplicity-likely contributes to the origin of the observed nebular emission. Specifically, for our galaxies with higher gas-phase metallicity (12 + log(O/H) &gt; 7.55), we find that models for binary population with Salpeter IMF (Mup=100 Msol) and stellar metallicity ~ 0.001 (i.e., similar to that of the gas) can reproduce the observed ionising conditions. However at lower metallicities, models for binary population with `top-heavy' initial mass function (Mup = 300 Msol) and Zstar much lower &lt; Zstar) than that of the gas are required to fully account for the observed ionising photon production. These results reinforce that the ionisation keeps challenging current stellar populations, and the ionisation problem persists in the very low metallicity regime.

### 49) [2506.11601](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11601v1): Unveiling a Population of Strong Galaxy-Galaxy Lensed Faint Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies

<p>
The measurements of the number density of galaxy-galaxy strong lenses can be used to put statistical constraints on the foreground mass distributions. Dusty galaxies uncovered in submillimeter surveys are particularly useful in this regard because of the large volume probed by these surveys. Previous discoveries of strong galaxy-galaxy lensed dusty galaxies are predominantly the brightest in the sky discovered by Herschel, SPT, and Planck. However, models have also predicted a non-negligible fraction of strong galaxy-galaxy lensed faint dusty galaxies, which were difficult to confirm due to technical difficulties. Utilizing the deepest SCUBA-2 submillimeter survey, STUDIES, in both the COSMOS and the UDS fields, together with a red JWST color selection method, we discover a population of 13 strong galaxy-galaxy lensed faint dusty galaxies. The rich ancillary data allow us to confirm their strongly lensed nature via estimates of redshifts and lens modeling. Our systematic search has allowed us to construct the 450&mu;m number counts of strongly lensed sources down to the flux levels about an order of magnitude fainter than previous measurements. The measured lensing fractions of ~1% are consistent with predictions from models that also successfully produce the number density of the strong galaxy-galaxy lensed bright dusty galaxies. Future searches from Euclid and Roman are expected to discover orders of magnitude more strongly lensed faint dusty galaxies.

### 50) [2506.11233](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11233v1): Primordial black holes in cosmological simulations: growth prospects for supermassive black holes

<p> Lewis R. Prole, John A. Regan, Daxal Mehta, Peter Coles, Pratika Dayal </p>
<p>
It has long been suggested that a fraction of the dark matter in the Universe could exist in the form of primordial black holes (PBHs) that have existed since the radiation dominated era. Recent studies have suggested that these PBHs may be the progenitors to the population of high-redshift, supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed since the launch of JWST. For the first time, we have included PBHs in cosmological simulations, to test whether PBHs can sink to the center of collapsing halos, locate dense gaseous regions experience significant growth. We tested PBH-to-DM mass ratios of f_PBH = 10^-4 and 10^-3, with an initial PBH mass of 1000 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, as inspired by recent observational constraints. We find that at f_PBH = 10^-3, a number of PBHs were able to embed themselves in dense gas and grow to 10^4-10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> by z=20. These intermediate black holes (IMBHs) are possible progenitors to the highest redshift SMBH observations such as GNZ-11 (10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> by z=10), outperforming light seed black hole (BH) growth seen in recent simulations without the need to invoke heavy seeding prescriptions. On the other hand, f_PBH = 10^-4 resulted in no significant BH growth, emphasizing that the ability of PBHs to act as SMBH seeds is sensitive to the true value of f_PBH in the Universe, and showing that the f_PBH =10^-4-10^-3 boundary marks the threshold above which SMBH seeding via 1000 M<sub>&odot;</sub> PBHs becomes effective. This is the first step towards building a realistic PBH framework in cosmological simulations.

### 51) [2506.11207](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11207v2): JWST lens model for A370: A very low dark matter fraction for a brightest cluster galaxy and lensing properties for the Dragon arc

<p> Jose M. Diego, Fengwu Sun, Jose M. Palencia, Xiaojing Lin, Marceau Limousin, Rachel Gledhill, Anna Niemiec, Wenlei Chen, Rogier A. Windhorst, Mitchell F. Struble, Tom Broadhurst </p>
<p>
We present a new lens model for the z=0.375 galaxy cluster Abell 370 based on previously spectroscopically confirmed lensed galaxies and new lensed systems identified in JWST data, including recent data from the MAGNIF program. Based on the best models able to reproduce two radial arcs near the BCGs, we compare the stellar mass to the total mass from the lens model and find that the fraction of dark matter in the south BCG is consistent with &Lambda;CDM while in the north BCG we find a very small amount of dark matter, more consistent with alternative models to &Lambda;CDM. We discuss possible causes for this and conclude that additional data is needed to clarify the situation. We study the lensing properties, magnification, time delay and strength of the critical curve, along the Dragon arc, where previous studies have reported tens of alleged microlensing events from supergiant stars at z=0.7251. The new lens model is able to reproduce the distribution of microlensing events with great accuracy. Some of the microlensing events may be reinterpreted as long-period Cepheid in future observations. We consider this possibility and study in more detail the challenges for such detection from intervening microlenses.

<p>
Galaxy mergers play a critical role in driving galaxy evolution, especially by transforming galaxy morphology, redistributing the gas around galaxies, triggering AGN activity and star formation. We present the Cosmic Owl, a galaxy merger at z=1.14, identified in the COSMOS field. Deep imaging and spectroscopy from JWST, ALMA, and VLA reveal a complex system of twin collisional ring galaxies, exhibiting a nearly identical morphology. The grism spectra from the JWST COSMOS-3D program confirm that both galaxies host an AGN. A bipolar radio jet from one AGN extends to strike the merging front. In addition, we detect a starburst at the merging front, characterized by luminous extended nebular line emission and a massive cold gas reservoir. This starburst is likely triggered by interstellar shocks induced by galaxy collision and the AGN jet. The twin ring structure of the Cosmic Owl requires further numerical simulations to clarify the precise conditions that lead to the formation of this rare morphology. This system exemplifies how shock-induced star formation, driven by galaxy collision or AGN jet, can act as a previously underappreciated yet crucial mechanism for efficient gas-to-star conversion and rapid stellar mass assembly in the early Universe.

### 53) [2506.10063](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10063v1): Time-scales of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and dust continuum emission from gas clouds compared to molecular gas cloud lifetimes in PHANGS-JWST galaxies

<p>
Recent JWST mid-infrared (mid-IR) images, tracing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and dust continuum emission, provide detailed views of the interstellar medium (ISM) in nearby galaxies. Leveraging PHANGS-JWST Cycle 1 and PHANGS-MUSE data, we measure the PAH and dust continuum emission lifetimes of gas clouds across 17 nearby star-forming galaxies by analyzing the relative spatial distributions of mid-IR (7.7-11.3&mu;m) and H&alpha; emission at various scales. We find that the mid-IR emitting time-scale of gas clouds in galaxy disks (excluding centers) ranges from 10 to 30Myr. After star formation is detected in H&alpha;, mid-IR emission persists for 3-7Myr during the stellar feedback phase, covering 70-80% of the H&alpha; emission. This significant overlap is due to intense radiation from star-forming regions, illuminating the surrounding PAHs and dust grains. In most galaxies, the mid-IR time-scale closely matches the molecular cloud lifetime measured with CO. Although mid-IR emission is complex as influenced by ISM distribution, radiation, and abundances of dust and PAHs, the similarity between the two time-scales suggests that once gas clouds form with compact mid-IR emission, they quickly provide sufficient shielding for stable CO formation. This is likely due to our focus on molecular gas-rich regions of galaxies with near-solar metallicity. Finally, we find that the mid-IR emitting time-scale is longer in galaxies with well-defined HII regions and less structured backgrounds, allowing photons to more efficiently heat the ambient ISM surrounding the HII regions, rather than contributing to diffuse emission. This suggests that the shape of the ISM also influences mid-IR emission.

### 54) [2506.08995](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08995v1): Investigating the physical properties of dusty star-forming galaxies at z≥1.5 in the GOODS-South field using JWST

<p> Dipanjan Mitra, Mattia Negrello, Gianfranco De Zotti </p>
<p>
We investigated how well the physical properties of progenitors of present-day massive spheroidal galaxies (proto-spheroids) can be constrained by the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) in the GOODS-South field, which benefits from extensive photometric and spectroscopic data, including those from the Hubble, Spitzer and Herschel. We adopted a physical model for the evolution of proto-spheroidal galaxies, which form the bulk of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at z≥1.5 and confirmed its consistency with recent mid-infrared high-z galaxy luminosity functions. Using the model and the JADES survey strategy, we simulated a sample of proto-spheroids over 87.5 arcmin<sup>2</sup>, matching the JADES/GOODS-S survey area. Photometric redshifts estimated from simulated JWST photometry showed ≥95% accuracy and were used in SED fitting with CIGALE. We demonstrated that JWST will provide reliable stellar mass estimates up to 0.1 dex for the majority of proto-spheroids at z≥1.5 and can detect low-mass systems during cosmic noon that were inaccessible in the pre-JWST era. Focusing on the active star-forming phase of the proto-spheroid evolution, we defined a sub-sample flux limited at 250 micron (DSFG sample) and derived SFR, dust luminosity and dust mass complementing the JWST photometry with that from Spitzer/MIPS and Herschel. We also constructed a JWST-selected DSFG catalog from ASTRODEEP data using NIRCam colour criteria and demonstrated strong consistency between the observed and simulated DSFG populations.

### 55) [2506.08969](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08969v1): A New Spectral Class of Brown Dwarfs at the Bottom of the IMF in IC 348

<p> K. L. Luhman, C. Alves de Oliveira </p>
<p>
In a previous study, we used JWST to identify three new brown dwarfs in the center of a nearby star-forming cluster, IC 348. The faintest object had an estimated mass of 3-4 M_Jup, making it a contender for the least massive brown dwarf confirmed with spectroscopy. Two of the new brown dwarfs also exhibited absorption features from an unidentified aliphatic hydrocarbon, which were not predicted by atmospheric models and were not previously detected in atmospheres outside of the solar system. We have used JWST to perform a deeper survey for brown dwarfs across a larger field in IC 348. We have identified 39 brown dwarf candidates in NIRCam images and have obtained spectra for 15 of them with NIRSpec, nine of which are classified as substellar members of the cluster. The faintest new members have mass estimates of ~2 M_Jup, providing a new constraint on the minimum mass of the IMF. Two new members (~2 and 10 M_Jup) exhibit large excess emission from circumstellar disks, demonstrating that they harbor the raw materials for planet formation. Finally, eight of the nine new brown dwarfs and one known member that is newly observed with NIRSpec show the aforementioned hydrocarbon features. Among the total of 11 brown dwarfs in IC 348 that have hydrocarbon detections, the features are stronger at fainter magnitudes, indicating that the hydrocarbon is a natural constituent of the atmospheres of the coolest newborn brown dwarfs. We propose a new spectral class "H" that is defined by the presence of the 3.4 &mu;m fundamental band of the hydrocarbon.

### 56) [2506.08508](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08508v1): Pickles on FIRE: The 3D Shape Evolution of Simulated Milky Way-Mass Galaxies

<p> Luke Y. Xia, Courtney Klein, James S. Bullock, Michael Boylan-Kolchin, Vincent Caudillo, Jorge Moreno, Francisco J. Mercado, Robert Feldmann </p>
<p>
JWST and HST observations have revealed numerous elongated, pickle-shaped galaxies at high to intermediate redshifts, with masses close to those expected for Milky Way progenitors. Here we use reduced-mass eigentensors to quantify the ellipsoidal shape evolution of thirteen Milky Way-mass galaxies simulated using FIRE-2 physics; all but one form disks at z=0. We find that all of our Milky Way progenitors go through phases when they are elongated. They often oscillate between spheroidal and elongated shapes in the early Universe over billion-year timescales. This is true whether we measure shapes weighted on stellar mass or luminosity, though the luminosity shapes show more extreme elongation and variance. In contrast, the stellar populations of our z=0 Milky Way analogs are never elongated and always symmetric about their minor axes. The youngest stars at z=0 reside in thin disks, intermediate-age stars reside in thick disks, and the oldest stars reside in flattened spheroids that are symmetric about their minor axes. Despite their symmetric shapes at z=0, the old and intermediate age stellar populations were often arranged in the shape of elongated pickles or triaxial spheroids at the time they formed, meaning that these populations changed shape significantly over time. Our results suggest that observed elongated galaxies seen in the early Universe are not stable structures, but rather reflect transitory phases of galaxy evolution.

### 57) [2506.08268](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08268v1): The Evolution Of Rotating Supermassive Pop III Stars On The Main Sequence

<p> Devesh Nandal, Gaël Buldgen, Daniel J. Whalen, John Regan, Tyrone E. Woods, Jonathan C. Tan </p>
<p>
The detection of billion-solar-mass supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the first billion years of cosmic history challenges conventional theories of black hole formation and growth. Simultaneously, recent JWST observations revealing exceptionally high nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratios in galaxies at high redshifts raise critical questions about rapid chemical enrichment mechanisms operating in the early universe. Supermassive stars (SMSs) with masses of 1000 to 10000 M<sub>&odot;</sub> are promising candidates to explain these phenomena, but existing models have so far neglected the pivotal role of stellar rotation. Here, we present the first comprehensive evolutionary models of rotating Pop III SMSs computed using the GENEC stellar evolution code, including detailed treatments of rotation-induced chemical mixing, angular momentum transport, and mass loss driven by the &Omega;\Gamma limit. We demonstrate that rotation significantly enlarges the convective core and extends stellar lifetimes by up to 20%, with moderate enhancement of mass-loss rates as stars approach critical rotation thresholds. Our results further indicate that the cores of SMSs rotate relatively slowly (below ~ 200 km s<sup>-1</sup>), resulting in dimensionless spin parameters a* &lt; 0.1 for intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) remnants that are notably lower than theoretical maximum spins. These findings highlight rotation as a key factor in determining the structural evolution, chemical yields, and black hole spin properties of SMSs, providing critical insights to interpret observational signatures from the high-redshift universe.

### 58) [2506.08116](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08116v1): The properties of primordially-seeded black holes and their hosts in the first billion years: implications for JWST

<p> Pratika Dayal, Roberto maiolino </p>
<p>
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have opened a tantalising new window onto possible black holes as early as redshifts of z ~ 10.4. These show a number of puzzling properties including unexpectedly massive black holes in place by z ~ 10 and inexplicably high black hole-to-stellar mass ratios of M_BH/M_*≥ 0.1. These pose a serious challenge for "astrophysical" seeding and growth models that we aim to explain with "cosmological" primordial black holes (PBHs) in this work. We present PHANES, an analytic framework that follows the evolution of dark matter halos, and their baryons in the first billion years, seeded by a population of PBHs with seed masses between 10^0.5-10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. PBH seeded models yield a black hole mass function that extends between 10^1.25-11.25 ~(10^0.75-7.25)M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z ~ 5 (15) for the different models considered in this work. Interestingly, PBH-seeded models (with spin s=0 or -1) naturally result in extremely high values of M_BH/M_*≥ 0.25 at z ~ 5-15. For a typical stellar mass of M_* =10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, we find an average value of M_BH/M_* ~ 0.4~ (1.6) for s=0~(-1) at z=5, providing a smoking gun for PBH-seeded models. Another particularity of PBH-seeded models is their ability of producing systems with high black hole-to-stellar mass ratios that are extremely metal poor (Z ≤ 10^-2~Z<sub>&odot;</sub>). Yielding a PBH-to-dark matter fraction ≤ 10^-9 and a stellar mass function that lies four orders of magnitude below observations, our model is in accord with all current cosmological and astrophysical bounds.

<p>
We present the first gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxy with a measured absorption line and electron temperature (T_e) based metallicity, using the temperature sensitive [OIII]&lambda;4363 auroral line detected in the JWST/NIRSpec spectrum of the host of GRB 050505 at redshift z=4.28. We find that the metallicity of the cold interstellar gas, derived from the absorption lines in the GRB afterglow, of 12 + log(O/H)~ 7.7 is in reasonable agreement with the temperature-based emission line metallicity in the warm gas of the GRB host galaxy, which has values of 12 + log(O/H) = 7.80±0.19 and 7.96±0.21 for two common indicators. When using strong emission line diagnostics appropriate for high-z galaxies and sensitive to ionisation parameter, we find good agreement between the strong emission line metallicity and the other two methods. Our results imply that, for the host of GRB050505, mixing between the warm and the cold ISM along the line of sight to the GRB is efficient, and that GRB afterglow absorption lines can be a reliable tracer of the metallicity of the galaxy. If confirmed with a large sample, this suggest that metallicities determined via GRB afterglow spectroscopy can be used to trace cosmic chemical evolution to the earliest cosmic epochs and in galaxies far too faint for emission line spectroscopy, even for JWST.

### 60) [2506.08077](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08077v1): JWST interferometric imaging reveals the dusty disk obscuring the supermassive black hole of the Circinus galaxy

<p>
The dusty and molecular torus is one of the most elusive structures surrounding supermassive black holes, yet its importance is unequivocal for understanding feedback and accretion mechanisms. The torus and accretion disk feed the inspiraling gas onto the supermassive black hole (SMBH) and launch outflows, fundamentally connecting the SMBH activity to the host galaxy. This scenario situates the torus as the interface between the AGN and its host galaxy with a flow cycle of molecular gas and dust of a few parsecs in size. Here, we utilize a novel aperture-masking interferometric mode onboard the JWST, achieving twice the previously possible resolution, and bringing out the fainter features that clearly show the torus being the critical interface for feeding material from galaxy scales into the SMBH. We also identify that &lt;1% of the emission arises from an arc structure composed of hot dust entrained in a molecular and ionized outflow. The rest of the emission, 12%, is associated with dust heated by the AGN and/or radio-jet at large scales. Combined with continuum data, gas tracers, and torus models, our study shows that most of the dust mass is located in the equatorial axis in the form of a disk feeding the AGN.

<p> Prajwel Joseph </p>
<p>
Galikyan et al. (2025) reported a statistically significant change in galaxy spectral properties at redshift z ≃ 2.7 based on a Kolmogorov analysis of JWST spectroscopic data of galaxies. In this comment, we demonstrate that their result is critically driven by a single outlier in the dataset. This outlier arises from the use of a questionable redshift estimate for one spectrum. When the outlier is removed or the redshift is corrected, the claimed transition at z ≃ 2.7 disappears entirely. By independently reproducing their analysis, we demonstrate that the claimed feature is not a robust statistical signal, but an artefact of this anomalous data point.

He II &lambda;1640 emission in galaxies indicates the presence of sources that produce extreme ionizing photons. Here, we report the discovery of a He II &lambda;1640 emitting galaxy, GNHeII J1236+6215, at z= 2.9803 in the GOODS-north field. We use photometry in 17 wavebands from near-UV to infrared to characterize the galaxy SED and combine Keck LRIS and JWST NIRSpec spectra to identify 15 emission lines including He II &lambda;1640. We infer that the He^+ ionization in the galaxy could be driven by small pockets of young Population III stars or low-metallicity Very Massive Stars (VMSs) rather than AGN or metal-rich Wolf-Rayet stars. The galaxy has a highly ionized ISM ([OIII]5007/[OII]3727 = 7.28±0.11, [SIII]/[SII] = 1.97±0.48 and detected Ly&alpha;, H&alpha;, H&beta;, H&gamma; lines), little reddening by dust (E(B-V) = 0.04±0.12), low metallicity (12 + log(O/H) = 7.85±0.22), and high star formation rate (SFR_SED = 12.2±2.0 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1). In addition to these ISM conditions, we also notice a significant [SII] deficiency ([SII]6718,6732/H&alpha; = 0.08±0.02, &Delta;[SII] = -0.12) which may indicate the presence of density-bounded optically thin H~II regions that combined with the low dust extinction favor leaking of ionizing Lyman continuum (LyC) photons. Our best-fit SED model also infers a high nebular ionization (log U = -2.0) and a low stellar mass M = 7.8±3.1×10^8M<sub>&odot;</sub>. This discovery not only adds one important object to the known sample of high-redshift He~II emitters but also highlights a potential connection between He^+ ionization and favorable ISM conditions for the leakage of ionizing photons from galaxies.

### 63) [2506.06418](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06418v1): The Identification of Two JWST/NIRCam-Dark Starburst Galaxies at z=6.6 with ALMA

<p>
We analyze two dusty star-forming galaxies at z=6.6. These galaxies are selected from the ASPIRE survey, a JWST Cycle-1 medium and ALMA Cycle-9 large program targeting 25 quasars and their environments at z≃6.5 - 6.8. These galaxies are identified as companions to UV-luminous quasars and robustly detected in ALMA continuum and [C II] emission, yet they are extraordinarily faint at the NIRCam wavelengths (down to &gt;28.0 AB mag in the F356W band). They are more obscured than galaxies like Arp220, and thus we refer to them as "NIRCam-dark" starburst galaxies (star formation rate ≃ 80 - 250 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1). Such galaxies are typically missed by (sub)-millimeter blank-field surveys. From the star-formation history (SFH), we show that the NIRCam-dark galaxies are viable progenitors of massive quiescent galaxies at z≳4 and descendants of UV-luminous galaxies at z&gt;10. Although it is hard to constrain their number density from a quasar survey, we conclude that NIRCam-dark galaxies can be as abundant as n~10^-5.5 Mpc^-3 assuming a light halo occupation model. If true, this would equal to ~30% of the number densities of both the quiescent galaxies at z≳4 and UV-luminous galaxies at z&gt;10. We further predict that analogs at z~8 should exist according to the SFH of early massive quiescent galaxies. However, they may fall below the current detection limits of wide JWST and ALMA surveys, thus remaining "JWST-dark". To fully trace the evolution of massive galaxies and dust-obscured cosmic star formation at z≳8, wide-field JWST/NIRCam imaging and slitless spectroscopic surveys of early protoclusters are essential.

### 64) [2506.06171](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06171v1): Primordial Black Holes and the First Stars

<p> Julia Monika Koulen, Stefano Profumo, Nolan Smyth </p>
<p>
Primordial black holes (PBHs) constitute a compelling dark matter candidate whose gravitational effects could significantly influence early cosmic structure formation. We investigate the impact of PBHs on Population III star formation through detailed N-body and hydrodynamic simulations, extending beyond previous semi-analytical approaches. Our results reveal a mass-dependent dichotomy in PBH effects: massive PBHs (M_PBH ≳ 10^2 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) with sufficient abundance can accelerate structure formation and shift Pop III formation to higher redshifts, potentially conflicting with observational constraints from high-redshift galaxy surveys. Conversely, lower-mass PBHs can induce tidal disruption of gas-rich minihalos, suppressing star formation and delaying the cosmic dawn depending on their abundance. We quantify these competing effects to derive new constraints on the PBH mass function and their contribution to the total dark matter density, with implications for forthcoming observations with the James Webb Space Telescope and 21-cm cosmology experiments.

### 65) [2506.06139](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06139v2): Impact of initial mass function on the chemical evolution of high-redshift galaxies

<p>
Star formation and metal enrichment in galaxies are regulated by supernova (SN) explosions and metal yields from massive stars, which are sensitive to the high-mass end of the initial mass function (IMF). Recent JWST observations found evidence for an invariant relation between stellar mass, metallicity, and star formation rate up to z~ 8 and its breakdown at higher redshifts. It is crucial to understand the underlying physics, especially the role played by the IMF. We explore the impact of IMF on the chemical evolution of high-redshift galaxies and the interplay between IMF and galactic outflow parameters. The ultimate goal is to constrain the high-mass end of the IMF by the cosmic star formation history and stellar mass-metallicity-star formation rate relation (MZSFR) inferred from observations at z~ 4-10. Using the semi-analytical galaxy evolution code A-SLOTH, we follow galactic baryon cycles along merger trees built from a high-resolution cosmological simulation. Stellar feedback is modeled with up-to-date stellar evolution tracks covering the full metallicity range (Z ~ 10^-11 - 0.03) and a broad stellar mass range (m<sub>&sext;</sub>~2 - 600 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) including the metal yields from stellar winds and all types of SNe. Assuming a Kroupa-like shape of the IMF with a varying upper mass limit m_\max, we find m_\max ≳ 200 M<sub>&odot;</sub> is required to reproduce the observed MZSFR. Observational data at z≳ 6 favor a galactic outflow model where the outflow rate is proportional to the supernova energy injection rate divided by the halo binding energy. We conclude that very massive (≳ 200 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) stars can play important roles in the star formation and chemical enrichment histories of high-z galaxies and discuss the implications of our results for reionization and transient sources of both electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves.

### 66) [2506.05470](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05470v1): Probing neutral outflows in z ~ 2 galaxies using JWST observations of Ca II H and K absorption lines

<p>
Using deep JWST/NIRSpec spectra from the Blue Jay survey, we perform the first systematic investigation of neutral gas content in massive galaxies at Cosmic Noon based on the Ca II H, K absorption lines. We analyze a sample of 9 galaxies at 1.8 &lt; z &lt; 2.8 with stellar masses &gt; 10.6, for which we detect neutral gas absorption both in Ca II and in Na I. After removing the stellar continuum using the best-fit model obtained with Prospector, we fit the excess absorption due to neutral gas in the Ca II H, K doublet and in the Na I D doublet, together with nearby emission lines produced by ionized gas. We measure covering fractions between 0.2 and 0.9 from the Ca II H and K lines, which are spectrally well resolved in the NIRSpec R ~ 1000 observations, unlike the absorption lines in the Na I D doublet. We measure the velocity shift, velocity dispersion, and column density separately for Ca II and Na I. About half of the galaxies present blueshifted Ca II, indicative of an outflow of neutral gas, consistent with previous results based on Na I. The velocity shift and the column density measured from Ca II are correlated with those measured from Na I, implying that these absorption lines trace gas in similar physical conditions. However, the column densities are not in a 1:1 relation, meaning that the relative amount of Ca II and Na I atoms along the line of sight varies with the gas column density. After discussing possible reasons for this behavior, we derive an empirical relation between the column density of Ca II and the column density of Na I and, in a more indirect way, of neutral hydrogen H I. This calibration offers a new way to estimate the outflow mass and the mass outflow rate for the neutral phase from current and future JWST observations of massive galaxies at Cosmic Noon and beyond

### 67) [2506.05459](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05459v1): RUBIES: A Spectroscopic Census of Little Red Dots; All V-Shaped Point Sources Have Broad Lines

<p>
The physical nature of Little Red Dots (LRDs) - a population of compact, red galaxies revealed by JWST - remains unclear. Photometric samples are constructed from varying selection criteria with limited spectroscopic follow-up available to test intrinsic spectral shapes and prevalence of broad emission lines. We use the RUBIES survey, a large spectroscopic program with wide color-morphology coverage and homogeneous data quality, to systematically analyze the emission-line kinematics, spectral shapes, and morphologies of ~1500 galaxies at z &gt; 3.1. We identify broad Balmer lines via a novel fitting approach that simultaneously models NIRSpec/PRISM and G395M spectra, yielding 80 broad-line sources with 28 (35%) at z &gt; 6. A large subpopulation naturally emerges from the broad Balmer line sources, with 36 exhibiting `v-shaped' UV-to-optical continua and a dominant point source component in the rest-optical; we define these as spectroscopic LRDs, constituting the largest such sample to date. Strikingly, the spectroscopic LRD population is largely recovered when either a broad line or rest-optical point source is required in combination with a v-shaped continuum, suggesting an inherent link between these three defining characteristics. We compare the spectroscopic LRD sample to published photometric searches. Although these selections have high accuracy, down to F444W&lt;26.5, only 50-62% of the RUBIES LRDs were previously identified. The remainder were missed due to a mixture of faint rest-UV photometry, comparatively blue rest-optical colors, or highly uncertain photometric redshifts. Our findings highlight that well-selected spectroscopic campaigns are essential for robust LRD identification, while photometric criteria require refinement to capture the full population.

### 68) [2506.05189](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05189v1): H3+ in irradiated protoplanetary disks: Linking far-ultraviolet radiation and hot water vapor

<p> Javier R. Goicoechea, Octavio Roncero, Evelyne Roueff, John H. Black, Ilane Schroetter, Olivier Berné </p>
<p>
The likely JWST detection of vibrationally excited H3+ emission in the irradiated disk d203-506, reported by Schroetter et al., raises the question of whether cosmic-ray ionization is enhanced in disks within clustered star-forming regions, or if alternative mechanisms contribute to H3+ formation and excitation. We present a detailed model of the photodissociation region (PDR) component of a protoplanetary disk-comprising the outer disk surface and the photoevaporative wind-exposed to strong external far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation. We investigate key gas-phase reactions involving excited H2 that lead to the formation of H3+ in the PDR, including detailed state-to-state dynamical calculations of reactions H2 + HOC+ -&gt; H3+ + CO and H2 + H+ -&gt; H2+ + H. We also consider the effects of photoionization of vibrationally excited H2(v≥4), a process that has not previously been included in disk models. We find that these FUV-driven reactions dominate the formation of H3+ in the PDR of strongly irradiated disks, largely independently of cosmic-ray ionization. The predicted H3+ abundance peaks at x(H3+)~10^-8, coinciding with regions where HOC+ is also abundant. The high abundances of H3+ and HOC+ are ultimately linked to the strength of the external FUV field (G0), the presence of C+, and an enhanced reservoir of hot H2O. The predicted H3+ column densities (~10^13 cm<sup>2</sup>) are consistent with the presence of H3+ in the PDR of irradiated disks. We also find that formation pumping, resulting from exoergic reactions between excited H2 and HOC+, drive the vibrational excitation of H3+. We expect this photochemistry to be highly active in disks where G0 &gt; 10^3. The H3+ formation pathways studied here may also be relevant in the inner disk region (near the host star), in exoplanetary ionospheres, and in the early Universe.

<p>
Most protoplanetary disks experience a phase in which they are subjected to strong ultraviolet radiation from nearby massive stars. This UV radiation can substantially alter their chemistry by producing numerous radicals and molecular ions. In this Letter we present detailed analysis of the JWST-NIRSpec spectrum of the d203-506 obtained as part of the PDRs4All Early Release Science program. Using state-of-the-art spectroscopic data, we searched for species using a multi-molecule fitting tool, PAHTATmol, that we developed for this purpose. Based on this analysis, we report the clear detection of ro-vibrational emission of the CH radical and likely detection of the H_3^+ molecular ion, with estimated abundances of a few times 10^-7 and approximately 10^-8, respectively. The presence of CH is predicted by gas-phase models and well explained by hydrocarbon photochemistry. H_3^+ is usually formed through reactions of H<sub>2</sub> with H<sub>2</sub>^+ originating from cosmic ray ionization of H<sub>2</sub>. However, recent theoretical studies suggest that H_3^+ also forms through UV-driven chemistry in strongly irradiated (G_0&gt;10^3), dense (n_H &gt;10^6 cm^-3) gas. The latter is favored as an explanation for the presence of "hot'' H_3^+ (T_ex≳1000 K) in the outer disk layers of d203-506, coinciding with the emission of FUV-pumped H<sub>2</sub> and other "PDR species'', such as CH^+, CH_3^+, and OH. Our detection of infrared emission from vibrationally excited H_3^+ and CH raises questions about their excitation mechanisms and, underscore that UV radiation can have a profound impact on the chemistry of planet forming disks. They also demonstrate the power of JWST pushing the limit for the detection of elusive species in protoplanetary disks.

### 70) [2506.04819](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04819v1): Model selection using the HII galaxy Hubble diagram

<p> Jun-Jie Wei, Fulvio Melia </p>
<p>
The proposal to use HII galaxies (HIIGx) and giant extragalactic HII regions (GEHR) as standard candles to construct the Hubble diagram at redshifts beyond the current reach of Type Ia supernovae has gained considerable support recently with the addition of five new HIIGx discovered by JWST. The updated sample of 231 sources now extends the redshift range of these objects to z~ 7.5, mapping the Universe's expansion over 95&percnt; of its current age. In this  Letter we use these sources for model selection, and show that the R_h=ct universe is strongly favored by this probe over both flat-&Lambda;CDM and wCDM, with relative Bayesian Information Criterion probabilities of, respectively, 91.8&percnt;, 7.4&percnt; and 0.8&percnt;. A possible caveat with these results, however, is that an unknown dispersion, &sigma;_int, in the HIIGx standard candle relation can weaken the model comparisons. We find that the inclusion of &sigma;_int as an additional, optimizable parameter makes the likelihoods of flat-&Lambda;CDM and R_h=ct about equal, though at the expense of creating ~ 2.5&sigma; tension between our inferred matter density &Omega;_m and its  Planck-optimized value.

### 71) [2506.04350](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04350v1): JWST Insights into Narrow-line Little Red Dots

<p> Zijian Zhang, Linhua Jiang, Weiyang Liu, Luis C. Ho, Kohei Inayoshi </p>
<p>
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a population of red and compact objects with a unique V-shape SED at z ≥ 4 known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Most of the LRDs with existing spectral observations exhibit broad Balmer lines and are thus likely to host active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here we present a study of LRDs with no broad H-alpha component. Our sample consists of five LRDs at z~5 with H-alpha line widths of about 250 km/s. They are selected from 32 LRDs that have NIRSpec high- or medium-resolution grating spectra covering H-alpha. During our construction of the sample, we find that approximately 20 percent of the LRD candidates previously selected do not show red continuum emission but resemble the V-shape spectra due to strong line emission. Compared to normal star-forming galaxies, narrow-line LRDs tend to have relatively higher H-alpha line widths and luminosities. If these LRDs are dominated by galaxies, our SED modeling suggests that they are dusty, compact star-forming galaxies with high stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs). Alternatively, if their SEDs are produced by AGNs, the inferred central black hole masses (MBH) are in the range of 10^5 to 10^6 solar masses, placing them at the low-mass end of the AGN population. They may represent an early stage of super-Eddington growth, where the black holes have yet to accumulate significant masses. With large measurement uncertainties, these black holes appear slightly overmassive relative to the local MBH-Mstar relation, but consistent or undermassive with respect to the MBH-sigma and MBH-Mdyn relations. We further find that nearly half of the high-redshift broad-line AGNs exhibit V-shape SEDs. (abridged)

<p>
The chemical characterization of galaxies in the first billion years after the Big Bang is one of the central goals of current astrophysics. Optical/near-infrared spectroscopy of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been heralded as an effective diagnostic to probe the interstellar medium of their host galaxies and their metal and dust content, up to the highest redshift. An opportunity to fulfill this expectation was provided by the recent blast triggered by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory of GRB 240218A at redshift z=6.782. We study a high-redshift galaxy selected in a complementary way with respect to flux-limited surveys, not depending on galaxy luminosity and stellar mass. We present the VLT/X-shooter spectrum of its afterglow enabling the detection of neutral-hydrogen, low-ionization, high-ionization and fine-structure absorption lines. We determine the metallicity, kinematics and chemical abundance pattern, providing the first detailed characterization of the neutral gas of a galaxy at z&gt;6.5. From the analysis of fine-structure lines we estimate the distance of the closest gas clouds as d_II=620^+230_-140 pc. We determine a high neutral hydrogen column density, log(N(HI)/cm<sup>2</sup>)=22.5±0.3, which is the highest one at z&gt;6 determined so far for a GRB host galaxy, as well as a surprisingly high metal column density, log(N(ZnII)/cm<sup>2</sup>)&gt;14.3. The observed metallicity of the host galaxy system is [Zn/H]&gt;-0.8. We find evidence of a high amount of dust depletion and of aluminum overabundance, although a number of transitions are saturated. The high hydrogen column density, metal abundances and dust depletion in the neutral gas align with those of the ionized gas of very high-redshift galaxies unveiled by ALMA and JWST, testifying that a rapid build up of metals and dust, and massive neutral hydrogen reservoirs seem to be common features of galaxies in the early Universe.

We present an efficient Bayesian SED-fitting framework tailored to multiwavelength pixel photometry from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). Our method employs simulation-based inference to enable rapid posterior sampling across galaxy pixels, leveraging the unprecedented spatial resolution, wavelength coverage, and depth provided by the survey. It is trained on synthetic photometry generated from MILES stellar population models, incorporating both parametric and non-parametric SFHs, realistic noise, and JADES-like filter sensitivity thresholds. We validate this amortised inference approach on mock datasets, achieving robust and well-calibrated posterior distributions, with an R^2 score of 0.99 for stellar mass. Applying our pipeline to real observations, we derive spatially resolved maps of stellar population properties down to S/N_pixel=5 (averaged over F277W, F356W, F444W) for 1083 JADES galaxies and ~2 million pixels with spectroscopic redshifts. These maps enable the identification of dusty or starburst regions and offer insights into mass growth and the structural assembly. We assess the outshining phenomenon by comparing pixel-based and integrated stellar mass estimates, finding limited impact only in low-mass galaxies (&lt;10^8M<sub>&odot;</sub>) but systematic differences of ~0.20 dex linked to SFH priors. With an average posterior sampling speed of 10^-4 seconds per pixel and a total inference time of ~1 CPU-day for the full dataset, our model offers a scalable solution for extracting high-fidelity stellar population properties from HST+JWST datasets, opening the way for statistical studies at sub-galactic scales.

<p> Antti Rantala, Natalia Lahén, Thorsten Naab, Gastón J. Escobar, Giuliano Iorio </p>
<p>
Observations and high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations indicate that massive star clusters form through a complex hierarchical assembly. We use simulations including post-Newtonian dynamics and stellar evolution to investigate this collisional assembly with the \bifrost code coupled to the \sevn stellar evolution module. With a full initial stellar mass function, we study the effect of initial binary and triple stars as well a high initial single star mass limit (450 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) on the hierarchical assembly, structure, and kinematics of massive (M_ cl~10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, N=1.8 × 10^6) star clusters. Simultaneously, intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs), potential seeds for supermassive black holes, can form and grow in our models by stellar collisions, tidal disruption events (TDEs) and black hole (BH) mergers. At a fixed cluster mass, stellar multiplicity or a high mass limit increase the numbers (up to ~ 10) and masses (up to 10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) of the formed IMBHs within the first 10 Myr of cluster evolution. The TDE rates peak at \Gamma_ tde~ 5 × 10^-5 yr^-1 shortly after IMBH formation at ~ 2 Myr. In all simulations, we find gravitational wave driven mergers involving stellar BHs and IMBHs. Initial multiplicity or a high mass limit also result in IMBH-IMBH mergers. The IMBH masses correlate with the initial cluster masses, surface densities and velocity dispersions approximately as M<sub>&bull;</sub> &prop; M_cl, M<sub>&bull;</sub> &prop; &Sigma;_h^3/2 and M<sub>&bull;</sub> &prop; &sigma;^3. Our results suggest IMBH masses above M<sub>&bull;</sub> ≳ 10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub> for the dense z~10 star clusters recently observed by the James Webb Space Telescope.

### 75) [2506.04310](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04310v1): Fast Rotators at Cosmic Noon: Stellar Kinematics for 15 Quiescent Galaxies from JWST-SUSPENSE

<p>
We present spatially-resolved stellar kinematics of 15 massive (M_*=10^10.5-11.5M<sub>&odot;</sub>) quiescent galaxies at z~1.2-2.3 from the JWST-SUSPENSE program. This is the largest sample of spatially-resolved kinematic measurements of quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon to date. Our measurements are derived from ultra-deep NIRSpec/MSA stellar absorption line spectra, using a forward modelling approach that accounts for optics, source morphology, positioning, and data reduction effects. 10 out of 15 galaxies are orientated such that we can measure rotational support. Remarkably, all 10 galaxies show significant rotation (V_r_e=117-345km/s, &sigma;_0 = 180-387km/s), and are classified as "fast rotators" from their spin parameter. The remaining galaxies are too misaligned with respect to the slit to constrain their rotational velocities. The widespread rotational support in our sample indicates that the process responsible for quenching star formation in early massive galaxies did not destroy rotating disc structures. When combined with other quiescent galaxy samples at z~0.5-2.5, we find a trend between rotational support and age, with younger quiescent galaxies being more rotationally supported. This age trend has also been found at z~0, and likely explains why our high-redshift galaxies show more rotational support compared to massive ETGs at z~0, which are, on average, older. Our kinematic modelling also enables us to calculate dynamical masses. These dynamical masses greatly exceed the stellar masses for our sample (median M_dyn/M_*=2.7); they even allow for the bottom-heavy IMF found in the cores of low-z massive ellipticals. Altogether, our results support a scenario in which distant quiescent galaxies evolve into nearby massive ETGs, gradually building up their outskirts and simultaneously losing rotation, due to a series of (mostly minor) mergers.

<p>
The COSMOS-Web survey, with its unparalleled combination of multiband data, notably, near-infrared imaging from JWST's NIRCam (F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W), provides a transformative dataset down to ~28 mag (F444W) for studying galaxy evolution. In this work, we employ Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), an unsupervised machine learning method, to estimate key physical parameters of galaxies &ndash; redshift, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), specific SFR (sSFR), and age &ndash; directly from photometric data out to z=3.5. SOMs efficiently project high-dimensional galaxy color information onto 2D maps, showing how physical properties vary among galaxies with similar spectral energy distributions. We first validate our approach using mock galaxy catalogs from the HORIZON-AGN simulation, where the SOM accurately recovers the true parameters, demonstrating its robustness. Applying the method to COSMOS-Web observations, we find that the SOM delivers robust estimates despite the increased complexity of real galaxy populations. Performance metrics (&sigma;_NMAD typically between 0.1&ndash;0.3, and Pearson correlation between 0.7 and 0.9) confirm the precision of the method, with ~ 70&percnt; of predictions within 1&sigma; dex of reference values. Although redshift estimation in COSMOS-Web remains challenging (median &sigma;_NMAD = 0.04), the overall success of the highlights its potential as a powerful and interpretable tool for galaxy parameter estimation.

### 77) [2506.04119](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04119v2): Exploring over 700 massive quiescent galaxies at z = 2-7: Demographics and stellar mass functions

<p>
High-redshift (z&gt;2) massive quiescent galaxies are crucial tests of early galaxy formation and evolutionary mechanisms through their cosmic number densities and stellar mass functions (SMFs). We explore a sample of 745 massive (M_*&gt; 10^9.5M<sub>&odot;</sub>) quiescent galaxies from z=2-7 in over 800 arcmin<sup>2</sup> of NIRCam imaging from a compilation of public JWST fields (with a total area &gt; 5 × previous JWST studies). We compute and report their cosmic number densities, stellar mass functions, and cosmic stellar mass density. We confirm a significant overabundance of massive quiescent galaxies relative to a range of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and semi-analytic models (SAMs). We find that one SAM, SHARK is able to reproduce our observed number density with the addition of mock observational errors, but that it is still unable to produce quiescent galaxies of the same masses. We find that no simulations or SAMs accurately reproduce the SMF for massive quiescent galaxies at any redshift within the interval z=2-5. This shows that none of these models' feedback prescriptions are fully capturing high-z galaxy quenching, challenging the standard formation scenarios. We find a greater abundance of lower-mass (M_*&lt;10^10M<sub>&odot;</sub>) quiescent galaxies than previously found, highlighting the importance of sSFR cuts rather than simple colour selection. We show the importance of this selection bias, alongside individual field-to-field variations caused by cosmic variance, in varying the observed quiescent galaxy SMF, especially at higher-z. We also find a steeper increase in the cosmic stellar mass density for massive quiescent galaxies than has been seen previously, with an increase of around a factor of 60 from z=4.5 to z=2, indicating the increasing importance of galaxy quenching within these epochs.

<p>
We present a comprehensive study of the structural evolution of Brightest Group Galaxies (BGGs) from redshift z ≃ 0.08 to z = 3.7 using the itJames Webb Space Telescope's 255h COSMOS-Web program. This survey provides deep NIRCam imaging in four filters (F115W, F150W, F277W, F444W) across ~ 0.54~deg<sup>2</sup> and MIRI coverage in ~ 0.2~deg<sup>2</sup> of the COSMOS field. High-resolution NIRCam imaging enables robust size and morphological measurements, while multiwavelength photometry yields stellar masses, SFRs, and S\'ersic parameters. We classify BGGs as star-forming and quiescent using both rest-frame NUV&ndash;r&ndash;J colors and a redshift-dependent specific star formation rate (sSFR) threshold. Our analysis reveals: (1) quiescent BGGs are systematically more compact than their star-forming counterparts and exhibit steeper size&ndash;mass slopes; (2) effective radii evolve as R_e &prop; (1+z)^-&alpha;, with &alpha; = 1.11 ± 0.07 (star-forming) and 1.40 ± 0.09 (quiescent); (3) star formation surface density (&Sigma;_SFR) increases with redshift and shows stronger evolution for massive BGGs (log_10(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 10.75); (4) in the &Sigma;_*&ndash;sSFR plane, a structural transition marks the quenching process, with bulge-dominated systems comprising over 80&percnt; of the quiescent population. These results highlight the co-evolution of structure and star formation in BGGs, shaped by both internal and environmental processes, and establish BGGs as critical laboratories for studying the baryonic assembly and morphological transformation of central galaxies in group-scale halos.

<p>
Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal a previously unseen population of compact red objects, known as "little red dots" (LRDs). We study a new photometrically selected sample of 124 LRDs in the redshift range z ~ 3 - 10 selected from NIRCam coverage of the CEERS, NEP-TDF, JADES and JEMS surveys. For JADES, the NEP-TDF and CEERS, we compare SED models with and without AGN components and analyse the impact of an AGN component on the goodness of fit using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). We find that whilst the &chi;<sup>2</sup> of the majority of models containing AGN components is improved compared to models without AGN components, we show that the BIC suggests models without AGN are a more appropriate fit to LRD SEDs, especially when MIRI data is available. We also measure LRD clustering in the CEERS field, JADES field, and NEP-TDF, where we compare the spatial distribution of LRDs and galaxies with Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of equality of distribution. We find that the neighbourhood of LRDs tends to be less dense compared to galaxies at all selections and masses and at similar redshifts. We further measure upper limit estimates for the halo masses of LRDs using abundance matching. Whilst the population of LRDs could be a mixture of several different inherent populations, as a whole it does appear that these systems are mostly hosting compact galaxies or star clusters in formation.

The COSMOS-Web survey is the largest JWST Cycle 1 General Observer program covering a contiguous ~0.54 deg<sup>2</sup> area with NIRCam imaging in four broad-band filters and a non-contiguous ~0.2 deg<sup>2</sup> with parallel MIRI imaging in a single broad-band filter, F770W. Here we present a comprehensive overview of the MIRI imaging observations, the data reduction procedure, the COSMOS-Web MIRI photometric catalog, and the first data release including the entire COSMOS-Web MIRI coverage. Data reduction is predominantly based on the JWST Science Calibration Pipeline with an additional step involving custom background subtraction to mitigate the presence of strong instrumental features and sky background in the MIRI images. We reach 5&sigma; (point source) limiting depths (m_F770W~25.51 based on r~0.3'' circular apertures) that are significantly better than initial expectations. We create a COSMOS-Web MIRI catalog based on the images presented in this release and compare the F770W flux densities with the Spitzer/IRAC CH4 measurements from the COSMOS2020 catalog for CH4 detections with S/N &gt;5. We find that these are in reasonable agreement with a small median offset of &lt;0.05 mag. We also derive robust 7.7&mu;m number counts spanning five orders of magnitude in flux (~0.2-2300 &mu;Jy) &ndash; making COSMOS-Web the only JWST survey to date to efficiently sample such a large flux range &ndash; which is in good agreement with estimates from other JWST and IRAC surveys.

We present the data reduction methodology used for the COSMOS-Web survey JWST NIRCam data. Covering 0.54 deg<sup>2</sup> with four broadband filters (F115W, F150W, F277W, F444W) and a total exposure time of approximately 270 hours, COSMOS-Web represents the largest contiguous field surveyed during JWST Cycle 1, posing unique data reduction challenges due to its extensive scale. By combining the official JWST Calibration Pipeline with custom improvements for noise removal, background subtraction, and astrometric alignment, we achieve high fidelity science-ready mosaics. We detail the systematic approach employed in the three stages of the JWST Calibration Pipeline. The data, collected in three epochs from January 2023 to January 2024, encompass 152 visits and have been processed into 20 mosaic tiles to optimize computational efficiency and data processing. The final data products achieve 5 sigma depths of 26.7-28.3 AB mag in 0.15" apertures. The processed and calibrated datasets are made available to the public.

<p>
Dwarf galaxies provide powerful laboratories for studying galaxy formation physics. Their early assembly, shallow gravitational potentials, and bursty, clustered star formation histories make them especially sensitive to the processes that regulate baryons through multi-phase outflows. Using high-resolution, cosmological zoom-in simulations of a dwarf galaxy from itthe Pandora suite, we explore the impact of stellar radiation, magnetic fields, and cosmic ray feedback on star formation, outflows, and metal retention. We find that our purely hydrodynamical model without non-thermal physics - in which supernova feedback is boosted to reproduce realistic stellar mass assembly - drives violent, overly enriched outflows that suppress the metal content of the host galaxy. Including radiation reduces the clustering of star formation and weakens feedback. However, the additional incorporation of cosmic rays produces fast, mass-loaded, multi-phase outflows consisting of both ionized and neutral gas components, in better agreement with observations. These outflows, which entrain a denser, more temperate ISM, exhibit broad metallicity distributions while preserving metals within the galaxy. Furthermore, the star formation history becomes more bursty, in agreement with recent JWST findings. These results highlight the essential role of non-thermal physics in galaxy evolution and the need to incorporate it in future galaxy formation models.

### 83) [2506.03242](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03242v1): Age dependence of Lyα escape fraction of Lyα emitters and their significant role in cosmic reionization

<p> Shunta Shimizu, Nobunari Kashikawa, Satoshi Kikuta, Yoshihiro Takeda, Junya Arita, Ryo Emori, Kentaro Koretomo </p>
<p>
We study the Ly&alpha; escape fraction, f<sub>esc</sub>^Ly&alpha; of Ly&alpha; emitters (LAEs) identified by Subaru/HSC narrowband imaging at z = 2.2-6.6, using publicly available deep imaging data from HST and JWST. We perform SED fitting for 127 LAEs at 0.4 - 5.0  &mu; m to estimate their physical properties robustly, and confirm that two distinct LAE populations exist: young LAEs (&lt; 100 Myr) and old LAEs (&gt; 100 Myr). Young LAEs are characterized by burst-like star formation activity and low dust content, significantly differing from Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at the same stellar mass, while old LAEs show similar star formation activity to LBGs, yet with lower dust content and more compact morphology in rest-UV/optical than LBGs. The f<sub>esc</sub>^Ly&alpha; of LAEs is anticorrelated with stellar mass, and this correlation is found to depend on the age of LAEs, such that old LAEs show a weaker anticorrelation than young LAEs, and tend to exhibit higher f<sub>esc</sub>^Ly&alpha; than young LAEs at a given stellar mass. This implies that Ly&alpha; photons escape more efficiently from old LAEs, possibly through the low-density channels of HI and dust created by outflows. The average f<sub>esc</sub>^Ly&alpha; of young LAEs remains nearly constant at ~40% at z = 2.2-6.6, suggesting that the previously observed evolution of global f<sub>esc</sub>^Ly&alpha; of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is due to the changes in the LAE fraction among the SFGs. Converting f<sub>esc</sub>^Ly&alpha; to Lyman continuum escape fraction using empirical relations, we demonstrate that LAEs alone can supply the ionizing photons necessary for reionization at z~6, causing rapid and late reionization.

We present COSMOS2025, the COSMOS-Web catalog of photometry, morphology, photometric redshifts and physical parameters for more than 700,000 galaxies in the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field. This catalog is based on our itJames Webb Space Telescope 255 h COSMOS-Web program, which provides deep near-infrared imaging in four NIRCam (F115W, F150W, F277W, F444W) and one MIRI (F770W) filter over the central ~ 0.54   deg<sup>2</sup> (~ 0.2   deg<sup>2</sup> for MIRI) in COSMOS. These data are combined with ground- and space-based data to derive photometric measurements of NIRCam-detected sources using both fixed-aperture photometry (on the space-based bands) and a profile-fitting technique on all 37 bands spanning 0.3-8 micron. We provide morphology for all sources from complementary techniques including profile fitting and machine-learning classification. We derive photometric redshifts, physical parameters and non-parametric star formation histories from spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. The catalog has been extensively validated against previous COSMOS catalogs and other surveys. Photometric redshift accuracy measured using spectroscopically confirmed galaxies out to z~9 reaches &sigma;_MAD = 0.012 at m_F444W&lt;28 and remains at &sigma;_MAD ≲ 0.03 as a function of magnitude, color, and galaxy type. This represents a factor of ~ 2 improvement at 26 AB mag compared to COSMOS2020. The catalog is approximately 80&percnt; complete at log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ~ 9 at z ~ 10 and at log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ~ 7 at z ~ 0.2, representing a gain of 1 dex compared to COSMOS2020. COSMOS2025 represents the definitive COSMOS-Web catalog. It is provided with complete documentation, together with redshift probability distributions, and it is ready for scientific exploitation today.

### 85) [2506.03244](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03244v1): Cosmic Outliers: Low-Spin Halos Explain the Abundance, Compactness, and Redshift Evolution of the Little Red Dots

<p> Fabio Pacucci, Abraham Loeb </p>
<p>
The Little Red Dots (LRDs) are high-redshift galaxies uncovered by JWST, characterized by small effective radii (R_eff ~ 80-300 pc), number densities intermediate between typical galaxies and quasars, and a redshift distribution peaked at z ~ 5. We present a theoretical model in which the LRDs descend from dark matter halos in the extreme low-spin tail of the angular momentum distribution. Within this framework, we explain their three key observational signatures: (i) abundance, (ii) compactness, and (iii) redshift distribution. Our model focuses on observed, not modeled, properties; it is thus independent of whether they are powered primarily by a black hole or stars. We find that the assumption that the prototypical LRD at z ~ 5 originates from halos in the lowest ~ 1&percnt; of the spin distribution is sufficient to reproduce both their observed number densities and physical sizes. The redshift evolution of their observability is driven by the interplay between the evolving compact disk fraction and cosmological surface brightness dimming. This effect leads to a well-defined "LRDs Era" at 4&lt;z&lt;8, during which the LRDs are common and detectable; at z&lt;4, they are bright but rare, while at z&gt;8, they are common but faint. Finally, we test the predicted redshift trend against observational data, finding excellent agreement. Additional observational support comes from their excess small-scale clustering and spectral signatures of extreme core densities, both of which are expected outcomes of galaxy formation in low-spin halos. These findings suggest that the LRDs are not a fundamentally distinct population but the natural manifestation of galaxies forming in the rarest, lowest angular momentum environments.

<p>
We present AGNBoost, a machine learning framework utilizing XGBoostLSS to identify AGN and estimate redshifts from JWST NIRCam and MIRI photometry. AGNBoost constructs 121 input features from 7 NIRCam and 4 MIRI bands-including magnitudes, colors, and squared color terms-to simultaneously predict the fraction of mid-IR 3-30 &mu;m emission attributable to an AGN power law (frac_AGN) and photometric redshift. Each model is trained on a sample of 10^6 simulated galaxies from CIGALE providing ground truth values of both frac_AGN and redshift. Models are tested against both mock CIGALE galaxies set aside for testing and 698 observations from the JWST MIRI EGS Galaxy and AGN (MEGA) survey. On mock galaxies, AGNBoost achieves 15&percnt; outlier fractions of 0.19&percnt; (frac_AGN) and 0.63&percnt; (redshift), with a root mean square error (&sigma;_RMSE) of 0.027 for frac_AGN and a normalized mean absolute deviation (&sigma;_NMAD) of 0.011 for redshift. On MEGA galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, AGNBoost achieves &sigma;_NMAD = 0.074 and 17.05&percnt; outliers, with most outliers at z<sub>spec</sub> &gt; 2. AGNBoost frac_AGN estimates broadly agree with CIGALE fitting (&sigma;_RMSE = 0.183, 20.41&percnt; outliers), and AGNBoost finds a similar number of AGNs as CIGALE SED fitting. The flexible framework of AGNBoost allows straightforward incorporation of additional photometric bands and derived qualities, and simple re-training for other variables of interest. AGNBoost's computational efficiency makes it well-suited for wide-sky surveys requiring rapid AGN identification and redshift estimation.

### 87) [2506.03121](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03121v1): EIGER VII. The evolving relationship between galaxies and the intergalactic medium in the final stages of reionization

<p> Daichi Kashino, Simon J. Lilly, Jorryt Matthee, Ruari Mackenzie, Anna-Christina Eilers, Rongmon Bordoloi, Robert A. Simcoe, Rohan P. Naidu, Minghao Yue, Bin Liu </p>
<p>
We present a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between galaxies and the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the late stages of cosmic reionization, based on the complete JWST EIGER dataset. Using deep NIRCam 3.5 &mu; m slitless spectroscopy, we construct a sample of 948 [\OIII]&lambda;5008-emitting galaxies with -21.4≲ M_UV≲ -17.2 spanning 5.33&lt;z&lt;6.97 along six quasar sightlines. We correlate these galaxies with \Lya and \Lyb transmission measured from high-resolution quasar spectra across multiple redshift intervals. We find clear redshift evolution in the correlation between galaxy density and transmission: it is suppressed in overdense regions at z&lt;5.50, while enhanced at 5.70&lt;z&lt;6.15. The intermediate range exhibits a transitional behavior. Cross-correlation measurements further reveal excess absorption within ~ 8 cMpc of galaxies at low redshifts, and enhanced transmission at intermediate scales (~5&ndash;20 cMpc) at z&gt;5.70. Statistical tests using mock catalogs with realistic galaxy clustering but no correlation with the transmission field confirm that the observed correlations are unlikely to arise by chance. The evolving signals can be explained by stronger absorption in overdense regions, combined with the competing influences of local radiation fields and the rising background radiation. While local radiation dominates ionization of the surrounding IGM at earlier times, the background becomes increasingly important, eventually surpassing the impact of nearby galaxies. These results support an inside-out progression of reionization, with ionized regions originating around clustered, star-forming galaxies and gradually extending into underdense regions.

<p>
We present cosmological constraints from 8 strongly lensed quasars (hereafter, the TDCOSMO-2025 sample). Building on previous work, our analysis incorporated new deflector stellar velocity dispersions measured from spectra obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Keck Telescopes, and the Very Large Telescope (VLT), utilizing improved methods. We used integrated JWST stellar kinematics for 5 lenses, VLT-MUSE for 2, and resolved kinematics from Keck and JWST for RX J1131-1231. We also considered two samples of non-time-delay lenses: 11 from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) sample with Keck-KCWI resolved kinematics; and 4 from the Strong Lenses in the Legacy Survey (SL2S) sample. We improved our analysis of line-of-sight effects, the surface brightness profile of the lens galaxies, and orbital anisotropy, and corrected for projection effects in the dynamics. Our uncertainties are maximally conservative by accounting for the mass-sheet degeneracy in the deflectors' mass density profiles. The analysis was blinded to prevent experimenter bias. Our primary result is based on the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, in combination with &Omega;_m constraints from the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae (SN) dataset. In the flat &Lambda; Cold Dark Matter (CDM), we find H_0=71.6^+3.9_-3.3 km s<sup>-1</sup> Mpc^-1. The SLACS and SL2S samples are in excellent agreement with the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, improving the precision on H_0 in flat &Lambda;CDM to 4.6%. Using the Dark Energy Survey SN Year-5 dataset (DES-SN5YR) or DESI-DR2 baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) likelihoods instead of Pantheon+ yields very similar results. We also present constraints in the open &Lambda;CDM, wCDM, w_0w_aCDM, and w_&phi;CDM cosmologies. The TDCOSMO H_0 inference is robust and consistent across all presented cosmological models, and our cosmological constraints in them agree with those from the BAO and SN.

<p>
Planet-forming disks around brown dwarfs and very low-mass stars (VLMS) are on average less massive and are expected to undergo faster radial solid transport than their higher mass counterparts. Spitzer had detected C_2H<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub> and HCN around these objects. With better sensitivity and spectral resolving power, JWST recently revealed incredibly carbon-rich spectra from such disks. A study of a larger sample of objects is necessary to understand how common such carbon-rich inner disk regions are and to put constraints on their evolution. We present and analyze MIRI observations of 10 disks around VLMS from the MIRI GTO program. This sample is diverse, with the central object ranging in mass from 0.02 to 0.14 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. They are located in three star-forming regions and a moving group (1-10 Myr). We identify molecular emission in all sources and report detection rates. We compare the molecular flux ratios between different species and to dust emission strengths. We also compare the flux ratios with the stellar and disk properties. The spectra of these VLMS disks are extremely molecular rich, and we detect the 10 &mu;m silicate dust emission feature in 70% of the sample. We detect C_2H<sub>2</sub> and HCN in all of the sources and find larger hydrocarbons such as C_4H<sub>2</sub> and C_6H_6 in nearly all sources. Among O-bearing molecules, we find firm detections of CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, and CO in 90%, 50%, and 20% of the sample, respectively. We find that the detection rates of organic molecules correlate with other organic molecules and anti-correlate with inorganic molecules. Hydrocarbon-rich sources show a weaker 10&mu;m dust strength as well as lower disk dust mass than the oxygen-rich sources. We find potential evidence for C/O enhancement with disk age. The observed trends are consistent with models that suggest rapid inward solid material transport and grain growth.

<p>
Our understanding of the physical properties of star-forming galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR, at z &gt; 6) suffers from degeneracies among the apparent properties of the stars, the nebular gas, and the dust. These degeneracies are most prominent with photometry, which has insufficient (1) spectral resolution and (2) rest-frame spectral coverage. We explore ways to break these degeneracies with a sample of N = 22 high-redshift star-forming galaxies at 7 &lt; z<sub>phot</sub> ≤ 9, using some of the deepest existing imaging from JWST/NIRCam and JWST/MIRI with JADES. Key to this study is the imaging from JWST/MIRI at 7.7 &mu;m, which provides coverage of the rest-frame I-band at the observed redshifts. We infer stellar population properties and rest-frame colors using a variety of filter sets and star formation history assumptions to explore the impact of these choices. Evaluating these quantities both with and without the 7.7 &mu;m data point shows that dense spectral coverage with JWST/NIRCam (eight or more filters, including at least one medium-band) can compensate for lacking the rest-frame I-band coverage for the vast majority (≈ 80&percnt;) of our sample. Furthermore, these galaxy properties are most consistently determined by assuming the delayed-tau star formation history, which provides the smallest offsets and scatters around these offsets when including JWST/MIRI. Within extragalactic surveys like JADES and CEERS, our findings suggest that robust characterization of the stellar population properties and rest-frame colors for high-redshift star-forming galaxies is possible with JWST/NIRCam alone at z ≈ 8.

<p>
We present the a near complete spectral energy distribution (SED) for an extrasolar world: the T8 brown dwarf 2MASS~J04151954-0935066. Spanning from optical to mid-infrared (0.7&ndash;20.4 micron) wavelengths, the SED for this substellar atmosphere is constructed from new JWST NIRSpec G395H (R~2700) and Magellan FIRE echelle (R~8000) near-infrared spectra, along with MIRI mid-infrared photometry complemented by spectra from Keck I, IRTF, Magellan, AKARI, Spitzer and photometry from various surveys and missions. The NIRSpec G395H spectrum reveals strong molecular absorptions from NH_3, CH_4, H<sub>2</sub>S, CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O at approximately 3.00, 3.35, 3.95, 4.25, and 5.00 micron respectively, along with the presence of a CO absorption feature detected mainly at ~ 4.6 micron. We detect no absorption of near-infrared K I doublets in the R~8000 FIRE spectra. In the mid-infrared IRS spectrum, we tentatively identify a new CO<sub>2</sub> feature at 14&ndash;16 micron. The comprehensive SED allows us to empirically constrain bolometric luminosity, effective temperature, mass and radius. Additionally, we demonstrate that the NIRSpec G395H resolution, the highest allowable by JWST, enables a precise radial velocity measurement of 47.1±1.8 km s<sup>-1</sup> for the object, in agreement with previous measurements.

### 92) [2505.24308](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24308v2): Inferring Obscured Cosmic Black Hole Accretion History from AGN Found by JWST/MIRI CEERS Survey

<p> Cheng-An Hsieh, Tomotsugu Goto, Chih-Teng Ling, Seong Jin Kim, Tetsuya Hashimoto, Tom C. -C. Chien, Amos Y. -A. Chen </p>
<p>
This study presents the black hole accretion history (BHAH) of obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) identified from the JWST CEERS survey by Chien et al. (2024) using mid-infrared (MIR) SED fitting. We compute black hole accretion rates (BHARs) to estimate the black hole accretion density (BHAD), &rho;_L_disk, across 0 &lt; z &lt; 4.25. MIR luminosity functions (LFs) are also constructed for these sources, modeled with modified Schechter and double power law forms, and corresponding BHAD, &rho;_LF, is derived by integrating the LFs and multiplying by the luminosity. Both &rho;_LF extend to luminosities as low as 10^7   L<sub>&odot;</sub>, two orders of magnitude fainter than pre-JWST studies. Our results show that BHAD peaks between redshifts 1 and 3, with the peak varying by method and model, z ≈ 1&ndash;2 for &rho;_L_disk and the double power law, and z ≈ 2&ndash;3 for the modified Schechter function. A scenario where AGN activity peaks before cosmic star formation would challenge existing black hole formation theories, but our present study, based on early JWST observations, provides an initial exploration of this possibility. At z ~ 3, &rho;_LF appears higher than X-ray estimates, suggesting that MIR observations are more effective in detecting obscured AGNs missed by X-ray observations. However, given the overlapping error bars, this difference remains within the uncertainties and requires confirmation with larger samples. These findings highlight the potential of JWST surveys to enhance the understanding of co-evolution between galaxies and AGNs.

### 93) [2505.24080](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24080v2): The Impact of Galaxy Overdensities and Ionized Bubbles on Lyα Emission at z~7.0-8.5

<p> Zuyi Chen, Daniel P. Stark, Charlotte A. Mason, Mengtao Tang, Lily Whitler, Ting-Yi Lu, Michael W. Topping </p>
<p>
Ly&alpha; spectroscopy with JWST is opening a new window on the sizes of ionized bubbles through the reionization epoch. Theoretical expectations suggest typical bubble radii should be 0.6-1.5 pMpc at z≃ 7, assuming neutral hydrogen fractions of the intergalactic medium in the range x_HI=0.5-0.7. Here we investigate this picture using JWST to characterize the environment and Ly&alpha; emission of 292 galaxies at 7.0&lt;z&lt;8.5 across 5 fields spanning a comoving volume of 1.3×10^6 Mpc^3. If the reionization predictions are correct, we should see overdensities and strong Ly&alpha; emission clustered in redshift windows of dz=0.04-0.08 and angular scales of 5-11 arcmin. We detect Ly&alpha; emission in 36 out of 292 galaxies, including nine new Ly&alpha; detections, two of which (in the UDS field) show extremely large equivalent widths (EW = 200_-78^+50 A and 284_-75^+56 A). We identify 13 significant (4-11×) galaxy overdensities using redshifts from NIRCam grism and NIRSpec. Strong Ly&alpha; emitters are almost uniformly found in the overdensities, with nearly all located between the center and back of the structures. The overdensities that host the strong Ly&alpha; emitters span typical line-of-sight distances (dz~ 0.14) and angular scales (~ 8 arcmin) that are comparable to the predicted bubble sizes at z≃ 7. We discuss evidence that the EGS is mostly ionized along a 24 pMpc sightline at z≃ 7.0-7.6, based on the presence of 3 overdense structures and 10 Ly&alpha; emitters in this volume, and find such a large ionized region would pose tension with standard reionization models.

### 94) [2505.22600](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22600v1): Dust Budget Crisis in Little Red Dots

<p> Kejian Chen, Zhengrong Li, Kohei Inayoshi, Luis C. Ho </p>
<p>
Little red dots (LRDs), a population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) recently identified by JWST, are characterized by their compact morphology and red optical continuum emission, which is often interpreted as evidence for significant dust extinction of A_V ≳ 3 mag. However, the dust-reddened AGN scenario is increasingly challenged by their faint near-to-far infrared emission and a potential "dust budget crisis" in cases when the host galaxy is either undetectably low-mass or absent. In this study, we re-evaluate the dust extinction level in LRDs by modeling the UV-to-infrared spectra for various extinction laws and a broad range of dusty distribution parameters. Comparing the predicted infrared fluxes with observational data from the JWST MIRI, Herschel, and ALMA, our analysis finds that the visual extinction is tightly constrained to A_V ≲ 1.0 mag for A2744-45924 and A_V ≲ 1.5 mag for RUBIES-BLAGN-1 under the SMC extinction laws, with slightly weaker constraints for those with gray extinction in the UV range. The revised A_V values yield a radiative efficiencies of 10&percnt; for the LRD population, easing the tension with the Soltan argument for the bulk AGN population at lower redshifts. Moreover, this moderate extinction (or dust-free) scenario, with reprocessed emission spectra testable by future far-infrared observatories, provides a paradigm shift in understanding their natures, environments, and evolutionary pathways of massive black holes in the early universe.

### 95) [2505.22314](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22314v1): Solar C/O ratio in planet-forming gas at 1 au in a highly irradiated disk

<p>
The chemical composition of exoplanets is thought to be influenced by the composition of the disks in which they form. JWST observations have unveiled a variety of species in numerous nearby disks, showing significant variations in the C/O abundance ratio. However, little is known about the composition and C/O ratio of disks around young stars in clusters exposed to strong ultraviolet (UV) radiation from nearby massive stars, which are representative of the environments where most planetary systems form, including ours. We present JWST spectroscopy of d203-504, a young 0.7 M<sub>&odot;</sub> star in the Orion Nebula with a 30 au disk irradiated by nearby massive stars. These observations reveal spectroscopic signatures of CO, H<sub>2</sub>O, CH_3^+, and PAHs. Water and CO are detected in absorption in the inner disk (r≲ 1 au), where the estimated gas-phase C/O ratio is 0.48, consistent with the Solar value and that of the Orion Nebula. In contrast, \chCH3+ and PAHs are found in the extended surface layers of the disk. These results suggest that gas in the inner disk is chemically shielded from UV radiation while the surface layers of the disk experience UV-induced chemistry, potentially depleting their carbon content.

### 96) [2505.22242](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22242v1): Ito calculus meets the Hubble tension: Effects of small-scale electron density fluctuations on the CMB anisotropies

<p> Jens Chluba, Geoffrey Vasil, Richard Battye </p>
<p>
In this work, we develop a novel formalism to include the effect of electron density fluctuations at ultra small scales (well below the sound horizon at last scattering) on the observed anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). We treat the electron field as an independent stochastic variable and obtain the required ensemble-averaged photon Boltzmann equations using Ito calculus. Beyond changes to the average recombination history (which can be incorporated in the standard approach) our work identifies two new effects caused by the clumpiness of the medium. The first is a correction to the Thomson visibility function caused by correlations of the electron fluctuations along the line of sight, leading to an additional broadening of the visibility towards higher redshifts which causes extra damping and smearing of the CMB anisotropies. The second effect is a reduction of the effective scattering rate in the (pre-)recombination era that affects the photon transfer functions in a non-trivial manner. These new effects are subdominant in LCDM but can be significant in cosmologies with an early onset of structure formation (e.g., due to generation of enhanced small-scale power) as suggested by a number of indicators (e.g., the abundance of high redshift galaxies observed by JWST). We discuss the relevance of these new effects to the Hubble tension, finding that corrections which cannot be captured by simple modifications to the average recombination history arise. This highlights how important an understanding of the recombination process is in cosmological inference, and that a coordinated simulation and analysis campaign is required as part of the search for the origin of the various tensions in cosmology.

<p>
Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) serve as powerful probes of distant galaxies. Their luminous afterglow pinpoints galaxies independent of luminosity, in contrast to most flux-limited surveys. Nevertheless, GRB-selected galaxy samples are not free from bias, instead tracing the conditions favoured by the progenitor stars. Characterising the galaxy populations traced by GRBs is therefore important both to effectively use GRBs as probes as well as to place stronger constraints on the progenitor stars capable of forming long GRBs. Spatially-resolved spectroscopic observations with integral field units (IFUs) provide valuable insights into the interstellar medium and stellar populations of GRB host galaxies. In this paper we present results of the first two GRB host galaxies observed with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU with a spatial resolution of ~ 1.6 kpc; the hosts of GRB 150403A and GRB 050820A at redshifts z ~ 2.06 and z ~ 2.61, respectively. The data reveal two complex galaxy environments made up of two or more star forming galaxies that are likely interacting given their small spatial separation (&lt; 20 kpc) and line of sight velocity offsets (&lt; 100 km/s). The measured gas-phase metallicity, star formation rates (SFRs), and key diagnostic line ratios for each of the detected galaxies are overall consistent with the properties of other star forming galaxies and GRB hosts at z &gt; 2. However, differences in the SFR and metallicities of the interacting galaxies highlight the importance of spatially resolved observations in order to accurately characterise the galaxy properties traced by GRBs.

<p>
To better understand how galaxies assemble their structure and evolve over cosmic time, we present a new catalog of morphological measurements for over 340,000 sources spanning 0 &lt; z &lt; 12, derived from deep JWST NIRCam imaging across four major extragalactic fields (CEERS, PRIMER-UDS, PRIMER-COSMOS, GOODS) compiled in the DAWN JWST Archive (DJA). We perform two-dimensional surface brightness fitting for all galaxies in a uniform, flux-limited sample. Each galaxy is modeled with both a S\'ersic profile and a two-component (bulge and disk) decomposition, yielding consistent structural parameters - including effective radius, S\'ersic index, axis ratio, and bulge-to-total ratio (B/T). To demonstrate the scientific application of our morphology catalogs, we combined these measurements with DJA photometric redshifts, physical parameters and rest-frame colors, and investigated the relation between total, bulge and disk sizes, S\'ersic index (n_S), star formation activity, and redshift. Bulge-dominated galaxies (high n_S and B/T) predominantly occupy the quiescent region of the UVJ diagram, while disk-dominated galaxies are mostly star-forming. A significant bimodality persists, with quiescent disks and compact, bulge-dominated star-forming galaxies observed out to z &gt; 3. Quiescent galaxies also show significantly higher stellar mass surface densities, nearly an order of magnitude greater at z ~ 4 than at z ~ 1. Our results confirm a strong and evolving link between morphology and star formation activity, and support a scenario in which bulge growth and quenching are closely connected. This work is a highly valuable addition to the DJA, adding a morphological dimension to this rich dataset and thus enabling a wider scientific application.

### 99) [2505.21463](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21463v1): Spectral Evolution of Rotating Population III Stars

<p> Jake Hassan, Rosalba Perna, Matteo Cantiello, Tyler Parsotan, Davide Lazzati, Nathan Walker </p>
<p>
Population III (Pop III) stars, the first generation of stars formed from primordial gas, played a fundamental role in shaping the early universe through their influence on cosmic reionization, early chemical enrichment, and the formation of the first galaxies. However, to date they have eluded direct detection due to their short lifetimes and high redshifts. The launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revolutionized observational capabilities, providing the opportunity to detect Pop~III stars via caustic lensing, where strong gravitational lensing magnifies individual stars to observable levels. This prospect makes it compelling to develop accurate models for their spectral characteristics to distinguish them from other stellar populations. Previous studies have focused on computing the spectral properties of non-rotating, zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) Pop III stars. In this work, we expand upon these efforts by incorporating the effects of stellar rotation and post-ZAMS evolution into spectral calculations. We use the JWST bands and magnitude limits to identify the optimal observing conditions, both for isolated stars, as well as for small star clusters. We find that, while rotation does not appreciably change the observability at ZAMS, the subsequent evolution can significantly brighten the stars, making the most massive ones potentially visible with only moderate lensing.

<p> Patrick LaChance, Rupert A. C. Croft, Tiziana Di Matteo, Yihao Zhou, Fabio Pacucci, Yueying Ni, Nianyi Chen, Simeon Bird </p>
<p>
We present simulated counterparts of the "Little Red Dot'' (LRD) galaxies observed with JWST, using the large cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, ASTRID. We create mock observations of the galaxies (5 ≤ z ≤ 8) in ASTRID, and find seventeen which fit the color and size criteria of LRDs. These LRDs are galaxies with high stellar masses (log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 9.7), and massive black holes (log(M_BH/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 6.8). The host galaxies are dense, with stellar half mass radii (325 pc ≤ r_half,* ≤ 620 pc), and dust attenuation in the F444W band above 1.25. Their star formation has been recently quenched. They host relatively bright AGN that are dust-obscured and contribute significantly to the rest-frame optical red slope and have relatively low luminosity in the rest-frame ultraviolet, where the host galaxy's stars are more dominant. These LRDs are in an evolutionary phase of miniquenching that is the result of AGN feedback from their massive black holes. The LRDs in ASTRID are bright with F444W magnitudes of 23.5-25.5. The less massive and fainter galaxies in ASTRID lack the dust concentration necessary to produce the red slope of an LRD, though this could be an effect of limited resolution. Most of the highest Eddington black holes are not LRDs due to their host galaxies having typical dust levels and relatively high star formation rates accompanying their highly accreting black holes, resulting in their spectra being too flat.

### 101) [2505.20263](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20263v1): Bursty or heavy? The surprise of bright Population III systems in the Reionization era

<p> Alessandra Venditti, Julian B. Munoz, Volker Bromm, Seiji Fujimoto, Steven L. Finkelstein, John Chisholm </p>
<p>
The nature of the first, so-called Population III (Pop III), stars has for long remained largely unconstrained. However, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) finally opened new concrete prospects for their detection during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), notably providing promising observational constraints on the Pop III ultra-violet luminosity function (UVLF) at z ~ 6.5. These preliminary data hint towards an unexpected population of UV-bright Pop III sources, which challenges the prevailing view that Pop III star formation is confined to molecular-cooling mini-halos. Here we show that there are two families of models that can explain these surprising observations, either by allowing for late-time Pop III formation within massive, atomic-cooling halos (with halo masses up to M_up^III ≳ 10^10.5 ~M<sub>&odot;</sub>) or by invoking a highly bursty Pop III star-formation activity (with a stochasticity parameter &sigma;_UV^III ≳ 1.5). In these scenarios Pop III systems would have to be either heavier or burstier than usually assumed, underscoring the need to reconsider common assumptions about Pop III star-formation sites, and the potential implications of JWST candidates for current and future observations.

### 102) [2505.19039](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19039v1): Origins of Supermassive Black Holes in Galactic Centers

<p> Ke-Jung Chen </p>
<p>
Direct imaging of black hole shadow halos has firmly confirmed the existence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), with millions of solar masses, residing at the centers of the Milky Way and M87 galaxies. These groundbreaking discoveries represent a monumental success of Einstein's theory of general relativity and have revealed the hidden "monsters" lurking at the centers of galaxies. Moreover, observations of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) indicate that SMBHs with billions of solar masses were already in place within the first billion years after the Big Bang. However, the origins of these SMBHs, as well as their co-evolution with host galaxies, remain poorly understood. This review focuses on the origin of SMBHs, particularly on the formation of their seed black holes. We also highlight several outstanding challenges in modeling seed formation and discuss possible observational signatures. These signatures may be testable with current and future facilities, including the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the upcoming gravitational wave observatory, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).

### 103) [2505.18873](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18873v1): An upper limit of 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> in dust from ALMA observations in 60 Little Red Dots

<p> Caitlin M. Casey, Hollis B. Akins, Steven L. Finkelstein, Maximilien Franco, Seiji Fujimoto, Daizhong Liu, Arianna S. Long, Georgios Magdis, Sinclaire M. Manning, Jed McKinney, Marko Shuntov, Takumi S. Tanaka </p>
<p>
By virtue of their red color, the dust in little red dots (LRDs) has been thought to be of appreciable influence, whether that dust is distributed in a torus around a compact active galactic nucleus (AGN) or diffuse in the interstellar medium (ISM) of nascent galaxies. In Casey et al. (2024) we predicted that, based on the compact sizes of LRDs (unresolved in JWST NIRCam imaging), detection of an appreciable dust mass would be unlikely. Here we present follow-up ALMA 1.3mm continuum observations of a sample of 60 LRDs drawn from Akins et al. (2024). None of the 60 LRDs are detected in imaging that reaches an average depth of &sigma;_rms=22 &mu; Jy. A stack of the 60 LRDs also results in a non-detection, with an inverse-variance weighted flux density measurement of S_1.3mm=2.1±2.9 &mu; Jy. This observed limit translates to a 3&sigma; upper limit of 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> in LRDs' dust mass, and ≲10^11 L<sub>&odot;</sub> in total dust luminosity; both are a factor of 10× deeper than previous submm stack limits for LRDs. These results are consistent with either the interpretation that LRDs are reddened due to compact but modest dust reservoirs (with A_V~2-4) or, alternatively, that instead of being reddened by dust, they have extreme Balmer breaks generated by dense gas (&gt;10^9 cm^-3) enshrouding a central black hole.

<p> Lorraine C. Marcelin, Jaclyn B. Champagne, Feige Wang, Xiaohui Fan, Maria Pudoka, Wei Leong Tee, Yongda Zhu </p>
<p>
Mergers play a critical role in galaxy evolution, but their relationship to their surrounding environments is unexplored at high redshift. We investigate the galaxy merger rate among 124 [OIII] emitters at 5.3&lt;z&lt;6.9 as a function of local galaxy density. Identified in the ASPIRE JWST/NIRCam grism survey, we investigate three density regimes: a z=6.6 quasar-centered protocluster, two overdensities at z=5.4 and z=6.2, and field galaxies. We evaluate merger candidates through close pair and morphological criteria in NIRCam imaging, finding that the z=6.6 protocluster contains the highest fraction of galaxies meeting either criterion. We observe a &gt;3&sigma; enhancement of the merger fraction amongst all three overdense structures compared to the field. Eleven galaxies are classified as "active mergers" satisfying both merger criteria, all of which occur within the overdensity samples. We conclude that environment affects the merger rates of galaxies at z&gt;6, leading to increased specific star formation at the 4&sigma; level.

<p>
We present four galaxy scale lenses discovered in two JWST blank-fields: the ~ 54 arcmin<sup>2</sup> of the PEARLS North-Ecliptic-Pole Time-Domain Field (NEP TDF) and in the ~ 90 arcmin<sup>2</sup> of CEERS. We perform the search by visual inspection of NIRCam photometric data, obtaining an initial list of 16 lens candidates. We down-select this list to 4 high-confidence lens candidates, based on lens modelling of the image configuration and photometric redshift measurements for both the source and the deflector. We compare our results to samples of lenses obtained in ground-based and space-based lens searches and theoretical expectations. We expect that JWST observations of field galaxies will yield approximately 1 galaxy scale lens every three to five NIRCam pointings of comparable depth to these observations (~ 9 arcmin<sup>2</sup> each). This shows that JWST, compared to other lens searches, can yield an extremely high number of secure lenses per unit area, with redshift and size distributions complementary to lens samples obtained from ground-based and wide-area surveys. We estimate that a single JWST pure-parallel survey of comparable depth could yield ~ 70 galaxy scale lenses, with a third of them having z_lens&gt;1 and z_source&gt;3.

<p> Justine C. Obidowski, Jeremy J. Webb, Simon Portegies Zwart, Maxwell X. Cai </p>
<p>
It is unknown if an Oort cloud reaches its maximum mass within its star's birth cluster or millions of years later. Complicating the Oort cloud evolution process is the fact that comets can be stripped from orbit due to perturbations from passing stars. We explore how a star's cluster escape time (t_ esc) and the time its Oort cloud reaches maximum mass (t_ max) affect the Oort cloud's ability to survive via N-body simulations. In a 14 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/pc^3 cluster, we identify 50 stars of 1 M<sub>&odot;</sub> with a range of t_ esc to host Oort clouds, each with 1000 comets at t_ max. For each host, we consider Oort clouds that reach maximum mass 0, 50, and 250 Myr after the cluster's formation. Each Oort cloud's evolution is simulated in the cluster from t_ max to t_ esc. Only a fraction of comets tend to remain in orbit, with this amount depending on t_ max and t_ esc. We observe that 12%, 22%, and 32% of Oort clouds with a t_ max of 0, 50 and 250 Myr retain &gt;50% of their comets at t_ esc, respectively. We find that the fraction of comets stripped has the relationship, f=mlog_10(\fract_ esc-t_ max Myr) where m = 0.32±0.04, indicating that the longer the Oort cloud remains in the cluster, the more comets are stripped, with this fraction increasing logarithmically at approximately the same rate for each t_ max.

<p> Soumak Maitra, Girish Kulkarni, Shikhar Asthana, James S. Bolton, Martin G. Haehnelt, Laura Keating </p>
<p>
Ly&alpha; emitters (LAEs) have now been discovered out to redshift z=13, and are valuable probes of the reionization history at redshifts beyond the reach of other currently available tracers. Most inferences of the neutral hydrogen fraction from LAE observations rely on one-point and two-point statistics like the luminosity function and the power spectrum. We present here an analysis of the bispectrum of high-redshift LAEs and demonstrate its sensitivity to the Epoch of Reionization. We use the Sherwood-Relics suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with the GPU-based radiative transfer code ATON-HE to generate realistic LAE mock catalogues for a wide range of reionization models, varying the ionization history and the source populations, including contributions of AGN to hydrogen reionization. We demonstrate that the bispectrum provides greater sensitivity than the power spectrum to both the timing and spatial morphology of reionization. Using reduced-&chi;<sup>2</sup> analysis we further show that the bispectrum also responds more strongly to variations in source population and AGN contribution, apparently more efficiently capturing morphological features missed by two-point statistics. The redshift evolution of the bispectrum reflects the increased clustering of ionizing sources at earlier epochs. The sensitivity of the bispectrum to peculiar velocities underscores the importance of velocity corrections in comparisons to observations. Our findings demonstrate that the LAE bispectrum is a powerful higher-order statistic for probing reionization through current and future LAE surveys using telescopes such as Subaru and JWST.

The evolution of interstellar ices can be studied with thermal tracers such as the vibrational modes of CO<sub>2</sub> ice that show great diversity depending on their local chemical and thermal environment. In this work we present JWST observations of the 15.2 &mu;m bending mode, the 4.39 &mu;m stretching mode and the 2.70 &mu;m combination mode of ^12CO<sub>2</sub> and ^13CO<sub>2</sub> ice in the high-mass protostar IRAS 20126 and the low-mass protostar Per-emb 35. The 15.2 &mu;m bending mode of both protostars shows the characteristic double peak profile that is associated with pure CO<sub>2</sub> ice and a sharp short-wavelength peak is observed at 4.38 &mu;m in the ^13CO<sub>2</sub> bands of the two sources. Furthermore, a narrow short-wavelength feature is detected at 2.69 &mu;m in the ^12CO<sub>2</sub> combination mode of Per-emb 35. We perform a consistent profile decomposition on all three vibrational modes and show that the profiles of all three bands can be reproduced with the same linear combination of CO<sub>2</sub> ice in mixtures with mostly CH_3OH and H<sub>2</sub>O ices when the ices undergo segregation due to heating. The findings show that upon heating, CO<sub>2</sub> ice is likely segregating from mostly the water-rich ice layer and the CO<sub>2</sub>-CH_3OH component becomes dominant in all three vibrational modes. Additionally, we find that the contribution of the different CO<sub>2</sub> components to the total absorption band is similar for both ^12CO<sub>2</sub> and ^13CO<sub>2</sub>. This indicates that fractionation processes must not play a significant role during the different formation epochs, H<sub>2</sub>O-dominated and CO-dominated. We quantify the ^12CO<sub>2</sub> and ^13CO<sub>2</sub> ice column densities and derive ^12C/^13C_ice = 90 ± 9 in IRAS 20126. Finally, we report the detection of the ^13CO<sub>2</sub> bending mode of pure CO<sub>2</sub> ice at 15.64 &mu;m in both IRAS 20126 and Per-emb 35.

Water is detected in environments representing every stage of star and solar system formation, but its chemical evolution throughout these stages remains poorly constrained. Deuterium ratios offer a means of probing chemical links between water in different cosmic regions because of their sensitivity to physicochemical conditions. Here, we present the first detection of the 4.1 &mu;m HDO ice feature with JWST toward a low-mass protostar, L1527 IRS, which may eventually grow to a sun-like mass. We measure an ice HDO/H<sub>2</sub>O ratio of 4.4^+3.7_-1.7×10^-3, where the reported error is dominated by uncertainties in continuum definition and ice band strengths. This fraction is similar to the gas HDO/H<sub>2</sub>O ratios measured in the warm (&gt;100 K) inner cores of other low-mass protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks found in comparably isolated star-forming regions. Such a similarity tentatively supports the assumption that water vapor detected in these regions is not significantly altered by gas-phase reactions following ice sublimation. It also supports the hypothesis that pre- and protostellar water ice is largely inherited in a chemically unaltered state by outer protoplanetary disks. However, the fraction is a factor of ~4-10 times higher than the gas HDO/H<sub>2</sub>O ratios measured toward comets and low-mass protostars in clustered star-forming regions. This difference may be due to either gas-phase water reprocessing in protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks, or differences between prestellar conditions of isolated dense cores and the clustered star-forming regions that are more analogous to the environment in which our Sun formed.

<p>
We present a new stellar dynamical measurement of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the compact elliptical galaxy NGC 4486B, based on integral field spectroscopy with JWST/NIRSpec. The two-dimensional kinematic maps reveal a resolved double nucleus and a velocity dispersion peak offset from the photometric center. Utilizing two independent methods-Schwarzschild orbit-superposition and Jeans Anisotropic Modeling-we tightly constrain the black hole mass by fitting the full line-of-sight velocity distribution. Our axisymmetric Schwarzschild models yield a best-fit black hole mass of M_BH = 3.6^+0.6_-0.6 × 10^8   M<sub>&odot;</sub>, slightly lower but significantly more precise than previous estimates. However, since our models do not account for the non-equilibrium nature of the double nucleus, this value may represent a lower limit. The inferred black hole mass corresponds to approximately 4-13% of the total stellar mass, providing robust evidence for an overmassive SMBH in NGC 4486B. Combined with the galaxy's location deep within the Virgo Cluster, our results support the interpretation that NGC 4486B is the tidally stripped remnant core of a formerly massive galaxy. As the JWST/NIRSpec field of view is insufficient to constrain the dark matter halo, we incorporate archival ground-based long-slit kinematics extending to 5 arcsec. While this provides some leverage on the dark matter content, the constraints remain relatively weak. We place only an upper limit on the dark matter fraction, with M_DM/M_* &lt; 0.5 within 1 kpc-well beyond the effective radius. The inferred black hole mass remains unchanged with or without a dark matter halo.

Magnetic fields play a significant role in star-forming processes on core to clump scales. We investigate magnetic field orientations and strengths in the massive star-forming clump P2 within the filamentary infrared dark cloud G28.34+0.06 using dust polarization observations made using SCUBA-2/POL-2 on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as part of the B-field In STar-forming Region Observations (BISTRO) survey. We compare the magnetic field orientations at the clump scale of ~2 parsecs from these JCMT observations with those at the core scale of ~0.2 parsecs from archival ALMA data, finding that the magnetic field orientations on these two different scales are perpendicular to one another. We estimate the distribution of magnetic field strengths, which range from 50 to 430 &mu;G over the clump. The region forming the core shows the highest magnetic field strength. We also obtain the distribution of mass-to-flux ratios across the clump. In the region surrounding the core, the mass-to-flux ratio is larger than 1, which indicates the magnetic field strength is insufficient to support the region against gravitational collapse. Therefore, the change in the magnetic field orientation from clump to core scales may be the result of gravitational collapse, with the field being pulled inward along with the flow of material under gravity.

The \Gamma growth model is an effective parameterization employed across various scientific disciplines and scales to depict growth. It has been demonstrated that the cosmic star formation rate density (CSFRD) can also be described broadly by this pattern, i.e. \fracdM(T) dT = M_z,0  × \frac&beta;^&alpha; \Gamma(&alpha;)   T^&alpha;-1 e^-&beta;   T  M<sub>&odot;</sub> Gyr^-1, where M_z,0 is the stellar mass at z = 0, &alpha; = 3.0, &beta; = 0.5 Gyr^-1 and T describes time. We use the identical \Gamma growth pattern given by the CSFRD to extend the present day (z = 0) stellar mass bins M<sub>&ast;</sub>(T) of the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function (GSMF) and investigate if we are able to reproduce observations for the high redshift GSMFs. Surprisingly, our scheme describes successfully the evolution of the GSMF over 13.5 Gyrs, especially for objects with intermediate and low masses. We observe some deviations that manifest  solely at very high redshifts (z &gt; 1.5, i.e. more than 9.5 Gyr ago) and  specifically for very small and exceedingly massive objects. We discuss the possible solutions (e.g. impacts of mergers) for these offsets. Our formalism suggests that the evolution of the GSMF is set by simple (few parameters) and physically motivated arguments. The parameters &beta; and &alpha; are theoretically consistent within a multi-scale context and are determined from the dynamical time scale (&beta;) and the radial distribution of the accreting matter (&alpha;). We demonstrate that both our formalism and state-of-the-art simulations are consistent with recent GSMFs derived from JWST data at high redshifts.

### 113) [2505.12867](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12867v1): The Dichotomy in the Nuclear and Host Galaxy Properties of High-redshift Quasars

<p> Ruancun Li, Luis C. Ho, Chang-Hao Chen </p>
<p>
The early growth of high-redshift quasars and their host galaxies raises critical questions about their cosmic evolution. We exploit the angular resolution and sensitivity of NIRCam to investigate the host galaxies of 31 quasars at 4≲ z≲7 drawn from multiple JWST surveys. Using a new multi-band forward-modeling code (scGalfitS) that incorporates physically motivated priors, we securely detect and quantify the host emission in 30 objects, while simultaneously characterizing the nuclear spectral energy distribution. The host galaxies of high-redshift quasars are ~ 0.3~dex more compact than star-forming galaxies of comparable mass. A striking dichotomy emerges: luminous "blue'' quasars (L_5100≳10^45 erg s<sup>-1</sup>) reside in bulge-dominated galaxies (n ≈ 5) and exhibit a narrow range of ultraviolet nuclear slopes (median &beta;_UV ≈ -1.4), while fainter "red'' quasars inhabit disk-like hosts (n≈ 1) and display a broad range of slopes (&beta;_UV≈-2 to 4). These two populations differ markedly in their black hole-to-stellar mass ratios, with high-luminosity quasars showing M_BH/M<sub>&ast;</sub> = 1.2&percnt; compared to 4.7&percnt; for lower luminosity sources, placing them collectively ~0.6~dex above the local M_BH-M<sub>&ast;</sub> relation. This offset likely reflects rapid black hole growth in early gas-rich environments, where feedback from the active galactic nucleus becomes effective only after substantial gas depletion. Our findings suggest that the observed dichotomy, whether due to intrinsic spectral differences or dust extinction, fundamentally shapes the coevolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies in the early Universe.

### 114) [2505.12802](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12802v1): Low-Metallicity Star Formation Survey in Sh2-284 (LZ-STAR). II. The inital mass function

<p> M. Andersen, A. Brizawasi, Y. Cheng, J. C. Tan, R. Fedriani, J. J. Armstrong, M. Robberto </p>
<p>
To fully understand the star formation process, we are compelled to study it in a variety of environments. Of particular interest are how star formation and the resulting initial mass function (IMF) vary as a function of metallicity. We have observed an embedded young cluster in Sh2-284 (hereafter S284), the HII region associated with the open cluster Dolidze 25 using JWST/NIRCam with the aim to study star formation in a metal-poor, i.e., about 1/3 of solar, environment. In particular, we aim to measure the peak of the IMF. Using JWST NIRCam photometry, we identified the embedded cluster S284-EC1 and resolved its low-mass content. By comparison with pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks we determine the mass and extinction for the individual cluster members. Extinction limited samples are created based on the distribution of extinction and the completeness of the data. For the region with a completeness of 50% or higher, we have fitted a log-normal distribution to the IMF. Adopting a fiducial age of 1 Myr of the members, the peak of the IMF is found to be at mc = 0.16+-0.02M<sub>&odot;</sub>, which is significantly smaller than the peak mass measured in local young clusters, such as mc = 0.26+0.11-0.07 M<sub>&odot;</sub> in the Orion Nebula Cluster (Gennaro & Robberto 2020), or the local Galactic disk value of mc = 0.25 M<sub>&odot;</sub> (Chabrier 2005). We have found evidence for IMF variation as a function of metallicity, i.e., the peak of the IMF shifts to lower masses as one goes from solar to 1/3 solar metallicity. However, we caution that the result is sensitive to the assumed age of the stellar population, i.e., with peak mass rising if an age older than 1 Myr is adopted. This study further motivates the need for expanded samples of low-metallicity regions and their content to enable more comprehensive measures of the IMF in such environments.

### 115) [2505.12505](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12505v1): Connecting JWST discovered N/O-enhanced galaxies to globular clusters: Evidence from chemical imprints

<p> Xihan Ji, Vasily Belokurov, Roberto Maiolino, Stephanie Monty, Yuki Isobe, Andrey Kravtsov, William McClymont, Hannah Übler </p>
<p>
Recent JWST observations have revealed a growing population of galaxies at z&gt;4 with elevated nitrogen-to-oxygen ratios. These "N/O-enhanced" galaxies (NOEGs) exhibit near- to super-solar N/O at sub-solar O/H, clearly deviating from the well-established scaling relation between N/O and O/H observed in local galaxies. The origin of this abundance anomaly is unclear. Interestingly, local globular clusters also exhibit anomalous light-element abundances, whose origin remains debated. In this work, we compare the chemical abundance patterns of 22 known NOEGs at 0≲ z≲ 12 &ndash; primarily discovered with JWST &ndash; to those observed in local globular clusters. We find striking similarities in the abundances of C, N, O, Fe, and He between the two populations. The similar abundance patterns support the scenario in which globular cluster stars formed within proto-cluster environments &ndash; similar to those traced by NOEGs &ndash; that were self-enriched. Indeed, the enhancement in N/O in early galaxies appears to be only found in dense stellar environments with &Sigma; <sub>&sext;</sub>≳ 10^2.5~M<sub>&odot;</sub>~pc^-2, as expected for the progenitors of globular clusters in the Milky Way, and similar to those of star clusters identified in strongly lensed high-redshift galaxies. Furthermore, we find a tentative positive correlation between N/O ratios and stellar mass among NOEGs. The apparent high occurrence rate of NOEGs at high redshift is consistent with the picture of cluster-dominated star formation during the early stages of galaxy evolution. Measuring chemical abundances across diverse stellar environments in high-redshift galaxies will be crucial for elucidating the connection between NOEGs and globular clusters.

<p> Yurina Nakazato, Kazuyuki Sugimura, Akio K. Inoue, Massimo Ricotti </p>
<p>
Recent multi-wavelength observations by JWST and ALMA are unveiling both ionized and neutral ISM components in high-redshift (z&gt;6) galaxies. In this work, we investigate the origin of rest-frame far-infrared [OIII]88 &mu;m and [CII]158 &mu;m emission by performing zoom-in cosmological simulations of dwarf-galaxy progenitors at z=9-13. Our simulations incorporate on-the-fly radiative transfer at sub-pc (~ 0.1 pc) resolution, allowing us to resolve the multi-phase ISM. We compute emission lines on a cell-by-cell basis, taking into account local temperature, density, metallicity, radiation field strength, column density, and spectral hardness of radiation bins. We find that [OIII] predominantly arises from centrally located ionizing bubbles with temperatures of ~ (1-5)× 10^4 K and high ionization parameters of log U<sub>ion</sub> ≃ -1.5. In contrast, [CII] is produced in the surrounding dense neutral regions at ~ 5× 10^3 K, which are heated by strong FUV radiation from the central stellar clusters. This spatial arrangement leads to large local variations in [OIII]/[CII], ranging from ~ 100 to 0.01. Our galaxy reproduces the global ratio [OIII]/[CII]~5-30, consistent with recent ALMA detections at z&gt;6 without invoking enhanced O/C abundance ratios. We further derive that [OIII]/[CII] linearly scales with the mass and density ratios of ionized to neutral gas, M_HII/M_HI and n_HII/n_HI and show that the [OIII]/[CII] ratio typically changes from 5.7 to 0.3 from high-z to low-z. For future synergies of JWST and ALMA, we derived M_HII/M_HI for observed z &gt;6 galaxies using H&beta; and [CII] and show the validity of our scaling relations.

<p>
Some carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet stars (WC stars) show an infrared excess from dust emission. Dust forms in the collision of the WC wind with a companion star's wind. As this dust is carried towards the ISM at close to the WCd wind speed and the binary continues through its orbit, a spiral structure forms around the system. The shape depends on the orbital eccentricity and period, as well as stellar parameters like mass-loss rates and terminal wind speeds. Imaging of the WCd binary WR 140 with JWST/MIRI revealed 17 concentric dust shells surrounding the binary. We present new JWST imaging of four additional WCd systems (WR 48a, WR 112, WR 125, and WR 137) that were imaged in 2024. In this analysis, we show that the dust is long-lived, detected with an age of at least 130 years, but more than 300 years in some systems. Longer duration measurements are limited by sensitivity. Regular spacing of dust features confirms the periodic nature of dust formation, consistent with a connection to binary motion. We use these images to estimate the proper motion of the dust, finding the dust to propagate out to the interstellar medium with motion comparable to the wind speed of the WC stars. In addition to these results, we observe unusual structures around WR 48a, which could represent dusty clumps shaped by photoevaporation and wind ablation like young proplyd objects. These results demonstrate that WC dust is indeed long-lived and should be accounted for in galactic dust budgets.

JWST has revealed a stunning population of bright galaxies at surprisingly early epochs, z&gt;10, where few such sources were expected. Here we present the most distant example of this class yet &ndash; MoM-z14, a luminous (M_UV=-20.2) source in the COSMOS legacy field at z<sub>spec</sub>=14.44^+0.02_-0.02 that expands the observational frontier to a mere 280 million years after the Big Bang. The redshift is confirmed with NIRSpec/prism spectroscopy through a sharp Lyman-&alpha; break and ≈3&sigma; detections of five rest-UV emission lines. The number density of bright z<sub>spec</sub>≈14-15 sources implied by our "Mirage or Miracle" survey spanning ≈350 arcmin<sup>2</sup> is &gt;100× larger (182^+329_-105×) than pre-JWST consensus models. The high EWs of UV lines (≈15-35 &#8491;) signal a rising star-formation history, with a ≈10× increase in the last 5 Myr (SFR_5Myr/SFR_50Myr=9.9^+3.0_-5.8). The source is extremely compact (circularized r_e = 74^+15_-12 pc), and yet resolved, suggesting an AGN is not the dominant source of light. The steep UV slope (&beta;=-2.5^+0.2_-0.2) implies negligible dust attenuation and a young stellar population. The absence of a strong damping wing may indicate that the immediate surroundings of MoM-z14 are partially ionized at a redshift where virtually every reionization model predicts a ≈100&percnt; neutral fraction. The nitrogen emission and highly super-solar [N/C]&gt;1 hint at an abundance pattern similar to local globular clusters that may have once hosted luminous supermassive stars. Since this abundance pattern is also common among the most ancient stars born in the Milky Way, we may be directly witnessing the formation of such stars in dense clusters, connecting galaxy evolution across the entire sweep of cosmic time.

Determining how much mass is removed by stellar winds is crucial to understanding massive star evolution and feedback. However, traditional spectroscopic diagnostics in the UV and optical are not sensitive enough to characterize weak stellar winds of OB stars in low-metallicity environments. A new tool to access weak stellar winds is provided by spectroscopy in the infrared (IR). Stellar atmosphere models indicate that the hydrogen Br&alpha; line at &lambda; 4.05 &mu;m is a useful mass-loss rate indicator, particularly at low metallicity. The unprecedented capabilities of the NIRSpec spectrograph on board of the phJames Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allow us to measure this line in spectra of massive stars in other galaxies. In this work, we present the first NIRSpec spectra of O-type stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), which has a metallicity of only 20&percnt; Solar. Our sample consists of thirteen stars with spectral types ranging from O2 to O9.5 including supergiants, giants, and dwarfs. The stars belong to NGC 346, the most massive young cluster in the SMC. We describe the observing strategy and data reduction, highlighting the treatment of the nebular background emission. The spectra cover the 2.8&ndash;5.1 &mu;m wavelength range, and we detect the Br&alpha; line in emission in each of our sample stars. Using a combination of spectral and photometric data ranging from the UV to the IR, we improve the measurements of stellar luminosity and reddening. A first qualitative comparison of the observed Br&alpha; line with stellar atmosphere models shows its potential as a wind diagnostic for weak-winded stars.

### 120) [2505.10701](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10701v1): Origins of Carbon Dust in a JWST-Observed Primeval Galaxy at z~6.7

<p> Ambra Nanni, Michael Romano, Darko Donevski, Joris Witstok, Irene Shivaei, Michel Fioc, Prasad Sawant </p>
<p>
JADES-GS-z6-0, a high-redshift galaxy (z ~ 6.7) recently observed as part of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), exhibits a distinct bump in its rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) spectrum indicative of a large quantity of hydrocarbon grains, a sign of rapid metal and dust enrichment in its interstellar medium (ISM). This galaxy serves as an ideal case for examining rapid dust formation processes in the early universe. We investigated diverse dust production channels from a possible maximal formation redshift of z_form ≈ 17, enabling dust contributions from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars over the longest possible timescale. Our model simultaneously reproduces key spectral features of JADES-GS-z6-0 such as its Balmer decrement, UV slope, and UV bump. The match is obtained by adopting a star-formation history in which a burst at ~ 600~Myr accounts for approximately 30&percnt; of the galaxy's final stellar mass. Our findings indicate two pathways for the formation of hydrocarbon grains, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs): (1) efficient dust accretion within the ISM, necessitating a low depletion of metals into dust grains from Type II supernovae (≈ 10&percnt;), or (2) dust production predominantly by Type II supernovae, requiring a high depletion fraction (≈ 73&percnt;) without dust accretion. We further demonstrate that PAHs are unlikely to originate solely from AGB stars or from shattering of large grains in the ISM. The evolution of the UV slope with redshift points to a complex and bursty star formation history for galaxies observed by JADES.

### 121) [2505.10632](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10632v1): Measuring Emission Lines with JWST-MegaScience Medium-Bands: A New Window into Dust and Star Formation at Cosmic Noon

We demonstrate the power of JWST-NIRCam medium-band photometry to measure emission line fluxes and study dust and star formation properties of galaxies at cosmic noon. In this work, we present photometric emission line measurements and spatially-resolved maps of H&alpha; and Pa&beta; for a sample of 14 galaxies at 1.3≤ z≤ 2.4, observed by the MegaScience medium-band survey and the UNCOVER deep spectroscopic survey. We measure line fluxes directly from the medium-band photometry and compare with spectroscopic measurements from UNCOVER. We find reasonable agreement between the photometric and spectroscopic emission line fluxes for both H&alpha; and Pa&beta;, with scatter &lt;0.15 dex down to emission line equivalent widths of 10&#8491;. We also make a nebular dust measurement from the ratio Pa&beta; / H&alpha;, finding an average nebular A_V of 1.4. Our photometric A_V measurements show a slightly larger scatter of 0.5 magnitudes when compared to spectroscopic measurements; however, this scatter may be partially caused by aperture effects. Finally, we produce spatially resolved maps of H&alpha; emission, Pa&beta; emission, and stellar continuum. We find that offsets in H&alpha; and Pa&beta; emission are common, especially for galaxies with the highest A_V, indicating dusty sub-structures. Furthermore, the correlation between H&alpha; and continuum emission decreases with increasing A_V, suggesting that the dustiest objects have clumpy dust and star formation distributions. Our study demonstrates the power of medium-band photometry to directly probe emission line strengths, star formation, and dust attenuation for hundreds of galaxies in UNCOVER and thousands of galaxies in upcoming JWST medium-band surveys.

### 122) [2505.09941](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09941v1): Supermassive black hole mass measurement in the spiral galaxy NGC 4736 Using JWST/NIRSpec stellar kinematics

<p>
We present accurate mass measurements of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) in NGC 4736 (M 94). We used the "gold-standard" stellar absorption features (CO band heads) at ~2.3 &mu; m, as opposed to gas emission lines, to trace the dynamics in the nuclear region, easily resolving the SMBH's sphere of influence. The analysis uses observations made with the integral field unit of the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on the  James Webb Space Telescope and a surface brightness profile derived from  Hubble Space Telescope archival images. We used Jeans anisotropic models within a Bayesian framework, and comprehensive Markov chain Monte Carlo optimization, to determine the best-fit black hole mass, orbital anisotropy, mass-to-light ratio, and nucleus kinematical inclination. We obtained a SMBH mass M_BH=(1.60±0.16)×10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub> (1&sigma; random error), which is consistent with the M_BH-&sigma; and M_BH-M<sub>&sext;</sub> relations. This is the first dynamical measurement of a M_BH in NGC 4736 based on the stellar kinematics observed with NIRSpec. We thus settle a longstanding inconsistency between estimates based on nuclear emission-line tracers and the M_BH-&sigma; relation. Our analysis shows that NIRSpec can detect SMBHs with M_BH,min≈ 5×10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> in galaxies within 5 Mpc and &sigma;≈100 km s<sup>-1</sup>

### 123) [2505.09888](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09888v1): VUV Processing of Nitrile Ice: Direct Comparison of Branching in Ice and TPD Spectra

<p> Travis J. Hager, Bailey M. Moore, Quentin D. Borengasser, Kyle T. Renshaw, Rachel Johnson, Anudha C. Kanaherarachchi, Bernadette M. Broderick </p>
<p>
The interplay between radiation chemistry and sublimation dynamics of condensed organic compounds on cold grains is fundamental to describe observed gas-phase and ice-phase molecular abundances in the ISM. Infrared measurements are generally used to identify molecules synthesized in irradiated ices in lab experiments, while mass spectrometric techniques have been used to monitor the products following temperature programmed desorption. The IR measurements are often used quantitatively to monitor chemical transformation of ices during the course of irradiation, but the gas phase methods applied with TPD generally do not permit quantitative branching determination. Here we combine reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) of ices with broadband rotational spectroscopy of the sublimed products, to study the branching of photoproducts produced by the VUV irradiation of condensed CH3CN and CH3CH2CN ices. This permits direct comparison between the ice-phase and gas-phase branching following temperature programmed desorption. This comparison is analogous to astronomical observations of ices in protostellar disks such as by the James Webb Space Telescope employed in conjunction with ALMA observations in the corresponding warm-up regions of the same objects. In the condensed CH3CN VUV processed ices we quantified the HCN, CH3NC, CH2CCNH, CH3NH2, and CH4 abundances. The CH3CH2CN ices also readily produced the corresponding isocyanide and HCN in addition to a significant yield of CH2CHCN. The ethyl cyanide ice produced CH3CHNH rather than CH3NH2 and no CH4 formation was observed. In the gas phase we detected the isocyanides, HCN and vinyl cyanide. The ice and gas phase relative abundances could be brought into agreement if the unknown IR band strength of the isocyanides C-N stretch is assumed to be ~3 times larger than that of the cyanides.

### 124) [2505.09728](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09728v1): A PAH deficit in the starburst core of a distant spiral galaxy

<p>
We present high-resolution and spatially-matched observations with JWST and ALMA of a starburst galaxy (PACS-830) at z=1.46. The NIRCam observations mainly trace the stellar light while the CO (J=5&ndash;4) observations map the dense molecular gas at kpc scales. Both datasets reveal the morphology to be that of a gas/dust rich bulge with two extending arms, together resembling a grand-design spiral galaxy. The more pronounced arm contributes 21 ± 6&percnt; of the total CO emission. These results demonstrate that starburst activity at high redshift can be triggered, without undergoing a highly disruptive major merger. We assess the strength and distribution of star formation using two tracers: (1) Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) emission detected at 8~&mu;m (L_8) with a MIRI/F1800W image, and (2) L_IR, inferred from the CO (J=5&ndash;4) map. The spatial profiles of the L_IR and L_8 are dissimilar, thus leading to a significant deficit of mid-IR (L_8) emission in the nucleus. We hypothesize that this is due to the destruction of PAH molecules by the intense ionizing radiation field or decreased emission in the photodissociation region, as seen in nearby star-forming regions and consistent with the galaxy-wide properties of distant starbursts. This study reveals spatial variations in the L_8 to L_IR ratio for the first time at z&gt;1, in agreement with expectations from theory. Our analysis underscores the pivotal role of joint high-resolution observations with JWST and ALMA in discerning the different phases of the interstellar medium (ISM) and revealing internal physics in galaxy substructures.

### 125) [2505.09703](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09703v1): SCUBADive II: Searching for z&gt;4 Dust-Obscured Galaxies via F150W-Dropouts in COSMOS-Web

<p>
The role of dust in the cosmic star formation budget remains highly uncertain, especially at z&gt;4, where accurate bookkeeping of the dust-obscured component proves difficult. We address this shortcoming with SCUBADive, a compilation of the \jwst counterparts of (sub-)millimeter galaxies, in order to further analyze the distribution and properties of massive dust-obscured galaxies at early times. In this paper, we present a subset of SCUBADive, focusing on 60 "dark'' galaxies that dropout at 1.5\micron. Motivated by \jwst observations of AzTECC71, a far-infrared bright F150W-dropout with z<sub>phot</sub>=5.7^+0.8_-0.7, we complete a systematic search of F150W-dropouts with SCUBA-2 and ALMA detections to find the highest redshift dusty galaxies. Within our subsample, 16 are most similar to AzTECC71 due to faint F444W magnitudes (&gt;24 mag) and lack of counterparts in COSMOS2020. Despite high star formation rates (&langle;SFR&rangle;=550^+500_-360 \mdot yr^-1) and large stellar masses (&langle;log_10(\mstar)&rangle;=11.2^+0.5_-0.4 \mdot), these galaxies may not be particularly extreme for their presumed epochs according to offsets from the main sequence. We find that heavily obscured galaxies, which have inadvertently been omitted by past galaxy evolution studies, comprise roughly 20&percnt; of their host population by mass. This population may, however, contribute significantly to the high mass end (log_10(\mstar/\mdot)&gt;11) of the z&gt;4 stellar mass function as up to 60&percnt; could have been missed from previous studies.

### 126) [2505.09669](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09669v1): Chandra Rules Out Super-Eddington Accretion For Little Red Dots

<p> Andrea Sacchi, Akos Bogdan </p>
<p>
One of the most puzzling discoveries by JWST is the population of high-redshift, red, and compact galaxies dubbed little red dots (LRDs). Based on broad-line diagnostics, these galaxies have been argued to host accreting 10^7-10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> supermassive black holes (SMBHs), a claim with crucial consequences for our understanding of how the first black holes form and grow over cosmic time. A key feature of LRDs is their extreme X-ray weakness: analyses of individual and stacked sources have yielded non-detections or only tentative, inconclusive X-ray signals, except for a handful of individual cases. As the most natural explanation, high obscuration, is disfavored by JWST spectroscopic evidence, several authors have suggested that the X-ray weakness of LRDs is intrinsic, due to super-Eddington accretion rates. In this work, we test that scenario by stacking X-ray data for 55 LRDs in the Chandra Deep Field South, accumulating a total exposure time of nearly 400 Ms. Despite reaching unprecedented X-ray depths, our stack still yields a non-detection. The corresponding upper limits are deep enough to rule out current super-Eddington accretion models, and are compatible only with extremely high levels of obscuration (N_H≳10^25~cm<sup>2</sup>). To explain the X-ray weakness of LRDs, we therefore speculate that the SMBHs in these systems are neither as massive nor as luminous as currently believed.

### 127) [2505.09542](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09542v2): A weak Lyα halo for an extremely bright Little Red Dot. Indications of enshrouded SMBH growth

<p>
The abundant population of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs)-compact objects with red UV to optical colors and broad Balmer lines at high redshift-is unveiling new insights into the properties of early active galactic nuclei (AGN). Perhaps the most surprising features of this population are the presence of Balmer absorption and ubiquitous strong Balmer breaks. Recent models link these features to an active supermassive black hole (SMBH) cocooned in very dense gas (N_H~10^24 cm<sup>2</sup>). We present a stringent test of such models using VLT/MUSE observations of A2744-45924, the most luminous LRD known to date (L_H&alpha;≈10^44~erg s<sup>-1</sup>), located behind the Abell-2744 lensing cluster at z=4.464 (&mu;=1.8). We detect a moderately extended Ly&alpha; nebula (h≈5.7 pkpc), spatially offset from the point-like H&alpha; seen by JWST. The Ly&alpha; emission is narrow (FWHM=270± 15~km s<sup>-1</sup>), spatially offset to H&alpha;, and faint (Ly&alpha;=0.07H&alpha;) compared to Ly&alpha; nebulae typically observed around quasars of similar luminosity. We detect compact N IV]&lambda;1486 emission, spatially aligned with H&alpha;, and a spatial shift in the far-UV continuum matching the Ly&alpha; offset. We discuss that H&alpha; and Ly&alpha; have distinct physical origins: H&alpha; originates from the AGN, while Ly&alpha; is powered by star formation. In the environment of A2744-45924, we identify four extended Ly&alpha; halos (&Delta; z&lt;0.02, &Delta; r&lt;100 pkpc). Their Ly&alpha; luminosities match expectations based on H&alpha; emission, indicating no evidence for radiation from A2744-45924 affecting its surroundings. The lack of strong, compact, and broad Ly&alpha; and the absence of a luminous extended halo, suggest that the UV AGN light is obscured by dense gas cloaking the SMBH with covering factor close to unity.

### 128) [2505.09510](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09510v1): A 70 pc-Diameter Nova Super-remnant Surrounding the Recurrent Nova RS Ophiuchi

<p>
Recurrent novae undergo thermonuclear-powered eruptions separated by less than 100 years, enabled by subgiant or red giant donors transferring hydrogen-rich matter at very high rates onto their massive white dwarf companions. The most-rapidly moving parts of envelopes ejected in successive recurrent nova events are predicted to overtake and collide with the slowest ejecta of the previous eruption, leading to the buildup of vast (~ 10 - 100 parsec) super-remnants surrounding all recurrent novae; but only three examples are currently known. We report deep narrowband imaging and spectroscopy which has revealed a ~ 70-parsec-diameter shell surrounding the frequently recurring nova RS Ophiuchi. We estimate the super-remnant mass to be ~ 20 - 200 solar masses, expanding at a few tens of km/s, with an age of order 50-100 kyr. Its extremely low surface brightness and large angular size help explain the hitherto surprising absence of nova super-remnants. Our results support the prediction that ALL recurrent novae are surrounded by similar extended structures.

<p>
We present a JWST and ALMA detailed study of the ISM properties of high-redshift galaxies. Our JWST/NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy targeting three galaxies at z=6-7 detects key rest-frame optical emission lines, allowing us to derive [OII]&lambda;&lambda;3726,3729-based electron densities of n_e,optical~1000 cm^-3 on average and [OIII]&lambda;4363-based metallicities of 12+log(O/H)=8.0-8.2 in two galaxies. New ALMA Band 9/10 observations detect the [OIII]52&mu;m line in one galaxy but do not in the others, resulting in FIR-based densities of n_e,FIR≲500 cm^-3 from the [OIII]52&mu;m/[OIII]88&mu;m ratios, systematically lower than the optical [OII]-based measurements. These low FIR-based densities are comparable to those at both z~0 and z&gt;6 in the literature, including JADES-GS-z14-0 at z=14.18, suggesting little evolution up to z~14, in contrast to the increasing trend of optical-based densities with redshift. By conducting a JWST and ALMA joint analysis using emission lines detected with both telescopes, we find that the observed FIR [OIII]52,88&mu;m luminosities are too high to be explained by the optical-based densities at which they would be significantly collisionally de-excited. Instead, a 2-zone model with distinct high- and low-density regions is required to reproduce all observed lines, indicating that FIR [OIII] emission arises predominantly from low-density gas, while optical [OIII] and [OII] lines trace both regions. We further demonstrate that the direct-T_e method can sometimes significantly underestimate metallicities up to 0.8 dex due to the presence of the low-density gas not fully traced by optical lines alone, highlighting the importance of combining optical and FIR lines to accurately determine gas-phase metallicities in the early universe.

They are believed to be analogues of high-redshift galaxies that re-ionised the universe and, indeed, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is now uncovering such populations at record redshifts. Intriguingly, JWST finds evidence suggestive of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in many of these distant galaxies, including the elusive Little Red Dots, that broadly lack any detectable X-ray counterparts. Intuitively, one would expect to detect an AGN in their low-redshift analogues with X-rays, yet no study to date has conclusively identified an X-ray AGN within a Green Pea galaxy. Here we present the deepest X-ray campaign of a Green Pea galaxy performed to date, obtained with the goal of discerning the presence of a (potentially low-luminosity) AGN. The target - SDSS J082247.66 +224144.0 (J0822+2241 hereafter) - was previously found to display a comparable X-ray spectral shape to more local AGN (\Gamma ~ 2) and a high luminosity (L_2-10 keV ~ 10^42 erg s<sup>-1</sup>). We show that over 6.2 years (rest-frame), the 2-10 keV luminosity of J0822+2241 is constant, whereas the soft 0.5-2 keV flux has decreased significantly by ~60%. We discuss possible scenarios to explain the X-ray properties of J0822+2241, finding transient low-column density obscuration surrounding an AGN to be the only plausible scenario. J0822+2241 thus provides further evidence that low-luminosity AGN activity could have contributed to the epoch of reionisation, and that local analogues are useful to derive a complete multi-wavelength picture of black hole growth in high redshift low luminosity AGN.

<p>
We present JWST NIRCam observations of the emerging young star clusters (eYSCs) detected in the nearby spiral galaxy M83. The NIRcam mosaic encompasses the nuclear starburst, the bar, and the inner spiral arms. The eYSCs, detected in Pa&alpha; and Br&alpha; maps, have been largely missed in previous optical campaigns of young star clusters (YSCs). We distinguish between eYSCI, if they also have compact 3.3~&mu;m PAH emission associated to them, and eYSCII, if they only appear as compact Pa&alpha; emitters. We find that the variations in the 3.3~&mu;m PAH feature are consistent with an evolutionary sequence where eYSCI evolve into eYSCII and then optical YSCs. This sequence is clear in the F300M-F335M (tracing the excess in the \PAHlambda feature) and the F115W-F187N (tracing the excess in Pa&alpha;) colors which become increasingly bluer as clusters emerge. The central starburst stands out as the region where the most massive eYSCs are currently forming in the galaxy. We estimate that only about 20~&percnt; of the eYSCs will remain detectable as compact YSCs. Combining eYSCs and YSCs (≤10 Myr) we recover an average clearing timescale of 6~Myr in which clusters transition from embedded to fully exposed. We see evidence of shorter emergence timescales (~5~Myr) for more massive (&gt;5×10^3 \msun) clusters, while star clusters of ~ 10^3 \msun about 7~Myr. We estimate that eYSCs remain associated to the \PAHlambda emission 3&ndash;4~Myr. Larger samples of eYSC and YSC populations will provide stronger statistics to further test environmental and cluster mass dependencies on the emergence timescale.

Early results from JWST suggest that epoch-of-reionization (EoR) galaxies produce copious ionizing photons, which, if they escape efficiently, could cause reionization to occur too early. We study this problem using JWST imaging and prism spectroscopy for 426 galaxies at 4.5 &lt; z &lt; 9.0. We fit these data simultaneously with stellar&ndash;population and nebular&ndash;emission models that include a parameter for the fraction of ionizing photons that escape the galaxy, f<sub>esc</sub>. We find that the ionization production efficiency,  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  = Q(H) / L(UV), increases with redshift and decreasing UV luminosity, but shows significant scatter, &sigma;( log  &xi;<sub>ion</sub> ) ~= 0.3 dex. The inferred escape fractions averaged over the population are &langle; f<sub>esc</sub> &rangle; = 3 +± 1% with no indication of evolution over 4.5 &lt; z &lt; 9.0. This implies that in our models nearly all of the ionizing photons need to be absorbed to account for the nebular emission. We compute the impact of our results on reionization, including the distributions for  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  and f<sub>esc</sub>, and the evolution and uncertainty of the UV luminosity function. Considering galaxies brighter than M(UV) &lt; -16 mag, we would produce an IGM hydrogen-ionized fraction of x_e=0.5 at 5.5 &lt; z &lt; 7.1, possibly too late compared to constraints from from QSO sightlines. Including fainter galaxies, M(UV) &lt; -14 mag, we obtain x_e = 0.5 at 6.7 &lt; z &lt; 9.6, fully consistent with QSO and CMB data. This implies that EoR galaxies produce plenty of ionizing photons, but these do not efficiently escape. This may be a result of high gas column densities combined with burstier star-formation histories, which limit the time massive stars are able to clear channels through the gas for ionizing photons to escape.

<p>
Active galactic nuclei (AGNi) are a key ingredient in galaxy evolution and possibly shape galaxy growth through the generation of powerful outflows. Little is known regarding AGN-driven ionized outflows in moderate-luminosity AGNi (logLbol[erg/s]&lt;47) beyond cosmic noon (z&gt;3). We present the first systematic analysis of the ionized outflow properties of a sample of X-ray-selected AGNi (logLx[erg/s]&gt;44) from the COSMOS-Legacy field at z~3.5 and with logLbol[erg/s]=45.2-46.7, by using JWST NIRSpec/IFU spectroscopic observations as part of the GA-NIFS program. We spectrally isolated and spatially resolved the ionized outflows, through a multi-component kinematic decomposition of the rest-frame optical emission lines. JWST/NIRSpec IFU data also revealed a wealth of close-by companions, of both non-AGN and AGN nature, and ionized gas streams likely tracing tidal structures and large-scale ionized gas nebulae, extending up to the circumgalactic medium. Ionized outflows are detected in all COS-AGNi targets, which we compared with results from the literature up to z~3, opportunely (re-)computed. We normalized outflow energetics (M&#775;_out, \dotE_out) to the outflow density in order to standardize the various assumptions that were made in the literature. Our choice is equal to assuming that each outflow has the same gas density. We find GA-NIFS AGNi to show outflows consistent with literature results, within the large scatter shown by the collected measurements, thus suggesting no strong evolution with redshift in terms of total mass outflow rate, energy budget, and outflow velocity for fixed bolometric luminosity. Moreover, we find no clear redshift evolution of the ratio of mass outflow rate and kinetic power over AGN bolometric luminosity beyond z&gt;1. In general, our results indicate no significant evolution of the physics driving outflows beyond z~3.[abridged]

### 134) [2505.08858](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08858v2): Ages and metallicities of quiescent galaxies: confronting broadband (UVJ) colours with stellar absorption lines

<p>
For decades, studying quiescent galaxies beyond z~1 has been challenging due to the reliance on photometric spectral energy distributions, which are highly susceptible to degeneracies between age, metallicity, dust, and star-formation history. Only recently has deep, rest-frame, optical spectroscopy made robust metallicity and age measurements possible, allowing us to empirically assess their effects on continuum shapes. To this end, we measure ages and metallicities of ~700 massive (10.2≲log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≲11.8), quiescent galaxies at 0.6≲ z≲1.0 from the Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census (LEGA-C) via continuum-normalized, absorption-line spectra, and compare with independent rest-frame U-V and V-J colours. Age increases along the quiescent sequence as both colours redden, consistent with stellar population synthesis (SPS) model predictions. Metallicity increases perpendicularly to the age trend, with higher metallicities at redder U-V and bluer V-J colours. Thus, age and metallicity behave differently in the UVJ diagram. Moreover, this trend conflicts with SPS model expectations of increasing metallicity approximately along the quiescent sequence. Independent dynamical mass-to-light ratio trends also differ dramatically from SPS model predictions. These results demonstrate that relying on model fits to continuum shapes alone may lead to systematic biases in ages, metallicities, and stellar masses. The cause of these data-model disparities may stem from non-solar abundance patterns in quiescent galaxies or the treatment of evolved stellar phases in the models. Resolving these discrepancies is crucial, as photometric data remain central even with JWST.

<p>
The embedded phase is a crucial period in the development of a young star. Mid-IR observations, now possible with JWST with unprecedented sensitivity, spectral resolution and sharpness are key for probing many physical and chemical processes on sub-arcsecond scales. JOYS addresses a wide variety of questions, from protostellar accretion and the nature of primeval jets, winds and outflows, to the chemistry of gas and ice, and the characteristics of embedded disks. We introduce the program and show representative results. MIRI-MRS data of 17 low-mass and 6 high-mass protostars show a wide variety of features. Atomic line maps differ among refractory (e.g., Fe), semi-refractory (e.g., S) and volatile elements (e.g., Ne), linked to their different levels of depletion and local (shock) conditions. Nested, stratified jet structures consisting of an inner ionized core seen in [Fe II] with an outer H2 layer are commonly seen. Wide-angle winds are found in low-J H2 lines. [S I] follows the jet in the youngest protostars, but is concentrated on source when more evolved. [Ne II] reveals a mix of jet shock and photoionized emission. H I lines measure accretion, but are also associated with jets. Molecular emission (CO2, C2H2, HCN, H2O, ..) is cool compared with disks, and likely associated with hot cores. Deep ice absorption features reveal not just the major ice components but also ions (as part of salts) and complex organic molecules, with comparable abundances from low- to high-mass sources. A second detection of HDO ice in a solar-mass source is presented with HDO/H2O ~ 0.4%, providing a link with disks and comets. A deep search for solid O2 suggests it is not a significant oxygen reservoir. Only few embedded Class I disks show the same forest of water lines as Class II disks do, perhaps due to significant dust extinction of the upper layers [abridged].

We study the Mpc-scale environments of the three highest redshift luminous quasars at z≥ 7.5 (J031343.84-180636.40, J134208.11+092838.61, and J100758.27+211529.21) to understand their connection to large-scale structure. Cosmological simulations show that these early supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are expected to form in the most massive dark matter halos. Therefore, it is expected that they are anchors of galaxy overdensities if luminous matter traces the underlying dark matter structure of the Universe. Using JWST NIRCam (F090W/F115W/F250M/F360M/F430M) imaging, we observe the large-scale structure out to ~13 comoving Mpc around these quasars. We select F090W-dropout Lyman Break galaxies (LBGs) and F430M-excess [OIII] emitters in the three fields. We find 18, 21, and 6 LBG candidates in the fields of J0313, J1342, and J1007, respectively, resulting in a wide range of overdensities (1+&delta; ~ 19, 24, and 7). The photometric redshifts indicate serendipitous foreground and background overdensities in the J0313 field. The joint angular autocorrelation of the combined LBG sample shows significant clustering on &lt;1.8 comoving Mpc scales, demonstrating that the selected galaxies are likely associated with the large-scale structure surrounding the quasars. This first systematic study of z~ 7.5 quasars shows a diverse set of quasar environments at the onset of their formation, providing empirical data to help constrain theoretical predictions of early structure formation.

### 137) [2505.07935](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07935v1): Synthetic Clones of the Most Distant Galaxies in the Universe

<p> Mahsa Kohandel, Andrea Pallottini, Andrea Ferrara </p>
<p>
Synergies between JWST and ALMA are unveiling a population of bright, super-early (z&gt;10) galaxies, including systems like GS-z14-0 (z=14.2) and GHZ2 (z=12.3) with extreme FIR line ratios ([OIII]88&mu; m/[CII]158&mu; m &gt; 3) that challenge galaxy formation models. To clarify this issue, we identify in the SERRA zoom-in simulations a synthetic analogue, Amaryllis, of these sources, and track its evolution from z=16 to z=7. During this period, Amaryllis grows from log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ~ 7.4 to 10.3, linking super-early progenitors to the massive galaxy population at the end of reionization. At z=11.5, Amaryllis closely matches the observed properties of GS-z14-0, including M<sub>&sext;</sub>, SFR, and the luminosity of FIR ([OIII]88&mu;m) and UV (e.g. CIII]1908) lines. We find that high [OIII]/[CII] ratios appear during short, merger-driven starburst episodes, when low metallicity (Z ~ 0.02 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) and high ionization conditions (U<sub>ion</sub> ~ 0.1) push the ISM far from equilibrium. These extreme FIR line ratios are thus transient and linked to major mergers that ignite strong ionized gas outflows. Despite such a dynamically violent environment, strikingly, Amaryllis develops a dynamically cold gaseous disk (V/&sigma; ~ 4-6) as early as z ~ 11, while its stellar component remains dispersion-dominated down to z~7. The co-existence of ordered rotation and merger-driven disturbances in z&gt;10 galaxies can explain the tentative disk signatures in GS-z14-0.

### 138) [2505.07749](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07749v1): Emission Line Diagnostics for IMBHs in Dwarf Galaxies: Accounting for BH Seeding and ULX Excitation

<p>
Dwarf AGN serve as the ideal systems for identifying intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) down to the most elusive regimes (~ 10^3 - 10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>). However, the ubiquitously metal-poor nature of dwarf galaxies gives rise to ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) that can mimic the spectral signatures of IMBH excitation. We present a novel photoionization model suite that simultaneously incorporates IMBHs and ULXs in a metal-poor, highly star-forming environment. We account for changes in M_BH according to formation seeding channels and metallicity, and changes in ULX populations with post-starburst age and metallicity. We find that broadband X-rays and UV emission lines are insensitive to M_BH and largely unable to distinguish between ULXs and IMBHs. Many optical diagnostic diagrams cannot correctly identify dwarf AGN. The notable exceptions include He~II~&lambda;4686 and [O~I]~&lambda;6300, for which we redefine typical demarcations to account for ULX contributions. Emission lines in the mid-IR show the most promise in separating stellar, ULX, IMBH, and shock excitation while presenting sensitivity to M_BH and f_AGN. Overall, our results expose the potential biases in identifying and characterizing dwarf AGN purely on strong line ratios and diagnostic diagrams rather than holistically evaluating the entire spectrum. As a proof of concept, we argue that recently discovered over-massive BHs in high-z JWST AGN might not represent the overall BH population, with many galaxies in these samples potentially being falsely classified as purely star-forming.

<p>
Context. We present simulations of a massive young star cluster using scNbody6++GPU and scMOCCA. The cluster is initially more compact than previously published models, with one million stars, a total mass of 5.86 × 10^5~M<sub>&odot;</sub>, and a half-mass radius of 0.1~pc. Aims. We analyse the formation and growth of a very massive star (VMS) through successive stellar collisions and investigate the subsequent formation of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the core of a dense star cluster. Methods. We use both direct itN-body and Monte Carlo simulations, incorporating updated stellar evolution prescriptions (SSE/BSE) tailored to massive stars and VMSs. These include revised treatments of stellar radii, rejuvenation, and mass loss during collisions. While the prescriptions represent reasonable extrapolations into the VMS regime, the internal structure and thermal state of VMSs formed through stellar collisions remain uncertain, and future work may require further refinement. Results. We find that runaway stellar collisions in the cluster core produce a VMS exceeding 5 × 10^4~M<sub>&odot;</sub> within 5 Myr, which subsequently collapses into an IMBH. Conclusions. Our model suggests that dense stellar environments may enable the formation of very massive stars and massive black hole seeds through runaway stellar collisions. These results provide a potential pathway for early black hole growth in star clusters and offer theoretical context for interpreting recent JWST observations of young, compact clusters at high redshift.

### 140) [2505.06965](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06965v1): Black Hole Envelopes in Little Red Dots

<p> Daisaburo Kido, Kunihito Ioka, Kenta Hotokezaka, Kohei Inayoshi, Christopher M. Irwin </p>
<p>
Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope have uncovered a population of compact, red object (z~ 4&ndash;7) known as little red dots (LRDs). The presence of broad Balmer emission lines indicates active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes (BHs), while LRDs exhibit unusually weak X-ray and radio emission and low variability, suggesting super-Eddington accretion that obscures the central engine. We suggest that such an extreme accretion disc inevitably drives strong outflows, which would disrupt the LRDs themselves unless confined within the nuclear region &ndash; posing a general feedback problem for overmassive BHs. To resolve this, we propose that the BH is embedded in a massive, optically thick envelope that gravitationally confines the outflow, making any outflow a no-go. This envelope, powered by accretion on to the BH, radiates at nearly the Eddington limit, and is sustained by an infall of the interstellar medium at a rate on the order of ~ 1 M<sub>&odot;</sub>~yr^-1. A photosphere emerges either within the envelope or in the infalling medium, with a characteristic temperature of 5000 - 7000 K, near the Hayashi limit. The resulting blackbody emission naturally explains the red optical continuum of the distinct V-shaped spectrum observed in most LRDs. Furthermore, the dynamical time-scale at the photosphere, ~ 0.01~pc, is consistent with the observed year-scale variabilities. The nuclear structure and spectral features of LRDs are shaped by this envelope, which not only regulates feedback but also acts as a gas reservoir that sustains rapid BH growth in the early universe.

The role of mergers in the evolution of massive black holes is still unclear, and their dynamical evolution, from the formation of pairs to binaries and the final coalescence, carries large physical uncertainties. The identification of the elusive population of close massive binary black holes (MBBHs) is crucial to understand the importance of mergers in the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes. It has been proposed that MBBHs may display periodic optical/ultra-violet variability. Optical surveys provide photometric measurements of a large variety of objects, over decades and searching for periodicities coming from galaxies in their long-term optical/UV lightcurves may help identify new MBBH candidates. Using the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS) and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data, we studied the long-term periodicity of variable sources in the centre of galaxies identified using the galaxy catalogue Glade+. We report 36 MBBHs candidates, with sinusoidal variability with amplitudes between 0.1 and 0.8 magnitudes over 3-5 cycles, through fitting 15 years of data. The periodicities are also detected when adding a red noise contribution to the sine model. Moreover, the periodicities are corroborated through Generalized Lomb Scargle (GLS) periodograms analysis, providing supplementary evidence for the observed modulation. We also indicate 58 objects, that were previously proposed to be MBBH candidates from analysis of CRTS data only. Adding ZTF data clearly shows that the previously claimed modulation is due to red noise. We also created a catalogue of 221 weaker candidates which require further observations over the coming years to help validate their nature. Based on our 36 MBBHs candidates, we expect ~20 MBBHs at z&lt;1, which is commensurate with simulations. Further observations will help confirm these results.

### 142) [2505.06359](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06359v1): JWST/NIRSpec Observations of High Ionization Emission Lines in Galaxies at High Redshift

<p>
JWST spectroscopy has built large emission line samples at z≳4, but it has yet to confidently reveal many galaxies with the hard radiation fields commonly associated with AGN photoionization. While this may indicate a weaker UV ionizing spectrum in many z&gt;4 AGNs or obscuration from dense neutral gas and dust, the complete picture remains unclear owing to the small number of deep rest-UV spectra. Here we characterize the strength of high ionization lines in 53 new galaxies observed with NIRSpec R=2700 grating spectroscopy. We present new detections of narrow NV&lambda;1240 in two galaxies. One is a previously-confirmed z=6.98 Little Red Dot (LRD) with broad H&beta;, and the other is a z=8.72 galaxy with a narrow line spectrum. Neither source exhibits CIV or HeII emission, indicating large NV/CIV and NV/HeII ratios that may reflect a combination of nitrogen-enhancement and resonant scattering effects. We investigate the incidence of narrow high ionization lines in a large database of 851 NIRSpec grating spectra, and we separately quantify the fraction of LRDs with narrow high ionization UV emission lines. Our results likely suggest that hard radiation fields are indeed present in a small subset of LRDs (12.5^+23.7_-10.4&percnt;) and UV-selected galaxies (2.2^+1.7_-1.0&percnt;) at z&gt;4. The identification of narrow high ionization lines in the population of LRDs with strong Balmer absorption suggests the dense neutral hydrogen gas may not uniformly cover the nucleus. The NV/CIV and NV/HeII ratios suggest that efforts to identify high ionization lines should extend down in wavelength to the NV doublet.

JWST observations uncovered a large number of massive quiescent galaxies (MQGs) at z&gt;3, which theoretical models struggle to reproduce. Explaining the number density of such objects requires extremely high conversion efficiency of baryons into stars in early dark matter halos. Using stellar kinematics, we can investigate the processes shaping the mass assembly histories of MQGs. We present high-resolution JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy of GS-9209, a massive, compact quiescent galaxy at z=4.66 (log ≤ft (M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub> ) = 10.52 ± 0.06 , R_eff = 220 ± 20 pc). Full spectral fitting of the spatially resolved stellar continuum reveals a clear rotational pattern, yielding a spin parameter of &lambda;_R_eff = 0.65 ± 0.12. With its high degree of rotational support, this galaxy challenges the scenario of MQGs growing mainly by dry major mergers. This study suggests that at least a fraction of the earliest quiescent galaxies were fast rotators and that quenching was dynamically gentle process, preserving the stellar disc even in highly compact objects. Using Jeans anisotropic modelling (JAM) and a NFW profile, we measure a dark matter fraction of f_DM ≤ft (&lt; R_eff  ) = 6.3^+2.8_-1.7%, which is plausible given that this galaxy is extremely compact. Our findings use kinematics to independently confirm the massive nature of early quiescent galaxies, previously inferred from stellar population modelling. We suggest that GS-9209 has a similar structure to low-redshift 'relic' galaxies. However, unlike relic galaxies which have bottom-heavy initial mass functions (IMF), the dynamically inferred stellar mass-to-light ratio of GS-9209 is consistent with a Milky-Way like IMF. The kinematical properties of GS-9209 are different from those of z&lt;1 early-type galaxies and more similar to those of recently quenched post-starburst galaxies at z&gt;2.

We present the ALMA-CRISTAL survey, an ALMA Cycle 8 Large Program designed to investigate the physical properties of star-forming galaxies at 4 ≲ z ≲ 6 through spatially resolved, multi-wavelength observations. This survey targets 19 star-forming main-sequence galaxies selected from the ALPINE survey, using ALMA Band 7 observations to study [CII] 158 &mu;m line emission and dust continuum, complemented by JWST/NIRCam and HST imaging to map stellar and UV emission. The CRISTAL sample expanded to 39 after including newly detected galaxies in the CRISTAL fields, archival data, and pilot study targets. The resulting dataset provides a detailed view of gas, dust, and stellar structures on kiloparsec scales at the end of the era of reionization. The survey reveals diverse morphologies and kinematics, including rotating disks, merging systems, [CII] emission tails from potential interactions, and clumpy star formation. Notably, the [CII] emission in many cases extends beyond the stellar light seen in HST and JWST imaging. Scientific highlights include CRISTAL-10, exhibiting an extreme [CII] deficit similar to Arp 220; and CRISTAL-13, where feedback from young star-forming clumps likely causes an offset between the stellar clumps and the peaks of [CII] emission. CRISTAL galaxies exhibit global [CII]/FIR ratios that decrease with increasing FIR luminosity, similar to trends seen in local galaxies but shifted to higher luminosities, likely due to their higher molecular gas content. CRISTAL galaxies also span a previously unexplored range of global FIR surface brightness at high-redshift, showing that high-redshift galaxies can have elevated [CII]/FIR ratios. These elevated ratios are likely influenced by factors such as lower metallicity gas, the presence of significant extraplanar gas, and contributions from shock-excited gas.

### 145) [2505.06101](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06101v1): Spectroscopic Supermassive Dark Star candidates

<p> Cosmin Ilie, Sayed Shafaat Mahmud, Jillian Paulin, Katherine Freese </p>
<p>
Dark Stars, i.e. early stars composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium but powered by Dark Matter, could form in zero metallicity clouds located close to the center of high redshift Dark Matter halos. In 2023 three of us identified (in a PNAS work) the first three photometric Dark Star candidates: JADES-GS-z11-0, JADES-GS-z12-0, and JADES-GS-z13-0. We report here our results of a followup analysis based on available NIRSpec JWST data. We find that JADES-GS-z11-0 and JADES-GS-z-13-0 are spectroscopically consistent with a Dark Star interpretation. Moreover, we find two additional spectroscopic Dark Star candidates: JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z-14-1, with the former being the most distant luminous object ever observed. We furthermore identify a feature in its spectrum indicative of the smoking gun signature of Dark Stars: the He II&lambda;1640 absorption line. In view ALMA's recent identification of a probable OIII nebular emission line in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z14-0, the simple interpretation of this object as an isolated Dark Star is unlikely. If both spectral features survive follow-up observations it would imply a Dark Star embedded in a metal rich environment, requiring theoretical refinements of the formation of evolution of Dark Stars, which in previous studies were assumed to form in isolation, without any companions.

### 146) [2505.05942](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05942v1): Green Flash: Residual Emissions Enshrouded in Low-mass Balmer-break Galaxies at z~5

<p> Kosuke Takahashi, Takahiro Morishita, Tadayuki Kodama, Zhaoran Liu, Kazuki Daikuhara, Nuo Chen </p>
<p>
Recent James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have discovered galaxies that are already passively evolving at z&gt;4, ~1.5 Gyr after the Big Bang. Remarkably, some of these galaxies exhibit strong emission lines such as \ha and [OIII] while showing a strong continuum break at ~3650 &#8491; i.e., Balmer break, giving us a unique insight into the physical mechanisms responsible for early galaxy quenching. In this study, we investigate the nature of four such galaxies at z=5.10&ndash;5.78 identified in the Abell~2744 field, using JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec data. Our spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting analysis reveals that these galaxies have been mostly quiescent since ~100 Myr prior to the observed time. We find a higher dust attenuation in the nebular component than in the continuum in all cases. This suggests the presence of dusty star-forming regions or obscured AGN, which could be a  residual signature of past quenching. For one of the galaxies with sufficient medium-band coverage, we derive the \hb+[OIII] emission line map, finding that the line-emitting region is located in the center and is more compact (R_e=0.7 kpc) than the stellar component (R_e=0.9 kpc). For this specific galaxy, we discuss a scenario where quenching proceeds in the manner of "outside-in", a stark contrast to the inside-out quenching commonly seen in massive galaxies at later cosmic times.

### 147) [2505.05556](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05556v1): Super-Eddington accretion in high-redshift quasar hosts: black-hole driven outflows, galaxy quenching, and the nature of Little Red Dots

<p> Giada Quadri, Alessandro Trinca, Alessandro Lupi, Monica Colpi, Marta Volonteri </p>
<p>
The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope has revolutionised our understanding of the high-redshift Universe, detecting bright, massive galaxies up to z≳ 10, and identifying peculiar sources called "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). The origin of both classes of objects remains uncertain but is likely linked to the formation and early growth of the first massive black holes (MBHs), which may be more easily explained by invoking phases of super-Eddington accretion. In this study, we use a state-of-the-art zoom-in cosmological simulation of a quasar host to investigate whether these objects, during their assembly, can resemble any of the peculiar sources observed with JWST. We find that the impact of MBH feedback on star formation is typically moderate, with outflows preferentially escaping perpendicular to the galactic disc. However, for approximately ten percent of the galaxy's lifetime, the system enters a distinct quenched phase, after a rapid MBH growth driven by super-Eddington accretion. This phase culminates in a powerful feedback event, during which the MBH jet and disc-driven winds interact directly with the galactic disc, carving out a central cavity. We also find that, during the history of the quasar host progenitor, the spectral properties of the system can resemble both LRDs and quenched galaxies, depending on the specific evolutionary stage considered. These findings suggest that both conditions may represent transient phases in the life cycle of high-redshift galaxies.

### 148) [2505.05442](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05442v1): Density modulated star formation efficiency: implications for the observed abundance of ultra-violet luminous galaxies at z&gt;10

<p> Rachel S. Somerville, L. Y. Aaron Yung, Lachlan Lancaster, Shyam Menon, Laura Sommovigo, Steven L. Finkelstein </p>
<p>
The number density of UV luminous galaxies discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope at ultra high redshift (z ≳ 10) is higher, and declines much more slowly with increasing redshift, than expected from extrapolations of lower redshift observations or pre-launch physics-based models. Most of these models assume star formation efficiencies (SFE) of only a few percent, motivated by observations of nearby galaxies. In this work, we incorporate a scaling of SFE with gas surface density (which we refer to as Density Modulated SFE; DMSFE), motivated by cloud-scale simulations and theory, into a semi-analytic cosmological model (SAM) of galaxy formation which is calibrated to match the observed rest-UV sizes of high redshift galaxies. We also model the impact of dust and bursty star formation on the SAM-predicted properties of observed galaxies. We show that with plausible values of the main parameters, such as the fraction of gas in dense clouds f_dense, our new models easily reproduce or even exceed the observed galaxy number densities at z~ 6-17. While no single value of f_dense is able to reproduce the very shallow observed decline of the galaxy number density at z≳ 12, it is plausible and even expected for f_dense to have some effective dependence on cosmic time, which could bring these models into closer agreement with the data. We show that the combined effects of DMSFE, decreasing dust attenuation, and increasingly bursty star formation at earlier cosmic epochs could conspire to reproduce the observed evolution.

<p>
We present the combined 2.5-30&mu;m spectra of four protostars acquired with the infrared camera and the infrared spectrograph on board the AKARI and Spitzer space telescopes, respectively. To analyze the ice absorption features in the 8-22&mu;m, we first performed a continuum determination process on mid-infrared spectra and applied a method to subtract the silicate absorption. We conducted a global fitting process to the absorption features in the combined infrared spectra using the experimental ice absorbance data to identify the intrinsic absorption of each ice component. We first derived the H<sub>2</sub>O ice column densities of both stretch and libration modes at 3.05&mu;m and 13.6&mu;m simultaneously. We also identified the absorption features containing NH_3, CH_3OH, CO<sub>2</sub>, and CO and decomposed their mixed components and compared their ice abundances at different evolutionary stages of the protostars. We explored possible absorptions of the organic ice species such as HCOOH, CH_3CHO, and CH_3CH<sub>2</sub>OH in the mid-infrared ranges. The ice analysis method developed in this study can be applied to the ice spectra obtained by the James Webb Space Telescope.

One of the most remarkable results from the phJames Webb Space Telescope has been the discovery of a large population of compact sources exhibiting strong broad H&alpha; emission, typically interpreted to be low-luminosity broad-line (Type 1) active galactic nuclei (BLAGN). An important question is whether these observations are in tension with galaxy formation models, and if so how? While comparisons have been made using physical properties (i.e.~black hole mass and accretion rate) inferred from observations, these require the use of SED modelling assumptions, or locally inferred scaling relations, which may be unjustified, at least in the distant high-redshift Universe. In this work we take an alternative approach and forward model predictions from the First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom simulations to predict the observable properties of BLAGN. We achieve this by first coupling \flares with the \qsosed model to predict the ionising photon luminosities of high-redshift (z&gt;5) AGN. To model the observed broad H&alpha; emission we then assume a constant conversion factor and covering fraction, and the fraction of AGN that have observable broad-lines. With a reasonable choice of these parameters, \flares is able to reproduce observational constraints on the H&alpha; luminosity function and equivalent width distribution at z=5.

<p>
We report on Chandra X-ray observations of four narrow-line quasar candidates at z~6, selected from the SHELLQs project, based on the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam survey. These objects are characterised by narrow (FWHM&lt;310 km/s), luminous (&gt;1e44 erg/s) Lya and faint UV continuum (M_1450 = -22 - -21), prompting us to examine whether they are obscured luminous AGN at the epoch of reionization. However, none of these objects were detected by Chandra, giving an upper limit to their rest-frame 2-10 keV luminosity (Lx) of 2e44 erg/s (2 sigma), assuming a spectral slope Gamma=2. Subsequent rest-frame optical spectroscopy of these objects by the JWST-NIRSpec, presented in a companion paper, show weak broad Balmer emission at the base of narrow cores. With the scaling relation for low-redshift AGN, the observed strong [OIII]5007 flux of these sources would predict Lx to be around 1e45 erg/s, which is well above the Chandra upper limits. These optical spectra and X-ray quietness are reminiscent of JWST-selected broad-line AGN. We attribute the weak broad Balmer emission to the broad-line regions hidden partially by optically-thick obscuring matter which also hides the optical and X-ray continuum emission from the accretion disc. Compton-thick obscuration, which would strongly suppress X-ray emission, could be due to a dense inter-stellar medium that is often present in galaxies at high redshifts. Alternatively, the same effect could be obtained from an inflated disc at the innermost radii in a supercritical accretion flow, when the disc is viewed at inclined angles.

The unprecedented sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a surprisingly abundant population of mildly obscured, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the epoch of reionization (EoR). However, the link between these objects and classical unobscured quasars remains a mystery. Here we report the discovery of obscured quasars hosted by the most luminous galaxies at z &gt; 6, possibly bridging the gap between the two AGN populations. The 13 objects presented here were originally selected from a rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) imaging survey over &gt;1000 deg<sup>2</sup>, and were known to have luminous (&gt;10^43 erg s<sup>-1</sup>) narrow Ly&alpha; emission. With JWST/NIRSpec follow-up observations, we found that 7 out of 11 objects with narrow Ly&alpha; exhibit a broad component in H I Balmer lines and He I lines, but not in [O III] and other forbidden lines. Mild dust obscuration (0 &lt; A_V &lt; 3) is inferred from the Balmer decrements. The estimated intrinsic luminosities suggest that our broad line (BL) objects are the long-sought UV-obscured counterparts of luminous quasars in the EoR. They host supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses 10^7.8 - 9.1 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, undergoing sub-Eddington to Eddington accretion. Most of the BL objects are spatially unresolved, and are close to "little red dots" with their blue rest-UV and red rest-optical colors. We estimate the AGN number density among similarly luminous Ly&alpha; emitters to be larger than 2 × 10^-8 Mpc^-3. This density is comparable to that of classical quasars with similar continuum luminosities, suggesting that a substantial fraction of active SMBHs are obscured in the EoR and have been overlooked in past rest-UV surveys.

### 153) [2505.04687](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04687v1): The Impact of Early Massive Galaxy Formation on the Cosmic Microwave Background

<p> Eda Gjergo, Pavel Kroupa </p>
<p>
The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, corrected for foreground effects, form the foundation of cosmology and support the Big Bang model. A previously overlooked foreground component is the formation of massive early-type galaxies (ETGs), which can no longer be ignored, particularly in light of JWST's detection of massive, evolved systems at extreme redshifts (z &gt; 13). The rapid formation of massive ETGs has been advocated in galaxy evolution studies for decades, and recent evidence has compelled even proponents of hierarchical mass assembly to acknowledge the fact that massive ETGs evolve quickly. Constraints from chemical evolution are particularly stringent. Without both intense star formation and a top-heavy galaxy-wide initial mass function of stars (IMF), it is difficult to reconcile stellar population synthesis models with the high metallicity and abundance patterns of alpha elements. We infer from previous studies that the progenitor cloud of each massive ETG must have had a radius of approximately 400 kpc. Comparing this value to the average present-day separation of massive ETGs, their formation may have occurred around 15 &lt; z &lt; 20. We consider this epoch of formation in a flat-LCDM cosmological context, incorporating the known and necessary properties of massive ETGs. Such properties are encapsulated independently by the integrated galaxy-wide IMF (IGIMF) theory. The massive ETG evolution presented in this work is consistent with recent advancements in stellar and galaxy evolution, and is derived entirely without priors or constraints from the CMB. Yet, it emerges as a non-negligible source of CMB foreground contamination. Even in our most conservative estimates, massive ETGs account for 1.4% up to the full present-day CMB energy density.

Stellar populations serve as a fossil record of galaxy formation and evolution, providing crucial information about the history of star formation and galaxy evolution. The color-magnitude diagram (CMD) stands out as the most accurate tool currently available for inferring the star formation histories (SFHs) of nearby galaxies with stellar-resolved multiband data. The launch of new space telescopes, including JWST, EUCLID, and the upcoming CSST and Roman, will significantly increase the number of stellar-resolved galaxies over the next decade. A user-friendly and customizable CMD fitting package would be valuable for galaxy evolution studies with these data. We develop an open-source Python-based package named scpancake, which is fast and accurate in determining SFHs and stellar population parameters in nearby galaxies. We have validated our method via a series of comprehensive tests. First, scpancake performs well on mock data, meanwhile the random and systematic uncertainties are quantified. Second, scpancake performs well on observational data containing a star cluster and 38 dwarf galaxies (50 fields). Third, the star formation rate (SFR) from scpancake is consistent with the SFR from FUV photometry. To ensure compatibility and accuracy, we have included isochrone libraries generated using PARSEC for most of the optical and near-infrared filters used in space telescopes such as HST, JWST, and the upcoming CSST.

Population III stars, the hypothetical first generation metal-free stars, have yet to be discovered. Even after three years of successful JWST operations, studies have shown that most galaxies identified to date at z &gt; 5 exhibit a metallicity floor of Z≳2&percnt; Z<sub>&odot;</sub>, possibly due to unknown selection biases toward bright galaxies or rapid metal enrichment. To address this question, we search for galaxies with low R3=[OIII] &lambda;5008/H&beta; ratios as part of the JWST Cycle-3 large treasury program, the Slitless Areal Pure-Parallel HIgh-Redshift Emission Survey (SAPPHIRES). Using deep NIRCam Wide-Field Slitless Spectrscopy (WFSS) data, we report the discovery of seven extremely metal-poor galaxy candidates in the SAPPHIRES Early Data Release field, with estimated 12+log(O/H)&lt;7.0 at z~5-7, including two sources with Z&lt;1&percnt; Z<sub>&odot;</sub>, significantly breaking the metallicity floor observed both locally and at high redshift. These candidates appear extremely faint (~28-30  F200W AB mag) and low-mass (log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)~6.8-7.8), as expected from the mass-metallicity relation. They also exhibit very blue UV slopes (-2.6≲&beta;≲-2.0), likely due to low dust content A_V≲0.2 mag or young stellar ages ~5-20 Myr. Compared to galaxies at similar redshift, they appear exceptionally bursty in their star formation activity. Our results highlight the power of NIRCam/WFSS in identifying extremely metal-poor galaxies, from just a single pointing, with more data to come in SAPPHIRES. This underscores the potential of pure-parallel programs towards achieving JWST's primary science goal: discovering the first pristine stars and galaxies. Deep JWST/NIRSpec follow-up observations will also be essential to confirm their nature and perform detailed chemical abundance analyses.

The advent of JWST has opened new horizons in the study of quasar host galaxies during the reionization epoch (z &gt; 6). Building upon our previous initial uncovering of stellar light from two quasar host galaxies at these redshifts, we now report the detection of the stellar light from the full Cycle 1 sample of 12 distant moderate-luminosity quasar (M_1450&gt;-24 mag) host galaxies at z&gt;6 from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). Using JWST/NIRCam observations at 1.5 and 3.6 &mu;m combined with 2D image decomposition analysis, we successfully detect the host galaxies in 11 out of 12 targets, underscoring the high detection rates achievable with moderate-luminosity quasars. Based on two-band photometry and SED fitting, we find that our host galaxies are massive with log~M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub> = 9.5-11.0. The effective radii range from 0.6 to 3.2 kpc which is comparable to the sizes of inactive galaxies with similar masses as measured with imaging from COSMOS-Web. Intriguingly, the two quasar hosts with post-starburst features, which reside at the high-mass end of our sample and exhibit relatively compact morphologies, are consistent (at the 1-&sigma; level) with quiescent galaxies at z~4-5 in terms of their sizes and stellar mass surface densities. These findings support the so-called galaxy compaction scenario already being valid at the reionization epoch (z&gt;6), in which gas inflows during starburst phases drive centrally concentrated star formation followed by rapid quenching, bridging the structural transition of massive galaxies from relatively extended star-forming disks to compact quiescent systems.

### 157) [2505.03511](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03511v1): The Tip of Red Giant Branch Distances to Nearby Dwarf Galaxies WLM and Sextans A with JWST

<p> Ziming Yan, Shu Wang, Xiaodian Chen, Licai Deng </p>
<p>
Distance measurements to extragalactic systems that are both accurate and precise are cornerstones of modern astrophysics, underpinning the calibration of standard candles and the determination of the Hubble constant. Dwarf galaxies, such as Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM) and Sextans A, provide valuable laboratories for testing distance scales across different stellar populations. In this work, we utilize the high sensitivity and spatial resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to measure the distances to WLM and Sextans A using the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) method. Adopting the TRGB absolute magnitude calibrated by NGC 4258, we determine distance moduli of &mu;_0,WLM = 24.977 ± 0.018 (stat) ± 0.056 (sys) mag for WLM and &mu;_0,SexA = 25.740 ± 0.011 (stat) ± 0.057 (sys) mag for Sextans A. Our results are consistent within a 3% distance uncertainty with previous measurements based on TRGB, Cepheids, and J-Region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) methods. With improved distance measurements in the future, these two galaxies have the potential to serve as additional anchor points for TRGB calibration, aiming to reduce the TRGB-based distance uncertainty to below 2%.

### 158) [2505.03183](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03183v1): The Physical Nature of the Off-centered Extended Emission Associated with the Little Red Dots

<p> Chang-Hao Chen, Luis C. Ho, Ruancun Li, Kohei Inayoshi </p>
<p>
A significant fraction of little red dots (LRDs) exhibit nearby extended emission of unknown origin. If physically associated with the LRD, this component may trace stellar emission from an off-centered host galaxy, neighboring companions, or nebular gas illuminated by the active nucleus. We investigate the detailed spectral energy distribution of the extended emission near four LRDs in the JWST UNCOVER and MegaScience surveys. We accurately decompose the extended emission from the dominant point source by simultaneously fitting the images in eight broad-band and nine medium-band filters. After considering both the results from photometric redshift fitting and the probability of galaxies at different redshift overlapping, we confirm that the off-centered blobs in three sources are physically associated with the LRDs, with two of them showing strong [\ionO 3] &lambda;&lambda; 4959, 5007 emission captured by the medium-band filters. While the spectral energy distributions of all three blobs can be modeled assuming star-forming galaxies with stellar mass ~ 10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, the exceptionally strong [\ionO 3] emission of two sources is best interpreted as pure nebular emission from low-density (n&lt;10  cm^-3), low-metallicity (Z≈ 0.05 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) gas photoionized by the ultraviolet radiation from the nearby LRD. Adopting LRD halo masses constrained by clustering measurements and theoretical considerations, we estimate a typical baryonic halo mass accretion rate of ~ 2-9  M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1. If the halo accretion rate is sustained to z=4 and stars form with an efficiency of 10&percnt;, the accreted gas would form a galaxy with stellar mass ~ 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, potentially rendering them spatially resolved at lower redshift.

We present the morphological properties of 17 spectroscopically confirmed massive quiescent galaxies (10.2 &lt; log(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &lt; 11.2) at 3.0 &lt; z &lt; 4.3, observed with JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam. Using S\'ersic profile fits to the F277W and F444W imaging, we derive the size-mass relation and find typical sizes of ~0.6-0.8 kpc at M<sub>&ast;</sub> = 5 × 10^10~M<sub>&odot;</sub>, consistent with a factor of ~7 growth from z ~ 4 to the present day, including a factor of ~2 by z ~ 2. Galaxies with earlier formation times (z_50 ≳ 5) tend to be larger (up to 0.3 dex above the relation), while late-forming galaxies are more compact. Using a random forest regressor, we identify local environmental density, quantified by log(1+&delta;^&prime;_3) from the distances to the three nearest neighbors, as the strongest predictor of bulge-to-total ratio (B/T), which ranges from 0.25 to 1. Applying the same method to the IllustrisTNG simulation, the ex-situ stellar mass fraction (f<sub>&ast;</sub>,ex-situ) &ndash; a proxy for mergers &ndash; is the dominant predictor of B/T. Galaxies with high B/T in dense environments show bursty star formation and short quenching timescales (≲0.4 Gyr), consistent with bulge growth via merger-induced starbursts; in simulations, such galaxies exhibit elevated ex-situ fractions (~20&percnt;-30&percnt;). In contrast, some high-B/T galaxies in intermediate-density environments have low ex-situ fractions, suggesting that additional mechanisms &ndash; such as violent disk instabilities &ndash; may contribute. These findings point to multiple bulge growth pathways at high redshift, unified by rapid gas accretion, central starbursts, and AGN feedback, as predicted by cosmological simulations.

### 160) [2505.02918](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02918v1): Carbon from massive binary-stripped stars over cosmic time: effect of metallicity

<p> Jing-Ze Ma, Rob Farmer, Selma E. de Mink, Eva Laplace </p>
<p>
The origin of carbon in the Universe remains uncertain. At solar metallicity, binary-stripped massive stars &ndash; stars that lost their envelope through stable interaction with a companion &ndash; have been suggested to produce twice as much carbon as their single-star counterparts. However, understanding the chemical evolution of galaxies over cosmic time requires examining stellar yields across a range of metallicities. Using the stellar evolution code MESA, we compute the carbon yields from wind mass loss and supernova explosions of single and binary-stripped stars across a wide range of initial masses (10-46,M<sub>&odot;</sub>), metallicities (Z = 0.0021, 0.0047, 0.0142), and initial orbital periods (10-5000 days). We find that metallicity is the dominant factor influencing the carbon yields of massive stars, outweighing the effects of binarity and detailed orbital parameters. Since the chemical yields from binary massive stars are highly sensitive to metallicity, we caution that yields predicted at solar metallicity should not be directly extrapolated to lower metallicities. At sub-solar metallicities, particularly below 1/7 solar, weak stellar winds and inefficient binary stripping result in carbon yields from binary-stripped stars that closely resemble those of single stars. This suggests that binary-stripped massive stars are unlikely to explain the presence of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars or the carbon enrichment observed in high-redshift galaxies as probed by the James Webb Space Telescope. Our findings only concern the stripped stars in massive binaries. The impact of other outcomes of binary star evolution, in particular stellar mergers and accretors, remains largely unexplored but will be necessary for a full understanding of the role of massive binaries in nucleosynthesis.

<p>
We present a spectroscopic search for broad H&alpha; emitters at z~3.7-6.5 in the GOODS-N field, utilizing JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopy from FRESCO and CONGRESS, complemented by JADES imaging. We identify 19 broad H&alpha; emitters with FWHM &gt; 1000 km/s at z~4-5.5, including 9 new sources. The black hole masses and AGN bolometric luminosities, inferred from the broad H&alpha; components, indicate that most sources are accreting at ~10% of the Eddington limit. We derive their host stellar masses via SED fitting and find higher M_BH/M_* ratios relative to the local M_BH-M_* relations, consistent with previous studies. We find that 42% of the sample do not satisfy the widely-used color selection criteria for Little Red Dots (LRDs), with the majority of these sources lacking the characteristic steep red slope. A comparison of the average SEDs between our sample and LRDs selected in the same field reveals that the steep red slopes observed in some LRDs are likely due to line-boosting effects as previously suggested. Furthermore, we find that 68% of color-selected LRDs with H&alpha; detections in the NIRCam/Grism spectra do not exhibit broad-line features. While the limited sensitivity of the grism spectra may hinder the detection of broad-line components in faint sources, our findings still highlight the enigmatic nature of the LRD population.

<p>
We study the large-scale environments and clustering properties of 28 low-luminosity AGNs at z=3.9-6 in the GOODS-N field. Our sample, identified from the JWST NIRCam Imaging and WFSS data in CONGRESS and FRESCO surveys with either broad H&alpha; emission lines or V-shape continua, are compared to 782 H&alpha; emitters (HAEs) selected from the same data. These AGNs are located in diverse large-scale environments and do not preferentially reside in denser environments compared to HAEs. Their overdensity field, &delta;, averaged over (15 h^-1cMpc)^3, ranges from -0.56 to 10.56, and shows no clear correlation with broad-line luminosity, black hole (BH) masses, or the AGN fraction. It suggests that &gt; 10 cMpc structures do not significantly influence BH growth. We measure the two-point cross-correlation function of AGNs with HAEs, finding a comparable amplitude to that of the HAE auto-correlation. This indicates similar bias parameters and host dark matter halo masses for AGNs and HAEs. The correlation length of field AGNs is 4.26 h^-1cMpc, and 7.66 h^-1cMpc at 3.9 &lt; z &lt; 5 and 5 &lt; z &lt; 6, respectively. We infer a median host dark matter halo mass of log (M_h/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≈ 11.0-11.2 and host stellar masses of log (M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≈ 8.4-8.6 by comparing with the UniverseMachine simulation. Our clustering analysis suggests that low-luminosity AGNs at high redshift reside in normal star-forming galaxies with overmassive BHs. They represent an intrinsically distinct population from luminous quasars and could be a common phase in galaxy evolution.

<p>
We study the evolution of the bar fraction in disc galaxies between 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 4.0 using multi-band coloured images from JWST CEERS. These images were classified by citizen scientists in a new phase of the Galaxy Zoo project called GZ CEERS. Citizen scientists were asked whether a strong or weak bar was visible in the host galaxy. After considering multiple corrections for observational biases, we find that the bar fraction decreases with redshift in our volume-limited sample (n = 398); from 25^+6_-4% at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.0 to 3^+6_-1% at 3.0 &lt; z &lt; 4.0. However, we argue it is appropriate to interpret these fractions as lower limits. Disentangling real changes in the bar fraction from detection biases remains challenging. Nevertheless, we find a significant number of bars up to z = 2.5. This implies that discs are dynamically cool or baryon-dominated, enabling them to host bars. This also suggests that bar-driven secular evolution likely plays an important role at higher redshifts. When we distinguish between strong and weak bars, we find that the weak bar fraction decreases with increasing redshift. In contrast, the strong bar fraction is constant between 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5. This implies that the strong bars found in this work are robust long-lived structures, unless the rate of bar destruction is similar to the rate of bar formation. Finally, our results are consistent with disc instabilities being the dominant mode of bar formation at lower redshifts, while bar formation through interactions and mergers is more common at higher redshifts.

In Paper I (Rowan-Robinson 2024), models derived in 2009 to fit mid-infrared (8-24 micron) source counts from the IRAS, ISO and Spitzer missions, were found to provide an excellent fit to deep counts at 7.7-21 mu with JWST, demonstrating that the evolution of dusty star-forming galaxies is well understood. Here the treatment of optical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) is improved and the counts are extended to 5.6 mu and optical wavelengths. The models proved a good fit to the latest, deeper, JWST counts. The models are also extended to radio and X-ray wavelengths. Predicted redshift distributions are given for a range of wavelengths and flux-densities.

We present a spectral stacking analysis of galaxies at z≥6 observed with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We curate a sample of 64 galaxies spanning redshifts z<sub>spec</sub> = 6.0 - 9.4 which have NIRSpec medium resolution data. The stacks achieve sufficient signal-to-noise to measure equivalent widths (EW) and velocity centroids (v_cen) of low-ionization species (LIS) absorption features, transmitted Lyman-alpha (Ly&alpha;) emission, and nebular emission lines. Overall, we find our sample has weaker LIS absorption lines (EW(LIS) ≈ 1 &#8491;), smaller v_cen,LIS ≈ -20 ± 50~ km  s<sup>-1</sup>, and significantly suppressed Ly&alpha; emission (EW(Ly&alpha;) ≈ 5~&#8491;), compared to similar studies undertaken at lower redshift. The weaker LIS absorption may suggest a lower covering fraction of HI and larger escape fraction of ionizing photons from our sample. Additionally, the smaller blueshifted v_cen,LIS indicates less prevalent or weaker outflows in z&gt;6 galaxies. Stacking our sub-sample of Ly&alpha; emitters (LAEs), we find high EW(H&beta;) ≈ 170 ± 4~&#8491; and a detection of nebular C IV emission suggesting higher  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  in LAEs at z&gt;6. This work showcases the enormous potential for stacked JWST spectra revealing properties of galaxies and their diffuse interstellar medium in the epoch of reionization.

<p>
The evolution of dust in core-collapse supernovae (SNe), in general, is poorly constrained owing to a lack of infrared observations after a few years from explosion. Most theories of dust formation in SNe heavily rely only on SN 1987A. In the last two years, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled us to probe the dust evolution in decades-old SNe, such as SN 2004et, SN 2005ip, and SN 1980K. In this paper, we present two decades of dust evolution in SN 2005af, combining early-time infrared observations with Spitzer Space Telescope and recent detections by JWST. We have used a chemical kinetic model of dust synthesis in SN ejecta to develop a template of dust evolution in SN 2005af. Moreover, using this approach, for the first time, we have separately quantified the dust formed in the pre-explosion wind that survived after the explosion, and the dust formed in the metal-rich SN ejecta post-explosion. We report that in SN 2005af, predominantly carbon-rich dust is formed in the ejecta, where the total mass of ejecta dust is about 0.02-0.03 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, while in the circumstellar medium the amount of surviving oxygen-rich dust is 0.001-0.004 M<sub>&odot;</sub>.

<p> Paul F. Goldsmith, Shengzhe Wang, Xin Wang, Raphael Skalidis, Gary A. Fuller, Di Li, Chao-Weo Tsai, Lile Wang, Donghui Quan </p>
<p>
We report JWST MIRI/MRS observations of the H2 S(1) 17.04 micron transition in two regions in the boundary of the Taurus Molecular Cloud. The two regions, denoted Edge (near the relatively sharp boundary of the 13CO J=1-0 emission) and Peak (the location of the strongest H2 emission observed with Spitzer), have average intensities of 14.5 MJy/sr and 32.1 MJy/sr, respectively. We find small scale structures of characteristic size 1.0 to 2.5 arcseconds, corresponding to 140 AU to 350 AU, with characteristic intensity above the extended background of 10 MJy/sr, corresponding to a J = 3 column density of 1.6x1017/cm2. The most plausible explanation for the observed intensities from level 845 K above the J = 1 ortho-H2 ground state level is excitation by collisions with H2 molecules (the hydrogen in this region being predominantly molecular). Two mechanisms, turbulent dissipation and shocks, have been proposed for heating of localized regions of the ISM to temperatures ~1000 K to explain abundances of and emission from particular molecules. While we cannot determine unique values of density and kinetic temperature, the solutions in best agreement with predictions of shock models are H2 density = 370 /cm3 and kinetic temperature = 1000 K. The total H2 column density of the small-scale structures under these conditions is ~8x1017/cm2. This first direct detection of heated tiny scale structure in the quiescent molecular interstellar medium has significant implications for the physical structure of this phase of the ISM and maintaining supersonic motions within it.

<p> John Ellis, Malcolm Fairbairn, Juan Urrutia, Ville Vaskonen </p>
<p>
We confront the star formation rate in different dark matter (DM) models with UV luminosity data from JWST up to z≃25 and legacy data from HST. We find that a transition from a Salpeter population to top-heavy Pop-III stars is likely at z≃10 and that beyond z=10-15 the feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei is progressively reduced, so that at z≃25 the production of stars is almost free from any feedback. We compare fuzzy and warm DM models that suppress small-scale structures with the CDM paradigm, finding that the fuzzy DM mass &gt; 4.5 × 10^-22 eV and the warm DM mass &gt; 1.5  keV at the 95&percnt; CL. The fits of the star formation rate parametrization do not depend strongly on the DM properties within the allowed range. We find no preference over CDM for enhanced matter perturbations associated with axion miniclusters or primordial black holes. The scale of the enhancement of the power spectrum should be &gt; 27 Mpc^-1 at the 95&percnt; CL, excluding axion miniclusters produced for m_a &lt; 7.5 × 10^-17 eV or heavy primordial black holes that constitute a fraction f_PBH &gt; Max[88 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/m_PBH, 10^-4 (m_PBH/10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>)^-0.09] of DM.

<p> Harry George Chittenden, Karl Glazebrook, Themiya Nanayakkara, Lalitwadee Kawinwanichakij, Claudia Lagos, Lucas Kimmig, Rhea-Silvia Remus </p>
<p>
We investigate the evolutionary histories of a population of high mass, high redshift, quiescent galaxies in the cosmohydrodynamical simulation Thesan; studying the characteristic properties of their haloes and environments over the epoch of reionisation. Thesan employs a modified version of the Arepo moving-mesh code utilised in IllustrisTNG, whose explicit handling of ionising radiation couples haloes and galaxies with cosmic reionisation. This results in a regime of rapid growth and quenching, producing nine massive quiescent galaxies at z = 5.5, in a 95.5cMpc^3 volume, with no counterpart in IllustrisTNG. We find that the rapid assembly of stellar mass is attributed to smooth accretion of mass onto their haloes in dense environments, particularly from massive neighbouring structures; while these galaxies exhibit fast-growing potential wells hosting massive central black holes. With insignificant merger activity, we find AGN feedback to be the primary source of quenching. We find megaparsec-scale densities and halo masses to continue growing after quenching, suggesting that massive quiescent galaxies will be found in some of the largest haloes and densest regions of space by observations. With an unprecedented plethora of massive quiescent galaxies found in JWST data, these reionisation simulations may provide the paradigm for the evolutionary histories of these galaxies, while constraining the relatively unknown physics of reionisation. Despite the rarity of simulated massive quiescent galaxies, their identification in Thesan enables identification of halo and environmental properties most conducive to their quenching, hopefully guiding future efforts into the study of analogous systems in deep observational surveys and large-volume N-body simulations.

<p> Qing-Bo Ma, Xiao-Rong Chen, Ming Li, Qi Guo, Benedetta Ciardi, Anshuman Acharya, Xin Wang </p>
<p>
We use high resolution N-body dark matter simulations and L-Galaxies semi-analytical galaxy formation models to explore the high-z galaxy properties and estimate the budget of ionizing photons. The parameters within L-Galaxies are obtained using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with high-z galaxy observations from JWST and other telescopes. We consider two versions of L-Galaxies with and without dust correction on galaxy UV luminosities. With the best-fit parameters, both L-Galaxies 2015 and L-Galaxies 2020 reproduce well observations of UV luminosity functions, stellar mass functions, star formation rate densities and ionizing photon emission efficiency. With the assumption of escape fraction of 20&percnt;, all models produce more ionizing photons than the number of Hydrogen atoms in the Universe at z&gt;6. The inclusion of dust correction within MCMC results in higher star formation efficiency, which predicts ~ 50&percnt; more ionizing photons, with better consistency between the predicted stellar mass functions and observations.

<p>
The gravitational potential is established as a critical determinant of gas-phase metallicity (12+log(O/H)) in low-redshift galaxies, whereas its influence remains unconfirmed at high redshifts. We investigate the correlation between gas-phase metallicity and effective radius (R_e) for a sample of galaxies with redshifts ranging from 1 to 7, drawn from JADES (JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey) Data Release 3. We calculate the metallicities using four strong-line methods: N2S2H&alpha;, R23, N2, and O3N2, respectively. After taking out the evolution of size, we find that the offsets of mass-size relation (&Delta; log R_e) are significantly negatively correlated with the offset of mass-metallicity relation (&Delta; log(O/H)) for the four metallicity tracers. Regardless of the metallicity tracer used, we obtain Spearman rank p-values much less than 0.01, rejecting the null hypothesis that the observed correlation is statistically nonsignificant and attributable to random chance. This is also true for galaxies with z&gt;3, with p-values less than 0.05 for the four metallicity tracers. We for the first time find evidence of size playing a key role in determining gas-phase metallicity towards cosmic dawn, suggesting that the gravitational potential influences their material-exchange processes with the surrounding environment at very early universe.

### 172) [2504.18618](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18618v1): ΛCDM is still not broken: empirical constraints on the star formation efficiency at z ~ 12-30

<p> L. Y. Aaron Yung, Rachel S. Somerville, Kartheik G. Iyer </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope continues to push back the redshift frontier to ever earlier cosmic epochs, with recent announcements of galaxy candidates at redshifts of 15 ≲ z ≲ 30. We leverage the recent GUREFT suite of dissipationless N-body simulations, which were designed for interpreting observations in the high redshift Universe, and provide predictions of dark matter halo mass functions and halo growth rates for a state-of-the-art cosmology over a wide range of halo masses from 6 &lt; z&lt; 30. We combine these results with an empirical framework that maps halo growth rate to galaxy star formation rate and then to rest-frame UV luminosity. We find that even if all of the photometrically selected 15 ≲ z ≲ 30 galaxy candidates are real and actually at these extreme redshifts, there is no fundamental tension with &Lambda;CDM, nor are exotic explanations required. With stellar light-to-mass ratios similar to those in well-studied lower redshift galaxies, our simple model can account for the observed extreme ultra-high redshift populations with star formation efficiencies that peak at values of 20-65 percent. Bursty star formation, or higher light-to-mass ratios such as are expected for lower metallicity stellar populations or a top-heavy Initial Mass Function, would result in even lower required star formation efficiencies, comparable to values predicted by high resolution numerical simulations of high-surface density star forming clouds.

We present the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) for a parent sample of 604 galaxies at z=5.34-6.94 with [O~sciii] doublets detected, using the deep JWST/NIRCam wide field slitless spectroscopic (WFSS) observations in 26 quasar fields. The sample incorporates the full observations of 25 quasar fields from JWST Cycle 1 GO program ASPIRE and the quasar SDSS J0100+2802 from JWST EIGER program. We identify 204 galaxies residing in overdense structures using friends-of-friends (FoF) algorithm. We estimate the electron temperature of 2.0^+0.3_-0.4×10^4 K from the Hg and [O~sciii]_4363 lines in the stacked spectrum, indicating a metal-poor sample with median gas phase metallicity 12+log(O/H)=7.64^+0.23_-0.11. With the most up-to-date strong line calibration based on NIRSpec observations, we find that the MZR shows a metal enhancement of ~0.2 dex at high mass end in overdense environments. However, compared to the local Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR), our galaxy sample at z&gt;5 shows a metal deficiency of ~0.2 dex relative to FMR predictions. We explain the observed trend of FMR with a simple analytical model, and we favor dilution from intense gas accretion over outflow to explain the metallicity properties at z&gt;5. Those high redshift galaxies are likely in a rapid gas accretion phase when their metal and gas contents are in a non-equilibrium state. According to model predictions, the protocluster members are closer to the gas equilibrium state than field galaxies and thus have higher metallicity and are closer to the local FMR. Our results suggest that the accelerated star formation during protocluster assembly likely plays a key role in shaping the observed MZR and FMR, indicating a potentially earlier onset of metal enrichment in overdense environments at z≈5-7.

<p> Shengqi Yang, Adam Lidz, Hui Li, Gergo Popping, Jorge A. Zavala, Guochao Sun </p>
<p>
Recent ALMA observations of the [OIII] 88 &mu;m line provide spectroscopic confirmation of two JWST photometric candidates, GS-z14 and GHZ2, at z=14.2 and z=12.3, respectively. These discoveries reveal that star formation and chemical enrichment were already underway when the universe was merely 300 Myr old, posing a challenge to galaxy formation models. Here we construct post-processed models for the [OIII] emission lines from galaxies in the state-of-the-art FIRE and IllustrisTNG simulations. Neither simulation suite contains galaxies directly comparable to GS-z14 or GHZ2. However, one simulated FIRE galaxy closely resembles GS-z14 in its star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass, metallicity, [OIII] luminosity and line-width, albeit at z=8.7, lagging GS-z14's formation by roughly 300 Myr. Although further investigation is required, we argue that the lack of simulated galaxies matching GS-z14 and GHZ2 may largely be a consequence of the limited volume of the FIRE simulations and the limited mass resolution of Illustris-TNG. We quantify the prospects for follow-up spectroscopic detections of GS-z14 in the [OIII] 52 &mu;m line with ALMA, and in rest-frame optical [OIII] and Balmer lines with the MIRI instrument on JWST.

<p> James E. Davies, Andrei Mesinger, Steven Murray </p>
<p>
Understanding the epochs of cosmic dawn and reionisation requires us to leverage multi-wavelength and multi-tracer observations, with each dataset providing a complimentary piece of the puzzle. To interpret such data, we update the public simulation code, 21cmFASTv4, to include a discrete source model based on stochastic sampling of conditional mass functions and semi-empirical galaxy relations. We demonstrate that our new galaxy model, which parametrizes the means and scatters of well-established scaling relations, is flexible enough to characterize very different predictions from hydrodynamic cosmological simulations of high-redshift galaxies. Combining a discrete galaxy population with approximate, efficient radiative transfer allows us to self-consistently forward-model galaxy surveys, line intensity maps (LIMs), and observations of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Not only does each observable probe different scales and physical processes, but cross-correlation will maximise the information gained from each measurement by probing the galaxy-IGM connection at high-redshift. We find that a stochastic source field produces significant shot-noise in 21cm and LIM power spectra. Scatter in galaxy properties can be constrained using UV luminosity functions and/or 21cm power spectra, especially if astrophysical scatter is higher than expected (as might be needed to explain recent JWST observations). Our modelling pipeline is both flexible and computationally efficient, facilitating high-dimensional, multi-tracer, field-level Bayesian inference of cosmology and astrophysics during the first billion years.

<p>
JWST galaxy deep spectral surveys provide a unique opportunity to trace a broad range of evolutionary features of galaxies and the intergalactic medium given the huge distance the photons are propagating. We have analyzed the spectral data of JWST galaxies up to a redshift of around 7 using the Kolmogorov technique, which is an efficient tool for testing the tiny comparative randomness properties of cumulative signals, that is, for distinguishing the contributions of regular and stochastic sub-signals. Our aim is to determine if certain identical spectral features of galaxies have undergone any distortions or systematic evolution across a broad range of redshifts. Our results indicate a change in the spectral properties of the sample galaxies at around z ≃ 2.7 at over a 99% confidence level.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discovered 79 transients out to z~4.8 through the JADES Transient Survey (JTS), but the JTS did not find any z&gt;5 transients. Here, we present the first photometric evidence of a z&gt;5 transient/variable source with JWST. The source, AT 2023adya, resides in a z<sub>spec</sub>=5.274 galaxy in GOODS-N, which dimmed from m_F356W=26.05±0.02 mag to 26.24±0.02 mag in the rest-frame optical over approximately two rest-frame months, producing a clear residual signal in the difference image (m_F356W=28.01±0.17 mag; SN_var=6.09) at the galaxy center. Shorter-wavelength bands (F090W/F115W) show no rest-frame ultraviolet brightness change. Based on its rest-frame V-band absolute magnitude of M_V=-18.48 mag, AT 2023adya could be any core-collapse supernova (SN) subtype or an SN Ia. However, due to low SN Ia rates at high redshift, the SN Ia scenario is unlikely. Alternatively, AT 2023adya may be a variable active galactic nucleus (AGN). However, the JWST NIRCam/Grism spectrum shows no broad H&alpha; emission line (FWHM=130±26 km s<sup>-1</sup>), disfavoring the variable AGN scenario. It is also unlikely that AT 2023adya is a tidal disruption event (TDE) because the TDE models matching the observed brightness changes have low event rates. Although it is not possible to determine AT 2023adya's nature based on the two-epoch single-band photometry alone, this discovery indicates that JWST can push the frontier of transient/variable science past z=5 and towards the epoch of reionization.

### 178) [2504.15381](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15381v1): Traversing the Star-Forming Main Sequence with Molecular Gas Stacks of z~1.6 Cluster Galaxies

The cluster environment has been shown to affect the molecular gas content of cluster members, yet a complete understanding of this often subtle effect has been hindered due to a lack of detections over the full parameter space of galaxy star formation rates and stellar masses. Here we stack CO(2-1) spectra of z~1.6 cluster galaxies to explore the average molecular gas fractions of galaxies both at lower mass (log(M/solar mass)~9.6) and further below the Star Forming Main Sequence (SFMS; DeltaMS~ -0.9) than other literature studies; this translates to a 3sigma gas mass limit of ~7x10^9 solar masses for stacked galaxies below the SFMS. We divide our sample of 54 z~1.6 cluster galaxies, derived from the Spitzer Adaptation of the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey, into 9 groupings, for which we recover detections in 8. The average gas content of the full cluster galaxy population is similar to coeval field galaxies matched in stellar mass and star formation rate. However, when further split by CO-undetected and CO-detected, we find that galaxies below the SFMS have statistically different gas fractions from the field scaling relations, spanning deficiencies to enhancements from 2sigma below to 3sigma above the expected field gas fractions, respectively. These differences between z=1.6 cluster and field galaxies below the SFMS are likely due to environmental processes, though further investigation of spatially-resolved properties and more robust field scaling relation calibration in this parameter space are required.

<p>
Understanding gas flows between galaxies and their surrounding circum-galactic medium (CGM) is crucial to unveil the mechanisms regulating galaxy evolution, especially in the early Universe. However, observations of the CGM around massive galaxies at z&gt;6 remain limited, particularly in the cold gas phase. In this work, we present multi-configuration ALMA observations of [CII]&lambda;158&mu;m and millimetre continuum emission in the z~6.4 quasar PSOJ183+05. We find clumpy [CII] emission, tracing gas up to a ~6 kpc radius, consistent with the interface region between the interstellar medium (ISM) and CGM. The [CII] kinematics shows a rotating disk and a high-velocity, biconical outflow extending up to 5 kpc. The inferred mass outflow rate is M&#775;_of~930 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1, among the highest at z&gt;6, and comparable to the star-formation rate. These findings suggest that quasar-driven outflows can rapidly transfer energy and momentum to the CGM, without immediately quenching star formation in the host galaxy ISM. This supports a delayed feedback scenario, in which outflows reshape CGM conditions and regulate future gas accretion over longer timescales. We find that neither the high-velocity component nor the extended CGM emission in PSOJ183+05 are recovered when using the high-resolution dataset alone, which may explain the conflicting results reported regarding [CII] sizes and the detection of outflows at z≳6. Combining multi-configuration ALMA data with observations from JWST and MUSE will be crucial to map the CGM across its different phases and build a comprehensive picture of the baryon cycle in the first massive galaxies.

### 180) [2504.15346](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15346v1): Big, Dusty Galaxies in Blue Jay: Insights into the Relationship Between Morphology and Dust Attenuation at Cosmic Noon

<p>
The dust attenuation of galaxies is highly diverse and closely linked to stellar population properties and the star dust geometry, yet its relationship to galaxy morphology remains poorly understood. We present a study of 141 galaxies (9&lt;log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;11.5) at 1.7&lt;z&lt;3.5 from the Blue Jay survey combining deep JWST/NIRCam imaging and R~1000 JWST/NIRSpec spectra. Using ttProspector to perform a joint analysis of these data with non-parametric star-formation histories and a two-component dust model with flexible attenuation laws, we constrain stellar and nebular properties. We find that the shape and strength of the attenuation law vary systematically with optical dust attenuation (A_V), stellar mass, and star formation rate (SFR). A_V correlates strongly with stellar mass for starbursts, star-forming galaxies and quiescent galaxies. The inclusion of morphological information tightens these correlations: attenuation correlates more strongly with stellar mass and SFR surface densities than with the global quantities. The Balmer decrement-derived nebular attenuation for 67 of these galaxies shows consistent trends with the stellar continuum attenuation. We detect a wavelength-dependent size gradient: massive galaxies (M<sub>&sext;</sub>≳ 10^10~M<sub>&odot;</sub>) appear ~30&percnt; larger in the rest-optical than in the rest-NIR, driven by central dust attenuation that flattens optical light profiles. Lower-mass systems exhibit more diverse size ratios, consistent with either inside-out growth or central starbursts. These results demonstrate that dust attenuation significantly alters observed galaxy structure and highlight the necessity of flexible attenuation models for accurate physical and morphological inference at cosmic noon.

### 181) [2504.15255](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15255v2): Population Models for Star Formation Timescales in Early Galaxies: The First Step Towards Solving Outshining in Star Formation History Inference

<p>
JWST have revealed temporarily-quenched and ultraviolet-luminous galaxies in the early universe, suggesting enhanced star formation stochasticity. Verifying this hypothesis is critical, yet challenging; outshining, wherein light from young stars dominates the spectral energy distribution, represents perhaps the greatest challenge in inferring the formation histories of unresolved galaxies. In this paper, we take a simple model of burstiness and show that state-of-the-art inference methods with flexible star formation histories (SFHs) and neutral priors, while recovering average star formation rates (SFRs; ~0.1 dex median offset), fail to recover the complexities of fluctuations on tens of Myr timescales, and typically underestimate masses in bursty systems (~0.15 dex). Surprisingly, detailed SFH recovery is still sensitive to priors even when data quality is optimal, e.g., including high signal-to-noise (20~pixel^-1) spectroscopy with wide coverage (rest-frame 0.12-1.06~&mu;m). Crucially, however, refitting the same data with a prior correctly encoding the bursty expectation eliminates these biases: median offsets in mass and SFRs decrease to ~ 0.04 dex and ~ 0.05 dex, respectively. Under the assumption that current population burstiness predicts past SFH, the solution to outshining in modeling statistical samples is empirically measuring recent galaxy SFHs with population modeling. A prototype is H&alpha;/UV: while helpful, it is insufficient to constrain the expected complex burstiness. To this end, we introduce a more complete, quantitative population-level approach and demonstrate that it promises to recover the typical amplitude, timescale, and slope of the recent SFH to high accuracy. This approach thus has the strong potential to solve outshining using observations from JWST.

<p>
We have discovered a substantial sodium doublet (Na D &lambda;&lambda;5890, 5896&#8491;)-traced neutral outflow in a quenching galaxy JADES-GS-206183 at z=1.317 in GOODS-S field. Its JWST NIRSpec/MSA spectrum shows a significantly blueshifted and deep Na D absorption, revealing a neutral outflow with a velocity of v_out=828^+79_-49 km s<sup>-1</sup> and a mass outflow rate of log(M&#775;_out/M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1)=2.40^+0.11_-0.16. The mass outflow rate of this outflow is higher than any of the neutral outflows identified previously beyond z~1 by the same line diagnostic and is comparable with those in local galaxies with extremely strong star formation activities or luminous AGN. Nonetheless, the best-fit SED modeling of JADES-GS-206183, based on its multi-band photometry from HST/ACS to JWST/NIRCam, suggests that the host galaxy now is quenched, and the Paschen &alpha; (Pa&alpha;) emission in the FRESCO NIRCam grism spectrum confirms its current low star formation rate (10.78± 0.55 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1). More surprisingly, optical line ratio diagnostics indicate that the current AGN activity of JADES-GS-206183, if present, is weak. Even though we tentatively detect a broad component of the H&alpha; line, it is more likely tracing the ionized outflow than an AGN. The results demonstrate that the Na D outflow in JADES-GS-206183 is highly unlikely to be driven by current star formation or nuclear activity. Instead, we propose that the outflow that we are witnessing in JADES-GS-206183 may be a long-lasting fossil outflow, powered by previous AGN activity that has recently shut down.

### 183) [2504.14592](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14592v1): The fate of the progenitors of Luminous Red Novae: Infrared detection of LRNe years after the outburst

<p> A. Reguitti, A. Pastorello, G. Valerin </p>
<p>
We present late-time optical and infrared (IR) observations of a sample of nine extragalactic Luminous Red Novae (LRNe) discovered in the last three decades. In all these cases, the LRN survivors fade below the pre-outburst luminosity of the progenitors in the optical region. Instead, they remain visible in the near-IR (NIR), and bright in the mid-IR (MIR) domains for years. We recover AT 1997bs in Spitzer images from 2004, and a residual source is visible in HST and JWST NIR images 27 years after the outburst. Its spectral energy distribution (SED) is consistent with that of a red supergiant star with a photospheric temperature of 3200 K and a radius of 220 R<sub>&odot;</sub>, without a significant circumstellar dust attenuation, as the source is not detected at 4.5 &mu;m. Another LRN, AT 2011kp, is detected by JWST 12.5 years after the outburst. From its SED, we find evidence for three black-body components: a warm/hot stellar component, a colder component from cool dust at 425 K, emitting between 3 and 6 &mu;m, and a third even colder component responsible for the excess at 8 &mu;m, possibly due to an IR echo. We construct the [3.6]-[4.5] colour curves extending up to +7 years for six LRNe, which show a similar evolution: the MIR colour is ~0 before the optical maximum light, it becomes bluer (~-0.5 mag) at around +1 year, then it gradually turns to redder colours (~+0.5 mag) in the following years, before reaching [3.6]-[4.5]~+1.5 mag 7 years after the outburst. Finally, we also estimate the masses and the temperatures of newly-formed dust years after the LRN onset for different chemical compositions (silicates or graphite) and grain sizes (0.1 or 1.0 &mu;m). We find that LRNe produce dust masses of the order of (0.1-30)×10^-6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> between 3.6 and 13 years after the outbursts, with temperatures in the range from 350 to 770 K.

<p> Manish Kataria, Kanak Saha, Bruce Elmegreen </p>
<p>
Understanding how supermassive black holes (SMBHs) form in the early universe is one of the most challenging problems in astrophysics. Their high abundance in the first billion years, as observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, hints towards black hole seeds that accrete mass rapidly. The origin of this accreted mass is not known. Here, we consider a billion solar mass clumpy galaxy at z=5.48 with a 30 million solar mass black hole in the center. We show that the clumps should migrate to the central region because of torques from dynamical friction with the halo, funneling in at least 14 solar masses per year. This is fast enough to grow the observed SMBH, with only 1% of the accreted mass getting in and the rest going to a bulge. Clump-fed accretion could explain most young SMBHs because young galaxies are highly irregular with massive star-forming clumps.

Robertson, Marko Shuntov, Matthew R. Siebert, Sune Toft, Thomas Wevers, Yossef Zenati </p>
<p>
The rates and properties of tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide valuable insights into their host galaxy central stellar densities and the demographics of their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). TDEs have been observed only at low redshifts (z ≲ 1), due to the difficulty in conducting deep time-domain surveys. In this work, we present the discovery of a high-redshift TDE candidate, HZTDE-1, in the COSMOS-Web survey with JWST's NIRCam, using a novel selection technique based on color and morphology. We first outline a methodology for identifying high-z TDEs in deep infrared imaging surveys, leveraging their unique spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and morphologies of these transients. We apply this technique to COSMOS-Web in filters F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W, and identify HZTDE-1, a transient point source relative to archival UltraVISTA infrared observations. If we assume it is a TDE, we estimate its photometric redshift to be z=5.02^+1.32_-1.11. HZTDE-1 cannot be explained by reasonable supernova or AGN models. However, we cannot rule out a superluminous supernova at z≳3. If confirmed with follow-up observations, HZTDE-1 would represent the highest-redshift TDE discovery to date, and would suggest an enhancement of the TDE rate in the high-redshift universe. Our method, which can be applied to future deep surveys with JWST and Roman, offers a pathway to identify TDEs at z&gt;4 and probe black hole demographics at early cosmic times.

We present the first results from the CAPERS survey, utilizing PRISM observations with the JWST/NIRSpec MSA in the PRIMER-UDS field. With just 14 % of the total planned data volume, we spectroscopically confirm two new bright galaxies (M_UV~ -20.4) at redshifts z = 10.562±0.034 and z = 11.013±0.028. We examine their physical properties, morphologies, and star formation histories, finding evidence for recent bursting star formation in at least one galaxy thanks to the detection of strong (EW_0~70 A) H&gamma; emission. Combining our findings with previous studies of similarly bright objects at high-z, we further assess the role of stochastic star formation processes in shaping early galaxy populations. Our analysis finds that the majority of bright (M_UV≲ -20) spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at z&gt;10 were likely observed during a starburst episode, characterized by a median SFR_10/SFR_100~2, although with substantial scatter. Our work also finds tentative evidence that z&gt;10 galaxies are more preferentially in a bursting phase than similarly bright z~6 galaxies. We finally discuss the prospects of deeper spectroscopic observations of a statistically significant number of bright galaxies to quantify the true impact of bursting star formation on the evolution of the bright end of the ultraviolet luminosity function at these early epochs.

Approximately half of all disc galaxies exhibit appreciable warps in both their stellar and HI discs. The typical warp amplitude is small (a few degrees), and only becomes noticeable at the periphery of the galaxy disc. As a result, warps remain a relatively poorly studied phenomenon. In this study, we investigate a large sample of distant edge-on galaxies (approximately 1,000 objects) in order to examine the frequency and characteristics of stellar disc warps up to a redshift of z ~ 2. For the selected galaxies, we utilize HST data from the Cosmic Evolution Survey field and JWST observations from the Cosmic Dawn Center Archive. We measured the properties of disc warps and investigate their evolution as a function of redshift. Our results indicate a potential evolution in the observed frequency of strong S-shaped warps (with an amplitude greater than 4&deg;) in stellar discs as a function of redshift. At z ≈ 2, the frequency of strong warps reaches approximately 50%, while at z ≈ 0, this fraction decreases to around 10-15%. We attribute the observed evolution in the occurrence of strong warps to the changing frequency of galaxy interactions and mergers. If galaxy interactions represent one of the primary mechanisms responsible for the formation of warps, then the prevalence of vertical disc deformations should increase in tandem with the rising interaction and merger rate.

A variety of dust attenuation/extinction curves have been observed in high-redshift galaxies, with mixed results regarding their correlations with global galaxy properties. These variations are likely driven by factors such as intrinsic dust properties, total dust content, and the dust-star geometry. In this work, we explore how the shape of dust attenuation curves-quantified by the UV-optical slope (S) and UV bump strength (B)-correlates with galaxy properties. Our goal is to identify the key physical mechanisms shaping attenuation curves through cosmic time. We build on arXiv:2402.05996, analyzing 173 dusty galaxies at z ~ 2-11.5, with attenuation curves inferred via SED fitting of JWST data using a modified version of BAGPIPES (arXiv:2304.11178). We investigate trends between S, B, and properties inferred from SED fitting: AV, SFR, stellar mass (M<sub>&sext;</sub>), specific SFR (sSFR), mass-weighted stellar age (a*), ionization parameter (U), and metallicity (Z). For a subset, we also consider oxygen abundance (12 + log(O/H)), derived via Te-based methods. We find that lower AV galaxies tend to have steeper slopes and stronger UV bumps, consistent with radiative transfer predictions involving dust geometry and content. S also correlates with a* and sSFR, suggesting that strong radiation fields in young, bursty galaxies may destroy small grains, flattening the slope. B correlates with 12 + log(O/H), possibly due to metallicity-driven dust composition changes. Overall, attenuation curve shapes appear most strongly linked to: (1) redshift (dust evolution), (2) AV (RT effects), (3) a* or sSFR (radiation field), and (4) oxygen abundance (dust composition). Disentangling these effects requires spatially resolved data and theoretical models including dust evolution.

Studying the anharmonicity in the infrared (IR) spectra of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at elevated temperatures is important to understand vibrational features and chemical properties of interstellar dust, especially in the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) era. We take pyrene as an example PAH and investigate how different degrees of superhydrogenation affects the applicability of the harmonic approximation and the role of temperature in IR spectra of PAHs. This is achieved by comparing theoretical IR spectra generated by classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and experimental IR spectra obtained via gas-phase action spectroscopy which utilizes the Infrared Multiple Photon Dissociation (IRMPD). All simulations are accelerated by a machine learning interatomic potential, in order to reach first principle accuracies while keeping low computational costs. We have found that the harmonic approximation with empirical scaling factors is able to reproduce experimental band profile of pristine and partially superhydrogenated pyrene cations. However, a MD-based anharmonic treatment is mandatory in the case of fully superhydrogenated pyrene cation for matching theory and experiment. In addition, band shifts and broadenings as the temperature increases are investigated in detail. Those findings may aid in the interpretation of JWST observations on the variations in band positions and widths of interstellar dust.

### 190) [2504.11595](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11595v1): Dark Matter Genesis

<p> Jeremy Mould </p>
<p>
Recent discoveries of primordial black hole (PBH) candidates by means of high cadence microlensing open the way to a physical understanding of the formation of dark matter as a chapter in the thermal history of the Universe. Two complementary sites of PBH formation are considered, inflation and the early Universe at TeV to MeV energies. In the latter case the Friedman equation, together with the measurement of the mass of the PBH, reveal the threshold energy, the mass spectrum and the likely end point of this epoch. Some of the many recent exoplanet detections may conceivably have been detections of PBHs. When the Universe cools to MeV temperatures, larger mass PBH would form similarly, reaching the supermassive regime. The discovery of numerous supermassive black holes (SMBH) at high redshift with JWST fulfils this expectation. We corroborate the idea that Planck mass relics could be an important component of dark matter, and find that these are formed by PBH with initial mass less than approximately 6 x 10^-16 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and cosmic temperature above 10^9 GeV. Although in some mass ranges PBH can only make up a modest fraction of &Omega;matter, it is possible that all astrophysical dark matter, as distinct from axions and WIMPs, is of PBH origin.

<p>
Galaxies grow alongside their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs), linked through fueling and feedback. However, the origins and details of this co-evolution remain unclear and differ significantly amongst modeling frameworks. Using a suite of semi-analytic models (SAMs), we trace SMBH mass assembly across M_BH ~ 10^6-10, M<sub>&odot;</sub>. We find significant discrepancies between observations and physics-based models of the local black hole mass function (BHMF), likely due to differences in the underlying stellar mass function and the scaling relations therefrom used to infer the BHMF. However, most physics-based models agree at z ~ 1-4 and align reasonably well with broad-line AGN BHMF from JWST observations at z=4-5. Most physics-based models reproduce the bolometric AGN luminosity evolution, except \sc Dark Sage, which predicts an excess deviating from models and observations. Interestingly, this pronounced "knee' in the bolometric AGN luminosity function predicted by \sc Dark Sage around L_bol ~ 10^46   erg   s<sup>-1</sup> is consistent with the inferred luminosity of "Little Red Dots'' at z=5-6, assuming that their entire emission originates from AGN activity. We analyze black hole mass build-up and accretion histories in \sc Dark Sage, which, unlike other models, allows for super-Eddington accretion. We report that on average, SMBHs in \sc Dark Sage primarily grow through secular disk instabilities and merger-driven cold gas accretion, while black hole mergers contribute 60&percnt; of the total mass budget only for the most massive SMBHs by z=0.

### 192) [2504.11531](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11531v1): Oxyster: A Circumgalactic Low-ionization Oxygen Nebula next to a Starburst Galaxy at z~1

<p> Pengjun Lu, Mingyu Li, Dalya Baron, Minghao Yue, Song Huang, Zheng Cai </p>
<p>
Extended emission line nebulae around galaxies or active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide a unique window to investigate the galactic ecosystem through the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Using Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam narrow-band imaging and spectroscopic follow-up, we serendipitously discover "Oxyster" - a large ionized nebula next to an interacting starburst galaxy at z=0.924. The nebula is traced by extended [OII]3726,3729 (~ 30 kpc) and [OIII]5007 (~ 20 kpc) emission lines. On the nebula luminosity-size plane, Oxyster surpasses the extended narrow-line regions around low-z AGNs, resembling a higher-z analog of "Hanny's Voorwerp". However, its uniformly low [OIII]/[OII] ratio (O32) sets it apart from typical AGN light echoes. For the host galaxy, HST and JWST images reveal a disturbed red disk galaxy with a single blue spiral "arm". Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting suggests the 2-6× 10^10 ~M<sub>&odot;</sub> host galaxy sits above the star-forming main sequence with an ongoing starburst, especially in the "arm", and have &lt;5&percnt; luminosity contribution from AGN, consistent with X-ray non-detection and radio continuum. Standard photoionization and shock models struggle to explain simultaneously Oxyster's emission line luminosities, low O32 ratio, and the non-detection of H&beta; line. A plausible explanation could involve the combination of a recent (&lt;10^8 yrs) starburst and a low-luminosity AGN (L_bol ~ 1×10^42 erg/s). While Oxyster's nature awaits future investigation, its discovery highlights the potential of ground-based narrow-band imaging to uncover extended emission line nebulae around non-AGN systems, opening new avenues for studying the CGM of normal galaxies in the early Universe.

2MASS J04381486+2611399 (or J0438) is one of the few young brown dwarfs (BD) with a highly inclined (i\!~\!70&deg;) disk. Here we report results from JWST-MIRI MRS, HST-ACS and ALMA Band 7 observations. Despite its late spectral type (M7.25), the spectrum of J0438 resembles those of inner disks around earlier-type stars (K1-M5, T Tauri stars), with a volatile reservoir lacking hydrocarbons (except for acetylene, C_2H<sub>2</sub>) and dominated by water. Other identified species are H<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, HCN, [Ar^+], and [Ne^+]. The dominance of water over hydrocarbons is driven by multiple factors such as disk dynamics, young disk age, low accretion rate and possible inner disk clearing. J0438 appears highly dynamic, showing a seesaw-like variability and extended emission in H<sub>2</sub>     S(1), S(3), S(5), [Ne^+] and CO (J=3-2). Interestingly, the CO emission reaches up to 400 au from the brown dwarf, suggesting ongoing infalling/outflowing activity impacting the disk chemistry. These observations underscore the combined power of JWST, HST and ALMA in characterizing the chemical diversity and dynamics of brown dwarf disks.

### 194) [2504.10731](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10731v2): Unveiling faint X-ray AGN populations in the NewAthena era: Insights from cosmological simulations

<p> Nuno Covas, Israel Matute, Stergios Amarantidis, José Afonso, Giorgio Lanzuisi, Andrea Comastri, Stefano Marchesi, Ciro Pappalardo, Rodrigo Carvajal, Polychronis Papaderos </p>
<p>
Recent observations expanded our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, yet key challenges persist in the X-ray regime, crucial for studying Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). These limitations drive the development of next-generation observatories such as ESA's NewAthena. Now in phase B (preliminary design), the mission requires extensive testing to ensure compliance with its scientific goals, particularly given the uncertainties surrounding high redshift AGN. This work leverages the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation to build an X-ray AGN mock catalogue and assess the performance of NewAthena's WFI. We created a Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH) light cone, spanning 10 deg2, with corrections to account for the limited resolution of the simulation and X-ray properties derived in post-processing. The resulting catalogue reveals a 5* overabundance of faint AGN compared to current X-ray constraints, an inconsistency potentially resolved by invoking a higher Compton-thick (CTK) fraction and intrinsic X-ray weakness, as suggested by recent JWST findings. An end-to-end survey simulation using SIXTE predicts 250000 AGN detections, including 20,000 at z &gt; 3 and 35 in the Epoch of Reionization (z &gt; 6); notably, only AGN with LX &gt; 43.5 erg/s are detectable at z &gt; 6. The analysis also forecasts a significant population of detectable CTK AGN, even beyond z &gt; 4. These findings suggest X-ray observations will, for the first time, probe a significant AGN population in the EoR, offering new insights into SMBH growth. They also provide key input for refining NewAthena's mission design and optimizing its survey strategy.

### 195) [2504.10581](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10581v1): Massive Black Hole Seed Formation in Strong X-ray Environments at High Redshift

<p> Kazutaka Kimura, Kohei Inayoshi, Kazuyuki Omukai </p>
<p>
Direct collapse of pristine gas in early galaxies is a promissing pathway for forming supermassive black holes (BHs) powering active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at the epoch of reionization (EoR). This seeding mechanism requires suppression of molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) cooling during primordial star formation via intense far-ultraviolet radiation from nearby starburst galaxies clustered in overdense regions. However, non-detection of 21 cm signals from the EoR reported by the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) experiment suggests that such galaxies may also emit X-rays more efficiently than in the local universe, promoting H<sub>2</sub> production and thereby potentially quenching massive BH seed formation. In this study, we examine the thermal and chemical evolution of collapsing gas in dark matter halos using a semi-analytic model incorporating observationally calibrated X-ray intensities. We find that strong X-ray irradiation, as suggested by HERA, significantly suppresses direct collapse and leads most halos to experience H<sub>2</sub> cooling. Nevertheless, massive BH seeds with M_BH ≳ 10^4~M<sub>&odot;</sub> still form by z≃ 15, particularly in regions with baryonic streaming motion, and their abundance reaches ~ 10^-4~Mpc^-3 sufficient to explain the SMBHs identified by JWST spectroscopy at 3&lt;z&lt;6. While the formation of highly overmassive BHs with masses comparable to their host galaxies is prohibited by X-ray ionization, our model predicts that BH-to-stellar mass ratios of ≃ 0.01-0.1 were already established at seeding.

### 196) [2504.10572](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10572v1): The Structure and Formation Histories of Low-Mass Quiescent Galaxies in the Abell 2744 Cluster Environment

Suess, Bingjie Wang </p>
<p>
Low-mass quiescent galaxies are thought to predominantly reside in overdense regions, as environmental effects are often invoked to explain their shutdown of star formation. These longer-timescale quenching mechanisms - such as interactions with hot gas in the intracluster medium and dynamical encounters with other cluster galaxies - leave imprints on galaxy morphologies, emphasizing the importance of quantifying the structures of low-mass quiescent galaxies in galaxy clusters at z&lt;0.5. Using spectrophotometric data from the UNCOVER and MegaScience programs, we present the first measurement of the quiescent size-mass relation between 7&lt;log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;10 using JWST imaging, based on a sample of 1100 galaxies in the z=0.308 Abell 2744 galaxy cluster. The resulting size-mass relation is systematically larger and flatter than samples of dwarf galaxies in less-rich environments (low-mass clusters and groups), and has a higher scatter than similar-redshift field samples. Both "progenitor bias," where larger, diskier low-mass galaxies enter the cluster at later epochs, and a general expansion of galaxy structure from dynamical interactions could be at play. This evolutionary framework is further supported by the tentative evidence that older low-mass quiescent galaxies in the cluster are more spheroidal. The star-formation histories derived for our cluster sample imply their formation and quenching occurs relatively late, at z&lt;1.5. In this scenario, the progenitor population would have disky axis-ratio distributions at cosmic noon, in agreement with recent observations. While this leaves ample time for dynamical interactions to maintain quiescence and drive the observed subsequent morphological evolution post-quenching, the data disfavors an onset of quenching due to the environment.

<p> Peter H. Sims, Harry T. J. Bevins, Anastasia Fialkov, Dominic Anstey, Will J. Handley, Stefan Heimersheim, Eloy de Lera Acedo, Rajesh Mondal, Rennan Barkana </p>
<p>
Observations of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) have the potential to answer long-standing questions of astrophysical interest regarding the nature of the first luminous sources and their effects on the intergalactic medium (IGM). We present astrophysical constraints from a Neural Density Estimation-Accelerated Bayesian joint analysis of constraints deriving from Cosmic Microwave Background power spectrum measurements from Planck and SPT, IGM neutral fraction measurements from Lyman-line-based data sets and 21-cm power spectrum upper limits from HERA, LOFAR and the MWA. In the context of the model employed, the data is found to be consistent with galaxies forming from predominantly atomic-cooled hydrogen gas in dark matter halos, with masses M_min ≳ 2.6 × 10^9~M<sub>&odot;</sub> ((1+z)/10)^\frac1 2 at 95% credibility (V_c ≳ 50~km~s<sup>-1</sup>) being the dominant galactic population driving reionization. These galaxies reionize the neutral hydrogen in the IGM over a narrow redshift interval (&Delta; z_re &lt; 1.8 at 95% credibility), with the midpoint of reionization (when the sky-averaged IGM neutral fraction is 50%) constrained to z_50 = 7.16^+0.15_-0.12. Given the parameter posteriors from our joint analysis, we find that the posterior predictive distribution of the global 21-cm signal is reduced in amplitude and shifted to lower redshifts relative to the model prior. We caution, however, that our inferences are model-dependent. Future work incorporating updated, mass-dependent star formation efficiencies in atomic cooling halos, informed by the latest UV luminosity function constraints from the James Webb Space Telescope, promises to refine these inferences further and enhance our understanding of cosmic reionization.

### 198) [2504.08921](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08921v1): The Complete Sample of Available SNe Ia Luminosity Calibrations from the TRGB Observed with either HST or JWST

<p> Siyang Li, Adam G. Riess, Gagandeep S. Anand, Daniel Scolnic, Yukei S. Murakami, Dillon Brout, Erik R. Peterson </p>
<p>
Distance ladders which calibrate the luminosity of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) currently provide the strongest constraints on the local value of H0. Recent studies from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) show good consistency between measurements of SNe Ia host distances. These are calibrated to NGC 4258 using different primary distance indicators (Cepheids, Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB), J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch, and Miras). However, some sub-samples of calibrated SNe Ia employed to measure H0 yield noteworthy differences due to small sample statistics but also due to differences in sample selection. This issue is particularly important for TRGB-derived calibrations owing to the smaller volume they reach compared to Cepheids, reducing sample size and enhancing the size of statistical fluctuations. To mitigate this issue, we compile the largest and complete (as currently available) sample of HST or JWST measurements of the TRGB in the hosts of normal SNe Ia for a total of N=35, 50% larger than the previous largest. Most are present in the literature, and we compile multiple measures when available. We also add 5 SNe Ia hosts from the HST archive not previously published. The full sample together with the Pantheon+ SN catalog gives H0=72.1-73.3 +/- 1.8 km/s/Mpc (depending on methodology), in good agreement with the value of 72.5 +/- 1.5 km/s/Mpc from HST Cepheids in hosts of 42 SNe Ia calibrated by the same anchor, NGC 4258. We trace the difference in the result of H0=70.4 +/- 1.9 km/s/Mpc from Freedman et al. 2025 to 11 hosts not selected for that CCHP compilation (of N=24) which alone yield H0=74.1 km/s/Mpc, 2&sigma; higher than the selected sample. A smaller increase of 0.6 km/s/Mpc comes from a commonly employed correction for peculiar velocities.

### 199) [2504.08879](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08879v1): Is Earendel a Star?: Investigating the Sunrise Arc Using JWST Strong and Weak Gravitational Lensing Analyses

<p> Zachary P. Scofield, M. James Jee, Sangjun Cha, Hyosun Park </p>
<p>
The galaxy cluster WHL J013719.8-08284 at z = 0.566 exhibits a strong-lensing feature known as the Sunrise Arc, which hosts the candidate star Earendel at z ≈ 6.2, the most distant star candidate observed to date. If this object is a star, or a system of a few stars, its apparent magnitude implies both extreme gravitational lensing magnification and unusually high luminosity. This study revisits Earendel's magnification, which, in previous literature, exhibits significant uncertainty across various lens models (2&mu; = 4,000-35,000). We present an improved cluster mass reconstruction and a tighter constraint on Earendel's magnification using a joint strong- and weak-lensing analysis with JWST data. Our strong-lensing mass model, incorporating newly identified multiple-image systems from JWST imaging data and modifying the existing multiple-image assignment scheme, produces a root-mean-square (RMS) lens-plane scatter of less than 0.''3. Additionally, our weak-lensing catalog achieves a source density of ~ 100 galaxies arcmin^-2, providing constraints on the mass profile beyond the strong-lensing regime. In our best-fit model, we estimate the magnification of Earendel to be &mu; = 43-67, significantly lower than previously proposed and thus calling into question its classification as a star.

We present 0.7-3.3 pc resolution mid-infrared (MIR) JWST images at 7.7 &mu;m (F770W) and 21 &mu;m (F2100W) covering the main star-forming regions of two of the closest star-forming low-metallicity dwarf galaxies, NGC6822 and Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM). The images of NGC6822 reveal filaments, edge-brightened bubbles, diffuse emission, and a plethora of point sources. By contrast, most of the MIR emission in WLM is point-like, with a small amount of extended emission. Compared to solar metallicity galaxies, the ratio of 7.7 &mu;m intensity (I_&nu;^F770W), tracing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), to 21 &mu;m intensity (I_&nu;^F2100W), tracing small, warm dust grain emission, is suppressed in these low-metallicity dwarfs. Using ALMA CO(2-1) observations, we find that detected CO intensity versus I_&nu;^F770W at ~2 pc resolution in dwarfs follows a similar relationship to that at solar metallicity and lower resolution, while the CO versus I_&nu;^F2100W relationship in dwarfs lies significantly below that derived from solar metallicity galaxies at lower resolution, suggesting more pronounced destruction of CO molecules at low metallicity. Finally, adding in Local Group L-Band Survey VLA 21 cm HI observations, we find that I_&nu;^F2100W and I_&nu;^F770W vs. total gas ratios are suppressed in NGC6822 and WLM compared to solar metallicity galaxies. In agreement with dust models, the level of suppression appears to be at least partly accounted for by the reduced galaxy-averaged dust-to-gas and PAH-to-dust mass ratios in the dwarfs. Remaining differences are likely due to spatial variations in dust model parameters, which should be an exciting direction for future work in local dwarf galaxies.

Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is crucial for regulating galaxy evolution. Motivated by observations of broad absorption line winds from rapidly accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs), we introduce the Mistral AGN feedback model, implemented in the Arepo code. Mistral comes in two versions: continuous radial (Mistral-continuous) and stochastic bipolar momentum deposition (Mistral-stochastic). Using the framework of the IllustrisTNG simulations, we explore the effect of Mistral on BH and galaxy properties, through an idealized Milky Way-mass galaxy and cosmological zoom simulations run down to z=2. Unlike standard thermal AGN feedback prescriptions, Mistral generates galaxy-scale winds that mimic outflows driven by BH accretion. Mistral-continuous produces short-lived galactic fountains, and is inefficient at regulating the growth of massive galaxies at z=2. In contrast, Mistral-stochastic efficiently suppresses star formation in massive galaxies, and reproduces the empirical stellar-to-halo mass and (z=0) BH-stellar mass relations. By supporting large-scale (&gt;50 kpc) outflows while simultaneously preventing gas inflows, Mistral-stochastic additionally regulates the cold and hot gas fractions at both galaxy and halo scales. Mistral-stochastic therefore works self-consistently across the halo mass range explored ≤ft(10^12-3×10^13 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), without adopting a SMBH-mass dependent AGN feedback scheme such as the one used in IllustrisTNG. Our model is a promising tool for predicting the impact of radiatively efficient AGN winds on galaxy evolution, and interpreting the growing population of high-redshift galaxies and quasars observed by JWST. This work is part of the "Learning the Universe" collaboration, which aims to infer the physical processes governing the evolution of the Universe.

We report the discovery of 13 broad-line AGNs at z = 5 - 8 from the first 10% data of the JWST Cycle 3 Treasury Program COSMOS-3D. These AGNs are identified by their broad H&alpha; or H&beta; emission lines through the NIRCam grism wide-field slitless spectroscopy. One object at z = 7.646 with broad H&beta; emission has an F444W magnitude of 23.6 mag, making it one of the brightest z &gt; 7.5 broad-line AGNs yet known. Among the 13 AGNs, 10 objects have reddened optical continua with slopes &beta;_opt&gt;0. The remaining three objects have their overall SEDs that resemble those of UV-luminous quasars at similar redshifts, but their &beta;_opt, though negative, are not as blue as those of unobscured quasars. We also obtain MIRI photometry at 7.7-18 &mu;m for two AGNs and place strong constraints on their rest-frame near-IR SED. We find no significant variability in the rest-frame UV by comparing the COSMOS-3D and COSMOS-Web F115W images taken apart by 60 days in the rest-frame. We compute the H&alpha; luminosity functions (LFs) for the broad H&alpha; emitters at z ≈ 5-6 and find a potential redshift evolution when compared with that of the z ≈ 4-5 sample. We also derive the H&beta; LF at z~8 for AGNs and galaxies by combining our sample with those from the literature. The broad H&beta; emitters in this work suggest a number density two orders of magnitude higher than that predicted by the quasar LF based on rest-frame UV-selected samples. As a preview, our work showcases the ability of the COSMOS-3D grism survey to provide a complete view of the properties, growth, and evolution of bright broad-line AGNs at z&gt;5.

### 203) [2504.07325](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07325v2): Resolved ALMA [CII] 158 micron Observations at Cosmic Noon: ISM Structure and Dynamics of Starbursting QSO SDSSJ1000

We present spatially resolved Alma Band-9 observations of the [CII] 158 &mu;m fine structure line from an optically selected quasar, SDSS J100038.01+020822.4 (J1000), at z=1.8275. By utilizing [OI] 63 &mu;m line observations from Herschel/PACS and constructing a detailed dust SED using Herschel and Spitzer archival imaging data, we show that the [CII] line emission is well explained by a photodissociation region (PDR) model, in which the emission arises from the surfaces of molecular clouds exposed to far-UV radiation fields ~ 5\cdot10^3 times the local interstellar radiation field (G_0). We find a factor of 30 variation in spatially resolved [CII]/Far-IR continuum across the source which is explained by the reduced fraction of cooling via [CII] line emission at such high far-UV field strengths. By matching derived PDR parameters to the observed far-IR line and continuum intensities we derive cloud size-scales and find that typical cloud radii in J1000 are ~3.5 pc perhaps indicating an ISM that is highly fractured due to intense star formation activity. We model the galaxy dynamically and find that the [CII] emission is contained within a compact, dynamically cold disk with v/&sigma;=6.2, consistent with cosmological simulations. We also report the discovery of a companion galaxy to j1000 confirmed by the detection of [CII] and use recently obtained JWST/NirCAM imaging of the system to argue for J1000 being an interacting system. With total stellar mass ~ 1.5 × 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and main-component dynamical mass ≳ 10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, the J1000 system is a progenitor to the most massive galaxies seen in the local Universe.

### 204) [2504.07039](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07039v2): Microlensing at Cosmological Distances: Event Rate Predictions in the Warhol Arc of MACS 0416

<p>
Highly magnified stars (&mu; &gt; 100) are now outinely identified as transient events at cosmological distances thanks to microlensing by intra-cluster stars near the critical curves of galaxy clusters. Using the  James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in combination with the  Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we outline here an analytical framework that is applied to the Warhol arc (at z=0.94) in the MACS 0416 galaxy cluster (at z=0.396) where over a dozen microlensed stars have been detected to date. This method is general and can be applied to other lensed arcs. Within this lensed galaxy we fit the spatially resolved SED spanned by eight JWST-NIRCam filters combined with three ACS filters, for accurate lensed star predictions in 2D. With this tool we can generate 2D maps of microlensed stars for well resolved arcs in general, including dependence on wavelength and limiting apparent magnitude, for comparison with with planned cadenced campaigns for JWST and Hubble, for constraining directly the IMF and the level of dark matter substructure.

### 205) [2504.06334](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06334v2): UNCOVER/MegaScience: No Evidence of Environmental Quenching in a z~2.6 Proto-cluster

Setton, Adi Zitrin </p>
<p>
Environmental quenching &ndash; where interactions with other galaxies and/or the intra-cluster medium (ICM) suppress star formation in low-mass galaxies &ndash; has long been proposed as the primary driver to establish the red sequence for low-mass galaxies within clusters at low redshift (z&lt;1). However, we still do not know whether these environmental quenching mechanisms are also active at higher redshifts in proto-cluster environments that have yet to fully virialize. In large part, this regime has remained unexplored due to observational limitations; however, the James Webb Space Telescope has recently opened a new window into the role of environmental quenching on low-mass (log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;9.5) galaxies at cosmic noon (2 &lt; z &lt; 3). Here, we use data from the JWST UNCOVER and MegaScience programs to directly probe the role of environmental quenching on low-mass galaxies in a newly-discovered z≈ 2.6 overdensity. Leveraging the deep imaging and R ~ 15 spectrophotometry enabled by these JWST/NIRCam data, we analyze the stellar populations and inferred star formation histories (SFHs) of 20 low-mass (8.5&lt;log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≤9.0) quiescent galaxies in the overdense environment and compare to a similar sample of 18 such galaxies in the field. The SFHs of quiescent galaxies in the proto-cluster and field across the entire probed stellar mass regime (8.5&lt;log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≤11.0) are indistinguishable, demonstrating that the environment at cosmic noon is not yet accelerating quenching compared to the field. This is consistent with expectations that proto-clusters at z&gt;2 have yet to virialize and develop a dense enough environment to efficiently quench low-mass galaxies.

### 206) [2504.06252](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06252v2): A systematic method to identify runaways from star clusters produced from single-binary interactions: A case study of M67

<p>
One hypothesis for runaway stars (RSs) is that they are ejected from star clusters with high velocities relative to the cluster center-of-mass motion. There are two competing mechanisms for their production: supernova-based ejections in binaries, where one companion explodes, leaves no remnant, and launches the other companion at the instantaneous orbital velocity, and the disintegration of triples (or higher-order multiples), which produces a recoiled runaway binary (RB) and an RS. We search for RS candidates using data from the Gaia DR3 survey with a focus on triple disintegration since in this case the product is always a binary and a single star that should be moving in opposite directions. We created a systematic methodology to look for candidate RS-RB runaway pairs produced from the disintegration of bound three-body systems formed from single-binary interactions based on momentum conservation and causality. The method we use is general and can be applied to any cluster with a 5D kinematic data set. We used our criteria to search for these pairs in a 150 pc circular field of view surrounding the open cluster M67, which we used as a benchmark cluster to test the robustness of our method. Our results reveal only one RS-RB pair that is consistent with all of our selection criteria out of an initial sample of 10^8 pairs.

### 207) [2504.03551](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03551v2): JADES: comprehensive census of broad-line AGN from Reionization to Cosmic Noon revealed by JWST

<p>
The depth and coverage of the first years of JWST observations have revealed low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) across a wide redshift range, shedding light on black hole (BH) assembly and feedback. We present our spectroscopic sample of 34 Type 1 AGN obtained from JADES survey data and spanning 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 9. Our sample of AGN probes a BH mass range of 10^6-9~M<sub>&odot;</sub> at bolometric luminosities down to 10^43~erg~s<sup>-1</sup>, implying generally sub-Eddington ratios of &lt;0.5L_Edd. Most of these AGN are hosted in low mass (M<sub>&sext;</sub>~10^8~M<sub>&odot;</sub>) galaxies and are overmassive relative to the local M_BH-M<sub>&sext;</sub> relation, while remaining consistent with the local M_BH-&sigma;_* relation. The wide redshift range provided by our sample allows us to trace the emergence of local M_BH-M_* scaling relation across the cosmic epoch. Additionally, we explore the capability of narrow-line diagnostics in identifying Type 2 AGN and find that a significant fraction of our AGN would be missed by them due to low metallicity or lack of high energy ionizing photons (potentially due to dust absorption, dense gas blanketing the broad and narrow line regions, or intrinsically soft ionizing spectra). We explore the UV luminosity function of AGN and their hosts and find that it is subject to significant cosmic variance and is also dependent on the AGN bolometric luminosity. Finally, we show that the electron and Balmer scattering scenarios recently proposed to explain the broad components of the Balmer lines are untenable on multiple grounds. There is no evidence that the black hole masses have been overestimated by orders of magnitude as proposed in those scenarios.

### 208) [2504.02538](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02538v2): Detection of Deuterated Hydrocarbon Nanoparticles in the Whirlpool Galaxy, M51

Deuteration of hydrocarbon material, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), has been proposed to account for the low gas-phase abundances of D in the interstellar medium. JWST spectra of four star-forming regions in M51 show an emission feature, with central wavelength ~4.647&mu;m and FWHM 0.0265&mu;m, corresponding to the C-D stretching mode in aliphatic hydrocarbons. The emitting aliphatic material is estimated to have (D/H)_aliph≈ 0.17±0.02 &ndash; a factor ~10^4 enrichment relative to the overall interstellar medium (ISM). On ~50 pc scales, deuteration levels toward four H II regions in M51 are 2-3 times higher than in the Orion Bar photodissociation region (PDR), with implications for the processes responsible for the formation and evolution of hydrocarbon nanoparticles, including PAHs. The deuteration of the aliphatic material is found to anticorrelate with helium ionization in the associated H II, suggesting that harsh FUV radiation may act to lower the deuteration of aliphatics in PDRs near massive stars. No evidence is found for deuteration of aromatic material, with (D/H)_arom ≲ 0.016: deuteration of the aliphatic material exceeds that of the aromatic material by at least a factor 10. The observed levels of deuteration may account for the depletion of D observed in the Galactic interstellar medium. If so, the 4.65&mu;m feature may be detectable in absorption.

The standard model of cosmology has provided a good phenomenological description of a wide range of observations both at astrophysical and cosmological scales for several decades. This concordance model is constructed by a universal cosmological constant and supported by a matter sector described by the standard model of particle physics and a cold dark matter contribution, as well as very early-time inflationary physics, and underpinned by gravitation through general relativity. There have always been open questions about the soundness of the foundations of the standard model. However, recent years have shown that there may also be questions from the observational sector with the emergence of differences between certain cosmological probes. In this White Paper, we identify the key objectives that need to be addressed over the coming decade together with the core science projects that aim to meet these challenges. These discordances primarily rest on the divergence in the measurement of core cosmological parameters with varying levels of statistical confidence. These possible statistical tensions may be partially accounted for by systematics in various measurements or cosmological probes but there is also a growing indication of potential new physics beyond the standard model. After reviewing the principal probes used in the measurement of cosmological parameters, as well as potential systematics, we discuss the most promising array of potential new physics that may be observable in upcoming surveys. We also discuss the growing set of novel data analysis approaches that go beyond traditional methods to test physical models. [Abridged]

We present a spectroscopic redshift catalogue of sources in the Abell 2744 cluster field, derived from JWST/NIRISS observations taken as part of the GLASS-JWST Early Release Science programme. We describe the data reduction, contamination modelling and source detection, as well as the data quality assessment, redshift determination and validation. The catalogue consists of 354 secure and 134 tentative redshifts, of which 245 are new spectroscopic redshifts, spanning a range 0.1 ≤ z ≤ 8.2. These include 17 galaxies at the cluster redshift, one galaxy at z ≈ 8, and a triply-imaged galaxy at z = 2.653 ± 0.002. Comparing against galaxies with existing spectroscopic redshifts z<sub>spec</sub>, we find a small offset of &Delta; z = (z<sub>spec</sub> - z_NIRISS )/(1 + z<sub>spec</sub> ) = (1.3 ± 1.6) × 10^-3. We also present a forced extraction tool (pygrife) and a visualisation tool (pygcg) to the community, to aid with the reduction and classification of grism data. This catalogue will enable future studies of the spatially-resolved properties of galaxies throughout cosmic noon, including dust attenuation and star formation. As a first application of the catalogue, we discuss the spectroscopic confirmation of multiple image systems, and the identification of multiple overdensities at 1 &lt; z &lt; 2.7.

<p>
The Bullet Cluster (1E 0657-56) is a key astrophysical laboratory for studying dark matter, galaxy cluster mergers, and shock propagation in extreme environments. Using new JWST imaging, we present the highest-resolution mass reconstruction to date, combining 146 strong lensing constraints from 37 systems with high-density (398 sources arcmin^-2) weak lensing data, without assuming that light traces mass. The main cluster's mass distribution is highly elongated (NW-SE) and consists of at least three subclumps aligned with the brightest cluster galaxies. The subcluster is more compact but elongated along the E-W direction, with a single dominant peak. We also detect a possible mass and ICL trail extending from the subcluster's eastern side toward the main cluster. Notably, these detailed features are closely traced by the intracluster light, with a modified Hausdorff distance of 19.80 ± 12.46 kpc. Together with multi-wavelength data, the complex mass distribution suggests that the merger history of the Bullet Cluster may be more complex than previous binary cluster merger scenarios.

The way in which radial flows shape galaxy structure and evolution remains an open question. Internal drivers of such flows, such as bars and spiral arms, known to mediate gas flows in the local Universe, are now observable at high redshift thanks to JWST's unobscured view. We investigated the morphology of massive star-forming galaxies at 0.8&lt;z&lt;1.3 and 2.0&lt;z&lt;2.5, epochs marking the peak and decline of cosmic star formation, both well covered by kinematic surveys. Using JWST/NIRCam imaging, we visually classified 1,451 galaxies, identified nonaxisymmetric features, counted the number of spiral arms, analyzed nonparametric morphological indicators, and studied the dynamical support of the sample covered by kinematics (≈ 11% of the sample) as measured via v/&sigma;. Disks dominate the sample (fraction 0.82 ± 0.03); among them, 0.48 ± 0.04 exhibit spiral structure and 0.11 ± 0.03 host bars. Both fractions decline with redshift, in agreement with previous studies. The proportion of two- and three-armed spirals remains largely unchanged across our redshift bins: approximately two-thirds show two arms and one-third show three arms in both bins. Notably, we find a higher incidence of three-armed spirals (≈ 0.30) than reported in the local Universe (≈ 0.20), suggesting a mild evolution in spiral arm multiplicity. Nonparametric morphological metrics strongly correlate with stellar mass but show no significant redshift evolution. Finally, kinematic analysis reveals a correlation between disk morphology and rotational support: most disks exhibit v/&sigma; &gt; 3 and median values of v/&sigma; &gt; 7 for spirals and v/&sigma; &gt; 5 for barred galaxies. This study establishes a population-wide framework for linking galaxy morphology and dynamics at cosmic noon, providing a key reference for future studies on the role of detailed structural features in galaxy evolution.

### 213) [2503.20415](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20415v2): Massive black hole formation in Population III star clusters

<p> B. Reinoso, M. A. Latif, D. R. G. Schleicher </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that challenge existing black hole (BH) formation models. These newly observed BHs seem overmassive compared to the host galaxies and have an unexpectedly high abundance. Their exact origin remains elusive. The primary goal of this work is to investigate the formation of massive BH seeds in dense Population III (Pop III) star clusters. Using a cosmological simulation of Pop III cluster formation, we present models for the assembly and subsequent evolution of these clusters. The models account for background gas potential, stellar collisions and associated mass loss, gas accretion, stellar growth, their initial mass function (IMF), and subsequent star formation. We conduct N-body simulations of these models over a span of 2 million years. Our results show that BHs of &gt; 400 M<sub>&odot;</sub> are formed in all cases, reaching up to ~ 5000 M<sub>&odot;</sub> under optimistic yet reasonable conditions and potentially exceeding 10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub> provided that high accretion rates of 10^-3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1 onto the stars can be sustained. We conclude that massive BHs can be formed in Pop III stellar clusters and are likely to remain within their host clusters. These BHs may experience further growth as they sink into the galaxy's potential well. This formation channel should be given further consideration in models of galaxy formation and BH demographics.

### 214) [2503.17585](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17585v2): How do Massive Primordial Black Holes Impact the Formation of the First Stars and Galaxies?

<p> Saiyang Zhang, Boyuan Liu, Volker Bromm, Junehyoung Jeon, Michael Boylan-Kolchin, Florian Kuhnel </p>
<p>
We investigate the impact of massive primordial black holes (PBHs; m_BH~ 10^6~M<sub>&odot;</sub>) on the star formation and first galaxy assembly process using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations from z = 1100 to z ~ 9. We find that PBH accretion is self-regulated by feedback, suppressing mass growth unless feedback is weak. PBHs accelerate structure formation by seeding dark matter halos and gravitationally attracting gas, but strong feedback can delay cooling and suppress star formation. In addition, the presence of baryon-dark matter streaming creates an offset between the PBH location and the peaks induced in gas density, promoting earlier and more efficient star formation compared to standard &Lambda;CDM. By z ~ 10, PBH-seeded galaxies form dense star clusters, with PBH-to-stellar mass ratios comparable to observed high-z AGN like UHZ-1. Our results support PBHs as viable SMBH seeds but do not exclude alternative scenarios. We emphasize that PBH-seeding provides a natural explanation for some of the newly-discovered overmassive SMBHs at high redshift, in particular those with extreme ratios of BH-to-dynamical (virial) mass that challenge standard formation channels. Future studies with ultra-deep JWST surveys, the Roman Space Telescope, and radio surveys with facilities such as SKA and HERA will be critical in distinguishing PBH-driven SMBH growth from other pathways.

<p>
JWST has uncovered large numbers of compact galaxies at high redshift with broad hydrogen/helium lines. These include the enigmatic population known as "little red dots" (LRDs). Their nature is debated, but they are thought to be powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) or intense star formation. They exhibit unusual properties for SMBHs, such as black holes that are overmassive for their host galaxies and extremely weak X-ray and radio emission. Using the highest-quality JWST spectra, we show here that the lines are broadened by electron scattering with a narrow intrinsic line core. The data require high electron column densities and compact sizes (light days), which, when coupled with their high luminosities can only be explained by SMBH accretion. The narrow intrinsic cores of the lines imply upper limits on the black hole masses of 10^5-7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, two orders of magnitude lower than previous estimates. These are among the lowest mass SMBHs known at high redshift and suggest that this is a population of young, rapidly growing SMBHs. They are enshrouded in a dense cocoon of ionized gas, probably related to their youth, from which they are accreting close to the Eddington limit. Reprocessed nebular emission from the dense cocoon dominates the optical spectrum, explaining most LRD spectral characteristics and helping to suppress radio and X-ray emission.

### 216) [2503.14703](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14703v2): The Emerging Black Hole Mass Function in the High-Redshift Universe

<p> Junehyoung Jeon, Boyuan Liu, Anthony J. Taylor, Vasily Kokorev, John Chisholm, Dale D. Kocevski, Steven L. Finkelstein, Volker Bromm </p>
<p>
Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have identified an abundant population of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) already in place during the first few hundred million years of cosmic history. Most of them appear overmassive relative to the stellar mass in their host systems, challenging models of early black hole seeding and growth. Multiple pathways exist to explain their formation, including heavy seeds formed from direct collapse/supermassive stars or sustained super-Eddington accretion onto light stellar remnant seeds. We use the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH to predict the emerging SMBH mass function under physically motivated models for both light and heavy seed formation, to be compared with upcoming ultra-deep JWST surveys. We find that both pathways can reproduce observations at z~5-6, but have distinct features at higher redshifts of z~10. Specifically, JWST observations have the potential to constrain the fraction of efficiently accreting (super-Eddington) SMBHs, as well as the existence and prevalence of heavy seeds, in particular through ultra-deep observations of blank fields and/or gravitational lensing surveys. Such observations will provide key insights to understand the process of SMBH formation and evolution during the emergence of the first galaxies. We further emphasize the great promise of possible SMBH detections at z≳ 15 with future JWST observations to break the degeneracy between light- and heavy-seed models.

### 217) [2503.10958](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10958v2): Dot to dot: high-z little red dots in M_bh-M<sub>&sext;</sub> diagrams with galaxy-morphology-specific scaling relations

<p> Alister W. Graham, Igor V. Chilingarian, Dieu D. Nguyen, Roberto Soria, Mark Durre, Duncan A. Forbes </p>
<p>
The high redshift 'little red dots' (LRDs) detected with the James Webb Space Telescope are considered to be the cores of emerging galaxies that host active galactic nuclei (AGN). For the first time, we compare LRDs with local compact stellar systems and an array of galaxy-morphology-dependent stellar mass-black hole mass scaling relations in the M_bh-M<sub>&sext;</sub> diagrams. When considering the 2023-2024 masses for LRDs, they are not equivalent to nuclear star clusters (NSCs), with the latter having higher M_bh/M<sub>&sext;</sub> ratios. However, the least massive LRDs exhibit similar M_bh and M<sub>&sext;</sub>,gal values as ultracompact dwarf (UCD) galaxies, believed to be the cores of stripped/threshed galaxies. We show that the LRDs span the M_bh-M<sub>&sext;</sub>,gal diagram from UCD galaxies to primaeval lenticular galaxies. In contrast, local spiral galaxies and the subset of major-merger-built early-type galaxies define M_bh-M<sub>&sext;</sub>,gal relations that are offset to higher stellar masses. Based on the emerging 2025 masses for LRDs, they may yet have similarities with NSCs, UCD galaxies, and green peas. Irrespective of this developing situation, we additionally observe that low-redshift galaxies with AGN align with the quasi-quadratic or steeper black hole scaling relations defined by local disc galaxies with directly measured black hole masses. This highlights the benefits of considering a galaxy's morphology - which reflects its accretion and merger history - to understand the coevolution of galaxies and their black holes. Future studies of spatially-resolved galaxies with secure masses at intermediate-to-high redshift hold the promise of detecting the emergence and evolution of the galaxy-morphology-dependent M_bh-M<sub>&sext;</sub> relations.

<p>
We present a new parametric strong lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster MACS J0138.0-2155 at z = 0.336, the first known to show two multiply-imaged supernova (SN) siblings, SN Requiem and SN Encore at z= 1.949. We exploit HST and JWST multiband imaging in synergy with new MUSE spectroscopy to develop an improved lens mass model. We include 84 cluster members (of which ~60% are spectroscopically confirmed) and two perturber galaxies along the line of sight. Our observables consist of 23 spectroscopically confirmed multiple images from 8 background sources, spanning a fairly wide redshift range, from 0.767 to 3.420. To accurately characterise the sub-halo mass component, we calibrate the Faber-Jackson scaling relation based on the stellar kinematics of 14 bright cluster galaxies. We build several lens models, with different cluster total mass parametrisations, to assess the statistical and systematic uncertainties on the predicted values of the position and magnification of the observed and future multiple images of SN Requiem and SN Encore. Our reference best-fit lens model reproduces the observed positions of the multiple images with a root-mean-square offset of 0".36, and the multiple image positions of the SNe and their host galaxy with a remarkable mean precision of only 0".05. We measure a projected total mass of M(&lt;60~ kpc) = 2.89_-0.03^+0.04 × 10^13 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, consistent with that independently derived from the Chandra X-ray analysis. We demonstrate the reliability of the new lens model by reconstructing the extended surface-brightness distribution of the multiple images of the host galaxy. The discrepancy between our model-predicted magnification values with those from previous studies, critical for understanding the intrinsic properties of the SNe and their host galaxy, underscores the need to combine cutting-edge observations with detailed lens modelling.

### 219) [2503.07711](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07711v2): Where Have All the Little Red Dots Gone? Supermassive Black Hole Binary Dynamics and its Impact on Galaxy Properties

<p> Fazeel Mahmood Khan, Benjamin L. Davis, Andrea Valerio Macciò, Kelly Holley-Bockelmann </p>
<p>
Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations have revealed a peculiar class of galaxies at redshifts z ≳ 6, characterized by extremely high central stellar densities and overmassive central supermassive black holes (SMBHs), "little red dots" (LRDs). A critical question remains: If LRDs were common at high redshifts, how would they evolve into local elliptical galaxies with significantly lower central densities? To address this, we performed direct N-body simulations of LRD mergers, focusing on the coevolution of host galaxies and central SMBHs. We track the complete evolution of SMBH binaries into the three-body hardening and gravitational-wave (GW) emission phase. Our results demonstrate that during galaxy mergers, the central SMBHs can eject a substantial amount of mass from the galactic core via the three-body slingshot effect, leading to a decrease in central stellar surface density by an order of magnitude. Additionally, GW recoil can further contribute in making the galaxy centers less dense and more in alignment with low-redshift quiescent galaxies. This transformation occurs on a relatively short timescale of a few ~100 Myr, implying that LRDs can evolve into lower-redshift elliptical galaxies by z&lt;4. The timescales for our SMBH mergers vary between 100 Myr and 800 Myr, depending on the initial orbital parameters of the merging galaxies and the mass ratio of the SMBHs. Our findings provide a plausible mechanism for the transformation of LRDs into elliptical galaxies while highlighting the efficiency of SMBH mergers in such high-density environments, which plays a crucial role in SMBH growth.

### 220) [2503.03806](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03806v2): The THESAN-ZOOM project: Population III star formation continues until the end of reionization

<p> Oliver Zier, Rahul Kannan, Aaron Smith, Ewald Puchwein, Mark Vogelsberger, Josh Borrow, Enrico Garaldi, Laura Keating, William McClymont, Xuejian Shen, Lars Hernquist </p>
<p>
Population III (Pop III) stars are the first stars in the Universe, forming from pristine, metal-free gas and marking the end of the cosmic dark ages. Their formation rate is expected to sharply decline after redshift z ≈ 15 due to metal enrichment from previous generations of stars. In this paper, we analyze 14 zoom-in simulations from the THESAN-ZOOM project, which evolves different haloes from the THESAN-1 cosmological box down to redshift z=3. The high mass resolution of up to 142 M<sub>&odot;</sub> per cell in the gas phase combined with a multiphase model of the interstellar medium (ISM), radiative transfer including Lyman-Werner radiation, dust physics, and a non-equilibrium chemistry network that tracks molecular hydrogen, allows for a realistic but still approximate description of Pop III star formation in pristine gas. Our results show that Pop III stars continue to form in low-mass haloes ranging from 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> to 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> until the end of reionization at around z=5. At this stage, photoevaporation suppresses further star formation in these minihaloes, which subsequently merge into larger central haloes. Hence, the remnants of Pop III stars primarily reside in the satellite galaxies of larger haloes at lower redshifts. While direct detection of Pop III stars remains elusive, these results hint that lingering primordial star formation could leave observable imprints or indirectly affect the properties of high-redshift galaxies. Explicit Pop III feedback and specialized initial mass function modelling within the THESAN-ZOOM framework would further help interpreting emerging constraints from the James Webb Space Telescope.

### 221) [2503.02086](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02086v2): Discovery of a Low-mass Strong-lens System in SMACS J0723.3-7327

<p>
We report the discovery of an intriguing, low-mass galaxy-scale strong-lens system in the SMACS J0723.3-7327 galaxy cluster. By modeling James Webb Space Telescope imaging and Very Large Telescope Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer spectroscopic data, we find that the lens is cluster member galaxy at z=0.397 with an Einstein radius of 0&prime;&prime;.424 ± 0&prime;&prime;.012, stellar mass of M_* = (3.3 ± 0.8) × 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, half-light radius of ~ 1 kpc, and central stellar velocity dispersion of 140 ± 6 km s<sup>-1</sup>. This lens galaxy is one of the few strong lens galaxies known to date that have stellar mass as low as M_* ~ 10^10.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, offering an exceptional opportunity to peek into the population of low-mass galaxies that has largely remained unexplored in the context of strong-lensing studies. This strong lens system can also assist in assessing the systematic uncertainty in the lens modeling of cluster member galaxies.

### 222) [2503.01579](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01579v3): CANUCS/Technicolor: JWST Medium Band Photometry Finds Half of the Star Formation at z&gt;7.5 is Obscured

Sarrouh, Marcin Sawicki, Victoria Strait, Chris Willot, Naadiyah Jagga, Jon Judež, Anishya Harshan, Danilo Marchesini, Vladan Markov, Rosa M. Mérida, Gregor Rihtaršič, Roberta Tripodi </p>
<p>
We present a sample of 146 high-redshift (z&gt;7.5) galaxies from the CANUCS/Technicolor surveys, showcasing photometry in every wide- and medium-band NIRCam filter in addition to ancillary HST data sampling 0.4-5 &mu; m (22 JWST bands out of 29 bands total). Additionally, 48 (33&percnt;) galaxies in our sample meet criteria to be classified as extreme emission line galaxies, 15 (10&percnt;) of which are completely missed by typical dropout selections due to faint UV emission. By fitting the SEDs covering the rest-frame UV to optical at z &gt; 7.5, we investigate the dust obscuration properties, giving an unbiased view of dust buildup in high-redshift galaxies free from spectroscopic follow-up selection effects. Dust attenuation correlates with stellar mass, but more strongly with star formation rate. We find typical galaxies at z&gt;7.5 have ~ 25 &percnt; of their star formation obscured. However, since galaxies with higher star formation rates suffer more attenuation, ~ 50 &percnt; of the total star formation rate density at 7.5&lt;z&lt;9 is obscured. The obscured fraction drops to ~ 35 &percnt; in our 9&lt;z&lt;12 bin, possibly due to substantial dust grain growth in the interstellar medium not having time to occur. Extrapolating the decline in dust obscuration of galaxies to higher redshifts, we infer that dust obscuration should approach zero at z &gt; 15, implying that epoch as when dust first forms in bright galaxies.

### 223) [2503.01172](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01172v3): Detection Prospects of Electromagnetic Signatures from OGLE-2011-BLG-0462

<p> Shigeo S. Kimura, Lena Murchikova, Kailash C. Sahu </p>
<p>
Stellar-mass isolated black holes (IsoBHs) wandering in interstellar medium (ISM) are expected to be abundant in our Galaxy. Recently, an IsoBH, OGLE-2011-BLG-0462, was unambiguously discovered using astrometric microlensing. We examine prospects for detecting electromagnetic signatures from an accretion flow surrounding the IsoBH. The accretion rate onto the IsoBH should be highly sub-Eddington, which leads to formation of a hot accretion flow. In this paper, we evaluate the detectability of electromagnetic signals from the hot accretion flows in two accretion states: magnetically arrested disk (MAD) and classical radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs). For the MAD scenario, we find that the optical, infrared, and X-ray signals can be detectable by the current best facilities, such as HST, JWST, and Chandra, if the IsoBH is in a warm neutral medium. In contrast, for the classical RIAF scenario, the optical and X-ray emissions are weaker than MAD scenario, leading to unobservable signals for a typical parameter set. Future follow-up observations of OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 will provide a good test for theories of accretion processes.

### 224) [2503.00839](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00839v2): A large-scale ring galaxy at z = 2.2 revealed by JWST/NIRCam: kinematic observations and analytical modelling

<p>
A unique galaxy at z = 2.2, zC406690, has a striking clumpy large-scale ring structure that persists from rest UV to near-infrared, yet has an ordered rotation and lies on the star-formation main sequence. We combine new JWST/NIRCam and ALMA band 4 observations, together with previous VLT/SINFONI integral field spectroscopy and HST imaging to re-examine its nature. The high-resolution H&alpha; kinematics are best fitted if the mass is distributed within a ring with total mass M_ring = 2 × 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and radius R_ring = 4.6 kpc, together with a central undetected mass component (e.g., a "bulge") with a dynamical mass of M_bulge = 8 × 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. We also consider a purely flux emitting ring superposed over a faint exponential disk, or a highly "cuspy" dark matter halo, both disfavored against a massive ring model. The low-resolution CO(4-3) line and 142GHz continuum emission imply a total molecular and dust gas masses of M_mol,gas = 7.1 × 10^10M<sub>&odot;</sub> and M_dust = 3 × 10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> over the entire galaxy, giving a dust-to-mass ratio of 0.7%. We estimate that roughly half the gas and dust mass lie inside the ring, and that ~ 10&percnt; of the total dust is in a foreground screen that attenuates the stellar light of the bulge in the rest-UV to near-infrared. Sensitive high-resolution ALMA observations will be essential to confirm this scenario and study the gas and dust distribution.

### 225) [2503.00155](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00155v2): Late-time growth weakly affects the significance of high-redshift massive galaxies

<p> Qianran Xia, Dragan Huterer, Nhat-Minh Nguyen </p>
<p>
Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed massive galaxies at very high redshift (z≃ 7-15). The question of whether the existence of such galaxies is expected in the corresponding JWST surveys has received a lot of attention, though the answer straddles areas of cosmology and complex astrophysical details of high-redshift galaxy formation. The growth rate of density fluctuations determines the amplitude of overdensities that collapse to form galaxies. Late-time modifications of growth, combined with measurements at both z~ 1 from large-scale structure and z~ 1000 from the cosmic microwave background, affect the predictions for the abundance of first galaxies in the universe. In this paper, we point out that the late-time growth rate of structure affects the statistical significance of high-redshift, high-mass objects very weakly. Consequently, if the existence and abundance of these objects are confirmed to be unexpected, the variations in the late-time growth history are unlikely to explain these anomalies.

### 226) [2502.20447](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20447v3): Detecting galaxy-21-cm cross-correlation during reionization

<p> Samuel Gagnon-Hartman, James E. Davies, Andrei Mesinger </p>
<p>
The cosmic 21-cm signal promises to revolutionize studies of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Radio interferometers are aiming for a preliminary, low signal-to-noise (S/N) detection of the 21-cm power spectrum. Cross-correlating 21-cm with galaxies will be especially useful in these efforts, providing both a sanity check for initial 21-cm detection claims and potentially increasing the S/N due to uncorrelated residual systematics. Here we self-consistently simulate large-scale (1 Gpc) galaxy and 21-cm fields, computing their cross-power spectra for various choices of instruments as well as survey properties. We use 1080h observations with SKA-low AA* and HERA-350 as our benchmark 21-cm observations. We create mock Lyman alpha narrow-band, slitless and slit spectroscopic surveys, using benchmarks from instruments such as Subaru HyperSupremeCam, Roman grism, VLT MOONS, ELT MOSAIC, and JWST NIRCam. We forecast the resulting S/N of the galaxy-21-cm cross power spectrum, varying the galaxy survey area, depth and level of 21-cm foreground contamination for each pair of instruments. We find that the highest S/N is achievable through slitless, wide-area spectroscopic surveys, with the proposed Roman HLS survey resulting in a 55&sigma; detection of the cross power with 21-cm as observed with SKA-low AA* for our fiducial model. Narrow-band dropout surveys are unlikely to result in a detectable cross-power, due to their poor redshift localization. Slit spectroscopy can provide a high S/N detection of the cross power for SKA-low AA* observations. Specifically, the planned MOONRISE survey with MOONS on the VLT can result in a 3&sigma; detection, while a survey of comparable observing time using MOSAIC on the ELT can result in a 4&sigma; detection. Our results can be used to guide survey strategies, facilitating the detection of the galaxy-21-cm cross power spectrum.

### 227) [2502.18464](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18464v2): Unveiling the Aromatic and Aliphatic Universe at Redshifts z~0.2&ndash;0.5 with JWST NIRCam/WFSS

<p> Jianwei Lyu, Xuejuan Yang, Aigen Li, Fengwu Sun, George H. Rieke, Stacey Alberts, Irene Shivaei </p>
<p>
Utilizing deep NIRCam/WFSS data from JWST's FRESCO program, we spectroscopically survey the 3.3 &mu; m aromatic and 3.4 &mu; m aliphatic C&ndash;H stretching emission bands of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules in galaxies at redshifts z~0.2&ndash;0.5. Unlike pre-JWST studies, largely limited to infrared (IR)-bright galaxies (L_IR≳10^11~L<sub>&odot;</sub>) at z≲0.1, we probe 200 galaxies down to L_IR~10^8.5&ndash;10^10~L<sub>&odot;</sub> well beyond the local Universe. The 3.3 &mu; m emission is detected at ≥3-&sigma; in 88 out of 187 galaxies, correlating tightly with galaxy IR luminosity and star formation rate (SFR) and confirming the 3.3 &mu; m PAH as a viable SFR tracer. Despite a large scatter, the 3.3 &mu; m-to-IR luminosity ratio (L_3.3/L_IR) exhibits a strong metallicity dependence with a drop of L_3.3/L_IR by a factor of ≳10 at 12+log(O/H)~8.4&ndash;8.5 towards lower metallicities. The 3.4 &mu; m emission is detected in 37 out of 159 galaxies, with the 3.4 &mu; m-to-3.3 &mu; m luminosity ratio (L_3.4/L_3.3) spanning from ~0.05 to ~0.58 (median ~0.19), corresponding to PAH aliphatic fractions of ~0.78%&ndash;8.3% (median ~2.9%) in terms of fractional carbon atoms in aliphatic units. While L_3.4/L_3.3 does not depend significantly on redshift, stellar mass, metallicity, or galaxy morphology, it does decrease with various SFR tracers, suggesting that ultraviolet photons in active star-forming regions may strip aliphatic sidegroups from PAH molecules. Our study showcases the unique power of JWST's NIRCam/WFSS to systematically map PAH aromatic and aliphatic content in statistically significant, less-biased galaxy samples, providing critical insights into PAH chemistry and its connection to galaxy properties.

### 228) [2502.15935](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15935v2): The TRGB-SBF Project. III. Refining the HST Surface Brightness Fluctuation Distance Scale Calibration with JWST

<p> Joseph B. Jensen, John P. Blakeslee, Michele Cantiello, Mikaela Cowles, Gagandeep S. Anand, R. Brent Tully, Ehsan Kourkchi, Gabriella Raimondo </p>
<p>
The TRGB-SBF Project team is developing an independent distance ladder using a geometrical calibration of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) method in elliptical galaxies that can in turn be used to set the surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) distance scale independent of Cepheid variables and Type~Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The purpose of this project is to measure the local expansion rate of the universe independently of the methods that are most at odds with the theoretically-predicted value of the Hubble-Lema\^itre constant H_0, and therefore isolate the influence of potential systematic observational errors. In this paper, we use JWST TRGB distances calibrated using the megamaser galaxy NGC 4258 to determine a new Cepheid-independent SBF zero point for HST. This new calibration, along with improved optical color measurements from PanSTARRS and DECam, gives an updated value of H_0 = 73.8± 0.7 (statistical) ± 2.3~(systematic) km/s/Mpc that is virtually identical to the SBF Hubble constant measured by Blakeslee et al. 2021.

### 229) [2502.10271](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10271v2): The Rich JWST Spectrum of the Western Nucleus of Arp 220: Shocked Hot Core Chemistry Dominates the Inner Disk

<p>
We present full 3-28 &mu; m JWST MIRI/MRS and NIRSpec/IFU spectra of the western nucleus of Arp 220, the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxy. This nucleus has long been suggested to possibly host an embedded Compton-thick AGN. Millimeter observations of the dust continuum suggest the presence of a distinct 20 pc core with a dust temperature of T_d ≳ 500~K, in addition to a 100 pc circumnuclear starburst disk. However, unambiguously identifying the nature of this core is challenging, due to the immense obscuration, the nuclear starburst activity, and the nearby eastern nucleus. With the JWST integral field spectrographs, we can, for the first time, separate the two nuclei across this full wavelength range, revealing a wealth of molecular absorption features towards the western nucleus. We analyse the rovibrational bands detected at 4-22 &mu; m, deriving column densities and rotational temperatures for 10 distinct species. Optically thick features of C_2H<sub>2</sub>, HCN and HNC suggest that this molecular gas is hidden behind a curtain of cooler dust, and indicate that the column densities of C_2H<sub>2</sub> and HCN are an order of magnitude higher than previously derived from Spitzer observations. We identify a warm HCN component with rotational temperature T_rot = 330~K, which we associate with radiative excitation by the hot inner nucleus. We propose a geometry where the detected molecular gas is located in the inner regions of the starburst disk, directly surrounding the hot 20 pc core. The chemical footprint of the western nucleus is reminiscent of that of hot cores, with additional evidence for shocks. Despite the molecular material's close proximity to the central source, no evidence for the presence of an AGN in the form of X-ray-driven chemistry or extreme excitation is found.

### 230) [2502.07875](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07875v3): Investigating photometric and spectroscopic variability in the multiply-imaged Little Red Dot A2744-QSO1

Price, Katherine A. Suess, Bingjie Wang, John R. Weaver, Katherine E. Whitaker </p>
<p>
JWST observations have uncovered a new population of red, compact objects at high redshifts dubbed `Little Red Dots' (LRDs), which typically show broad emission lines and are thought to be dusty Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Some of their other features, however, challenge the AGN explanation, such as prominent Balmer breaks and extremely faint or even missing metal high-ionization lines, X-ray, or radio emission, including in deep stacks. Time variability is another, robust, test of AGN activity. Here, we exploit the z=7.045 multiply-imaged LRD A2744-QSO1, which offers a particularly unique test of variability due to lensing-induced time delays between the three images spanning 22 yr (2.7 yr in the rest-frame), to investigate its photometric and spectroscopic variability. We find the equivalent widths (EWs) of the broad H&alpha; and H&beta; lines, which are independent of magnification and other systematics, to exhibit significant variations, up to 18±3 % for H&alpha; and up to 22±8 % in H&beta;, on a timescale of 875 d (2.4 yr) in the rest-frame. This suggests that A2744-QSO1 is indeed an AGN. We find no significant photometric variability beyond the limiting systematic uncertainties, so it currently cannot be determined whether the EW variations are due to line-flux or continuum variability. These results are consistent with a typical damped random walk (DRW) variability model for an AGN like A2744-QSO1 (M_BH=4×10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) given the sparse sampling of the light-curve with the available data. Our results therefore support the AGN interpretation of this LRD, and highlight the need for further photometric and spectroscopic monitoring in order to build a detailed and reliable light-curve.

<p>
Nearby blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCDs) share similar properties with objects from the Epoch of Reionization revealed by JWST, in terms of low stellar mass, low metallicity and high specific star-formation rate. Thus, they represent ideal local laboratories for detailed multi-wavelength studies to understand their properties and the mechanisms shaping them. We report the first JWST MIRI/MRS observations of the BCD SBS 0335-052 E, analyzing MIR emission lines tracing different levels of ionization (e.g., [NeII], [SIV], [NeIII], [OIV], [NeV]) of the ionized gas. SBS 0335-052 E MIR emission is characterized by a bright point source, located in one of the youngest and most embedded stellar clusters (t~3 Myr, A_V~15), and underlying extended high-ionization emission (i.e., [OIV], [NeV]) from the surroundings of the older and less dusty stellar clusters (t&lt; 20 Myr, A_V~8). From the comparison with state-of-the-art models, we can exclude shocks, X-ray binaries, and old stellar populations as the main sources of the high ionization. Interestingly, a 4-16% contribution of a ~10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> intermediate massive black hole (IMBH) is needed to justify the strong [NeV]/[NeII] and would be consistent with optical/UV line ratios from previous studies. However, even IMBH models cannot explain the strongest [OIV]/[NeIII]. Also, star-forming models (regardless of including X-ray binaries) struggle to reproduce even the lower ionization line ratios (e.g., [SIV]/[NeII]) typically observed in BCDs. Overall, while current models suggest the need to account for an accreting IMBH in this high-z analog, limitations still exist in predicting high-ionization emission lines (I.P. &gt;54 eV) when modeling these low-metallicity environments, thus other sources of ionization cannot be fully ruled out.

### 232) [2502.05751](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05751v2): On The Very Bright Dropouts Selected Using the James Webb Space Telescope NIRCam Instrument

<p> Bangzheng Sun, Haojing Yan </p>
<p>
The selection of candidate high-redshift galaxies using the dropout technique targeting the Lyman-break signature sometimes yields very bright objects that are too luminous to be easily explained if they are indeed at the expected redshifts. Here we present a systematic study of very bright dropouts selected through successive bands of the NIRCam instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Using the public NIRCam data in four blank fields over 500~arcmin<sup>2</sup>, 300 such objects were found. They have F356W magnitudes &lt;25.1~mag or &lt;26.0~mag depending on the dropout passband, and the majority of them (&gt;80&percnt;) have very red F115W-F356W colors &gt; 2.0~mag, qualifying them as "extremely red objects'' (EROs). We focus on 137 objects that also have mid-IR observations from the JWST MIRI instrument. Their spectral energy distribution analysis shows that these objects are dominated by low-redshift (z~1&ndash;4) galaxies (≳67&percnt;). However, a non-negligible fraction (≳7&percnt;) could be at high redshifts. Seven of our objects have secure spectroscopic redshifts from JWST NIRSpec identifications, and the results confirm this picture: while six are low-redshift galaxies (z≈3), one is a known galaxy at z=8.679 (with M_UV=-22.4~mag and stellar mass M_*=10^9.1M<sub>&odot;</sub>) recovered in our sample. In light of recent theoretical models on early galaxy formation, this confirmed high-redshift galaxy does not pose a challenge. However, as our sample contains very luminous high-redshift candidates in the regime still underexplored (M_UV≤ -23~mag and M_*&gt;10^10.5M<sub>&odot;</sub>), spectroscopic identifications are necessary to ensure they do not create tension with these new models.

### 233) [2502.03522](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03522v2): Towards characterizing dark matter subhalo perturbations in stellar streams with graph neural networks

<p>
The phase space of stellar streams is proposed to detect dark substructure in the Milky Way through the perturbations created by passing subhalos - and thus is a powerful test of the cold dark matter paradigm and its alternatives. Using graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) data compression and simulation-based inference (SBI) on a simulated GD-1-like stream, we improve the constraint on the mass of a [10^8, 10^7, 10^6] M<sub>&odot;</sub> perturbing subhalo by factors of [11, 7, 3] with respect to the current state-of-the-art density power spectrum analysis. We find that the GCNN produces posteriors that are more accurate (better calibrated) than the power spectrum. We simulate the positions and velocities of stars in a GD-1-like stream and perturb the stream with subhalos of varying mass and velocity. Leveraging the feature encoding of the GCNN to compress the input phase space data, we then use SBI to estimate the joint posterior of the subhalo mass and velocity. We investigate how our results scale with the size of the GCNN, the coordinate system of the input and the effect of incomplete observations. Our results suggest that a survey with 10 × fewer stars (300 stars) with complete 6-D phase space data performs about as well as a deeper survey (3000 stars) with only 3-D data (photometry, spectroscopy). The stronger constraining power and more accurate posterior estimation motivate further development of GCNNs in combining future photometric, spectroscopic and astrometric stream observations.

<p>
Recent work with JWST has demonstrated its capability to identify and chemically characterize multiple populations in globular clusters down to the H-burning limit. In this study, we explore the kinematics of multiple populations in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae by combining data from JWST, HST, Gaia, and ground-based telescopes. We analyzed velocity dispersion and anisotropy profiles from the cluster center out to ~10R_h. Our findings indicate that while first population (1G) stars' motions are isotropic, second population (2G) stars' motions are significantly radially anisotropic. These results align with the predictions of simulations of the dynamical evolution of clusters where 2G stars are initially more centrally concentrated than 1G stars. Furthermore, we subdivided the 2G population into two subpopulations: 2G_A and 2G_B, with the latter being more chemically extreme. We compared their dynamical profiles and found no significant differences. For the first time, we measured the degree of energy equipartition among the multiple populations of 47 Tucanae. Overall, within the analyzed radial range (~2-4R_h), both populations exhibit a low degree of energy equipartition. The most significant differences between 1G and 2G stars are observed in the tangential velocity component, where 2G stars are characterized by a stronger degree of energy equipartition than 1G stars. In the radial component, the behavior of 1G and 2G stars is more variable, with differences largely dependent on radius. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the ratio of rotational velocity to velocity dispersion is larger for the 2G population. Finally, we found that 1G stars exhibit higher skewness in their tangential proper motions than 2G stars, providing additional evidence of kinematic differences between the two stellar generations.

### 235) [2502.02647](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02647v2): Synergising semi-analytical models and hydrodynamical simulations to interpret JWST data from the first billion years

<p> Valentin Mauerhofer, Pratika Dayal, Martin G. Haehnelt, Taysun Kimm, Joakim Rosdahl, Romain Teyssier </p>
<p>
The field of high redshift galaxy formation has been revolutionised by JWST, which is yielding unprecedented insights on galaxy assembly at early times. Our key aim is to study the physical mechanisms that can explain the unexpected abundance of bright galaxies at z ≥ 11, as well as their metal enrichment and spectral properties. We also use recent data to determine the key sources of reionisation. To do so, we implement cold gas fractions and star formation efficiencies derived from the SPHINX20 high-resolution radiation-hydrodynamics simulation into DELPHI, a semi-analytic model that tracks the assembly of dark matter halos and their baryonic components from z ~ 4.5-40. In addition, we explore two different methodologies to boost galaxy luminosities at z ≥ 11: a stellar initial mass function (IMF) that becomes increasingly top-heavy with decreasing metallicity and increasing redshift (eIMF model), and star formation efficiencies that increase with increasing redshift (eSFE model). Our key findings are: (i) both the eIMF and eSFE models can explain the abundance of bright galaxies at z ≥ 11; (ii) dust attenuation plays an important role for the bright-end of the UV LF at z ≤ 11; (iii) the mass-metallicity relation is in place as early as z ~ 17 in all models although its slope is model-dependent; (iv) within the spread of both models and observations, all of our models are in good agreement with current estimates of &beta; slopes at z ~ 5-17 and Balmer break strengths at z ~ 6-10; (v) in the eIMF model, galaxies at z≥12 or with M_UV≥-18 show values of  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  ~ 10^25.55~[Hz~erg^-1], twice larger than in other models; (vi) star formation in galaxies below 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> is the key driver of reionisation, providing the bulk (~ 85&percnt;) of ionising photons down to its midpoint at z ~ 7.

### 236) [2501.14026](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14026v2): Luminous Mid-IR Selected Type-2 Quasars at Cosmic Noon in SDSS Stripe82 I: Selection, Composite Photometry, and Spectral Energy Distributions

<p> Ben Wang, Joseph F. Hennawi, Zheng Cai, Gordon T. Richards, Jan-Torge Schindler, Nadia L. Zakamska, Yuzo Ishikawa, Hollis B. Akins, Zechang Sun </p>
<p>
We analyze 23 spectroscopically confirmed Type-2 quasars (QSOs) selected from the WISE 22&mu;m band in the SDSS Stripe 82 region, focusing on their multi-band photometry and spectral energy distributions (SEDs). These objects were selected to be IR-luminous (flux_W4 &gt; 5mJy, i.e., 12.62 &lt; W4 &lt; 14.62  AB   magnitude), optically faint (r &gt; 23) or with red color (r - W4 &gt;8.38). Gemini/GNIRS observations were conducted for all 24 candidates, and 18/24 were also observed with Keck/LRIS. The observations confirm 23 to be real Type-2 QSOs in the redshift range 0.88 - 2.99 (12 are at z&gt;2). We collect multi-band photometry and conduct SED fitting. The composite photometry probes the wavelength from 0.1&mu;m to 10&mu;m at the rest frame. The IR emission is dominated by dust torus implying an average torus luminosity for the sample of L_torus 10^46.84 erg/s. The origin of the rest-UV/optical light is not definitive, but we present three possible scenarios: scattered light, stellar emission, and the reddened accretion disk. Assuming an obscured:unobscured ratio of approximately 1:1, our targets have L_bol = 10^46.28 erg  s<sup>-1</sup> - 10^47.49 erg  s<sup>-1</sup> and around SMBH masses 10^8.18 M<sub>&odot;</sub> - 10^9.39 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, assuming they accreate at the Eddington limit. Compared to previous Type-2 AGN SEDs, our targets have a brighter dust torus and redder optical-IR color. By comparing the SED to the results from JWST `little red dots' (LRDs), we find that these IR-selected Type-2 QSOs have similar SED shapes to the LRDs. This pilot Type-2 QSO survey demonstrates that mid-IR selection is an efficient way to find luminous Type-2 QSOs at z&gt;2. Finally, the composite photometry and Type-2 QSOs SED model generated by this sample provide a guide for finding more Type-2 QSOs at higher redshift.

### 237) [2501.13899](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13899v2): The Pitfalls of Using Lyman Alpha Damping Wings in High-z Galaxy Spectra to Measure the Intergalactic Neutral Hydrogen Fraction

<p> Mason Huberty, Claudia Scarlata, Matthew J. Hayes, Simon Gazagnes </p>
<p>
The Lyman Alpha damping wing is seen in absorption against the spectra of high-redshift galaxies. Modeling of this wing is a way to measure the volume neutral hydrogen fraction of the Universe, as well as to measure the strength of HI absorption in the form of a damped Ly&alpha; absorber (DLA). We use very high-quality ultraviolet spectra of low-z galaxies to create mock high-redshift, low-resolution spectra complete with a damping wing resulting from the IGM and HI absorption from local, dense gas to mimic current James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of the early universe. The simulated spectra are used to test the ability to recover the "true" values of the column density of the DLA (N_DLA) and the volume neutral hydrogen fraction (x_HI) of the IGM through modified stellar continuum fitting. We find that the ability to recover the true values of N_DLA and x_HI simultaneously is compromised by degeneracies between these two parameters, and the spectral shape itself at low-resolution (R~100). The root mean squared error between the recovered and true column density of the DLAs is on the order of 1 dex. This error somewhat decreases with improved resolution (R~1000), but systematically underestimates N_DLA when Ly&alpha; emission is present in the mock spectra. The recovered values of x_HI are poorly constrained and do not improve substantially with the higher resolution. We recommend accounting for these sources of uncertainty and biases when using galaxies' Ly&alpha; damping wings to measure the intergalactic neutral hydrogen fraction.

We explore the evolving relationship between galaxies and their dark matter halos from z ~ 0.1 to z ~ 12 using mass-limited angular clustering measurements in the 0.54 deg<sup>2</sup> of the COSMOS-Web survey. This study provides the first measurements of the mass-limited two-point correlation function at z ≥ 10 and a consistent analysis spanning 13.4 Gyr of cosmic history, setting new benchmarks for future simulations and models. Using a halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework, we derive characteristic halo masses and the stellar-to-halo mass relationship (SHMR) across redshifts and stellar mass bins. Our results first indicate that HOD models fit data at z ≥ 2.5 best when incorporating a non-linear scale-dependent halo bias, boosting clustering at non-linear scales (r = 10-100 kpc). We find that galaxies at z &gt; 10.5 with log(M<sub>&sext;</sub> / M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 8.85 are hosted by halos with M_h ~ 10^10.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, achieving a star formation efficiency (SFE) M<sub>&sext;</sub> / (f_b M_h) up to 1 dex higher than at z ≤ 1. The high galaxy bias at z ≥ 8 suggests that these galaxies reside in massive halos with intrinsic high SFE. Our SHMR evolves significantly with redshift, starting high at z ≥ 10.5, decreasing until z ~ 2 - 3, then increasing again until the present. Current simulations fail to reproduce both massive high-z galaxies and this evolution, while semi-empirical models linking SFE to halo mass, accretion rates, and redshift align with our findings. We propose that z &gt; 8 galaxies experience bursty star formation without significant feedback altering their growth, driving the rapid growth of massive galaxies observed by JWST. Over time, increasing feedback efficiency and exponential halo growth suppress star formation. At z ~ 2 - 3 and after, halo growth slows down while star formation continues, supported by gas reservoirs in halos.

<p>
We present an analysis of the rest-frame optical (&lambda; ≃ 3100-5600  &#8491;) spectrum of a log_10(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 8.6 star-forming galaxy at z=8.271 from JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution observations taken as part of the EXCELS survey. The galaxy (EXCELS-63107) is compact, with a size consistent with the size of local star-forming cluster complexes (r_e &lt; 200   pc) and has an extremely steep UV continuum measured from JWST/NIRCam photometry (&beta;=-3.3±0.3). The JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectrum of EXCELS-63107 is notable for its strong [OIII]&lambda;4363 auroral-line emission relative to the [OIII]&lambda;5007 forbidden line. Via a detailed emission-line and photoionization-modelling analysis, we find that the the observed properties of EXCELS-63107 are consistent with the presence of an ionizing source with an effective temperature of T_eff ≳ 80   000 K heating ionized gas with a density of n_e &lt; 10^4   cm^-3 to a volume-averaged electron temperature of T_e ≃ 34   000 K. Crucially, we find that stellar population models assuming a standard IMF are not capable of producing the required heating. We determine an oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H)= 6.89^+0.26_-0.21 which is one of the lowest directly constrained oxygen abundances measured in any galaxy to date, and ≃ 10 × lower than is typical for z≃8 galaxies with the same stellar mass. The extremely low metallicity of EXCELS-63107 places it in a regime in which theoretical models expect a transition to a top-heavy IMF, and we speculate that a ≃ 10-30   × excess of M &gt; 50   M<sub>&odot;</sub> stars is one plausible explanation for its observed properties. However, more exotic scenarios, such as Pop III star formation within a mildly enriched halo, are also consistent with the observations.

### 240) [2501.09810](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09810v3): The Cosmic Evolution of Fast Radio Bursts Inferred from the CHIME/FRB Baseband Catalog 1

<p> Om Gupta, Paz Beniamini, Pawan Kumar, Steven L. Finkelstein </p>
<p>
Redshift and luminosity distributions are essential for understanding the cosmic evolution of extragalactic objects and phenomena, such as galaxies, gamma-ray bursts, and fast radio bursts (FRBs). For FRBs, these distributions are primarily estimated using the fluence and the Dispersion Measure (DM). Calibrating their joint distribution has been challenging due to a lack of accurate fluences in the intensity data of the CHIME/FRB survey. Using the baseband update of CHIME/FRB Catalog 1, we calibrate the 2D fluence-DM distribution for the first time. We find the energy distribution is described well by a Schechter function with power-law slope of -1.94^+0.14_-0.12. Testing two types of redshift evolution models suggests a likely combination of young and old formation channels. 31^+31_-21% of FRB sources may track star formation, or correspondingly, FRB sources may have delay times of 1.94^+1.54_-1.31 Gyr. A pure star formation tracking population is excluded by only one model at &gt; 2&sigma; confidence. An updated cosmic star formation rate density evolution up to redshift 14 is constrained by compiling results from several JWST studies. The furthest FRB detection with planned radio facilities is expected to be at z ≈ 5. A radio telescope operating at 200 MHz with a system-equivalent flux density of ≤ 0.07 Jy (equivalent to a detection threshold of 1 mJy ms) and instantaneous sky coverage of ≳ 400 square degrees should be able to detect 630^+730_-485 FRBs year^-1 at z ≳ 6 and 53^+83_-43 FRBs year^-1 at z≳ 8, which is sufficient to differentiate between reionization histories.

Galaxy groups with M_tot ≲ 10^14 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and up to a few tens of members are the most common galaxy environment, marking the transition between field and massive clusters. Identifying groups plays a crucial role in understanding structure formation and galaxy evolution. Modern deep surveys allow us to build well-characterized samples of groups up to the regime where structures were taking shape. We aimed to build the largest deep catalog of galaxy groups to date over the COSMOS-Web field effective area of 0.45 deg<sup>2</sup>, leveraging the deep high quality data of the new COSMOS-Web photometric catalog resulted from the James Webb Space Telescope observations of the COSMOS-Web field. We performed the group search with the AMICO algorithm, a linear matched filter based on an analytical model for the group signal. AMICO has already been tested in wide and deep field surveys, including COSMOS data up to z=2. In this work, we tested the algorithm performances at even higher redshift and searched for protocluster cores at z&gt;2. We compiled a list of known protoclusters in COSMOS at 2 ≤ z ≤ 3.7, matched them with our detections and studied the clustering of the detected cores. We estimated purity and completeness of our sample by creating data-driven mocks with the SinFoniA code and linked signal-to-noise to purity. We detected 1678 groups in the COSMOS-Web field up to z=3.7, including lists of members extending nearly two magnitudes deeper than the previous AMICO-COSMOS catalog. 756 groups were detected with purity of 80&percnt;. More than 500 groups have their redshift confirmed by assigning spectroscopic counterparts. This group catalog offers a unique opportunity to explore galaxy evolution in different environments spanning ~12 Gyr and to study groups, from the least rich population to the formation of the most massive clusters.

In this work we estimate the explosion and progenitor properties of six Type II supernovae (SNe) at 0.675 ≤ z ≤ 3.61 discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) transient survey by modeling their light curves. Two Type II SNe are found to have high explosion energies of 3e51 erg, while the other four Type II SNe are estimated to have typical explosion energies found in the local Universe [(0.5-2)e51 erg]. The fraction of Type II SNe with high explosion energies might be higher at high redshifts because of, e.g., lower metallicity, but it is still difficult to draw a firm conclusion because of the small sample size and potential observational biases. We found it difficult to constrain the progenitor masses for Type II SNe in our sample because of the sparse light-curve data. We found two Type II SN light curves can be better reproduced by introducing confined, dense circumstellar matter. Thus, the confined, dense circumstellar matter frequently observed in nearby Type II SNe is likely to exist in Type II SNe at high redshifts as well. Two Type II SNe are estimated to have high host galaxy extinctions, showing the ability of JWST to discover dust-obscured SNe at high redshifts. More high-redshift Type II SNe are required to investigate the differences in the properties of Type II SNe near and far, but here we show the first glimpse into the high-redshift population of Type II SNe.

We present a detailed optical and NIR spectral analysis of J-138717, a post-starburst galaxy at z = 1.8845 observed with JWST/NIRSpec, for which we derive a stellar mass of 3.5 ± 0.2 × 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and a stellar velocity dispersion of 198 ± 10 km s<sup>-1</sup>. We estimate an age of ~0.9 Gyr and a sub-solar metallicity (between -0.4 and -0.2 dex). We find generally consistent results when fitting the optical and NIR wavelength ranges separately or using different model libraries. The reconstruction of the star formation history indicates that the galaxy assembled most of its mass quickly and then rapidly quenched, ~0.4 Gyr prior to observation. Line diagnostics suggest that the weak emission is probably powered by residual star formation (SFR~0.2M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1) or a low-luminosity AGN, with no strong evidence for outflows in ionized or neutral gas. We perform a detailed study of the NIR spectral indices by comparing observations with predictions of several state-of-the-art stellar population models. This is unprecedented at such a high redshift. In particular, the analysis of several CO and CN features argues against a heavy contribution of Thermally Pulsating (TP-)AGB stars. Observations align better with models that include a minimal contribution from TP-AGB stars, but they are also consistent with a mild contribution from TP-AGB stars, assuming a younger age (consistent with the fits). The analysis of other NIR spectral indices shows that current models struggle to reproduce observations. This highlights the need for improved stellar population models in the NIR, especially at young ages and low metallicities, which is most relevant for studying high redshift galaxies in the JWST era.

### 244) [2501.07119](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07119v3): Can Dark Stars account for the star formation efficiency excess at very high redshifts?

<p> Lei Lei, Yi-Ying Wang, Guan-Wen Yuan, Tong-Lin Wang, Martin A. T. Groenewegen, Yi-Zhong Fan </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently conducted observations of massive galaxies at high redshifts, revealing a notable anomaly in their star formation efficiency (SFE). Motivated by the recent identification of three ~ 10^6M<sub>&odot;</sub> dark star candidates, we investigate whether dark stars can be the origin of the SFE excess. It turns out that the excess can be reproduced by a group of dark stars with M ≳ 10^3  M<sub>&odot;</sub>, because of their domination in generating primary UV radiation in high-redshift galaxies. The genesis of these dark stars is attributed to the capture of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) within a mass range of tens of GeV to a few TeV. However, if the top-heavy initial mass function of dark stars holds up to ~ 10^5M<sub>&odot;</sub>, the relic black holes stemming from their collapse would be too abundant to be consistent with the current observations of Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). We thus suggest that just a small fraction of SFE excess may be contributed by the very massive dark stars and the majority likely originated from other reasons such as the Population III stars in view of their rather similar UV radiation efficiencies.

### 245) [2501.04912](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04912v2): Another piece to the puzzle: radio detection of a JWST detected AGN candidate

<p> Anniek J. Gloudemans, Kenneth J. Duncan, Anna-Christina Eilers, Emanuele Paolo Farina, Yuichi Harikane, Kohei Inayoshi, Erini Lambrides, Eleni Vardoulaki </p>
<p>
Radio observations can provide crucial insight into the nature of a new abundant and mysterious population of dust-reddened active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), including Little Red Dots (LRDs). In this study, we search for radio bright sources in a large sample of ~700 JWST discovered AGN candidates (z~2-11) in the 0.144-3 GHz frequency range, utilizing deep radio imaging in COSMOS, GOODS-N, and GOODS-S. Only one source, PRIMER-COS 3866 at z=4.66, is significantly detected in our radio surveys, which has been previously identified as an X-ray AGN. Its radio properties are consistent with both an AGN and star formation origin with a spectral index of &alpha;=-0.76^+0.11_-0.09, radio-loudness of R≈0.5, and brightness temperature limit of T_b ≳ 10^3 K. Our stacking results of both spectroscopically and photometrically selected AGN candidates yield non-detections in all fields, with 3&sigma; limits of L_1.4GHz &lt; 8.6×10^39 erg s<sup>-1</sup> (spectroscopic sample) and L_1.3GHz &lt; 1.3×10^39 erg s<sup>-1</sup> (photometric sample). We demonstrate that these results are still consistent with expectations from the empirical L_X - L_H&alpha; and L_X - L_R correlations established for local AGN. We argue that current radio observations in these studied fields have insufficient depth to claim JWST discovered AGN candidates are radio-weak. We project that future surveys carried out by the SKA and ngVLA should be able to obtain significant detections within a few hours, providing crucial measurements of their brightness temperature, which would allow for distinguishing between AGN and starburst-driven origins of this new abundant population.

### 246) [2501.03309](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03309v2): Little Red Dots are Tidal Disruption Events in Runaway-Collapsing Clusters

<p> Jillian Bellovary </p>
<p>
I hypothesize a physical explanation for the "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The first star formation in the universe occurs in dense clusters, some of which may undergo runaway collapse and form an intermediate mass black hole. This process would appear as a very dense stellar system, with recurring tidal disruption events (TDEs) as stellar material is accreted by the black hole. Such a system would be compact, UV-emitting, and exhibit broad H-alpha emission. If runaway collapse is the primary mechanism for forming massive black hole seeds, this process could be fairly common and explain the large volume densities of LRDs. In order to match the predicted number density of runaway collapse clusters, the tidal disruption rate must be on the order of 10^-4 per year. A top-heavy stellar initial mass function may be required to match observations without exceeding the predicted LambdaCDM mass function. The TDE LRD hypothesis can be verified with followup JWST observations looking for TDE-like variability.

### 247) [2501.03217](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03217v2): No evidence (yet) for increased star-formation efficiency at early times

<p> C. T. Donnan, J. S. Dunlop, R. J. McLure, D. J. McLeod, F. Cullen </p>
<p>
Early JWST observations have revealed substantial numbers of galaxies out to redshifts as high as z ≃ 14, reflecting a slow evolution of the galaxy UV luminosity function (LF) not anticipated by many models of galaxy evolution. The discovery of fairly massive galaxies at early times has again been viewed as a challenge to our understanding of early galaxy growth or even &Lambda;CDM cosmology. Here we develop and test a simple theoretical model which shows that these observations are unsurprising, but instead are arguably as expected if one assumes a non-evolving halo-mass dependent galaxy-formation efficiency consistent with that observed today. Crucially, this model matches the observed galaxy UV LF at z ≃ 6-13 and the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) at z ≃ 6-8. Using new constraints on Lyman continuum escape and the ionizing photon production efficiency, we also predict the progress of cosmic hydrogen reionization consistent with current observations. The requirement to fit both the UV LF and the GSMF breaks the degeneracy between mass-to-light ratio and star-formation efficiency, where the typical mass-to-light ratio of galaxies increases systematically with redshift beyond z ≃ 6. However, at present this does not require changes to the IMF, cosmic dust, or any other new astrophysics. Rather, the current data can be reproduced simply by assuming ever-younger stellar populations consistent with a formation epoch at z ≃ 15. A key prediction of our model therefore is that there should be a more rapid drop-off in the galaxy number density beyond z ≃ 15, where one can no longer appeal to ever younger ages to offset the precipitous descent of the halo mass function.

### 248) [2412.18654](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18654v2): Diffuse Neutrino Signals from Dark Stars Seeding Super-Massive Black Holes

<p> Thomas Schwemberger, Volodymyr Takhistov </p>
<p>
Dark stars (DSs) &ndash; first stars powered by dark-matter (DM) heating rather than fusion &ndash; could form in the early Universe. They can grow to ≳ 10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> masses and collapse into seeds of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We demonstrate that diffuse neutrino flux generated by DSs can be observable in existing experiments and have energies reaching hundreds of MeV, providing novel window for probing SMBH progenitors. We establish first constraints on DSs and DM annihilations powering them using data from Super-Kamiokande and IceCube neutrino experiments, and consistent with James Webb Space Telescope observations. Upcoming experiments such as Hyper-Kamiokande, DUNE, JUNO will be able to explore DS properties with enhanced sensitivity.

### 249) [2412.16440](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16440v2): Coevolution of Dwarf Galaxies and Their Circumgalactic Medium Across Cosmic Time

<p> Pei-Cheng Tung, Ke-Jung Chen </p>
<p>
Dwarf galaxies are thought of as the building blocks of large galaxies such as our Milky Way. This paper presents new high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies and their intergalactic medium with the ttGIZMO code. Our simulations consider the key physical processes of galaxy evolution, such as gas cooling, chemistry, and stellar and black hole feedback. Unlike the previous work, the initial conditions of our simulations taking the dwarf galaxies of 2-5 × 10^10   M<sub>&odot;</sub> from the realistic cosmology simulations, ttIllustrisTNG. We further increase the original resolution of ttIllustrisTNG by a factor of ~ 100 via a particle splitting scheme. Our results show that the evolution of complex multiphase CGM and its metal content is sensitive to the redshift of dwarf galaxies. The accretion of CGM into dwarf galaxies plays a key role in providing 20 &percnt; - 50 &percnt; of the star-forming gas and replenishing 40 &percnt; - 70 &percnt; of the total mass in the galactic disk. Furthermore, the accretion history of supermassive black holes in the centers of high-z dwarf galaxies shows episodic patterns with high-accreting states close to ~ 10 &percnt; of the Eddington mass accretion rate, implying the rapid growth of supermassive black holes in the early universe, which may be revealed by the coming observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

### 250) [2412.14685](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14685v3): The JWST/NIRSpec view of the nuclear region in the prototypical merging galaxy NGC 6240

<p>
Merger events are thought to be an important phase in the assembly of massive galaxies. At the same time, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) play a fundamental role in the evolution of their star formation histories. Both phenomena can be observed at work in NGC 6240, a local prototypical merger, classified as an UltraLuminous InfraRed Galaxy (ULIRG) thanks to its elevated infrared luminosity. Interestingly, NGC 6240 hosts two AGN separated by 1.5''(~ 735 pc), detected in both X-ray and radio band. Taking advantage of the unprecedented sensitivity and wavelength coverage provided by the Integral Field Unit (IFU) of the NIRSpec instrument onboard JWST, we observed the nuclear region of NGC 6240 in a FoV of 3.7'' x 3.7''(1.9 x 1.9 kpc<sup>2</sup>), to investigate gas kinematics and InterStellar Medium (ISM) properties with a high spatial resolution of ~ 0.1'' (or ~ 50 pc). We separated the different gas kinematic components through multi-Gaussian fitting and studied the excitation properties of the ISM from the NIR diagnostic diagram based on the H<sub>2</sub> 1-0 S(1)/BrGamma and [Fe II]1.257micron/PaBeta lines ratios. We isolated the ionization cones of the two nuclei, and detected coronal lines emission from both of them. Using H<sub>2</sub> line ratios, we found that the molecular hydrogen gas is excited mostly by thermal processes. We computed a hot molecular gas mass of 1.3 x 10^5 M_sun and an ionized gas mass in the range of 10^5 - 10^7 M_sun. We studied with unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity the kinematics of the molecular and ionized gas phases. We revealed the complex structure of the molecular gas and found a blueshifted outflow near the Southern nucleus, together with filaments connecting a highly redshifted H<sub>2</sub> cloud with the two nuclei. We speculate on the possible nature of this H<sub>2</sub> cloud and propose two possible scenarios: either outflowing gas, or a tidal cloud falling onto the nuclei.

<p>
We present a spectroscopic analysis of two star-forming galaxies at z≃5 observed with JWST/NIRSpec as part of the EXCELS survey. The detection of the CIII]~&lambda;&lambda;1906,09, [OII] &lambda;&lambda;3726,29, [OIII] &lambda;&lambda;4363,5007, and [NII] &lambda;6584 emission lines enables an investigation of the C/O, N/O, and C/N abundance ratios using the temperature-sensitive method. The galaxies have stellar masses of log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 8.09^+  0.24_-0.15 and log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 8.02^+  0.06_-0.08 with metallicities of Z ≃ 0.2   Z<sub>&odot;</sub> and Z ≃ 0.3   Z<sub>&odot;</sub>. These metallicities are somewhat higher than is typical for other z≳ 5 galaxies with similar stellar mass and are comparable to z ≃ 0 analogues. Both galaxies display evidence for elevated N/O ratios with respect to the typical star-forming galaxies at z≃0, with log(N/O) = -1.07^+ 0.17_-0.13 and log(N/O) = -0.86^+ 0.15_-0.11 respectively. In contrast, we find low C abundances, with log(C/O)=-0.82±0.22 and log(C/O)=-1.02±0.22, consistent with the predicted yields of core-collapse supernovae. Following the trend observed in other high-redshift sources, we find that the C/N ratios are lower at fixed O/H compared to the majority of local galaxies. Via a comparison to detailed chemical evolution models, we find that a standard or bottom-heavy IMF can explain the observed abundance ratios where the N-enrichment comes from intermediate mass (≃ 4-7   M<sub>&odot;</sub>) stars. Our results demonstrate that robust measurements of CNO abundances with phJWST can reveal unique enrichment pathways in galaxies as a function of both metallicity and redshift.

We use hierarchical Bayesian modelling to calibrate a network of 32 all-sky faint DA white dwarf (DA WD) spectrophotometric standards (16.5 &lt; V &lt; 19.5) alongside three CALSPEC standards, from 912 &#8491; to 32 &mu;m. The framework is the first of its kind to jointly infer photometric zeropoints and WD parameters (surface gravity log g, effective temperature T_eff, extinction A_V, dust relation parameter R_V) by simultaneously modelling both photometric and spectroscopic data. We model panchromatic Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (HST/WFC3) UVIS and IR photometry, HST/STIS UV spectroscopy and ground-based optical spectroscopy to sub-percent precision. Photometric residuals for the sample are the lowest yet yielding &lt;0.004 mag RMS on average from the UV to the NIR, achieved by jointly inferring time-dependent changes in system sensitivity and WFC3/IR count-rate nonlinearity. Our GPU-accelerated implementation enables efficient sampling via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, critical for exploring the high-dimensional posterior space. The hierarchical nature of the model enables population analysis of intrinsic WD and dust parameters. Inferred spectral energy distributions from this model will be essential for calibrating the James Webb Space Telescope as well as next-generation surveys, including Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

<p>
We study the rest-frame optical and ultraviolet morphology of galaxies in the first billion years of the Universe. Using JWST data from the UNCOVER and MegaScience surveys targeting the lensing cluster Abell 2744 we present multi-band morphological measurements for a sample of 995 galaxies selected using 20-band NIRCam photometry and 35 using NIRSpec Prism spectroscopy over the redshift range of 4&lt;z&lt;8. The wavelength-dependent morphology is measured using pysersic by simultaneously modeling the images in 6 NIRCam wide filters covering the rest-frame UV to optical. The joint modeling technique increases the precision of measured radii by 50&percnt;. Galaxies in our sample show a wide range of Sersic indices, with no systematic difference between optical and UV morphology. We model the size-mass relation in a Bayesian manner using a continuity model to directly fit the redshift evolution while accounting for observational uncertainties. We find the average size of galaxies at log M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>=8.5 grows rapidly, from 400 pc at z=8 to 830 pc at z=4. This is faster evolution than expected from power law scalings of the Hubble parameter or scale factor that describe well previous results at z&lt;2. This suggests that different and/or much stronger processes affect low mass systems during the epoch of reionization. The measured logarithmic slope (0.25) and scatter (0.23 dex) are non-evolving. We discuss the remarkable consistency of the slope and scatter over cosmic time in the context of the galaxy-halo connection.

### 254) [2412.05668](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05668v3): Kinematic evidence of magnetospheric accretion for Herbig Ae stars with JWST NIRSpec

<p> Ciarán Rogers, Bernhard Brandl, Guido de Marchi </p>
<p>
Hydrogen emission lines have been used to estimate the mass accretion rate of pre-main-sequence stars for over 25 years, although the physical origin of these lines is still unclear. Magnetospheric accretion (MA) and magneto-centrifugal winds are the two most often invoked mechanisms. Using a combination of HST photometry and new JWST NIRSpec spectra in the range 1.66 - 3.2  &mu; m, we analysed the emission line spectra of five sources to attempt to reveal the physical origin of their hydrogen emission lines. These sources reside in NGC 3603, a Galactic massive star forming region. We performed fits of the SEDs of the five sources employing a Markov chain Monte Carlo exploration to estimate T_eff, R_*, M_*, and A(V) for each source. We performed a kinematic analysis across three spectral series of hydrogen lines (Paschen, Brackett, and Pfund). We studied the full width at half maximum and optical depth of the lines in order to constrain the emission origin. We calculated the expected velocities from MA as well as gas in Keplerian orbit for our sources. All five sources have SEDs consistent with young intermediate-mass stars. We classified three of these sources as Herbig Ae type stars based on their T_eff. Hydrogen lines with high upper energy levels n_up tend to be significantly broader than lines with a lower n_up. The optical depth of the emission lines is also highest for the high-velocity component of each line, and it becomes optically thin in the low-velocity component. Emission from magneto-centrifugal winds is not consistent with any of our observations. Two sources are consistent with emission from a Keplerian disc, or MA. The remaining three sources are only consistent with emission from MA. In the future, this approach can be applied to more statistically significant samples of Herbig AeBe spectra, including existing archival observations.

<p> Ciarán Rogers, Guido de Marchi, Bernhard Brandl </p>
<p>
NGC 3603 is the optically brightest massive star forming region (SFR) in the Milky Way, representing a small scale starburst region. Studying young stars in regions like this allows us to assess how star and planet formation proceeds in a dense clustered environment with high levels of UV radiation. JWST provides the sensitivity, unbroken wavelength coverage, and spatial resolution required to study individual pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars in distant massive SFRs in detail for the first time. Using the Micro-Shutter Assembly (MSA) onboard the Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec), multi-object spectroscopy was performed, yielding 100 stellar spectra. We fit the PMS spectra to derive their photospheric properties, extinction, and NIR veiling. From this, we determined the masses and ages of our sources by placing them on the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram (HRD). Their accretion rates were determined by converting the luminosity of hydrogen emission lines to an accretion luminosity. We have classified 42 as actively accreting. Our sources span a range of masses from 0.5 to 7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Twelve of these accreting sources have ages consistent with ≥ 10 Myrs, with four having ages of ≥ 15 Myrs. Their mass accretion rates span 5 orders of magnitude and are systematically higher for a given stellar age and mass than for a comparative sample taken from low-mass SFRs. We report an environmental relationship between M&#775;_acc and the density of ambient molecular gas as traced by nebular H<sub>2</sub> emission.

### 256) [2412.05363](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05363v3): High N/O ratio at high redshift as a result of a strong burst of star formation and differential galactic winds

<p>
Recent observations by JWST have revealed supersolar ^14N abundances in galaxies at very high redshift. On the other hand, these galaxies show subsolar metallicity. The observed N/O ratios are difficult to reproduce in the framework of chemical evolution models for the Milky Way. Our aim is to reproduce these high N/O ratios with chemical evolution models assuming different histories of star formation triggering galactic winds coupled with detailed nucleosynthesis prescriptions for ^14N, ^12C, ^16O and ^56Fe. We compute several models for small galaxies (10^9  - 10^10  M<sub>&odot;</sub>) with high star formation efficiency and strong galactic winds. These winds are assumed to be differential, carrying out mainly the products of the explosion of core-collapse supernovae. We find that only models with high star formation rates, normal initial mass function, and differential galactic winds can reproduce the observed chemical abundances. We also find that with the same assumptions about star formation and galactic winds, but with a very rapid formation resulting from fast gas infall, we can also reproduce the estimated ages of these objects. We find no necessity to invoke peculiar nucleosynthesis from Population III stars, very massive stars and supermassive stars.

### 257) [2412.03653](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03653v2): Weakness of X-rays and Variability in High-redshift AGNs with Super-Eddington Accretion

<p> Kohei Inayoshi, Shigeo S. Kimura, Hirofumi Noda </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations enable the exploration of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with broad-line emission in the early universe. Despite their clear radiative and morphological signatures of AGNs in rest-frame optical bands, complementary evidence of AGN activity - such as X-ray emission and UV/optical variability - remains rarely detected. The weakness of X-rays and variability in these broad-line emitters challenges the conventional AGN paradigm, indicating that the accretion processes or environments around the central black holes (BHs) differ from those of low-redshift counterparts. In this work, we study the radiation spectra of super-Eddington accretion disks enveloped by high-density coronae. Radiation-driven outflows from the disk transport mass to the poles, resulting in moderately optically-thick, warm coronae formed through effective inverse Comptonization. This mechanism leads to softer X-ray spectra and larger bolometric correction factors for X-rays compared to typical AGNs, while being consistent with those of JWST AGNs and low-redshift super-Eddington accreting AGNs. In this scenario, UV/optical variability is suppressed due to photon trapping within super-Eddington disks, while X-ray emissions remain weak yet exhibit significant relative variability. These characteristics are particularly evident in high-redshift AGNs powered by lower-mass BHs with ≲ 10^7-8~M<sub>&odot;</sub>, which undergo rapid mass accretion following overmassive evolutionary tracks relative to the BH-to-stellar mass correlation in the local universe.

<p>
We report integral field spectroscopy observations with the Near-Infrared Spectrograph on board JWST targeting the 60 kpc environment surrounding the most luminous obscured quasar known at z=4.6. We detect ionized gas filaments on 40 kpc scales connecting a network of merging galaxies likely to form a cluster. We find regions of low ionization consistent with large-scale shock excitation surrounding the central dust-obscured quasar, out to distances nearly eight times the effective stellar radius of the quasar host galaxy. In the nuclear region, we find an ionized outflow driven by the quasar with velocities reaching 13,000 km s<sup>-1</sup>, one of the fastest discovered to date with an outflow rate of 2000 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1 and a kinetic luminosity of 6×10^46 erg s<sup>-1</sup> resulting in coupling efficiency between the bolometric luminosity of the quasar and the outflow of 5%. The kinetic luminosity of the outflow is sufficient to power the turbulent motion of the gas on galactic and circumgalactic scales and is likely the primary driver of the radiative shocks on interstellar medium and circumgalactic medium scales. This provides compelling evidence supporting long-standing theoretical predictions that powerful quasar outflows are a main driver in regulating the heating and accretion rate of gas onto massive central cluster galaxies.

<p>
Investigating the ionizing emission of star-forming galaxies is critical to understanding their contribution to reionization and their impact on the surrounding environment. The number of ionizing photons available to reionize the intergalactic medium (IGM) depends not only on the abundance of galaxies but also on their efficiency in producing ionizing photons ( &xi;<sub>ion</sub> ). We aim to estimate the  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  using Balmer lines in a sample of 761 galaxies at 4≤ z ≤ 10 selected from different JWST surveys. We used the available HST and JWST photometry to perform a SED fitting in the sample to determine their physical properties. We used the BAGPIPES code and assumed a delayed exponential model for the star formation history. We used the NIRSpec spectra from prism or grating configurations to estimate Balmer luminosities and then constrained  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  values after dust correction. We find a mean value of 10^25.22Hz erg^-1 for  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  in the sample with an observed scatter of 0.42dex. We find an increase in the median values of  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  which confirms the redshift evolution of  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  found in other works. Regarding the relation with physical properties, we find a decrease of  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  with increasing stellar mass, indicating that low-mass galaxies are efficient producers of ionizing photons. We also find an increase of  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  with increasing specific star formation rate (sSFR) and increasing UV absolute magnitude, which indicates that faint galaxies and with high sSFR are also efficient producers. We also investigated the relation of  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  with the EW([OIII]&lambda;5007) and find that galaxies with the higher EW([OIII]) are the more efficient producers of ionizing photons. Similarly, we find that galaxies with higher O32 ratios and lower gas-phase metallicities (based on the R23 calibration) show higher  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  values.

<p> Hiroto Yanagisawa, Masami Ouchi, Kimihiko Nakajima, Yuichi Harikane, Seiji Fujimoto, Yoshiaki Ono, Hiroya Umeda, Minami Nakane, Hidenobu Yajima, Hajime Fukushima, Yi Xu </p>
<p>
We investigate UV continuum slopes &beta; of 863 galaxies at z=4-14 using archival JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectra obtained from major JWST GTO, ERS, and GO programs, including JADES, CEERS, and UNCOVER. Among these galaxies, we identify a remarkable galaxy at z=9.25, dubbed EBG-1, with a significantly blue UV slope &beta;=-2.99±0.15, unlike the rest of the galaxies that exhibit red continua or ambiguous blue continua hindered by large uncertainties. We confirm that the &beta; value negligibly changes by the data reduction and fitting wavelength ranges for UV emission/absorption line masking. The extreme blue slope, &beta;=-3.0, rules out significant contributions from dust extinction or AGN activity. Comparing with stellar and nebular emission models, we find that such a blue UV slope cannot be reproduced solely by stellar models even with very young, metal-poor, or top-heavy contiguous star formation associated with strong nebular continua making the UV slopes red, but with a high ionizing photon escape fraction, f<sub>esc</sub>^ion ≳ 0.5, for a weak nebular continuum. While the H&beta; emission line is not detected, likely due to the limited sensitivity of the spectrum, we find moderately weak [O III] &lambda;&lambda;4959,5007 emission lines for the given star-formation rate (3  M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1) and stellar mass (10^8.0   M<sub>&odot;</sub>) that are about three times weaker than the average emission lines, again suggestive of the high ionizing photon escape fraction, f<sub>esc</sub>^ion ~ 0.7 or more. EBG-1 would provide crucial insights into stellar and nebular continuum emission in high-redshift galaxies, serving as an example of the ionizing photon escaping site at the epoch of reionization.

### 261) [2411.08747](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08747v2): Regression for Astronomical Data with Realistic Distributions, Errors and Non-linearity

<p> Tao Jing, Cheng Li </p>
<p>
We have developed a new regression technique, the maximum likelihood (ML)-based method and its variant, the KS-test based method, designed to obtain unbiased regression results from typical astronomical data. A normalizing flow model is employed to automatically estimate the unobservable intrinsic distribution of the independent variable as well as the unobservable correlation between uncertainty level and intrinsic value of both independent and dependent variables from the observed data points in a variational inference based empirical Bayes approach. By incorporating these estimated distributions, our method comprehensively accounts for the uncertainties associated with both independent and dependent variables. Our test on both mock data and real astronomical data from PHANGS-ALMA and PHANGS-JWST demonstrates that, given a sufficiently large sample size (&gt; 1000), both the ML-based method and the KS-test based method significantly outperform the existing widely-used methods, particularly in cases of low signal-to-noise ratios. The KS-test based method exhibits remarkable robustness against deviations from underlying assumptions, complex intrinsic distributions, varying correlations between uncertainty levels and intrinsic values, inaccuracies in uncertainty estimations, outliers, and saturation effects. For sample sizes between 300 and 1000, the ML-based method yields the best performance. In the low data regime (&lt; 300), the ML-based method maintains comparable performance to other state-of-the-art methods. A GPU-compatible Python implementation of our methods, nicknamed "raddest'', will be made publicly available upon acceptance of this paper.

<p>
Massive, intensely star-forming galaxies at high redshift require a supply of molecular gas from their gas reservoirs, replenished by infall from the surrounding circumgalactic medium, to sustain their immense star-formation rates. However, our knowledge of the extent and morphology of their cold-gas reservoirs is still in its infancy. We present the results of stacking 80 hours of JVLA observations of CO(1&ndash;0) emission &ndash; which traces the cold molecular gas &ndash; in nineteen z=2.0-4.5 dusty, star-forming galaxies from the AS2VLA survey. The visibility-plane stack reveals extended emission with a half-light radius of 3.8±0.5~kpc, 2&ndash;3× more extended than the dust-obscured star formation and 1.4±0.2× more extended than the stellar emission revealed by JWST. Stacking the [CI](1&ndash;0) observations for ten galaxies from our parent sample yields a half-light radius ≤2.6~kpc, marginally smaller than CO(1&ndash;0). The CO(1&ndash;0) size is also comparable to the [CII] halos detected around high-redshift star-forming galaxies, suggesting these arise from molecular gas. Photo-dissociation region modelling indicates that the extended CO(1&ndash;0) emission arises from clumpy, dense clouds rather than smooth, diffuse gas. Our results show that the bulk (up to 80&percnt;) of molecular gas resides outside the star-forming region; with only a small part directly contributing to their current star formation.

(Abridged) JWST continues to deliver incredibly detailed infrared (IR) images of star forming regions in the Milky Way and beyond. IR emission from star-forming regions is very spectrally rich due to emission from gas-phase atoms, ions, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Physically interpreting IR images of these regions relies on assumptions about the underlying spectral energy distribution in the imaging bandpasses. We aim to provide empirical prescriptions linking line, PAH, and continuum intensities from JWST images, to facilitate the interpretation of JWST images in a wide variety of contexts. We use JWST PDRs4All Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) imaging and Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) integral field unit (IFU) and MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) spectroscopic observations of the Orion Bar photodissociation region (PDR), to directly compare and cross-calibrate imaging and IFU data at ~100 AU resolution over a region where the radiation field and ISM environment evolves from the hot ionized gas to the cold molecular gas. We measure the relative contributions of line, PAH, and continuum emission to the NIRCam and MIRI filters as functions of local physical conditions. We provide empirical prescriptions based on NIRCam and MIRI images to derive intensities of emission lines and PAH features. Within the range of the environments probed in this study, these prescriptions accurately predict Pa-&alpha;, Br-&alpha;, PAH 3.3 &mu;m and 11.2 &mu;m intensities, while those for FeII 1.644 &mu;m, H<sub>2</sub> 1&ndash;0 S(1) 2.12 &mu;m and 1&ndash;0 S(9) 4.96 &mu;m, and PAH 7.7 &mu;m show more complicated environmental dependencies. Linear combinations of JWST NIRCam and MIRI images provide effective tracers of ionized gas, H<sub>2</sub>, and PAH emission in PDRs. We expect these recipes to be useful for both the Galactic and extragalactic communities.

<p> Zijian Zhang, Linhua Jiang, Weiyang Liu, Luis C. Ho </p>
<p>
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a population of red and compact sources at z ≳ 5 known as "Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) that are likely active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here we present a comprehensive study of the variability of 314 LRDs with multi-epoch JWST observations in five deep fields: UDS, GOODS-S, GOODS-N, Abell 2744, and COSMOS. Our analyses use all publicly available JWST NIRCam imaging data in these fields, together with multi-epoch JWST MIRI images available. We measure the significance (signal-to-noise ratio or SNR_var) of the variabilities for all LRDs and statistically evaluate their variabilities using the SNR_var distributions. We pay particular attention to the systematic offsets of photometric zero points among different epochs that seem to commonly exist. The derived SNR_var distributions of the LRDs, including those with broad H&alpha;/H&beta; emission lines, follow the standard Gaussian distribution, and are generally consistent with those of the comparison samples of objects detected in the same images. This finding suggests that the LRD population on average does not show strong variability, which can be explained by super-Eddington accretion of the black holes in AGNs. Alternatively, many of them may be dominated by galaxies. We also find eight strongly variable LRD candidates with variability amplitudes of 0.24 &ndash; 0.82 mag. The rest-frame optical SEDs of these variable LRDs should have significant AGN contribution. Future JWST observations will provide more variability information of LRDs.

<p>
During the last decade, studies about highly attenuated and massive red star-forming galaxies (RedSFGs) at z ~ 4 have suggested that they could constitute a crucial population for unraveling the mechanisms driving the transition from vigorous star formation to quiescence at high redshifts. Since such a transition seems to be linked to a morphological transformation, studying the morphological properties of these RedSFGs is essential to our understanding of galaxy evolution. To this end, we are using JWST/NIRCam images from the CEERS survey to assemble a mass-complete sample of 188 massive galaxies at z=3-4, for which we perform resolved-SED fit. After classifying galaxies into typical blue SFGs (BlueSFGs), RedSFGs and quiescent galaxies (QGs), we compare the morphologies of each population in terms of stellar mass density, SFR density, sSFR, dust-attenuation and mass-weighted age. We find that RedSFGs and QGs present similar stellar surface density profiles and that RedSFGs manifest a dust attenuation concentration significantly higher than that of BlueSFGs at all masses. This indicates that to become quiescent, a BlueSFG must transit through a major compaction phase once it has become sufficiently massive. At the same time, we find RedSFGs and QGs to account for more than 50&percnt; of galaxies with log(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&gt; 10.4 at this redshift. This transition mass corresponds to the "critical mass" delineating the bimodality between BlueSFGs and QGs in the local Universe. We then conclude that there is a bimodality between extended BlueSFGs and compact, highly attenuated RedSFGs that have undergone a major gas compaction phase enabling the latter to build a massive bulb in situ. There is evidence that this early-stage separation is at the origin of the local bimodality between BlueSFGs and QGs, which we refer to as a "primeval bimodality".

### 266) [2410.20530](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20530v2): On the Origin of the High Star-Formation Efficiency in Massive Galaxies at Cosmic Dawn

<p> Zachary Lee Andalman, Romain Teyssier, Avishai Dekel </p>
<p>
Motivated by the early excess of bright galaxies seen by JWST, we run zoom-in cosmological simulations of a massive galaxy at Cosmic Dawn, in a halo of 10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z = 9, using the hydro-gravitational code RAMSES at an effective resolution ~ 10~pc. We investigate physical mechanisms that enhance the star-formation efficiencies (SFEs) at the high gas densities of the star-forming regions in this galaxy (~ 3× 10^3~cm^-3, ~ 10^4~M<sub>&odot;</sub>/pc^2). Our fiducial star formation recipe uses a physically-motivated, turbulence-based, multi-freefall model, avoiding ad hoc extrapolation from lower redshifts. By z = 9, our simulated galaxy is a clumpy, thick, rotating disc with a high stellar mass ~ 3× 10^9~M<sub>&odot;</sub> and high star formation rate ~ 50~M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr. The high gas density makes supernova (SN) feedback less efficient, producing a high local SFE ≳ 10&percnt;. The global SFE is set by feedback-driven outflows and only weakly correlated with the local SFE. Photoionization heating makes SN feedback more efficient, but the integrated SFE always remains high. Intense accretion at Cosmic Dawn seeds turbulence which reduces local SFE, but this only weakly affects the global SFE. The star formation histories of our simulated galaxies are similar to observed massive galaxies at Cosmic Dawn, despite our limited resolution. We set the stage for future simulations which treat radiation self-consistently and use a higher effective resolution ~ 1~pc that captures the physics of star-forming clouds.

<p> Congcong Zhang, Joelene Hales, Els Peeters, Jan Cami, Ameek Sidhu, Junfeng Zhen </p>
<p>
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are responsible for strong mid-IR emission features near star-forming regions. It is well known that low-metallicity environments exhibit weaker PAH emission, but it is not clear how the metallicity affects the properties of the emitting PAH population. We present a detailed study of the PAH emission in the low-metallicity regime represented by 30 Dor in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and we compare it to the PAH emission in the Orion Bar to investigate the characteristics of the PAH population and how the environments affects the resulting IR emission. We analyze JWST observations of 30 Dor that include imaging (NIRCam, MIRI) and spectroscopy (NIRSpec/IFU, MIRI/MRS). We extracted NIRSpec/IFU and MIRI/MRS spectra from 18 apertures that cover the morphological structures of 30 Dor. We characterize the profiles and relative intensities of PAH emission in these apertures. The detailed profiles of the PAH emission bands in 30 Dor are all very similar, and compare well to those from one of the dissociation fronts (DF2) in the Orion Bar. The relative band ratios on the other hand show a much larger range than in the Orion Bar. The PAH emission in 30 Dor originates from a population with a higher ionization fraction than in the Orion Bar, and a size distribution that has more smaller PAHs. Since smaller PAHs typically photo-fragment before larger PAHs, our findings support the hypothesis that the lower PAH emission for lower metallicities is the result of inhibition of growth toward larger PAHs rather than photo-fragmentation.

<p>
We present JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopic characterization of GHZ9 at z= 10.145 ± 0.010, currently the most distant source detected by the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The spectrum reveals several UV high-ionization lines, including CII, SiIV, [NIV], CIV, HeII, OIII], NIII], and CIII]. The prominent rest-frame equivalent widths (EW(CIV)≃65A, EW(OIII])≃28A, EW(CIII])≃48A) show the presence of a hard AGN radiation field, while line ratio diagnostics are consistent with either AGN or star-formation as the dominant ionizing source. GHZ9 is nitrogen-enriched (6&ndash;9.5 (N/O)<sub>&odot;</sub>), carbon-poor (0.2&ndash;0.65 (C/O)<sub>&odot;</sub>), metal-poor (Z = 0.01&ndash;0.1 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>), and compact (&lt; 106 pc), similarly to GNz11, GHZ2, and recently discovered N-enhanced high redshift objects. We exploited the newly available JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam dataset to perform an independent analysis of the Chandra data confirming that GHZ9 is the most likely JWST source associated to X-ray emission at 0.5-7 keV. Assuming a spectral index \Gamma = 2.3 (1.8), we estimate a black hole (BH) mass of 1.60 ± 0.31 (0.48 ± 0.09) × 10^8M<sub>&odot;</sub>, which is consistent either with Eddington-accretion onto heavy (≥ 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) BH seeds formed at z=18, or super-Eddington accretion onto a light seed of ~ 10^2-10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z = 25. The corresponding BH-to-stellar mass ratio M_BH/M_star= 0.33±0.22 (0.10±0.07), with a stringent limit &gt;0.02, implies an accelerated growth of the BH mass with respect to the stellar mass. GHZ9 is the ideal target to constrain the early phases of AGN-galaxy coevolution with future multi-frequency observations.

<p>
[Abridged] The [OIII]_88&mu; m/[CII]_158&mu; m and [OIII]_88&mu; m/[NII]_122&mu; m luminosity ratios have shown to be promising tracers of the ionisation state and gas-phase metallicity of the ISM. Observations of galaxies at redshift z &gt; 6 show peculiarly higher [OIII]_88&mu; m/[CII]_158&mu; m luminosity ratios compared to local sources. No model has so far successfully managed to match the observed emission from both [OIII]_88&mu; m and [CII]_158&mu; m as well as their ratio. We use Cloudy to model the [CII]_158&mu; m, [OIII]_88&mu; m, [NII]_122&mu; m and [NIII]_57&mu; m emission lines of Ponos: a high-resolution (m_gas = 883.4  M<sub>&odot;</sub>) cosmological zoom-in simulation of a galaxy at redshift z = 6.5, which is post-processed using kramses-rt. We modify Carbon, Nitrogen and Oxygen abundances in our Cloudy models to obtain C/O and N/O abundance ratios respectively lower and higher than Solar, more in line with recent high-z observational constraints. We find [OIII]_88&mu; m/[CII]_158&mu; m luminosity ratios that are a factor of ~ 5 higher compared to models assuming solar abundances. Additionally, we find an overall better agreement of the simulation with high-z observational constraints of the [CII]_158&mu; m-SFR and [OIII]_88&mu; m-SFR relations. This shows that a lower C/O abundance ratio is essential to reproduce the enhanced [OIII]_88&mu; m/[CII]_158&mu; m luminosity ratios observed at z &gt; 6. By assuming a super-solar N/O ratio, motivated by recent z &gt; 6 JWST observations, our models yield an [OIII]_88&mu; m/[NII]_122&mu; m ratio of 1.3, which, according to current theoretical models, would be more appropriate for a galaxy with a lower ionisation parameter than the one we estimated for Ponos.

<p>
We present archival HST and JWST ultraviolet through near infrared time series photometric observations of a massive minimal-contact binary candidate in the metal-poor galaxy WLM (Z = 0.14 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>). This discovery marks the lowest metallicity contact binary candidate observed to date. We determine the nature of the two stars in the binary by using the eclipsing binary modeling software (PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs; PHOEBE) to train a neural network to fit our observed panchromatic multi-epoch photometry. The best fit model consists of two hot MS stars (T_1=29800^+2300_-1700 K, M_1=16^+2_-3~M<sub>&odot;</sub>, and T_2=18000^+5000_-5000 K, M_2=7^+5_-3~M<sub>&odot;</sub>). We discuss plausible evolutionary paths for the system, and suggest the system is likely to be currently in a contact phase before ultimately ending in a merger. Future spectroscopy will help to further narrow down evolutionary pathways. This work showcases a novel use of data of JWST and HST imaging originally taken to characterize RR Lyrae. We expect time series imaging from LSST, BlackGEM, etc. to uncover similar types of objects in nearby galaxies.

<p>
The topology of reionization and the environments where galaxies efficiently produce ionizing photons are key open questions. For the first time, we investigate the trend between ionizing photon production efficiency,  &xi;<sub>ion</sub> , and galaxy overdensity, log(1+&delta;). We analyze the ionizing properties of 79 galaxies between 1.0 &lt; z &lt; 5.2 using JWST NIRSpec medium-resolution spectra from the Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument (MIRI) Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES) program. Among these, 67 galaxies have H&alpha; coverage, spanning 1.0 &lt; z &lt; 3.1. The galaxy overdensity, log(1+&delta;), is measured using the JADES photometric catalog, which covers the SMILES footprint. For the subset with H&alpha; coverage, we find that log &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  is positively correlated with log(1+&delta;), with a slope of 0.94_-0.46^+0.46. Additionally, the mean  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  for galaxies in overdense regions (log(1+&delta;) &gt; 0.1) is 2.43 times that of galaxies in lower density regions (log(1+&delta;) &lt; 0.1). This strong trend is found to be independent of redshift evolution. Furthermore, our results confirm the robust correlations between  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  and the rest-frame equivalent widths of the [O III] or H&alpha; emission lines. Our results suggest that galaxies in high-density regions are efficient producers of ionizing photons.

<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope is revolutionising our ability to understand the host galaxies and local environments of high-z quasars. Here we obtain a comprehensive understanding of the host galaxy of the z=7.08 quasar J1120+0641 by combining NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy with NIRCam photometry of the host continuum emission. Our emission line maps reveal that this quasar host is undergoing a merger with a bright companion galaxy. The quasar host and the companion have similar dynamical masses of ~10^10M<sub>&odot;</sub>, suggesting that this is a major galaxy interaction. Through detailed quasar subtraction and SED fitting using the NIRCam data, we obtain an estimate of the host stellar mass of M<sub>&ast;</sub>=(3.0^+2.5_-1.4)×10^9M<sub>&odot;</sub>, with M_*=(2.7^+0.5_-0.5)×10^9M<sub>&odot;</sub> for the companion galaxy. Using the H&beta; Balmer line we estimate a virial black hole mass of M_BH=(1.9^+2.9_-1.1)×10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Thus, J1120+0641 has an extreme black hole-stellar mass ratio of M_BH/M<sub>&ast;</sub>=0.63^+0.54_-0.31, which is ~3 dex larger than expected by the local scaling relations between black hole and stellar mass. J1120+0641 is powered by an overmassive black hole with the highest reported black hole-stellar mass ratio, in a quasar host that is currently undergoing a major merger &ndash; these new insights highlight the power of JWST for measuring and understanding these extreme first quasars.

### 273) [2410.03830](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03830v2): Suppressed accretion onto massive black hole binaries surrounded by thin disks

<p> Christopher Tiede, Jonathan Zrake, Andrew MacFadyen, Zoltan Haiman </p>
<p>
We demonstrate that gas disks around binary systems might deliver gas to the binary components only when the circumbinary disk is relatively warm. We present new grid-based hydrodynamics simulations, performed with the binary on the grid and a locally isothermal equation of state, in which the binary is seen to functionally "stop accreting'' if the orbital Mach number in the disk exceeds a threshold value of about 40. Above this threshold, the disk continues to extract angular momentum from the binary orbit, but it delivers very little mass to the black holes, and instead piles up mass in a ring surrounding the binary. This ring will eventually become viscously relaxed and deliver mass to the binary at the large-scale inflow rate. However we show that the timescale for such relaxation can far exceed the implied binary lifetime. We demonstrate that the ability of a binary-disk system to equilibrate is dependent on the efficiency at which accretion streams deposit mass onto the binary; which in turn is highly sensitive to the thermodynamic conditions of the inner disk. If disks around massive black hole binaries do operate in such non-accreting regimes, it suggests these systems may be dimmer than their single black hole counterparts, but could exhibit dramatic re-brightening after the black holes in-spiral and merge. This dimming begins in the UV/optical and could completely choke high-energy emission, such that these systems would likely be intrinsically X-ray weak with reddened continua, potentially resembling the spectra of `Little Red Dots'' recently identified in JWST observations.

<p>
We present indirect constraints on the absolute escape fraction of ionizing photons (f<sub>esc</sub>^LyC) of the system GN 42912 which comprises two luminous galaxies (M_UV magnitudes of -20.89 and -20.37) at z~7.5, GN 42912-NE and GN 42912-SW, to determine their contribution to the ionizing photon budget of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The high-resolution James Webb Space Telescope NIRSpec and NIRCam observations reveal the two galaxies are separated by only ~0.1" (0.5 kpc) on the sky and have a 358 km s<sup>-1</sup> velocity separation. GN 42912-NE and GN 42912-SW are relatively massive for this redshift (log(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ~ 8.4 and 8.9, respectively), with gas-phase metallicities of 18 per cent and 23 per cent solar, O_32 ratios of 5.3 and &gt;5.8, and &beta; slopes of -1.92 and -1.51, respectively. We use the Mg II&lambda;&lambda;2796,2803 doublet to constrain f<sub>esc</sub>^LyC. Mg II has an ionization potential close to that of neutral hydrogen and, in the optically thin regime, can be used as an indirect tracer of the LyC leakage. We establish realistic conservative upper limits on f<sub>esc</sub>^LyC of 8.5 per cent for GN 42912-NE and 14 per cent for GN 42912-SW. These estimates align with f<sub>esc</sub>^LyC trends observed with &beta;, O_32, and the H&beta; equivalent width at z&lt;4. The small inferred ionized region sizes (&lt;0.3 pMpc) around both galaxies indicate they have not ionized a significant fraction of the surrounding neutral gas. While these z&gt;7 f<sub>esc</sub>^LyC constraints do not decisively determine a specific reionization model, they support a minor contribution from these two relatively luminous galaxies to the EoR.

<p>
Among the remarkable strides made by JWST is the discovery of the earliest star clusters found to date. These have been proposed as early progenitors of globular clusters, which are known to come from the early stages of star formation in the Universe. This is an exciting development in modern astronomy, as it offers an opportunity to connect theoretical models of globular cluster formation to actual observations of these high-redshift structures. In this work, we aim to develop observational signatures of a star cluster formation route known as supersonically induced gas objects, which are dark matter-less gas clouds in the early Universe proposed as a potential origin of some globular clusters. For the first time, we follow the star formation process of these early Universe objects using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, including mechanical feedback. Our results suggest that the first dark matter-less star clusters are top-heavy, meaning that they have a flatter IMF slope compared to very young low-metallicity star clusters in the local Universe, and they also have extremely high stellar mass surface densities compared to their local counterparts.

### 276) [2410.01187](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01187v2): The Tale of Two Telescopes: How Hubble Uniquely Complements the James Webb Space Telescope: Galaxies

<p>
In this paper, we present a simple but compelling argument, focusing on galaxy science, for preserving the main imagers and operational modes of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) for as long as is technically feasible. While star-formation started at redshifts z≳10-13, when the universe was less than 300-500 Myr old, the CSFH did not peak until z≃1.9, and has steadily declined since that time. Hence, at least half of all stars in the universe formed in the era where HST provides its unique rest-frame UV view of unobscured young, massive stars tracing cosmic star-formation. By rendering a subset of the 556.3 hours of available HST images in 12 filters of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) in an appropriate mix of colors, we illustrate the unique capabilities of HST for galaxy science emphasizing that rest-frame UV-optical wavelength range. We then contrast this with the 52.7 publicly available hours of JWST/NIRCam images in 8 filters of the same HUDF area from the JADES project, rendering these at the redder near-IR wavelengths to illustrate the unique capabilities of JWST to detect older stellar populations at higher redshifts, as well as very dusty stellar populations and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). HST uniquely probes (unobscured) young, hot, massive stars in galaxies, while JWST reveals more advanced stages of older stellar populations, as well as relatively short-lived phases where galaxies produce and shed a lot of dust from intense star-formation, and the very high redshift universe (z≳10-11) not accessible by HST. We conclude that HST and JWST are highly complementary facilities that took decades to build to ensure decades of operation. To maximize return on investment on both HST and JWST, ways will need to be found to operate HST imaging instruments in all relevant modes for as long as possible into the JWST mission.

### 277) [2409.18208](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18208v2): "Little red dots" cannot reside in the same dark matter halos as comparably luminous unobscured quasars

<p> Elia Pizzati, Joseph F. Hennawi, Joop Schaye, Anna-Christina Eilers, Jiamu Huang, Jan-Torge Schindler, Feige Wang </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a new population of candidate broad-line AGN emerging in the early Universe, named ''little red dots'' (LRDs) because of their compactness and red colors at optical wavelengths. LRDs appear to be surprisingly abundant (≈ 10^-5 cMpc^-3) given that their inferred bolometric luminosities largely overlap with the ones of the UV-luminous quasars identified at high z in wide-field spectroscopic surveys. In this work, we investigate how the population of LRDs and/or other UV-obscured AGN relates to the one of unobscured, UV-selected quasars. By comparing their number densities, we infer an extremely large and rapidly evolving obscured:unobscured ratio, ranging from ≈20:1 at z≈4 to ≈2300:1 at z≈7, and possibly extending out to very high (≈10^47 erg s<sup>-1</sup>) bolometric luminosities. This large obscured:unobscured ratio is incompatible with the UV-luminous duty cycle measured for unobscured quasars at z≈4-6, suggesting that LRDs are too abundant to be hosted by the same halos as unobscured quasars. This implies that either (a) the bolometric luminosities of LRDs are strongly overestimated (possibly because LRDs are dominated by stellar galaxy light) or (b) LRDs follow different scaling relations than the ones of UV-selected quasars, representing a new population of accreting SMBHs emerging in the early Universe. A direct comparison between the clustering of LRDs and the one of faint UV-selected quasars will ultimately confirm these findings, and shed light on key properties of LRDs such as their host mass distribution and duty cycle. We provide a mock analysis for the clustering of LRDs and show that it is feasible with current and upcoming JWST surveys.

We present a study of a previously identified candidate jellyfish galaxy in the Abell 2744 cluster, F0083, which showed faint signs of a tidal interaction in archival imaging. We used publicly available PSF-matched deep photometric data from the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes to infer the spatially resolved star formation history of this galaxy. F0083 shows clear signs of ram-pressure stripping (RPS), with a recently enhanced star formation rate (SFR) orientated towards the south-west quadrant of the stellar disc. The stellar mass surface density is heavily asymmetric, with a variation of nearly 1 dex between the western spiral arm and the postulated tidal feature. This feature appears to contain a high proportion of older stars, ruling out RPS as the cause of this `unwinding'. We identified two potential interaction candidates, 28171 and 26055, with masses log_10(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=8.56±0.06 and log_10(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=9.24±0.09, respectively, and projected separations of 31 kpc and 46 kpc. The star formation history (SFH) of the tidal feature in F0083 indicates a steep change in SFR at lookback times t_L≲1 Gyr, consistent with a burst in the SFH of 26055. The most probable formation scenario of F0083 thus indicates a significant tidal interaction, followed by RPS as the combined system approaches pericentre passage. Our results demonstrate that by using photometric data we are able to distinguish between these consecutive processes, and represent the first observational analysis of the contributions of each process at this redshift.

JWST has revealed diverse new populations of high-redshift (z~4-11) AGN and extreme star-forming galaxies that challenge current models. In this paper, we use rest-frame UV emission-line diagnostics to identify AGN candidates and other exceptional ionizing sources, complementing previous studies predominantly focused on broad-line AGN. From a parent sample of 205 z<sub>spec</sub>&gt;3 UNCOVER galaxies with NIRSpec/PRISM follow-up, we identify 12 C IV, He II, and C III] emitters. Three of these galaxies also exhibit clear N III] and/or N IV] lines. Leveraging the combined rest-optical and UV coverage of PRISM, we limit the emission-line model space using the sample's [O III]/H&beta; distribution, significantly decreasing the overlap between AGN and star-formation models in the UV diagnostics. We then find that the five He II emitters are the strongest AGN candidates, with further support from two [Ne V] detections and one X-ray detection from Chandra. Our Balmer line fits also reveal one new broad-line AGN at z=6.87. We cannot robustly quantify the AGN fraction in this sample, but we note that close to 20% of M_*&gt;2×10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> parent sample galaxies are AGN candidates. The lower-mass line emitters, which are consistent with both AGN and star-forming photoionization models, have more compact sizes and higher specific star formation rates than the parent sample. Higher-resolution and deeper data on these UV line emitters should provide much stronger constraints on the obscured AGN fraction at z &gt; 3.

<p>
We present a spatially resolved analysis of four star-forming galaxies at z = 4.44-5.64 using data from the JWST PRIMER and ALMA-CRISTAL surveys to probe the stellar and inter-stellar medium properties on the sub-kpc scale. In the 1-5 &mu;m JWST NIRCam imaging we find that the galaxies are composed of multiple clumps (between 2 and ~ 8) separated by ≃ 5 kpc, with comparable morphologies and sizes in the rest-frame UV and optical. Using BAGPIPES to perform pixel-by-pixel SED fitting to the JWST data we show that the SFR (≃ 25 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr) and stellar mass (log_10(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≃ 9.5) derived from the resolved analysis are in close ( ≲ 0.3 dex) agreement with those obtained by fitting the integrated photometry. In contrast to studies of lower-mass sources, we thus find a reduced impact of outshining of the older (more massive) stellar populations in these normal z ≃ 5 galaxies. Our JWST analysis recovers bluer rest-frame UV slopes (&beta; ≃ -2.1) and younger ages (≃ 100 Myr) than archival values. We find that the dust continuum from ALMA-CRISTAL seen in two of these galaxies correlates, as expected, with regions of redder rest-frame UV slopes and the SED-derived A_V, as well as the peak in the stellar mass map. We compute the resolved IRX-&beta; relation, showing that the IRX is consistent with the local starburst attenuation curve and further demonstrating the presence of an inhomogeneous dust distribution within the galaxies. A comparison of the CRISTAL sources to those from the FirstLight zoom-in simulation of galaxies with the same M<sub>&sext;</sub> and SFR reveals similar age and colour gradients, suggesting that major mergers may be important in the formation of clumpy galaxies at this epoch.

<p> Danial Langeroodi, Jens Hjorth </p>
<p>
We introduce genesis-metallicity, a gas-phase metallicity measurement python software employing the direct and strong-line methods depending on the available oxygen lines. The non-parametric strong-line estimator is calibrated based on a kernel density estimate in the 4-dimensional space of O2 = [O II]&lambda;&lambda; 3727,29/H&beta;; O3 = [O III]&lambda; 5007/H&beta;; H&beta; equivalent width EW(H&beta;); and gas-phase metallicity 12 + log(O/H). We use a calibration sample of 1510 galaxies at 0 &lt; z &lt; 10 with direct-method metallicity measurements, compiled from the JWST/NIRSpec and ground-based observations. In particular, we report 122 new NIRSpec direct-method metallicity measurements at z &gt; 1. We show that the O2, O3, and EW(H&beta;) measurements are sufficient for a gas-phase metallicity estimate that is more accurate than 0.09 dex. Our calibration is universal, meaning that its accuracy does not depend on the target redshift. Furthermore, the direct-method module employs a non-parametric T_e(O II) electron temperature estimator based on a kernel density estimate in the 5-dimensional space of O2, O3, EW(H&beta;), T_e(O III), and T_e(O II). This T_e(O II) estimator is calibrated based on 1004 spectra with detections of both [O III]&lambda; 4363 and [O II]&lambda;&lambda; 7320,30, notably reporting 20 new NIRSpec detections of the [O II]&lambda;&lambda; 7320,30 doublet. We make genesis-metallicity and its calibration data publicly available and commit to keeping both up-to-date in light of the incoming data.

We present a sample of 50 H-alpha detected broad-line active galactic nuclei (BLAGN) at redshifts 3.5&lt;z&lt;6.8 using data from the CEERS and RUBIES surveys. We select these sources directly from JWST/NIRSpec G395M/F290LP spectra. We use a multi-step pre-selection and a Bayesian fitting procedure to ensure a high-quality sample of sources with broad Balmer lines and narrow forbidden lines. We compute rest-frame ultraviolet and optical spectral slopes for these objects, and determine that 10 BLAGN in our sample are also little red dots (LRDs). These LRD BLAGN, when examined in aggregate, show broader H-alpha line profiles and a higher fraction of broad-to-narrow component H-alpha emission than non-LRD BLAGN. Moreover, we find that ~66% of these objects are intrinsically reddened (beta (optical)&gt;0), independent of the contributions of emission lines to the broadband photometry. We construct the black hole (BH) mass function at 3.5&lt;z&lt;6 after computing robust observational and line detection completeness corrections. This BH mass function shows broad agreement with both recent JWST/NIRSpec and JWST/NIRCam WFSS based BH mass functions, though we extend these earlier results to log(M(BH)/M(sun)) &lt; 7. The derived BH mass function is consistent with a variety of theoretical models, indicating that the observed abundance of black holes in the early universe is not discrepant with physically-motivated predictions. The BH mass function shape resembles a largely featureless power-law, suggesting that any signature from black-hole seeding has been lost by redshift z~5-6. Finally, we compute the BLAGN UV luminosity function and find good agreement with JWST-detected BLAGN samples from recent works, finding that BLAGN hosts constitute &lt;10% of the total observed UV luminosity at all but the brightest luminosities.

### 283) [2409.03997](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03997v2): A New Framework for ISM Emission Line Models: Connecting Multi-Scale Simulations Across Cosmological Volumes

<p> Shengqi Yang, Adam Lidz, Andrew Benson, Yizhou Zhao, Hui Li, Amelia Zhao, Aaron Smith, Yucheng Zhang, Rachel Somerville, Anthony Pullen, Hui Li </p>
<p>
The JWST and ALMA have detected emission lines from the ionized interstellar medium (ISM) in some of the first galaxies at z ≳ 6. These measurements present an opportunity to better understand galaxy assembly histories and may allow important tests of state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulations. It is challenging, however, to model these lines in their proper cosmological context. In order to meet this challenge, we introduce a novel sub-grid line emission modeling framework. The framework uses the high-z zoom-in simulation suite from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) collaboration. The line emission signals from HII regions within each simulated FIRE galaxy are modeled using the semi-analytic HIILines code. A machine learning approach is then used to determine the conditional probability distribution for the line luminosity to stellar-mass ratio from the HII regions around each simulated stellar particle. This conditional probability distribution can then be applied to predict the line luminosities around stellar particles in lower resolution, yet larger volume cosmological simulations. As an example, we apply this approach to the IllustrisTNG simulations at z=6. The resulting predictions for the [OII], [OIII], and Balmer line luminosities as a function of star-formation rate (SFR) agree well with current observations. Our predictions differ, however, from related work in the literature which lack detailed sub-grid ISM models. This highlights the importance of our multi-scale simulation modeling framework. Finally, we provide forecasts for future line luminosity function measurements from the JWST and quantify the cosmic variance in such surveys.

<p> Christopher Cain, Garett Lopez, Anson D'Aloisio, Julian B. Munoz, Rolf A. Jansen, Rogier A. Windhorst, Nakul Gangolli </p>
<p>
Recent JWST observations at z &gt; 6 may imply galactic ionizing photon production above prior expectations. Under observationally motivated assumptions about escape fractions, these suggest a z ~ 8-9 end to reionization, in tension with the z &lt; 6 end required by the Ly&alpha; forest. In this work, we use radiative transfer simulations to understand what different observations tell us about when reionization ended and when it started. We consider a model that ends too early (z_end ≈ 8) alongside two more realistic scenarios with z_end ≈ 5: one starting late (z ~ 9) and another early (z ~ 13). We find that the latter requires up to an order-of-magnitude evolution in galaxy ionizing properties at 6 &lt; z &lt; 12, perhaps in tension with measurements of  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  by JWST, which indicate little evolution. We study how these models compare to recent measurements of the Ly&alpha; forest opacity, mean free path, IGM thermal history, visibility of z &gt; 8 Ly&alpha; emitters, and the patchy kSZ signal from the CMB. We find that neither of the late-ending scenarios is strongly disfavored by any single data set. However, a majority of observables, spanning several distinct types of observations, prefer a late start. Not all probes agree with this conclusion, hinting at a possible lack of concordance arising from deficiencies in observations and/or theoretical modeling. Observations by multiple experiments (including JWST, Roman, and CMB-S4) in the coming years will establish a concordance picture of reionization's beginning or uncover such deficiencies.

Galaxy evolution emerges from the balance between cosmic gas accretion, fueling star formation, and supernova (SN) feedback, regulating the metal enrichment. Hence, the stellar mass (M_*) - gas metallicity relation (MZR) is key to understanding the physics of galaxies. High-quality JWST data enable accurate measurements of the MZR up to redshift z=10. Our aims are to understand the observed MZR, its connection with the star formation rate (SFR), the role played by SFR stochasticity, and how it is regulated by SN feedback. We compare the MZR from the JADES, CEERS, and UNCOVER surveys, which comprise about 180 galaxies at z=3-10 with 10^6&lt;M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>&lt;10^10, with 200 galaxies from the SERRA cosmological simulations. To interpret the MZR, we develop a minimal model for galaxy evolution that includes: cosmic accretion modulated with an amplitude A_100 on 100 Myr; a time delay t_d between SFR and SN; SN-driven outflows with a varying mass loading factor &epsilon;_SN. Using our minimal model, we find the observed mean MZR is reproduced by weak outflows (&epsilon;_SN=1/4), in line with findings from JADES. Matching the observed MZR dispersion requires t_d=20 Myr and a A_100=1/3 modulation of the accretion rate. Successful models have low stochasticity (&sigma;_SFR=0.2), yielding a MZR dispersion of &sigma;_Z=0.2. Such values are close but lower than SERRA predictions (&sigma;_SFR=0.24, &sigma;_Z=0.3), clarifying why SERRA shows flatter trend and some tension with the observations. As the MZR is very sensitive to SFR stochasticity, models predicting high r.m.s. values (&sigma;_SFR=0.5) result in a "chemical chaos'' (i.e. &sigma;_Z=1.4), virtually destroying the MZR. As a consequence, invoking a highly stochastic SFR (&sigma;_SFR=0.8) to explain the overabundance of bright, super-early galaxies leads to inconsistencies with the observed MZR.

<p>
Understanding how and when galaxies formed stars over the history of the Universe is fundamental to the study of galaxy evolution. The star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies in the local Universe can be measured with high precision using deep imaging with space telescopes. Such phresolved SFHs are based on modelling the observed color-magnitude diagram (CMD) with stellar evolution models and rely on age-sensitive features like the main sequence turn-off to measure a galaxy's star formation rate as a function of time. There are many other population-level parameters that factor into these measurements, such as the stellar initial mass function (IMF), binary fraction, and metallicity, to name a few. We present and release StarFormationHistories.jl, a modular, open-source Julia package for measuring resolved SFHs with a focus on model flexibility for these types of population parameters. The code can model unresolved photometric binaries and supports arbitrary IMFs. Random uncertainties in the SFH measurements can be quantified with Monte Carlo posterior sampling methods. We illustrate the performance of the package on JWST/NIRCAM data of the Local Group dwarf irregular galaxy WLM ≤ft(M_v≈-14.2  mag), which exhibits a complex, well-sampled CMD, and HST/ACS data of the ultra-faint Milky Way satellite dwarf galaxy Horologium I ≤ft(M_v≈-3.7  mag), which has a much simpler but sparser CMD.

We present a full analysis of galaxy major merger pair fractions, merger rates, and mass accretion rates, thus uncovering the role of mergers in galaxy formation at the earliest previously unexplored epoch of 4.5&lt;z&lt;11.5. We target galaxies with masses log_10(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 8.0 - 10.0, utilizing data from eight JWST Cycle-1 fields (CEERS, JADES GOODS-S, NEP-TDF, NGDEEP, GLASS, El-Gordo, SMACS-0723, MACS-0416), covering an unmasked area of 189.36 arcmin<sup>2</sup>. We develop a new probabilistic pair-counting methodology that integrates full photometric redshift posteriors and corrects for detection incompleteness to quantify close pairs with physical projected separations between 20 and 50 kpc. Our analysis reveals an increase in pair fractions up to z = 8, reaching 0.211 ± 0.065, followed by a statistically flat evolution to z = 11.5. We find that the galaxy merger rate increases from the local Universe up to z = 6 and then stabilizes at a value of ~ 6 Gyr^-1 up to z = 11.5. The redshift evolution of both pair fractions and merger rates is well described by a power-law plus exponential model. In addition, we measure that the average galaxy increases its stellar mass due to mergers by a factor of 2.77 ± 0.99 from redshift z = 10.5 to z = 5.0. Lastly, we investigate the impact of mergers on galaxy stellar mass growth, revealing that mergers contribute as much as 71 ± 25&percnt; to galaxy stellar mass growth. This indicates that mergers drive about half of galaxy assembly at high redshift.

Thanks to decades of observations using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the structure of galaxies at redshift z&gt;2 has been widely studied in the rest-frame ultraviolet regime, which traces recent star formation from young stellar populations. But, we still have little information about the spatial distribution of the older, more evolved stellar populations, constrained by the rest-frame infrared portion of the galaxies' spectral energy distribution. We present the morphological characterization of a sample of 49 massive galaxies (log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&gt;9) at redshift 3&lt;z&lt;5. The MIRI 5.6~&mu;m imaging allows us to characterize the rest-frame near-infrared structure of galaxies beyond cosmic noon, at higher redshifts than possible with NIRCam, tracing their older and dust-insensitive stellar populations. We derive the non-parametric morphology of galaxies and model the light distribution of galaxies with a single S\'ersic component and derive their parametric morphology. We find that at z&gt;3 massive galaxies show a smooth distribution of their rest-infrared light, strongly supporting the increasing number of regular disk galaxies already in place at early epochs. On the contrary, the ultraviolet structure obtained from HST/WFC3 and JWST/NIRCam observations at ~1.5~&mu;m is generally more irregular, catching the most recent episodes of star formation. Importantly, we find a segregation of morphologies across cosmic time, where galaxies at redshift z&gt;3.75 show later-type morphologies compared to z~3 galaxies. These findings suggest a transition phase in galaxy assembly and central mass build-up, which is already taking place at z~3-4. The combined analysis of NIRCam and MIRI imaging datasets allows us to prove that the rest-frame near-infrared morphology of massive galaxies at cosmic noon is typical of compact disk galaxies with a smooth mass distribution.

(Abridged) The strong lensing models of galaxy clusters rely on the number and quality of multiple images with spectroscopic redshifts. We present an updated strong lensing model of MACS J0416.1-2403 with the largest sample of multiple images with spectroscopic redshifts in a galaxy cluster field to date. Furthermore, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of JWST, particularly its NIRISS camera, for strong lensing studies. We used NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec and NIRISS spectroscopy from the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). The cluster mass model was constrained using Lenstool software. Our new dataset, which we used for constraining the lens model, comprises 303 secure multiple images with spectroscopic redshifts from 111 background sources and includes 95 systems with previously known MUSE redshift and 16 systems (with 46 multiple images) for which we obtained spectroscopic redshift for the first time using NIRISS and NIRSpec spectroscopy. Three of the spectroscopic systems were not identified by previous JWST studies. The total number of secure spectroscopic systems is more than 20% higher than in the previous strong lensing studies of this cluster. The model can reproduce multiple images with the root-mean-square distance of ~ 0.52''. We also provide a full catalogue with 415 multiple images, including less reliable candidates. In total, we provide 15 new multiple-image system candidates (with 38 multiple images) not reported in previous studies. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of JWST, particularly NIRISS, for obtaining spectroscopic redshifts of multiple images. As NIRISS F115W, F150W, and F200W grism spectroscopy captures at least two of the [OII], [OIII] and H&alpha; lines at 1 &lt; z &lt; 3 (a redshift range particularly relevant for strong lensing studies) without target pre-selection, it complements MUSE and NIRSpec observations extremely well.

### 290) [2406.10329](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10329v3): Exploring the AGN Fraction of a Sample of JWST's Little Red Dots at 5 &lt; z &lt; 8: Overmassive Black Holes Are Strongly Favored

<p> Emmanuel Durodola, Fabio Pacucci, Ryan C. Hickox </p>
<p>
JWST is revolutionizing our view of the early Universe by pushing the boundaries of detectable galaxies and black holes in redshift (upward) and mass (downward). The Little Red Dots (LRDs), detected by several surveys at z &gt; 4, present a significant interpretational challenge, as their Spectral Energy Distributions (SED) can mimic both AGN and stellar population templates. This study analyzes 19 LRDs from the JADES survey, utilizing NIRCam and MIRI photometry. By performing SED fitting across a vast parameter space, we explore a broad range of AGN fractions, defined as the ratio of the monochromatic luminosities (AGN, galaxy, and dust) over a specified wavelength range, 0.4 - 0.7 &mu; m rest-frame. We find that 17 of the 19 LRDs investigated are consistent with having significant AGN contributions, with best-fitting AGN fractions ranging between 20% and 70%, while one galaxy shows a low AGN contribution (2%) and another appears to be purely star-forming. Moreover, assuming these LRDs do indeed host AGN, we can place limits on their black hole masses using the inferred AGN bolometric luminosities and adopting the Eddington limit. We find that, independent of the specific AGN fraction adopted, the LRDs' black holes are significantly overmassive relative to their host galaxies (by ~ 1 dex, and up to ~ 4 dex in the most extreme cases) compared to the local M<sub>&bull;</sub> - M<sub>&sext;</sub> relation. The presence of overmassive black holes in the high-z Universe may provide the strongest evidence yet of heavy black hole seeding occurring during the cosmic dark ages.

### 291) [2406.03549](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03549v2): Chemical Abundances of Early Quiescent Galaxies: New Observations and Modelling Impacts

<p> Marziye Jafariyazani, Andrew B. Newman, Bahram Mobasher, Sirio Belli, Richard S. Ellis, Andreas L. Faisst </p>
<p>
Recent stellar chemical abundance measurements of a handful of z~2 quiescent galaxies have suggested these galaxies exhibit a remarkably strong &alpha;-enhancement compared to their local and intermediate redshift counterparts. This apparent chemical evolution following quenching suggests that even the innermost regions of massive early-type galaxies may have experienced substantial mixing of stars in mergers, challenging a purely inside-out growth model. However, larger samples are needed to determine whether a high &alpha;-enhancement ([Mg/Fe] ≈ 0.5) is common in z ~ 2 quiescent galaxies, and a comparative analysis is needed to determine whether it is consistently inferred using different stellar population synthesis models. We report age and stellar chemical abundance measurements for a sample of four gravitationally lensed quiescent galaxies at z~2.1-2.65 based on Magellan/FIRE spectroscopy. For three of these galaxies we constrain the &alpha;-enhancement, and in two cases we measure high values comparable to earlier results when the spectra are analyzed consistently. We also find that the choice of modeling approach can exert a significant effect on the measured abundances. This model dependence can be partly, but not entirely, explained by the complex abundance patterns of &alpha; elements in galaxies, which has been observed at lower redshifts and in one z ~ 2 quiescent galaxy. Our investigation highlights the importance of independently varying abundance of &alpha; elements when fitting the spectra of such galaxies. Observations with JWST will soon deliver precise and spatially resolved abundances of these and other quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon, opening a new window into their evolution.

### 292) [2405.19953](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19953v3): Do high redshift QSOs and GRBs corroborate JWST?

<p> Eoin Ó Colgáin, M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari, Lu Yin </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is reporting massive high redshift galaxies that appear challenging from the &Lambda;CDM perspective. Interpreted as a cosmological problem, this necessitates the Planck collaboration underestimating either matter density &Omega;_m or physical matter density &Omega;_m h^2 at higher redshifts. Through standard frequentist profile likelihoods, we identify corroborating quasar (QSO) and gamma-ray burst (GRB) data sets where &Omega;_m increases with effective redshift z_rmeff and remains anomalously large at higher redshifts. We relax the traditional priors by allowing for &Omega;_m &gt; 1, consistent with negative dark energy density, to locate profile likelihood peaks where possible. While the variation of &Omega;_m with z_rmeff is at odds with the &Lambda;CDM model, demarcating frequentist confidence intervals through differences in &chi;<sup>2</sup> in profile likelihoods, the prevailing technique in the literature, points to 3.9 &sigma; and 7.9 &sigma; tensions between GRBs and QSOs, respectively, and Planck-&Lambda;CDM. We explain the approximations inherent in the existing profile likelihood literature, and highlight fresh methodology that generalises the prescription. We show that alternative methods, including Bayesian approaches, lead to similar tensions. Finally, in the large sample limit, we show that Feldman-Cousins prescription for frequentist confidence intervals in the presence of a boundary (prior) leads to confidence intervals that are bounded above by Wilks' theorem.

### 293) [2405.13108](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13108v3): The impact of mass-dependent stochasticity at cosmic dawn

<p> Viola Gelli, Charlotte Mason, Christopher C. Hayward </p>
<p>
JWST is unveiling a surprising lack of evolution in the number densities of ultraviolet-selected (UV) galaxies at redshift z≳ 10. At the same time, observations and simulations are providing evidence for highly bursty star formation in high-z galaxies, resulting in significant scatter in their UV luminosities. Galaxies in low-mass dark matter halos are expected to experience most stochasticity due to their shallow potential wells. Here, we explore the impact of a mass-dependent stochasticity using a simple analytical model. We assume that scatter in the M_UV-M_h relation increases towards lower halo masses, following the decrease in halo escape velocity, &sigma;_UV ~ M_h^-1/3, independent of redshift. Since low-mass halos are more dominant in the early universe, this model naturally predicts an increase in UV luminosity functions (LFs) at high redshifts compared to models without scatter. We make predictions for additional observables which would be affected by stochasticity and could be used to constrain its amplitude, finding: (i) galaxies are less clustered compared to the no-scatter scenario, with the difference increasing at higher-z; (ii) assuming star-bursting galaxies dominate the ionizing photon budget implies reionization starts earlier and is more gradual compared to the no-scatter case, (iii) at fixed UV magnitude galaxies should exhibit wide ranges of UV slopes, nebular emission line strengths and Balmer breaks. Comparing to observations, the mass-dependent stochasticity model successfully reproduces the observed LFs up to z~12. However, the model cannot match the observed z~14 LFs, implying additional physical processes enhance star formation efficiency in the earliest galaxies.

### 294) [2405.12955](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12955v2): GA-NIFS: Witnessing the complex assembly of a star-forming system at z=5.7

Perez-Gonzalez, Vicente Villanueva </p>
<p>
We present observations of the z~5.7 Lyman-break galaxy HZ10 with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU in high and low spectral resolution (G395H, spectral resolving power R~2700 and PRISM, R~100, respectively), as part of the GA-NIFS program. By spatially resolving the source (spatial resolution ~0.15'' or ~0.9kpc), we find three spatially and spectrally distinct regions of line emission along with one region of strong continuum emission, all within a projected distance of &lt;10kpc. The R2700 data features strong detections in H&beta;, [OIII]&lambda;&lambda;4959,5007, [NII]&lambda;&lambda;6548,6584, H&alpha;, and [SII]&lambda;&lambda;6716,6731. The R100 data additionally contains a strong detection of the Ly&alpha; break, rest-frame UV and optical continuum, and [OII]&lambda;&lambda;3726,3729. None of the detected lines present strong evidence for AGN excitation from line diagnostic diagrams, and no high-ionisation lines are detected. Using the detected lines, we constrain the electron density ≤ft( log_10≤ft( n_e / cm^-3)~ 3) and metallicity (~0.5-0.7 solar) in each component. Spaxel-by-spaxel fits reveal a strong east-west velocity gradient and significant line asymmetries (possibly indicating tidal features or outflows). The western component features a very red UV slope (&beta;_UV~-0.9) and significant H&alpha; emission, suggesting an evolved population and active star formation. A comparison to high resolution (~0.3'' or ~1.8kpc) [CII]158&mu;m imaging obtained with the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) reveals areas of dust obscuration. Altogether, these data suggest that HZ10 represents an ongoing merger, with a complex distribution of stars, gas, and dust &lt;1Gyr after the Big Bang.

### 295) [2404.02194](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02194v2): Resolving the nature and putative nebular emission of GS9422: an obscured AGN without exotic stars

<p>
Understanding the sources that power nebular emission in high-redshift galaxies is fundamentally important not only for shedding light onto the drivers of reionisation, but to constrain stellar populations and the growth of black holes. Here we focus on an individual object, GS9422, a galaxy at z<sub>spec</sub>=5.943 with exquisite data from the JADES, JEMS and FRESCO surveys, including 14-band JWST/NIRCam photometry and deep NIRSpec prism and grating spectroscopy. We map the continuum emission and nebular emission lines across the galaxy on 0.2-kpc scales. GS9422 has been claimed to have nebular-dominated continuum and an extreme stellar population with top-heavy initial mass function. We find clear evidence for different morphologies in the emission lines, the rest-UV and rest-optical continuum emission, demonstrating that the full continuum cannot be dominated by nebular emission. While multiple models reproduce the spectrum reasonably well, our preferred model with a type-2 active galactic nucleus (AGN) and local damped Ly-&alpha; (DLA) clouds can explain both the spectrum and the wavelength-dependent morphology. The AGN powers the off-planar nebular emission, giving rise to the Balmer jump and the emission lines, including Ly-&alpha;, which therefore does not suffer DLA absorption. A central, young stellar component dominates the rest-UV emission and &ndash; together with the DLA clouds &ndash; leads to a spectral turn-over. A disc-like, older stellar component explains the flattened morphology in the rest-optical continuum. We conclude that GS9422 is consistent with being a normal galaxy with an obscured, type-2 AGN &ndash; a simple scenario, without the need for exotic stellar populations.

### 296) [2403.02399](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02399v3): JWST/MIRI reveals the true number density of massive galaxies in the early Universe

<p>
Early JWST studies reporting an unexpected abundance of massive galaxies at z ~ 5&ndash;8 challenge galaxy formation models in the &Lambda;CDM framework. Previous stellar mass (M<sub>&sext;</sub>) estimates suffered from large uncertainties due to the lack of rest-frame near-infrared data. Using deep JWST/NIRCam and MIRI photometry from PRIMER, we systematically analyze massive galaxies at z ~ 3&ndash;8, leveraging rest-frame ≳ 1 &mu;m constraints. We find MIRI is critical for robust M<sub>&sext;</sub> measurements for massive galaxies at z &gt; 5: excluding MIRI overestimates M<sub>&sext;</sub> by ~ 0.4 dex on average for M<sub>&sext;</sub> &gt; 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> galaxies, with no significant effects at lower masses. This reduces number densities of M<sub>&sext;</sub> &gt; 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> (10^10.3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) galaxies by ~ 36&percnt; (55&percnt;). MIRI inclusion also reduces "Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) contamination in massive galaxy samples, lowering the LRD fraction from ~ 32&percnt; to ~ 13&percnt; at M<sub>&sext;</sub> &gt; 10^10.3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Assuming pure stellar origins, LRDs exhibit M<sub>&sext;</sub> ~ 10^9&ndash;10.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> with MIRI constraints, rarely exceeding 10^10.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Within standard &Lambda;CDM, our results indicate a moderate increase in the baryon-to-star conversion efficiency (&epsilon;) toward higher redshifts and masses at z &gt; 3. For the most massive z ~ 8 galaxies, &epsilon; ~ 0.3, compared to &epsilon; ≲ 0.2 for typical galaxies at z &lt; 3. This result is consistent with models where high gas densities and short free-fall times suppress stellar feedback in massive high-z halos.

### 297) [2402.17140](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17140v2): Direct Detection of Dark Photon Dark Matter with the James Webb Space Telescope

<p> Haipeng An, Shuailiang Ge, Jia Liu, Zhiyao Lu </p>
<p>
In this study, we propose an investigation into dark photon dark matter (DPDM) within the infrared frequency band, utilizing highly sensitive infrared light detectors commonly integrated into space telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The presence of DPDM induces electron oscillations in both the reflectors and the interior of the detectors. Consequently, these oscillating electrons can emit monochromatic electromagnetic waves with a frequency almost equivalent to the mass of DPDM. By estimating the signal generated by DPDM inside the detector and comparing with observation data, we establish constraints on the kinetic mixing between the photon and dark photon within the range [10, 500] THz. Despite JWST not being optimized for DPDM searches, our findings reveal constraints comparable to those obtained from the XENON1T experiment in the laboratory, as well as astrophysical constraints from solar emission. Additionally, we propose to modify the configuration of JWST optical elements to focus the DPDM induced signal onto the detector. By employing the stationary phase approximation, we can demonstrate that when the size of the reflector significantly exceeds the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave, the contribution to the electromagnetic wave field at a given position primarily stems from the surface unit perpendicular to the relative position vector. This simplification results in the reduction of electromagnetic wave calculations to ray optics. We show that by rearranging the position of reflectors, JWST can achieve a sensitivity stronger than the existing limits by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude.

<p> Sabrina Berger, Madeline A. Marshall, J. Stuart B. Wyithe, Tiziana di Matteo, Yueying Ni, Stephen M. Wilkins </p>
<p>
The hosts of two low-luminosity high-z quasars, J2255+0251 and J2236+0032, were recently detected using JWST's NIRCam instrument. These represent the first high-z quasar host galaxy stellar detections and open a new window into studying high-z quasars. We examine the implications of the measured properties of J2255+0251 and J2236+0032 within the context of the hydrodynamic simulation BlueTides at z = 6.5. We find that these observed quasars fall on the BlueTides stellar to black hole mass relation and have similar luminosities to the brightest simulated quasars. We predict their star formation rates, estimating approximately 10^2-3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/ yr for both quasar hosts. J2255+0251 and J2236+0032's host galaxy radii also fall within estimates of the radii of the simulated host galaxies of similar luminosity quasars. We generate mock JWST NIRCam images of analogs to the observed quasars within BlueTides and perform a point source removal to illustrate both a qualitative and quantitative comparison of the measured and simulated radii and magnitudes. The quasar subtraction works well for similar luminosity quasars, and the recovered host images are consistent with what was observed for J2255+0251 and J2236+0032, further supporting the success of those observations. We also use our mock imaging pipeline to make predictions for the detection of J2255+0251 and J2236+0032's hosts in upcoming JWST observations. We anticipate that the simulation analogs of future high-z quasar host discoveries will allow us to make accurate predictions of their properties beyond the capabilities of JWST.

<p> Anshul Verma, Sanjeet K. Patel, Pavan K. Aluri, Sukanta Panda, David F. Mota </p>
<p>
We study the Bianchi-I cosmological model motivated by signals of statistical isotropy violation seen in cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations and others. To that end, we consider various kinds of anisotropic matter that source anisotropy in our model, specifically Cosmic strings, Magnetic fields, Domain walls and Lorentz violation generated magnetic fields. These anisotropic matter sources, taking one at a time, are studied for their co-evolution with standard model (isotropic) sources viz., dust-like (dark/normal) matter, and dark energy modelled as cosmological constant. We constrain the Hubble parameter, density fractions of anisotropic matter, cold dark matter (CDM), and dark energy (&Lambda;) in a Bianchi-I universe with planar symmetry i.e., which has a global ellipsoidal geometry, and try to find signatures of a cosmic preferred axis if any. The latest compilation of Type Ia Supernova (SNIa) data from Pantheon+SH0ES collaboration is used in our analysis to obtain constraints on cosmological parameters and any preferred axis for our universe. In our analysis, we found mild evidence for a cosmic preferred axis. It is interesting to note that this preferred axis lies broadly in the vicinity of other prominent cosmic anisotropy axes reported in the literature from diverse data sets. Also we find some evidence for non-zero (negative) cosmic shear and eccentricity that characterize different expansion rates in different directions and deviation from an isotropic scale factor respectively. The energy density fractions of two of the sources considered are found to be non-zero at a 2&sigma; confidence level. To be more conclusive, we require more SNIa host galaxy data for tighter constraints on distance and absolute magnitude calibration which are expected to be available from the future JWST observations and others.

### 300) [2307.06336](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06336v3): Ultraviolet Compactness of High-Redshift Galaxies as a Tracer of Early-Stage Gas Infall, Bursty Star Formation, and Offset from the Fundamental Metallicity Relation

<p> Danial Langeroodi, Jens Hjorth </p>
<p>
The empirical anti-correlation between gas-phase metallicity and star formation rate (SFR) at a fixed stellar mass, known as the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR), is commonly interpreted as an equilibrium state in the interplay between gas infall, enrichment, and gas removal. JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy has shown a z&gt;3 deviation from the local-universe FMR calibrations, suggesting that these galaxies are potentially caught out of equilibrium. To investigate this, we inferred the stellar population, nebular, and morphological properties of 427 galaxies at 3&lt;z&lt;10 using uniformly reduced NIRSpec prism spectroscopy and NIRCam photometry. We consider morphology as a possible indicator of chemical enrichment stage. We find a mass-size relation already in place at 4&lt;z&lt;10, with a normalization anti-correlated with redshift. The size-redshift anti-correlation depends on stellar mass: while the size of M_*&lt;10^8M<sub>&odot;</sub> galaxies strongly declines with redshift, M_*&gt;10^9M<sub>&odot;</sub> galaxies exhibit negligible redshift evolution. We also confirm the redshift evolution of the FMR: z&gt;3 galaxies appear metal-deficient compared to expectations for their stellar mass and SFR according to the local-universe FMR. This offset grows with redshift. Metal deficiency is correlated with compactness: galaxies most offset from the average mass-size relation are also the most metal-poor for their stellar mass and SFR. We interpret this as a product of bursty star formation: compact galaxies exhibit elevated SFR surface densities, indicating that they are observed during burst episodes triggered by gas infall. While accretion of metal-poor gas has reduced their gas-phase metallicity by diluting the interstellar medium, they are observed prior to chemical yield release by newly formed massive stars. Simply, they are chemically out of equilibrium compared to the equilibrium state known as the FMR.
