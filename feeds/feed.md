### 1) [2506.06171](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06171v1): Primordial Black Holes and the First Stars

<p> Julia Monika Koulen, Stefano Profumo, Nolan Smyth </p>
<p>
Primordial black holes (PBHs) constitute a compelling dark matter candidate whose gravitational effects could significantly influence early cosmic structure formation. We investigate the impact of PBHs on Population III star formation through detailed N-body and hydrodynamic simulations, extending beyond previous semi-analytical approaches. Our results reveal a mass-dependent dichotomy in PBH effects: massive PBHs (M_PBH ≳ 10^2 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) with sufficient abundance can accelerate structure formation and shift Pop III formation to higher redshifts, potentially conflicting with observational constraints from high-redshift galaxy surveys. Conversely, lower-mass PBHs can induce tidal disruption of gas-rich minihalos, suppressing star formation and delaying the cosmic dawn depending on their abundance. We quantify these competing effects to derive new constraints on the PBH mass function and their contribution to the total dark matter density, with implications for forthcoming observations with the James Webb Space Telescope and 21-cm cosmology experiments.

### 2) [2506.06139](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06139v1): Impact of initial mass function on the chemical evolution of high-redshift galaxies

<p>
Star formation and metal enrichment in galaxies are regulated by supernova (SN) explosions and metal yields from massive stars, which are sensitive to the high-mass end of the initial mass function (IMF). Recent JWST observations have reached a consensus on an invariant relation between stellar mass, metallicity, and star formation rate up to z~ 8 and its breakdown at higher redshifts. It is crucial to understand the underlying physics, especially the role played by the IMF. We explore the impact of IMF on the chemical evolution of high-redshift galaxies and the interplay between IMF and galactic outflows. The ultimate goal is to constrain the high-mass end of the IMF by the cosmic star formation history and stellar mass-metallicity-star formation rate relation (MZSFR) inferred from observations at z~ 4-10. Using the semi-analytical galaxy evolution code A-SLOTH, we follow galactic baryon cycles along merger trees built from cosmological simulations. Stellar feedback is modeled with up-to-date stellar evolution tracks covering the full metallicity range (Z ~ 10^-11 - 0.03) and a broad stellar mass range (m<sub>&sext;</sub>~2 - 600 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) including the metal yields from stellar winds, core-collapse SNe, (pulsational) pair-instability SNe, and Type Ia SNe. Assuming that the IMF follows a Kroupa-like shape with a varying upper mass limit m_\max, we find m_\max ≳ 200 M<sub>&odot;</sub> is required to reproduce the observed MZSFR. Observational data at z≳ 6 favor a galactic outflow model where the outflow mass is proportional to the ratio of supernova energy to halo binding energy. We conclude that very massive (≳ 200 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) stars can play important roles in the star formation and chemical enrichment histories of high-z galaxies. We also discuss their implications for transient sources of both electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves.

### 3) [2506.05470](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05470v1): Probing neutral outflows in z ~ 2 galaxies using JWST observations of Ca II H and K absorption lines

<p>
Using deep JWST/NIRSpec spectra from the Blue Jay survey, we perform the first systematic investigation of neutral gas content in massive galaxies at Cosmic Noon based on the Ca II H, K absorption lines. We analyze a sample of 9 galaxies at 1.8 &lt; z &lt; 2.8 with stellar masses &gt; 10.6, for which we detect neutral gas absorption both in Ca II and in Na I. After removing the stellar continuum using the best-fit model obtained with Prospector, we fit the excess absorption due to neutral gas in the Ca II H, K doublet and in the Na I D doublet, together with nearby emission lines produced by ionized gas. We measure covering fractions between 0.2 and 0.9 from the Ca II H and K lines, which are spectrally well resolved in the NIRSpec R ~ 1000 observations, unlike the absorption lines in the Na I D doublet. We measure the velocity shift, velocity dispersion, and column density separately for Ca II and Na I. About half of the galaxies present blueshifted Ca II, indicative of an outflow of neutral gas, consistent with previous results based on Na I. The velocity shift and the column density measured from Ca II are correlated with those measured from Na I, implying that these absorption lines trace gas in similar physical conditions. However, the column densities are not in a 1:1 relation, meaning that the relative amount of Ca II and Na I atoms along the line of sight varies with the gas column density. After discussing possible reasons for this behavior, we derive an empirical relation between the column density of Ca II and the column density of Na I and, in a more indirect way, of neutral hydrogen H I. This calibration offers a new way to estimate the outflow mass and the mass outflow rate for the neutral phase from current and future JWST observations of massive galaxies at Cosmic Noon and beyond

### 4) [2506.05459](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05459v1): RUBIES: A Spectroscopic Census of Little Red Dots; All V-Shaped Point Sources Have Broad Lines

<p>
The physical nature of Little Red Dots (LRDs) - a population of compact, red galaxies revealed by JWST - remains unclear. Photometric samples are constructed from varying selection criteria with limited spectroscopic follow-up available to test intrinsic spectral shapes and prevalence of broad emission lines. We use the RUBIES survey, a large spectroscopic program with wide color-morphology coverage and homogeneous data quality, to systematically analyze the emission-line kinematics, spectral shapes, and morphologies of ~1500 galaxies at z &gt; 3.1. We identify broad Balmer lines via a novel fitting approach that simultaneously models NIRSpec/PRISM and G395M spectra, yielding 80 broad-line sources with 28 (35%) at z &gt; 6. A large subpopulation naturally emerges from the broad Balmer line sources, with 36 exhibiting `v-shaped' UV-to-optical continua and a dominant point source component in the rest-optical; we define these as spectroscopic LRDs, constituting the largest such sample to date. Strikingly, the spectroscopic LRD population is largely recovered when either a broad line or rest-optical point source is required in combination with a v-shaped continuum, suggesting an inherent link between these three defining characteristics. We compare the spectroscopic LRD sample to published photometric searches. Although these selections have high accuracy, down to F444W&lt;26.5, only 50-62% of the RUBIES LRDs were previously identified. The remainder were missed due to a mixture of faint rest-UV photometry, comparatively blue rest-optical colors, or highly uncertain photometric redshifts. Our findings highlight that well-selected spectroscopic campaigns are essential for robust LRD identification, while photometric criteria require refinement to capture the full population.

### 5) [2506.05189](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05189v1): H3+ in irradiated protoplanetary disks: Linking far-ultraviolet radiation and hot water vapor

<p> Javier R. Goicoechea, Octavio Roncero, Evelyne Roueff, John H. Black, Ilane Schroetter, Olivier Berné </p>
<p>
The likely JWST detection of vibrationally excited H3+ emission in the irradiated disk d203-506, reported by Schroetter et al., raises the question of whether cosmic-ray ionization is enhanced in disks within clustered star-forming regions, or if alternative mechanisms contribute to H3+ formation and excitation. We present a detailed model of the photodissociation region (PDR) component of a protoplanetary disk-comprising the outer disk surface and the photoevaporative wind-exposed to strong external far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation. We investigate key gas-phase reactions involving excited H2 that lead to the formation of H3+ in the PDR, including detailed state-to-state dynamical calculations of reactions H2 + HOC+ -&gt; H3+ + CO and H2 + H+ -&gt; H2+ + H. We also consider the effects of photoionization of vibrationally excited H2(v≥4), a process that has not previously been included in disk models. We find that these FUV-driven reactions dominate the formation of H3+ in the PDR of strongly irradiated disks, largely independently of cosmic-ray ionization. The predicted H3+ abundance peaks at x(H3+)~10^-8, coinciding with regions where HOC+ is also abundant. The high abundances of H3+ and HOC+ are ultimately linked to the strength of the external FUV field (G0), the presence of C+, and an enhanced reservoir of hot H2O. The predicted H3+ column densities (~10^13 cm<sup>2</sup>) are consistent with the presence of H3+ in the PDR of irradiated disks. We also find that formation pumping, resulting from exoergic reactions between excited H2 and HOC+, drive the vibrational excitation of H3+. We expect this photochemistry to be highly active in disks where G0 &gt; 10^3. The H3+ formation pathways studied here may also be relevant in the inner disk region (near the host star), in exoplanetary ionospheres, and in the early Universe.

### 6) [2506.05186](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05186v1): PDRs4All XIV: CH radical and H_3^+ molecular ion in the irradiated protoplanetary disk d203-506

<p>
Most protoplanetary disks experience a phase in which they are subjected to strong ultraviolet radiation from nearby massive stars. This UV radiation can substantially alter their chemistry by producing numerous radicals and molecular ions. In this Letter we present detailed analysis of the JWST-NIRSpec spectrum of the d203-506 obtained as part of the PDRs4All Early Release Science program. Using state-of-the-art spectroscopic data, we searched for species using a multi-molecule fitting tool, PAHTATmol, that we developed for this purpose. Based on this analysis, we report the clear detection of ro-vibrational emission of the CH radical and likely detection of the H_3^+ molecular ion, with estimated abundances of a few times 10^-7 and approximately 10^-8, respectively. The presence of CH is predicted by gas-phase models and well explained by hydrocarbon photochemistry. H_3^+ is usually formed through reactions of H<sub>2</sub> with H<sub>2</sub>^+ originating from cosmic ray ionization of H<sub>2</sub>. However, recent theoretical studies suggest that H_3^+ also forms through UV-driven chemistry in strongly irradiated (G_0&gt;10^3), dense (n_H &gt;10^6 cm^-3) gas. The latter is favored as an explanation for the presence of "hot'' H_3^+ (T_ex≳1000 K) in the outer disk layers of d203-506, coinciding with the emission of FUV-pumped H<sub>2</sub> and other "PDR species'', such as CH^+, CH_3^+, and OH. Our detection of infrared emission from vibrationally excited H_3^+ and CH raises questions about their excitation mechanisms and, underscore that UV radiation can have a profound impact on the chemistry of planet forming disks. They also demonstrate the power of JWST pushing the limit for the detection of elusive species in protoplanetary disks.

### 7) [2506.04819](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04819v1): Model selection using the HII galaxy Hubble diagram

<p> Jun-Jie Wei, Fulvio Melia </p>
<p>
The proposal to use HII galaxies (HIIGx) and giant extragalactic HII regions (GEHR) as standard candles to construct the Hubble diagram at redshifts beyond the current reach of Type Ia supernovae has gained considerable support recently with the addition of five new HIIGx discovered by JWST. The updated sample of 231 sources now extends the redshift range of these objects to z~ 7.5, mapping the Universe's expansion over 95&percnt; of its current age. In this  Letter we use these sources for model selection, and show that the R_h=ct universe is strongly favored by this probe over both flat-&Lambda;CDM and wCDM, with relative Bayesian Information Criterion probabilities of, respectively, 91.8&percnt;, 7.4&percnt; and 0.8&percnt;. A possible caveat with these results, however, is that an unknown dispersion, &sigma;_int, in the HIIGx standard candle relation can weaken the model comparisons. We find that the inclusion of &sigma;_int as an additional, optimizable parameter makes the likelihoods of flat-&Lambda;CDM and R_h=ct about equal, though at the expense of creating ~ 2.5&sigma; tension between our inferred matter density &Omega;_m and its  Planck-optimized value.

### 8) [2506.04350](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04350v1): JWST Insights into Narrow-line Little Red Dots

<p> Zijian Zhang, Linhua Jiang, Weiyang Liu, Luis C. Ho, Kohei Inayoshi </p>
<p>
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a population of red and compact objects with a unique V-shape SED at z ≥ 4 known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Most of the LRDs with existing spectral observations exhibit broad Balmer lines and are thus likely to host active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here we present a study of LRDs with no broad H-alpha component. Our sample consists of five LRDs at z~5 with H-alpha line widths of about 250 km/s. They are selected from 32 LRDs that have NIRSpec high- or medium-resolution grating spectra covering H-alpha. During our construction of the sample, we find that approximately 20 percent of the LRD candidates previously selected do not show red continuum emission but resemble the V-shape spectra due to strong line emission. Compared to normal star-forming galaxies, narrow-line LRDs tend to have relatively higher H-alpha line widths and luminosities. If these LRDs are dominated by galaxies, our SED modeling suggests that they are dusty, compact star-forming galaxies with high stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs). Alternatively, if their SEDs are produced by AGNs, the inferred central black hole masses (MBH) are in the range of 10^5 to 10^6 solar masses, placing them at the low-mass end of the AGN population. They may represent an early stage of super-Eddington growth, where the black holes have yet to accumulate significant masses. With large measurement uncertainties, these black holes appear slightly overmassive relative to the local MBH-Mstar relation, but consistent or undermassive with respect to the MBH-sigma and MBH-Mdyn relations. We further find that nearly half of the high-redshift broad-line AGNs exhibit V-shape SEDs. (abridged)

<p>
The chemical characterization of galaxies in the first billion years after the Big Bang is one of the central goals of current astrophysics. Optical/near-infrared spectroscopy of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been heralded as an effective diagnostic to probe the interstellar medium of their host galaxies and their metal and dust content, up to the highest redshift. An opportunity to fulfill this expectation was provided by the recent blast triggered by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory of GRB 240218A at redshift z=6.782. We study a high-redshift galaxy selected in a complementary way with respect to flux-limited surveys, not depending on galaxy luminosity and stellar mass. We present the VLT/X-shooter spectrum of its afterglow enabling the detection of neutral-hydrogen, low-ionization, high-ionization and fine-structure absorption lines. We determine the metallicity, kinematics and chemical abundance pattern, providing the first detailed characterization of the neutral gas of a galaxy at z&gt;6.5. From the analysis of fine-structure lines we estimate the distance of the closest gas clouds as d_II=620^+230_-140 pc. We determine a high neutral hydrogen column density, log(N(HI)/cm<sup>2</sup>)=22.5±0.3, which is the highest one at z&gt;6 determined so far for a GRB host galaxy, as well as a surprisingly high metal column density, log(N(ZnII)/cm<sup>2</sup>)&gt;14.3. The observed metallicity of the host galaxy system is [Zn/H]&gt;-0.8. We find evidence of a high amount of dust depletion and of aluminum overabundance, although a number of transitions are saturated. The high hydrogen column density, metal abundances and dust depletion in the neutral gas align with those of the ionized gas of very high-redshift galaxies unveiled by ALMA and JWST, testifying that a rapid build up of metals and dust, and massive neutral hydrogen reservoirs seem to be common features of galaxies in the early Universe.

<p> Patricia Iglesias-Navarro, Marc Huertas-Company, Pablo Pérez-González, Johan H. Knapen, ChangHoon Hahn, Anton M. Koekemoer, Steven L. Finkelstein, Natalia Villanueva, Andrés Asensio Ramos </p>
<p>
We present an efficient Bayesian SED-fitting framework tailored to multiwavelength pixel photometry from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). Our method employs simulation-based inference to enable rapid posterior sampling across galaxy pixels, leveraging the unprecedented spatial resolution, wavelength coverage, and depth provided by the survey. It is trained on synthetic photometry generated from MILES stellar population models, incorporating both parametric and non-parametric SFHs, realistic noise, and JADES-like filter sensitivity thresholds. We validate this amortised inference approach on mock datasets, achieving robust and well-calibrated posterior distributions, with an R^2 score of 0.99 for stellar mass. Applying our pipeline to real observations, we derive spatially resolved maps of stellar population properties down to S/N_pixel=5 (averaged over F277W, F356W, F444W) for 1083 JADES galaxies and ~2 million pixels with spectroscopic redshifts. These maps enable the identification of dusty or starburst regions and offer insights into mass growth and the structural assembly. We assess the outshining phenomenon by comparing pixel-based and integrated stellar mass estimates, finding limited impact only in low-mass galaxies (&lt;10^8M<sub>&odot;</sub>) but systematic differences of ~0.20 dex linked to SFH priors. With an average posterior sampling speed of 10^-4 seconds per pixel and a total inference time of ~1 CPU-day for the full dataset, our model offers a scalable solution for extracting high-fidelity stellar population properties from HST+JWST datasets, opening the way for statistical studies at sub-galactic scales.

<p> Antti Rantala, Natalia Lahén, Thorsten Naab, Gastón J. Escobar, Giuliano Iorio </p>
<p>
Observations and high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations indicate that massive star clusters form through a complex hierarchical assembly. We use simulations including post-Newtonian dynamics and stellar evolution to investigate this collisional assembly with the \bifrost code coupled to the \sevn stellar evolution module. With a full initial stellar mass function, we study the effect of initial binary and triple stars as well a high initial single star mass limit (450 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) on the hierarchical assembly, structure, and kinematics of massive (M_ cl~10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, N=1.8 × 10^6) star clusters. Simultaneously, intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs), potential seeds for supermassive black holes, can form and grow in our models by stellar collisions, tidal disruption events (TDEs) and black hole (BH) mergers. At a fixed cluster mass, stellar multiplicity or a high mass limit increase the numbers (up to ~ 10) and masses (up to 10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) of the formed IMBHs within the first 10 Myr of cluster evolution. The TDE rates peak at \Gamma_ tde~ 5 × 10^-5 yr^-1 shortly after IMBH formation at ~ 2 Myr. In all simulations, we find gravitational wave driven mergers involving stellar BHs and IMBHs. Initial multiplicity or a high mass limit also result in IMBH-IMBH mergers. The IMBH masses correlate with the initial cluster masses, surface densities and velocity dispersions approximately as M<sub>&bull;</sub> &prop; M_cl, M<sub>&bull;</sub> &prop; &Sigma;_h^3/2 and M<sub>&bull;</sub> &prop; &sigma;^3. Our results suggest IMBH masses above M<sub>&bull;</sub> ≳ 10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub> for the dense z~10 star clusters recently observed by the James Webb Space Telescope.

### 12) [2506.04310](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04310v1): Fast Rotators at Cosmic Noon: Stellar Kinematics for 15 Quiescent Galaxies from JWST-SUSPENSE

Mancera Piña, Danilo Marchesini, Adam Muzzin, Andrew B. Newman, Sedona H. Price, Katherine A. Suess, Jesse van de Sande, Pieter van Dokkum, Daniel R. Weisz </p>
<p>
We present spatially-resolved stellar kinematics of 15 massive (M_*=10^10.5-11.5M<sub>&odot;</sub>) quiescent galaxies at z~1.2-2.3 from the JWST-SUSPENSE program. This is the largest sample of spatially-resolved kinematic measurements of quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon to date. Our measurements are derived from ultra-deep NIRSpec/MSA stellar absorption line spectra, using a forward modelling approach that accounts for optics, source morphology, positioning, and data reduction effects. 10 out of 15 galaxies are orientated such that we can measure rotational support. Remarkably, all 10 galaxies show significant rotation (V_r_e=117-345km/s, &sigma;_0 = 180-387km/s), and are classified as "fast rotators" from their spin parameter. The remaining galaxies are too misaligned with respect to the slit to constrain their rotational velocities. The widespread rotational support in our sample indicates that the process responsible for quenching star formation in early massive galaxies did not destroy rotating disc structures. When combined with other quiescent galaxy samples at z~0.5-2.5, we find a trend between rotational support and age, with younger quiescent galaxies being more rotationally supported. This age trend has also been found at z~0, and likely explains why our high-redshift galaxies show more rotational support compared to massive ETGs at z~0, which are, on average, older. Our kinematic modelling also enables us to calculate dynamical masses. These dynamical masses greatly exceed the stellar masses for our sample (median M_dyn/M_*=2.7); they even allow for the bottom-heavy IMF found in the cores of low-z massive ellipticals. Altogether, our results support a scenario in which distant quiescent galaxies evolve into nearby massive ETGs, gradually building up their outskirts and simultaneously losing rotation, due to a series of (mostly minor) mergers.

The COSMOS-Web survey, with its unparalleled combination of multiband data &ndash; particularly near-infrared imaging from JWST's NIRCam (F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W), provides a transformative dataset reaching down to approximately 28th magnitude (F444W) for studying galaxy evolution. In this work, we employ Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), an unsupervised machine learning method, to estimate key physical parameters of galaxies, redshift, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), specific SFR (sSFR), and age, directly from photometric data out to redshift z = 3.5. SOMs efficiently project high-dimensional galaxy color information onto two-dimensional maps, revealing how physical properties vary among galaxies with similar spectral energy distributions.We first validate our approach using mock galaxy catalogs from the HORIZON-AGN simulation, where the SOM accurately recovers the true parameters, demonstrating its robustness. Applying the method to COSMOS-Web observations, we find that the SOM delivers reliable estimates despite the increased complexity of real galaxy populations. Performance metrics (NMAD and RMSE typically between 0.1 and 0.3) confirm the method's precision, with about 70&percnt; of predictions falling within one standard deviation (dex) of the reference values. While redshift estimation in COSMOS-Web presents challenges (median NMAD = 0.05), the overall success of the SOM highlights its potential as a powerful and interpretable tool for galaxy parameter estimation.

### 14) [2506.04119](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04119v2): Exploring over 700 massive quiescent galaxies at z = 2-7: Demographics and stellar mass functions

<p>
High-redshift (z&gt;2) massive quiescent galaxies are crucial tests of early galaxy formation and evolutionary mechanisms through their cosmic number densities and stellar mass functions (SMFs). We explore a sample of 745 massive (M_*&gt; 10^9.5M<sub>&odot;</sub>) quiescent galaxies from z=2-7 in over 800 arcmin<sup>2</sup> of NIRCam imaging from a compilation of public JWST fields (with a total area &gt; 5 × previous JWST studies). We compute and report their cosmic number densities, stellar mass functions, and cosmic stellar mass density. We confirm a significant overabundance of massive quiescent galaxies relative to a range of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and semi-analytic models (SAMs). We find that one SAM, SHARK is able to reproduce our observed number density with the addition of mock observational errors, but that it is still unable to produce quiescent galaxies of the same masses. We find that no simulations or SAMs accurately reproduce the SMF for massive quiescent galaxies at any redshift within the interval z=2-5. This shows that none of these models' feedback prescriptions are fully capturing high-z galaxy quenching, challenging the standard formation scenarios. We find a greater abundance of lower-mass (M_*&lt;10^10M<sub>&odot;</sub>) quiescent galaxies than previously found, highlighting the importance of sSFR cuts rather than simple colour selection. We show the importance of this selection bias, alongside individual field-to-field variations caused by cosmic variance, in varying the observed quiescent galaxy SMF, especially at higher-z. We also find a steeper increase in the cosmic stellar mass density for massive quiescent galaxies than has been seen previously, with an increase of around a factor of 60 from z=4.5 to z=2, indicating the increasing importance of galaxy quenching within these epochs.

We present a comprehensive study of the structural evolution of Brightest Group Galaxies (BGGs) from redshift z ≃ 0.08 to z = 3.7 using the itJames Webb Space Telescope's 255h COSMOS-Web program. This survey provides deep NIRCam imaging in four filters (F115W, F150W, F277W, F444W) across ~ 0.54~deg<sup>2</sup> and MIRI coverage in ~ 0.2~deg<sup>2</sup> of the COSMOS field. High-resolution NIRCam imaging enables robust size and morphological measurements, while multiwavelength photometry yields stellar masses, SFRs, and S\'ersic parameters. We classify BGGs as star-forming and quiescent using both rest-frame NUV&ndash;r&ndash;J colors and a redshift-dependent specific star formation rate (sSFR) threshold. Our analysis reveals: (1) quiescent BGGs are systematically more compact than their star-forming counterparts and exhibit steeper size&ndash;mass slopes; (2) effective radii evolve as R_e &prop; (1+z)^-&alpha;, with &alpha; = 1.11 ± 0.07 (star-forming) and 1.40 ± 0.09 (quiescent); (3) star formation surface density (&Sigma;_SFR) increases with redshift and shows stronger evolution for massive BGGs (log_10(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 10.75); (4) in the &Sigma;_*&ndash;sSFR plane, a structural transition marks the quenching process, with bulge-dominated systems comprising over 80&percnt; of the quiescent population. These results highlight the co-evolution of structure and star formation in BGGs, shaped by both internal and environmental processes, and establish BGGs as critical laboratories for studying the baryonic assembly and morphological transformation of central galaxies in group-scale halos.

<p>
Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal a previously unseen population of compact red objects, known as "little red dots" (LRDs). We study a new photometrically selected sample of 124 LRDs in the redshift range z ~ 3 - 10 selected from NIRCam coverage of the CEERS, NEP-TDF, JADES and JEMS surveys. For JADES, the NEP-TDF and CEERS, we compare SED models with and without AGN components and analyse the impact of an AGN component on the goodness of fit using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). We find that whilst the &chi;<sup>2</sup> of the majority of models containing AGN components is improved compared to models without AGN components, we show that the BIC suggests models without AGN are a more appropriate fit to LRD SEDs, especially when MIRI data is available. We also measure LRD clustering in the CEERS field, JADES field, and NEP-TDF, where we compare the spatial distribution of LRDs and galaxies with Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of equality of distribution. We find that the neighbourhood of LRDs tends to be less dense compared to galaxies at all selections and masses and at similar redshifts. We further measure upper limit estimates for the halo masses of LRDs using abundance matching. Whilst the population of LRDs could be a mixture of several different inherent populations, as a whole it does appear that these systems are mostly hosting compact galaxies or star clusters in formation.

<p>
The COSMOS-Web survey is the largest JWST Cycle 1 General Observer program covering a contiguous ~0.54 deg<sup>2</sup> area with NIRCam imaging in four broad-band filters and a non-contiguous ~0.2 deg<sup>2</sup> with parallel MIRI imaging in a single broad-band filter, F770W. Here we present a comprehensive overview of the MIRI imaging observations, the data reduction procedure, the COSMOS-Web MIRI photometric catalog, and the first data release including the entire COSMOS-Web MIRI coverage. Data reduction is predominantly based on the JWST Science Calibration Pipeline with an additional step involving custom background subtraction to mitigate the presence of strong instrumental features and sky background in the MIRI images. We reach 5&sigma; (point source) limiting depths (m_F770W~25.51 based on r~0.3'' circular apertures) that are significantly better than initial expectations. We create a COSMOS-Web MIRI catalog based on the images presented in this release and compare the F770W flux densities with the Spitzer/IRAC CH4 measurements from the COSMOS2020 catalog for CH4 detections with S/N &gt;5. We find that these are in reasonable agreement with a small median offset of &lt;0.05 mag. We also derive robust 7.7&mu;m number counts spanning five orders of magnitude in flux (~0.2-2300 &mu;Jy) &ndash; making COSMOS-Web the only JWST survey to date to efficiently sample such a large flux range &ndash; which is in good agreement with estimates from other JWST and IRAC surveys.

We present the data reduction methodology used for the COSMOS-Web survey JWST NIRCam data. Covering 0.54 deg<sup>2</sup> with four broadband filters (F115W, F150W, F277W, F444W) and a total exposure time of approximately 270 hours, COSMOS-Web represents the largest contiguous field surveyed during JWST Cycle 1, posing unique data reduction challenges due to its extensive scale. By combining the official JWST Calibration Pipeline with custom improvements for noise removal, background subtraction, and astrometric alignment, we achieve high fidelity science-ready mosaics. We detail the systematic approach employed in the three stages of the JWST Calibration Pipeline. The data, collected in three epochs from January 2023 to January 2024, encompass 152 visits and have been processed into 20 mosaic tiles to optimize computational efficiency and data processing. The final data products achieve 5 sigma depths of 26.7-28.3 AB mag in 0.15" apertures. The processed and calibrated datasets are made available to the public.

<p>
Dwarf galaxies provide powerful laboratories for studying galaxy formation physics. Their early assembly, shallow gravitational potentials, and bursty, clustered star formation histories make them especially sensitive to the processes that regulate baryons through multi-phase outflows. Using high-resolution, cosmological zoom-in simulations of a dwarf galaxy from itthe Pandora suite, we explore the impact of stellar radiation, magnetic fields, and cosmic ray feedback on star formation, outflows, and metal retention. We find that our purely hydrodynamical model without non-thermal physics - in which supernova feedback is boosted to reproduce realistic stellar mass assembly - drives violent, overly enriched outflows that suppress the metal content of the host galaxy. Including radiation reduces the clustering of star formation and weakens feedback. However, the additional incorporation of cosmic rays produces fast, mass-loaded, multi-phase outflows consisting of both ionized and neutral gas components, in better agreement with observations. These outflows, which entrain a denser, more temperate ISM, exhibit broad metallicity distributions while preserving metals within the galaxy. Furthermore, the star formation history becomes more bursty, in agreement with recent JWST findings. These results highlight the essential role of non-thermal physics in galaxy evolution and the need to incorporate it in future galaxy formation models.

<p> Shunta Shimizu, Nobunari Kashikawa, Satoshi Kikuta, Yoshihiro Takeda, Junya Arita, Ryo Emori, Kentaro Koretomo </p>
<p>
We study the Ly&alpha; escape fraction, f<sub>esc</sub>^Ly&alpha; of Ly&alpha; emitters (LAEs) identified by Subaru/HSC narrowband imaging at z = 2.2-6.6, using publicly available deep imaging data from HST and JWST. We perform SED fitting for 127 LAEs at 0.4 - 5.0  &mu; m to estimate their physical properties robustly, and confirm that two distinct LAE populations exist: young LAEs (&lt; 100 Myr) and old LAEs (&gt; 100 Myr). Young LAEs are characterized by burst-like star formation activity and low dust content, significantly differing from Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at the same stellar mass, while old LAEs show similar star formation activity to LBGs, yet with lower dust content and more compact morphology in rest-UV/optical than LBGs. The f<sub>esc</sub>^Ly&alpha; of LAEs is anticorrelated with stellar mass, and this correlation is found to depend on the age of LAEs, such that old LAEs show a weaker anticorrelation than young LAEs, and tend to exhibit higher f<sub>esc</sub>^Ly&alpha; than young LAEs at a given stellar mass. This implies that Ly&alpha; photons escape more efficiently from old LAEs, possibly through the low-density channels of HI and dust created by outflows. The average f<sub>esc</sub>^Ly&alpha; of young LAEs remains nearly constant at ~40% at z = 2.2-6.6, suggesting that the previously observed evolution of global f<sub>esc</sub>^Ly&alpha; of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is due to the changes in the LAE fraction among the SFGs. Converting f<sub>esc</sub>^Ly&alpha; to Lyman continuum escape fraction using empirical relations, we demonstrate that LAEs alone can supply the ionizing photons necessary for reionization at z~6, causing rapid and late reionization.

We present COSMOS2025, the COSMOS-Web catalog of photometry, morphology, photometric redshifts and physical parameters for more than 700,000 galaxies in the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field. This catalog is based on our itJames Webb Space Telescope 255 h COSMOS-Web program, which provides deep near-infrared imaging in four NIRCam (F115W, F150W, F277W, F444W) and one MIRI (F770W) filter over the central ~ 0.54   deg<sup>2</sup> (~ 0.2   deg<sup>2</sup> for MIRI) in COSMOS. These data are combined with ground- and space-based data to derive photometric measurements of NIRCam-detected sources using both fixed-aperture photometry (on the space-based bands) and a profile-fitting technique on all 37 bands spanning 0.3-8 micron. We provide morphology for all sources from complementary techniques including profile fitting and machine-learning classification. We derive photometric redshifts, physical parameters and non-parametric star formation histories from spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. The catalog has been extensively validated against previous COSMOS catalogs and other surveys. Photometric redshift accuracy measured using spectroscopically confirmed galaxies out to z~9 reaches &sigma;_MAD = 0.012 at m_F444W&lt;28 and remains at &sigma;_MAD ≲ 0.03 as a function of magnitude, color, and galaxy type. This represents a factor of ~ 2 improvement at 26 AB mag compared to COSMOS2020. The catalog is approximately 80&percnt; complete at log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ~ 9 at z ~ 10 and at log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ~ 7 at z ~ 0.2, representing a gain of 1 dex compared to COSMOS2020. COSMOS2025 represents the definitive COSMOS-Web catalog. It is provided with complete documentation, together with redshift probability distributions, and it is ready for scientific exploitation today.

### 22) [2506.03244](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03244v1): Cosmic Outliers: Low-Spin Halos Explain the Abundance, Compactness, and Redshift Evolution of the Little Red Dots

<p> Fabio Pacucci, Abraham Loeb </p>
<p>
The Little Red Dots (LRDs) are high-redshift galaxies uncovered by JWST, characterized by small effective radii (R_eff ~ 80-300 pc), number densities intermediate between typical galaxies and quasars, and a redshift distribution peaked at z ~ 5. We present a theoretical model in which the LRDs descend from dark matter halos in the extreme low-spin tail of the angular momentum distribution. Within this framework, we explain their three key observational signatures: (i) abundance, (ii) compactness, and (iii) redshift distribution. Our model focuses on observed, not modeled, properties; it is thus independent of whether they are powered primarily by a black hole or stars. We find that the assumption that the prototypical LRD at z ~ 5 originates from halos in the lowest ~ 1&percnt; of the spin distribution is sufficient to reproduce both their observed number densities and physical sizes. The redshift evolution of their observability is driven by the interplay between the evolving compact disk fraction and cosmological surface brightness dimming. This effect leads to a well-defined "LRDs Era" at 4&lt;z&lt;8, during which the LRDs are common and detectable; at z&lt;4, they are bright but rare, while at z&gt;8, they are common but faint. Finally, we test the predicted redshift trend against observational data, finding excellent agreement. Additional observational support comes from their excess small-scale clustering and spectral signatures of extreme core densities, both of which are expected outcomes of galaxy formation in low-spin halos. These findings suggest that the LRDs are not a fundamentally distinct population but the natural manifestation of galaxies forming in the rarest, lowest angular momentum environments.

AGNBoost constructs 121 input features from 7 NIRCam and 4 MIRI bands-including magnitudes, colors, and squared color terms-to simultaneously predict the fraction of mid-IR 3-30 &mu;m emission attributable to an AGN power law (frac_AGN) and photometric redshift. Each model is trained on a sample of 10^6 simulated galaxies from CIGALE providing ground truth values of both frac_AGN and redshift. Models are tested against both mock CIGALE galaxies set aside for testing and 698 observations from the JWST MIRI EGS Galaxy and AGN (MEGA) survey. On mock galaxies, AGNBoost achieves 15&percnt; outlier fractions of 0.19&percnt; (frac_AGN) and 0.63&percnt; (redshift), with a root mean square error (&sigma;_RMSE) of 0.027 for frac_AGN and a normalized mean absolute deviation (&sigma;_NMAD) of 0.011 for redshift. On MEGA galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, AGNBoost achieves &sigma;_NMAD = 0.074 and 17.05&percnt; outliers, with most outliers at z<sub>spec</sub> &gt; 2. AGNBoost frac_AGN estimates broadly agree with CIGALE fitting (&sigma;_RMSE = 0.183, 20.41&percnt; outliers), and AGNBoost finds a similar number of AGNs as CIGALE SED fitting. The flexible framework of AGNBoost allows straightforward incorporation of additional photometric bands and derived qualities, and simple re-training for other variables of interest. AGNBoost's computational efficiency makes it well-suited for wide-sky surveys requiring rapid AGN identification and redshift estimation.

### 24) [2506.03121](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03121v1): EIGER VII. The evolving relationship between galaxies and the intergalactic medium in the final stages of reionization

<p>
We present a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between galaxies and the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the late stages of cosmic reionization, based on the complete JWST EIGER dataset. Using deep NIRCam 3.5 &mu; m slitless spectroscopy, we construct a sample of 948 [\OIII]&lambda;5008-emitting galaxies with -21.4≲ M_UV≲ -17.2 spanning 5.33&lt;z&lt;6.97 along six quasar sightlines. We correlate these galaxies with \Lya and \Lyb transmission measured from high-resolution quasar spectra across multiple redshift intervals. We find clear redshift evolution in the correlation between galaxy density and transmission: it is suppressed in overdense regions at z&lt;5.50, while enhanced at 5.70&lt;z&lt;6.15. The intermediate range exhibits a transitional behavior. Cross-correlation measurements further reveal excess absorption within ~ 8 cMpc of galaxies at low redshifts, and enhanced transmission at intermediate scales (~5&ndash;20 cMpc) at z&gt;5.70. Statistical tests using mock catalogs with realistic galaxy clustering but no correlation with the transmission field confirm that the observed correlations are unlikely to arise by chance. The evolving signals can be explained by stronger absorption in overdense regions, combined with the competing influences of local radiation fields and the rising background radiation. While local radiation dominates ionization of the surrounding IGM at earlier times, the background becomes increasingly important, eventually surpassing the impact of nearby galaxies. These results support an inside-out progression of reionization, with ionized regions originating around clustered, star-forming galaxies and gradually extending into underdense regions.

Williams, Kenneth C. Wong </p>
<p>
We present cosmological constraints from 8 strongly lensed quasars (hereafter, the TDCOSMO-2025 sample). Building on previous work, our analysis incorporated new deflector stellar velocity dispersions measured from spectra obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Keck Telescopes, and the Very Large Telescope (VLT), utilizing improved methods. We used integrated JWST stellar kinematics for 5 lenses, VLT-MUSE for 2, and resolved kinematics from Keck and JWST for RX J1131-1231. We also considered two samples of non-time-delay lenses: 11 from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) sample with Keck-KCWI resolved kinematics; and 4 from the Strong Lenses in the Legacy Survey (SL2S) sample. We improved our analysis of line-of-sight effects, the surface brightness profile of the lens galaxies, and orbital anisotropy, and corrected for projection effects in the dynamics. Our uncertainties are maximally conservative by accounting for the mass-sheet degeneracy in the deflectors' mass density profiles. The analysis was blinded to prevent experimenter bias. Our primary result is based on the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, in combination with &Omega;_m constraints from the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae (SN) dataset. In the flat &Lambda; Cold Dark Matter (CDM), we find H_0=72.1^+4.0_-3.7 km s<sup>-1</sup> Mpc^-1. The SLACS and SL2S samples are in excellent agreement with the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, improving the precision on H_0 in flat &Lambda;CDM to 4.4%. Using the Dark Energy Survey SN Year-5 dataset (DES-SN5YR) or DESI-DR2 baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) likelihoods instead of Pantheon+ yields very similar results. We also present constraints in the open &Lambda;CDM, wCDM, w_0w_aCDM, and w_&phi;CDM cosmologies. The TDCOSMO H_0 inference is robust and consistent across all presented cosmological models, and our cosmological constraints in them agree with those from the BAO and SN.

<p>
Planet-forming disks around brown dwarfs and very low-mass stars (VLMS) are on average less massive and are expected to undergo faster radial solid transport than their higher mass counterparts. Spitzer had detected C_2H<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub> and HCN around these objects. With better sensitivity and spectral resolving power, JWST recently revealed incredibly carbon-rich spectra from such disks. A study of a larger sample of objects is necessary to understand how common such carbon-rich inner disk regions are and to put constraints on their evolution. We present and analyze MIRI observations of 10 disks around VLMS from the MIRI GTO program. This sample is diverse, with the central object ranging in mass from 0.02 to 0.14 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. They are located in three star-forming regions and a moving group (1-10 Myr). We identify molecular emission in all sources and report detection rates. We compare the molecular flux ratios between different species and to dust emission strengths. We also compare the flux ratios with the stellar and disk properties. The spectra of these VLMS disks are extremely molecular rich, and we detect the 10 &mu;m silicate dust emission feature in 70% of the sample. We detect C_2H<sub>2</sub> and HCN in all of the sources and find larger hydrocarbons such as C_4H<sub>2</sub> and C_6H_6 in nearly all sources. Among O-bearing molecules, we find firm detections of CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, and CO in 90%, 50%, and 20% of the sample, respectively. We find that the detection rates of organic molecules correlate with other organic molecules and anti-correlate with inorganic molecules. Hydrocarbon-rich sources show a weaker 10&mu;m dust strength as well as lower disk dust mass than the oxygen-rich sources. We find potential evidence for C/O enhancement with disk age. The observed trends are consistent with models that suggest rapid inward solid material transport and grain growth.

<p>
Our understanding of the physical properties of star-forming galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR, at z &gt; 6) suffers from degeneracies among the apparent properties of the stars, the nebular gas, and the dust. These degeneracies are most prominent with photometry, which has insufficient (1) spectral resolution and (2) rest-frame spectral coverage. We explore ways to break these degeneracies with a sample of N = 22 high-redshift star-forming galaxies at 7 &lt; z<sub>phot</sub> ≤ 9, using some of the deepest existing imaging from JWST/NIRCam and JWST/MIRI with JADES. Key to this study is the imaging from JWST/MIRI at 7.7 &mu;m, which provides coverage of the rest-frame I-band at the observed redshifts. We infer stellar population properties and rest-frame colors using a variety of filter sets and star formation history assumptions to explore the impact of these choices. Evaluating these quantities both with and without the 7.7 &mu;m data point shows that dense spectral coverage with JWST/NIRCam (eight or more filters, including at least one medium-band) can compensate for lacking the rest-frame I-band coverage for the vast majority (≈ 80&percnt;) of our sample. Furthermore, these galaxy properties are most consistently determined by assuming the delayed-tau star formation history, which provides the smallest offsets and scatters around these offsets when including JWST/MIRI. Within extragalactic surveys like JADES and CEERS, our findings suggest that robust characterization of the stellar population properties and rest-frame colors for high-redshift star-forming galaxies is possible with JWST/NIRCam alone at z ≈ 8.

<p>
We present the a near complete spectral energy distribution (SED) for an extrasolar world: the T8 brown dwarf 2MASS~J04151954-0935066. Spanning from optical to mid-infrared (0.7&ndash;20.4 micron) wavelengths, the SED for this substellar atmosphere is constructed from new JWST NIRSpec G395H (R~2700) and Magellan FIRE echelle (R~8000) near-infrared spectra, along with MIRI mid-infrared photometry complemented by spectra from Keck I, IRTF, Magellan, AKARI, Spitzer and photometry from various surveys and missions. The NIRSpec G395H spectrum reveals strong molecular absorptions from NH_3, CH_4, H<sub>2</sub>S, CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O at approximately 3.00, 3.35, 3.95, 4.25, and 5.00 micron respectively, along with the presence of a CO absorption feature detected mainly at ~ 4.6 micron. We detect no absorption of near-infrared K I doublets in the R~8000 FIRE spectra. In the mid-infrared IRS spectrum, we tentatively identify a new CO<sub>2</sub> feature at 14&ndash;16 micron. The comprehensive SED allows us to empirically constrain bolometric luminosity, effective temperature, mass and radius. Additionally, we demonstrate that the NIRSpec G395H resolution, the highest allowable by JWST, enables a precise radial velocity measurement of 47.1±1.8 km s<sup>-1</sup> for the object, in agreement with previous measurements.

### 29) [2505.24308](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24308v1): Inferring Obscured Cosmic Black Hole Accretion History from AGN Found by JWST/MIRI CEERS Survey

<p> C. -A. Hsieh, T. Goto, C. -T. Ling, S. J. Kim, T. Hashimoto, T. C. -C. Chien, A. Y. -A. Chen </p>
<p>
This study presents the black hole accretion history (BHAH) of obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) identified from the JWST CEERS survey by Chien et al. (2024) using mid-infrared (MIR) SED fitting. We compute black hole accretion rates (BHARs) to estimate the black hole accretion density (BHAD), &rho;_L_disk, across 0 &lt; z &lt; 4.25. MIR luminosity functions (LFs) are also constructed for these sources, modeled with modified Schechter and double power law forms, and corresponding BHAD, &rho;_LF, is derived by integrating the LFs and multiplying by the luminosity. Both &rho;_LF extend to luminosities as low as 10^7   L<sub>&odot;</sub>, two orders of magnitude fainter than pre-JWST studies. Our results show that BHAD peaks between redshifts 1 and 3, with the peak varying by method and model, z ≈ 1&ndash;2 for &rho;_L_disk and the double power law, and z ≈ 2&ndash;3 for the modified Schechter function. A scenario where AGN activity peaks before cosmic star formation would challenge existing black hole formation theories, but our present study, based on early JWST observations, provides an initial exploration of this possibility. At z ~ 3, &rho;_LF appears higher than X-ray estimates, suggesting that MIR observations are more effective in detecting obscured AGNs missed by X-ray observations. However, given the overlapping error bars, this difference remains within the uncertainties and requires confirmation with larger samples. These findings highlight the potential of JWST surveys to enhance the understanding of co-evolution between galaxies and AGNs.

### 30) [2505.24080](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24080v2): The Impact of Galaxy Overdensities and Ionized Bubbles on Lyα Emission at z~7.0-8.5

<p> Zuyi Chen, Daniel P. Stark, Charlotte A. Mason, Mengtao Tang, Lily Whitler, Ting-Yi Lu, Michael W. Topping </p>
<p>
Ly&alpha; spectroscopy with JWST is opening a new window on the sizes of ionized bubbles through the reionization epoch. Theoretical expectations suggest typical bubble radii should be 0.6-1.5 pMpc at z≃ 7, assuming neutral hydrogen fractions of the intergalactic medium in the range x_HI=0.5-0.7. Here we investigate this picture using JWST to characterize the environment and Ly&alpha; emission of 292 galaxies at 7.0&lt;z&lt;8.5 across 5 fields spanning a comoving volume of 1.3×10^6 Mpc^3. If the reionization predictions are correct, we should see overdensities and strong Ly&alpha; emission clustered in redshift windows of dz=0.04-0.08 and angular scales of 5-11 arcmin. We detect Ly&alpha; emission in 36 out of 292 galaxies, including nine new Ly&alpha; detections, two of which (in the UDS field) show extremely large equivalent widths (EW = 200_-78^+50 A and 284_-75^+56 A). We identify 13 significant (4-11×) galaxy overdensities using redshifts from NIRCam grism and NIRSpec. Strong Ly&alpha; emitters are almost uniformly found in the overdensities, with nearly all located between the center and back of the structures. The overdensities that host the strong Ly&alpha; emitters span typical line-of-sight distances (dz~ 0.14) and angular scales (~ 8 arcmin) that are comparable to the predicted bubble sizes at z≃ 7. We discuss evidence that the EGS is mostly ionized along a 24 pMpc sightline at z≃ 7.0-7.6, based on the presence of 3 overdense structures and 10 Ly&alpha; emitters in this volume, and find such a large ionized region would pose tension with standard reionization models.

### 31) [2505.22600](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22600v1): Dust Budget Crisis in Little Red Dots

<p> Kejian Chen, Zhengrong Li, Kohei Inayoshi, Luis C. Ho </p>
<p>
Little red dots (LRDs), a population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) recently identified by JWST, are characterized by their compact morphology and red optical continuum emission, which is often interpreted as evidence for significant dust extinction of A_V ≳ 3 mag. However, the dust-reddened AGN scenario is increasingly challenged by their faint near-to-far infrared emission and a potential "dust budget crisis" in cases when the host galaxy is either undetectably low-mass or absent. In this study, we re-evaluate the dust extinction level in LRDs by modeling the UV-to-infrared spectra for various extinction laws and a broad range of dusty distribution parameters. Comparing the predicted infrared fluxes with observational data from the JWST MIRI, Herschel, and ALMA, our analysis finds that the visual extinction is tightly constrained to A_V ≲ 1.0 mag for A2744-45924 and A_V ≲ 1.5 mag for RUBIES-BLAGN-1 under the SMC extinction laws, with slightly weaker constraints for those with gray extinction in the UV range. The revised A_V values yield a radiative efficiencies of 10&percnt; for the LRD population, easing the tension with the Soltan argument for the bulk AGN population at lower redshifts. Moreover, this moderate extinction (or dust-free) scenario, with reprocessed emission spectra testable by future far-infrared observatories, provides a paradigm shift in understanding their natures, environments, and evolutionary pathways of massive black holes in the early universe.

Goicoechea, Emilie Habart, Thomas J. Haworth, Christine Joblin, Franck Le Petit, Takashi Onaka, Els Peeters, Markus Rölling, Alexander G. G. M. Tielens, Marion Zannese </p>
<p>
The chemical composition of exoplanets is thought to be influenced by the composition of the disks in which they form. JWST observations have unveiled a variety of species in numerous nearby disks, showing significant variations in the C/O abundance ratio. However, little is known about the composition and C/O ratio of disks around young stars in clusters exposed to strong ultraviolet (UV) radiation from nearby massive stars, which are representative of the environments where most planetary systems form, including ours. We present JWST spectroscopy of d203-504, a young 0.7 M<sub>&odot;</sub> star in the Orion Nebula with a 30 au disk irradiated by nearby massive stars. These observations reveal spectroscopic signatures of CO, H<sub>2</sub>O, CH_3^+, and PAHs. Water and CO are detected in absorption in the inner disk (r≲ 1 au), where the estimated gas-phase C/O ratio is 0.48, consistent with the Solar value and that of the Orion Nebula. In contrast, \chCH3+ and PAHs are found in the extended surface layers of the disk. These results suggest that gas in the inner disk is chemically shielded from UV radiation while the surface layers of the disk experience UV-induced chemistry, potentially depleting their carbon content.

### 33) [2505.22242](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22242v1): Ito calculus meets the Hubble tension: Effects of small-scale electron density fluctuations on the CMB anisotropies

<p> Jens Chluba, Geoffrey Vasil, Richard Battye </p>
<p>
In this work, we develop a novel formalism to include the effect of electron density fluctuations at ultra small scales (well below the sound horizon at last scattering) on the observed anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). We treat the electron field as an independent stochastic variable and obtain the required ensemble-averaged photon Boltzmann equations using Ito calculus. Beyond changes to the average recombination history (which can be incorporated in the standard approach) our work identifies two new effects caused by the clumpiness of the medium. The first is a correction to the Thomson visibility function caused by correlations of the electron fluctuations along the line of sight, leading to an additional broadening of the visibility towards higher redshifts which causes extra damping and smearing of the CMB anisotropies. The second effect is a reduction of the effective scattering rate in the (pre-)recombination era that affects the photon transfer functions in a non-trivial manner. These new effects are subdominant in LCDM but can be significant in cosmologies with an early onset of structure formation (e.g., due to generation of enhanced small-scale power) as suggested by a number of indicators (e.g., the abundance of high redshift galaxies observed by JWST). We discuss the relevance of these new effects to the Hubble tension, finding that corrections which cannot be captured by simple modifications to the average recombination history arise. This highlights how important an understanding of the recombination process is in cosmological inference, and that a coordinated simulation and analysis campaign is required as part of the search for the origin of the various tensions in cosmology.

Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) serve as powerful probes of distant galaxies. Their luminous afterglow pinpoints galaxies independent of luminosity, in contrast to most flux-limited surveys. Nevertheless, GRB-selected galaxy samples are not free from bias, instead tracing the conditions favoured by the progenitor stars. Characterising the galaxy populations traced by GRBs is therefore important both to effectively use GRBs as probes as well as to place stronger constraints on the progenitor stars capable of forming long GRBs. Spatially-resolved spectroscopic observations with integral field units (IFUs) provide valuable insights into the interstellar medium and stellar populations of GRB host galaxies. In this paper we present results of the first two GRB host galaxies observed with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU with a spatial resolution of ~ 1.6 kpc; the hosts of GRB 150403A and GRB 050820A at redshifts z ~ 2.06 and z ~ 2.61, respectively. The data reveal two complex galaxy environments made up of two or more star forming galaxies that are likely interacting given their small spatial separation (&lt; 20 kpc) and line of sight velocity offsets (&lt; 100 km/s). The measured gas-phase metallicity, star formation rates (SFRs), and key diagnostic line ratios for each of the detected galaxies are overall consistent with the properties of other star forming galaxies and GRB hosts at z &gt; 2. However, differences in the SFR and metallicities of the interacting galaxies highlight the importance of spatially resolved observations in order to accurately characterise the galaxy properties traced by GRBs.

<p>
To better understand how galaxies assemble their structure and evolve over cosmic time, we present a new catalog of morphological measurements for over 340,000 sources spanning 0 &lt; z &lt; 12, derived from deep JWST NIRCam imaging across four major extragalactic fields (CEERS, PRIMER-UDS, PRIMER-COSMOS, GOODS) compiled in the DAWN JWST Archive (DJA). We perform two-dimensional surface brightness fitting for all galaxies in a uniform, flux-limited sample. Each galaxy is modeled with both a S\'ersic profile and a two-component (bulge and disk) decomposition, yielding consistent structural parameters - including effective radius, S\'ersic index, axis ratio, and bulge-to-total ratio (B/T). To demonstrate the scientific application of our morphology catalogs, we combined these measurements with DJA photometric redshifts, physical parameters and rest-frame colors, and investigated the relation between total, bulge and disk sizes, S\'ersic index (n_S), star formation activity, and redshift. Bulge-dominated galaxies (high n_S and B/T) predominantly occupy the quiescent region of the UVJ diagram, while disk-dominated galaxies are mostly star-forming. A significant bimodality persists, with quiescent disks and compact, bulge-dominated star-forming galaxies observed out to z &gt; 3. Quiescent galaxies also show significantly higher stellar mass surface densities, nearly an order of magnitude greater at z ~ 4 than at z ~ 1. Our results confirm a strong and evolving link between morphology and star formation activity, and support a scenario in which bulge growth and quenching are closely connected. This work is a highly valuable addition to the DJA, adding a morphological dimension to this rich dataset and thus enabling a wider scientific application.

### 36) [2505.21463](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21463v1): Spectral Evolution of Rotating Population III Stars

<p> Jake Hassan, Rosalba Perna, Matteo Cantiello, Tyler Parsotan, Davide Lazzati, Nathan Walker </p>
<p>
Population III (Pop III) stars, the first generation of stars formed from primordial gas, played a fundamental role in shaping the early universe through their influence on cosmic reionization, early chemical enrichment, and the formation of the first galaxies. However, to date they have eluded direct detection due to their short lifetimes and high redshifts. The launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revolutionized observational capabilities, providing the opportunity to detect Pop~III stars via caustic lensing, where strong gravitational lensing magnifies individual stars to observable levels. This prospect makes it compelling to develop accurate models for their spectral characteristics to distinguish them from other stellar populations. Previous studies have focused on computing the spectral properties of non-rotating, zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) Pop III stars. In this work, we expand upon these efforts by incorporating the effects of stellar rotation and post-ZAMS evolution into spectral calculations. We use the JWST bands and magnitude limits to identify the optimal observing conditions, both for isolated stars, as well as for small star clusters. We find that, while rotation does not appreciably change the observability at ZAMS, the subsequent evolution can significantly brighten the stars, making the most massive ones potentially visible with only moderate lensing.

<p> Patrick LaChance, Rupert A. C. Croft, Tiziana Di Matteo, Yihao Zhou, Fabio Pacucci, Yueying Ni, Nianyi Chen, Simeon Bird </p>
<p>
We present simulated counterparts of the "Little Red Dot'' (LRD) galaxies observed with JWST, using the large cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, ASTRID. We create mock observations of the galaxies (5 ≤ z ≤ 8) in ASTRID, and find seventeen which fit the color and size criteria of LRDs. These LRDs are galaxies with high stellar masses (log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 9.7), and massive black holes (log(M_BH/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 6.8). The host galaxies are dense, with stellar half mass radii (325 pc ≤ r_half,* ≤ 620 pc), and dust attenuation in the F444W band above 1.25. Their star formation has been recently quenched. They host relatively bright AGN that are dust-obscured and contribute significantly to the rest-frame optical red slope and have relatively low luminosity in the rest-frame ultraviolet, where the host galaxy's stars are more dominant. These LRDs are in an evolutionary phase of miniquenching that is the result of AGN feedback from their massive black holes. The LRDs in ASTRID are bright with F444W magnitudes of 23.5-25.5. The less massive and fainter galaxies in ASTRID lack the dust concentration necessary to produce the red slope of an LRD, though this could be an effect of limited resolution. Most of the highest Eddington black holes are not LRDs due to their host galaxies having typical dust levels and relatively high star formation rates accompanying their highly accreting black holes, resulting in their spectra being too flat.

### 38) [2505.20263](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20263v1): Bursty or heavy? The surprise of bright Population III systems in the Reionization era

<p> Alessandra Venditti, Julian B. Munoz, Volker Bromm, Seiji Fujimoto, Steven L. Finkelstein, John Chisholm </p>
<p>
The nature of the first, so-called Population III (Pop III), stars has for long remained largely unconstrained. However, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) finally opened new concrete prospects for their detection during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), notably providing promising observational constraints on the Pop III ultra-violet luminosity function (UVLF) at z ~ 6.5. These preliminary data hint towards an unexpected population of UV-bright Pop III sources, which challenges the prevailing view that Pop III star formation is confined to molecular-cooling mini-halos. Here we show that there are two families of models that can explain these surprising observations, either by allowing for late-time Pop III formation within massive, atomic-cooling halos (with halo masses up to M_up^III ≳ 10^10.5 ~M<sub>&odot;</sub>) or by invoking a highly bursty Pop III star-formation activity (with a stochasticity parameter &sigma;_UV^III ≳ 1.5). In these scenarios Pop III systems would have to be either heavier or burstier than usually assumed, underscoring the need to reconsider common assumptions about Pop III star-formation sites, and the potential implications of JWST candidates for current and future observations.

### 39) [2505.19039](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19039v1): Origins of Supermassive Black Holes in Galactic Centers

<p> Ke-Jung Chen </p>
<p>
Direct imaging of black hole shadow halos has firmly confirmed the existence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), with millions of solar masses, residing at the centers of the Milky Way and M87 galaxies. These groundbreaking discoveries represent a monumental success of Einstein's theory of general relativity and have revealed the hidden "monsters" lurking at the centers of galaxies. Moreover, observations of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) indicate that SMBHs with billions of solar masses were already in place within the first billion years after the Big Bang. However, the origins of these SMBHs, as well as their co-evolution with host galaxies, remain poorly understood. This review focuses on the origin of SMBHs, particularly on the formation of their seed black holes. We also highlight several outstanding challenges in modeling seed formation and discuss possible observational signatures. These signatures may be testable with current and future facilities, including the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the upcoming gravitational wave observatory, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).

### 40) [2505.18873](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18873v1): An upper limit of 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> in dust from ALMA observations in 60 Little Red Dots

<p> Caitlin M. Casey, Hollis B. Akins, Steven L. Finkelstein, Maximilien Franco, Seiji Fujimoto, Daizhong Liu, Arianna S. Long, Georgios Magdis, Sinclaire M. Manning, Jed McKinney, Marko Shuntov, Takumi S. Tanaka </p>
<p>
By virtue of their red color, the dust in little red dots (LRDs) has been thought to be of appreciable influence, whether that dust is distributed in a torus around a compact active galactic nucleus (AGN) or diffuse in the interstellar medium (ISM) of nascent galaxies. In Casey et al. (2024) we predicted that, based on the compact sizes of LRDs (unresolved in JWST NIRCam imaging), detection of an appreciable dust mass would be unlikely. Here we present follow-up ALMA 1.3mm continuum observations of a sample of 60 LRDs drawn from Akins et al. (2024). None of the 60 LRDs are detected in imaging that reaches an average depth of &sigma;_rms=22 &mu; Jy. A stack of the 60 LRDs also results in a non-detection, with an inverse-variance weighted flux density measurement of S_1.3mm=2.1±2.9 &mu; Jy. This observed limit translates to a 3&sigma; upper limit of 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> in LRDs' dust mass, and ≲10^11 L<sub>&odot;</sub> in total dust luminosity; both are a factor of 10× deeper than previous submm stack limits for LRDs. These results are consistent with either the interpretation that LRDs are reddened due to compact but modest dust reservoirs (with A_V~2-4) or, alternatively, that instead of being reddened by dust, they have extreme Balmer breaks generated by dense gas (&gt;10^9 cm^-3) enshrouding a central black hole.

### 41) [2505.18262](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18262v1): Enhanced Merger Fractions in a Reionization-Era Protocluster

<p> Lorraine C. Marcelin, Jaclyn B. Champagne, Feige Wang, Xiaohui Fan, Maria Pudoka, Wei Leong Tee, Yongda Zhu </p>
<p>
Mergers play a critical role in galaxy evolution, but their relationship to their surrounding environments is unexplored at high redshift. We investigate the galaxy merger rate among 124 [OIII] emitters at 5.3&lt;z&lt;6.9 as a function of local galaxy density. Identified in the ASPIRE JWST/NIRCam grism survey, we investigate three density regimes: a z=6.6 quasar-centered protocluster, two overdensities at z=5.4 and z=6.2, and field galaxies. We evaluate merger candidates through close pair and morphological criteria in NIRCam imaging, finding that the z=6.6 protocluster contains the highest fraction of galaxies meeting either criterion. We observe a &gt;3&sigma; enhancement of the merger fraction amongst all three overdense structures compared to the field. Eleven galaxies are classified as "active mergers" satisfying both merger criteria, all of which occur within the overdensity samples. We conclude that environment affects the merger rates of galaxies at z&gt;6, leading to increased specific star formation at the 4&sigma; level.

<p>
We present four galaxy scale lenses discovered in two JWST blank-fields: the ~ 54 arcmin<sup>2</sup> of the PEARLS North-Ecliptic-Pole Time-Domain Field (NEP TDF) and in the ~ 90 arcmin<sup>2</sup> of CEERS. We perform the search by visual inspection of NIRCam photometric data, obtaining an initial list of 16 lens candidates. We down-select this list to 4 high-confidence lens candidates, based on lens modelling of the image configuration and photometric redshift measurements for both the source and the deflector. We compare our results to samples of lenses obtained in ground-based and space-based lens searches and theoretical expectations. We expect that JWST observations of field galaxies will yield approximately 1 galaxy scale lens every three to five NIRCam pointings of comparable depth to these observations (~ 9 arcmin<sup>2</sup> each). This shows that JWST, compared to other lens searches, can yield an extremely high number of secure lenses per unit area, with redshift and size distributions complementary to lens samples obtained from ground-based and wide-area surveys. We estimate that a single JWST pure-parallel survey of comparable depth could yield ~ 70 galaxy scale lenses, with a third of them having z_lens&gt;1 and z_source&gt;3.

<p> Justine C. Obidowski, Jeremy J. Webb, Simon Portegies Zwart, Maxwell X. Cai </p>
<p>
It is unknown if an Oort cloud reaches its maximum mass within its star's birth cluster or millions of years later. Complicating the Oort cloud evolution process is the fact that comets can be stripped from orbit due to perturbations from passing stars. We explore how a star's cluster escape time (t_ esc) and the time its Oort cloud reaches maximum mass (t_ max) affect the Oort cloud's ability to survive via N-body simulations. In a 14 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/pc^3 cluster, we identify 50 stars of 1 M<sub>&odot;</sub> with a range of t_ esc to host Oort clouds, each with 1000 comets at t_ max. For each host, we consider Oort clouds that reach maximum mass 0, 50, and 250 Myr after the cluster's formation. Each Oort cloud's evolution is simulated in the cluster from t_ max to t_ esc. Only a fraction of comets tend to remain in orbit, with this amount depending on t_ max and t_ esc. We observe that 12%, 22%, and 32% of Oort clouds with a t_ max of 0, 50 and 250 Myr retain &gt;50% of their comets at t_ esc, respectively. We find that the fraction of comets stripped has the relationship, f=mlog_10(\fract_ esc-t_ max Myr) where m = 0.32±0.04, indicating that the longer the Oort cloud remains in the cluster, the more comets are stripped, with this fraction increasing logarithmically at approximately the same rate for each t_ max.

<p> Soumak Maitra, Girish Kulkarni, Shikhar Asthana, James S. Bolton, Martin G. Haehnelt, Laura Keating </p>
<p>
Ly&alpha; emitters (LAEs) have now been discovered out to redshift z=13, and are valuable probes of the reionization history at redshifts beyond the reach of other currently available tracers. Most inferences of the neutral hydrogen fraction from LAE observations rely on one-point and two-point statistics like the luminosity function and the power spectrum. We present here an analysis of the bispectrum of high-redshift LAEs and demonstrate its sensitivity to the Epoch of Reionization. We use the Sherwood-Relics suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with the GPU-based radiative transfer code ATON-HE to generate realistic LAE mock catalogues for a wide range of reionization models, varying the ionization history and the source populations, including contributions of AGN to hydrogen reionization. We demonstrate that the bispectrum provides greater sensitivity than the power spectrum to both the timing and spatial morphology of reionization. Using reduced-&chi;<sup>2</sup> analysis we further show that the bispectrum also responds more strongly to variations in source population and AGN contribution, apparently more efficiently capturing morphological features missed by two-point statistics. The redshift evolution of the bispectrum reflects the increased clustering of ionizing sources at earlier epochs. The sensitivity of the bispectrum to peculiar velocities underscores the importance of velocity corrections in comparisons to observations. Our findings demonstrate that the LAE bispectrum is a powerful higher-order statistic for probing reionization through current and future LAE surveys using telescopes such as Subaru and JWST.

<p>
The evolution of interstellar ices can be studied with thermal tracers such as the vibrational modes of CO<sub>2</sub> ice that show great diversity depending on their local chemical and thermal environment. In this work we present JWST observations of the 15.2 &mu;m bending mode, the 4.39 &mu;m stretching mode and the 2.70 &mu;m combination mode of ^12CO<sub>2</sub> and ^13CO<sub>2</sub> ice in the high-mass protostar IRAS 20126 and the low-mass protostar Per-emb 35. The 15.2 &mu;m bending mode of both protostars shows the characteristic double peak profile that is associated with pure CO<sub>2</sub> ice and a sharp short-wavelength peak is observed at 4.38 &mu;m in the ^13CO<sub>2</sub> bands of the two sources. Furthermore, a narrow short-wavelength feature is detected at 2.69 &mu;m in the ^12CO<sub>2</sub> combination mode of Per-emb 35. We perform a consistent profile decomposition on all three vibrational modes and show that the profiles of all three bands can be reproduced with the same linear combination of CO<sub>2</sub> ice in mixtures with mostly CH_3OH and H<sub>2</sub>O ices when the ices undergo segregation due to heating. The findings show that upon heating, CO<sub>2</sub> ice is likely segregating from mostly the water-rich ice layer and the CO<sub>2</sub>-CH_3OH component becomes dominant in all three vibrational modes. Additionally, we find that the contribution of the different CO<sub>2</sub> components to the total absorption band is similar for both ^12CO<sub>2</sub> and ^13CO<sub>2</sub>. This indicates that fractionation processes must not play a significant role during the different formation epochs, H<sub>2</sub>O-dominated and CO-dominated. We quantify the ^12CO<sub>2</sub> and ^13CO<sub>2</sub> ice column densities and derive ^12C/^13C_ice = 90 ± 9 in IRAS 20126. Finally, we report the detection of the ^13CO<sub>2</sub> bending mode of pure CO<sub>2</sub> ice at 15.64 &mu;m in both IRAS 20126 and Per-emb 35.

Water is detected in environments representing every stage of star and solar system formation, but its chemical evolution throughout these stages remains poorly constrained. Deuterium ratios offer a means of probing chemical links between water in different cosmic regions because of their sensitivity to physicochemical conditions. Here, we present the first detection of the 4.1 &mu;m HDO ice feature with JWST toward a low-mass protostar, L1527 IRS, which may eventually grow to a sun-like mass. We measure an ice HDO/H<sub>2</sub>O ratio of 4.4^+3.7_-1.7×10^-3, where the reported error is dominated by uncertainties in continuum definition and ice band strengths. This fraction is similar to the gas HDO/H<sub>2</sub>O ratios measured in the warm (&gt;100 K) inner cores of other low-mass protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks found in comparably isolated star-forming regions. Such a similarity tentatively supports the assumption that water vapor detected in these regions is not significantly altered by gas-phase reactions following ice sublimation. It also supports the hypothesis that pre- and protostellar water ice is largely inherited in a chemically unaltered state by outer protoplanetary disks. However, the fraction is a factor of ~4-10 times higher than the gas HDO/H<sub>2</sub>O ratios measured toward comets and low-mass protostars in clustered star-forming regions. This difference may be due to either gas-phase water reprocessing in protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks, or differences between prestellar conditions of isolated dense cores and the clustered star-forming regions that are more analogous to the environment in which our Sun formed.

We present a new stellar dynamical measurement of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the compact elliptical galaxy NGC 4486B, based on integral field spectroscopy with JWST/NIRSpec. The two-dimensional kinematic maps reveal a resolved double nucleus and a velocity dispersion peak offset from the photometric center. Utilizing two independent methods-Schwarzschild orbit-superposition and Jeans Anisotropic Modeling-we tightly constrain the black hole mass by fitting the full line-of-sight velocity distribution. Our axisymmetric Schwarzschild models yield a best-fit black hole mass of M_BH = 3.6^+0.6_-0.6 × 10^8   M<sub>&odot;</sub>, slightly lower but significantly more precise than previous estimates. However, since our models do not account for the non-equilibrium nature of the double nucleus, this value may represent a lower limit. The inferred black hole mass corresponds to approximately 4-13% of the total stellar mass, providing robust evidence for an overmassive SMBH in NGC 4486B. Combined with the galaxy's location deep within the Virgo Cluster, our results support the interpretation that NGC 4486B is the tidally stripped remnant core of a formerly massive galaxy. As the JWST/NIRSpec field of view is insufficient to constrain the dark matter halo, we incorporate archival ground-based long-slit kinematics extending to 5 arcsec. While this provides some leverage on the dark matter content, the constraints remain relatively weak. We place only an upper limit on the dark matter fraction, with M_DM/M_* &lt; 0.5 within 1 kpc-well beyond the effective radius. The inferred black hole mass remains unchanged with or without a dark matter halo.

Magnetic fields play a significant role in star-forming processes on core to clump scales. We investigate magnetic field orientations and strengths in the massive star-forming clump P2 within the filamentary infrared dark cloud G28.34+0.06 using dust polarization observations made using SCUBA-2/POL-2 on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as part of the B-field In STar-forming Region Observations (BISTRO) survey. We compare the magnetic field orientations at the clump scale of ~2 parsecs from these JCMT observations with those at the core scale of ~0.2 parsecs from archival ALMA data, finding that the magnetic field orientations on these two different scales are perpendicular to one another. We estimate the distribution of magnetic field strengths, which range from 50 to 430 &mu;G over the clump. The region forming the core shows the highest magnetic field strength. We also obtain the distribution of mass-to-flux ratios across the clump. In the region surrounding the core, the mass-to-flux ratio is larger than 1, which indicates the magnetic field strength is insufficient to support the region against gravitational collapse. Therefore, the change in the magnetic field orientation from clump to core scales may be the result of gravitational collapse, with the field being pulled inward along with the flow of material under gravity.

The \Gamma growth model is an effective parameterization employed across various scientific disciplines and scales to depict growth. It has been demonstrated that the cosmic star formation rate density (CSFRD) can also be described broadly by this pattern, i.e. \fracdM(T) dT = M_z,0  × \frac&beta;^&alpha; \Gamma(&alpha;)   T^&alpha;-1 e^-&beta;   T  M<sub>&odot;</sub> Gyr^-1, where M_z,0 is the stellar mass at z = 0, &alpha; = 3.0, &beta; = 0.5 Gyr^-1 and T describes time. We use the identical \Gamma growth pattern given by the CSFRD to extend the present day (z = 0) stellar mass bins M<sub>&ast;</sub>(T) of the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function (GSMF) and investigate if we are able to reproduce observations for the high redshift GSMFs. Surprisingly, our scheme describes successfully the evolution of the GSMF over 13.5 Gyrs, especially for objects with intermediate and low masses. We observe some deviations that manifest  solely at very high redshifts (z &gt; 1.5, i.e. more than 9.5 Gyr ago) and  specifically for very small and exceedingly massive objects. We discuss the possible solutions (e.g. impacts of mergers) for these offsets. Our formalism suggests that the evolution of the GSMF is set by simple (few parameters) and physically motivated arguments. The parameters &beta; and &alpha; are theoretically consistent within a multi-scale context and are determined from the dynamical time scale (&beta;) and the radial distribution of the accreting matter (&alpha;). We demonstrate that both our formalism and state-of-the-art simulations are consistent with recent GSMFs derived from JWST data at high redshifts.

### 50) [2505.12867](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12867v1): The Dichotomy in the Nuclear and Host Galaxy Properties of High-redshift Quasars

<p> Ruancun Li, Luis C. Ho, Chang-Hao Chen </p>
<p>
The early growth of high-redshift quasars and their host galaxies raises critical questions about their cosmic evolution. We exploit the angular resolution and sensitivity of NIRCam to investigate the host galaxies of 31 quasars at 4≲ z≲7 drawn from multiple JWST surveys. Using a new multi-band forward-modeling code (scGalfitS) that incorporates physically motivated priors, we securely detect and quantify the host emission in 30 objects, while simultaneously characterizing the nuclear spectral energy distribution. The host galaxies of high-redshift quasars are ~ 0.3~dex more compact than star-forming galaxies of comparable mass. A striking dichotomy emerges: luminous "blue'' quasars (L_5100≳10^45 erg s<sup>-1</sup>) reside in bulge-dominated galaxies (n ≈ 5) and exhibit a narrow range of ultraviolet nuclear slopes (median &beta;_UV ≈ -1.4), while fainter "red'' quasars inhabit disk-like hosts (n≈ 1) and display a broad range of slopes (&beta;_UV≈-2 to 4). These two populations differ markedly in their black hole-to-stellar mass ratios, with high-luminosity quasars showing M_BH/M<sub>&ast;</sub> = 1.2&percnt; compared to 4.7&percnt; for lower luminosity sources, placing them collectively ~0.6~dex above the local M_BH-M<sub>&ast;</sub> relation. This offset likely reflects rapid black hole growth in early gas-rich environments, where feedback from the active galactic nucleus becomes effective only after substantial gas depletion. Our findings suggest that the observed dichotomy, whether due to intrinsic spectral differences or dust extinction, fundamentally shapes the coevolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies in the early Universe.

### 51) [2505.12802](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12802v1): Low-Metallicity Star Formation Survey in Sh2-284 (LZ-STAR). II. The inital mass function

<p> M. Andersen, A. Brizawasi, Y. Cheng, J. C. Tan, R. Fedriani, J. J. Armstrong, M. Robberto </p>
<p>
To fully understand the star formation process, we are compelled to study it in a variety of environments. Of particular interest are how star formation and the resulting initial mass function (IMF) vary as a function of metallicity. We have observed an embedded young cluster in Sh2-284 (hereafter S284), the HII region associated with the open cluster Dolidze 25 using JWST/NIRCam with the aim to study star formation in a metal-poor, i.e., about 1/3 of solar, environment. In particular, we aim to measure the peak of the IMF. Using JWST NIRCam photometry, we identified the embedded cluster S284-EC1 and resolved its low-mass content. By comparison with pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks we determine the mass and extinction for the individual cluster members. Extinction limited samples are created based on the distribution of extinction and the completeness of the data. For the region with a completeness of 50% or higher, we have fitted a log-normal distribution to the IMF. Adopting a fiducial age of 1 Myr of the members, the peak of the IMF is found to be at mc = 0.16+-0.02M<sub>&odot;</sub>, which is significantly smaller than the peak mass measured in local young clusters, such as mc = 0.26+0.11-0.07 M<sub>&odot;</sub> in the Orion Nebula Cluster (Gennaro & Robberto 2020), or the local Galactic disk value of mc = 0.25 M<sub>&odot;</sub> (Chabrier 2005). We have found evidence for IMF variation as a function of metallicity, i.e., the peak of the IMF shifts to lower masses as one goes from solar to 1/3 solar metallicity. However, we caution that the result is sensitive to the assumed age of the stellar population, i.e., with peak mass rising if an age older than 1 Myr is adopted. This study further motivates the need for expanded samples of low-metallicity regions and their content to enable more comprehensive measures of the IMF in such environments.

### 52) [2505.12505](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12505v1): Connecting JWST discovered N/O-enhanced galaxies to globular clusters: Evidence from chemical imprints

<p> Xihan Ji, Vasily Belokurov, Roberto Maiolino, Stephanie Monty, Yuki Isobe, Andrey Kravtsov, William McClymont, Hannah Übler </p>
<p>
Recent JWST observations have revealed a growing population of galaxies at z&gt;4 with elevated nitrogen-to-oxygen ratios. These "N/O-enhanced" galaxies (NOEGs) exhibit near- to super-solar N/O at sub-solar O/H, clearly deviating from the well-established scaling relation between N/O and O/H observed in local galaxies. The origin of this abundance anomaly is unclear. Interestingly, local globular clusters also exhibit anomalous light-element abundances, whose origin remains debated. In this work, we compare the chemical abundance patterns of 22 known NOEGs at 0≲ z≲ 12 &ndash; primarily discovered with JWST &ndash; to those observed in local globular clusters. We find striking similarities in the abundances of C, N, O, Fe, and He between the two populations. The similar abundance patterns support the scenario in which globular cluster stars formed within proto-cluster environments &ndash; similar to those traced by NOEGs &ndash; that were self-enriched. Indeed, the enhancement in N/O in early galaxies appears to be only found in dense stellar environments with &Sigma; <sub>&sext;</sub>≳ 10^2.5~M<sub>&odot;</sub>~pc^-2, as expected for the progenitors of globular clusters in the Milky Way, and similar to those of star clusters identified in strongly lensed high-redshift galaxies. Furthermore, we find a tentative positive correlation between N/O ratios and stellar mass among NOEGs. The apparent high occurrence rate of NOEGs at high redshift is consistent with the picture of cluster-dominated star formation during the early stages of galaxy evolution. Measuring chemical abundances across diverse stellar environments in high-redshift galaxies will be crucial for elucidating the connection between NOEGs and globular clusters.

<p> Yurina Nakazato, Kazuyuki Sugimura, Akio K. Inoue, Massimo Ricotti </p>
<p>
Recent multi-wavelength observations by JWST and ALMA are unveiling both ionized and neutral ISM components in high-redshift (z&gt;6) galaxies. In this work, we investigate the origin of rest-frame far-infrared [OIII]88 &mu;m and [CII]158 &mu;m emission by performing zoom-in cosmological simulations of dwarf-galaxy progenitors at z=9-13. Our simulations incorporate on-the-fly radiative transfer at sub-pc (~ 0.1 pc) resolution, allowing us to resolve the multi-phase ISM. We compute emission lines on a cell-by-cell basis, taking into account local temperature, density, metallicity, radiation field strength, column density, and spectral hardness of radiation bins. We find that [OIII] predominantly arises from centrally located ionizing bubbles with temperatures of ~ (1-5)× 10^4 K and high ionization parameters of log U<sub>ion</sub> ≃ -1.5. In contrast, [CII] is produced in the surrounding dense neutral regions at ~ 5× 10^3 K, which are heated by strong FUV radiation from the central stellar clusters. This spatial arrangement leads to large local variations in [OIII]/[CII], ranging from ~ 100 to 0.01. Our galaxy reproduces the global ratio [OIII]/[CII]~5-30, consistent with recent ALMA detections at z&gt;6 without invoking enhanced O/C abundance ratios. We further derive that [OIII]/[CII] linearly scales with the mass and density ratios of ionized to neutral gas, M_HII/M_HI and n_HII/n_HI and show that the [OIII]/[CII] ratio typically changes from 5.7 to 0.3 from high-z to low-z. For future synergies of JWST and ALMA, we derived M_HII/M_HI for observed z &gt;6 galaxies using H&beta; and [CII] and show the validity of our scaling relations.

<p>
Some carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet stars (WC stars) show an infrared excess from dust emission. Dust forms in the collision of the WC wind with a companion star's wind. As this dust is carried towards the ISM at close to the WCd wind speed and the binary continues through its orbit, a spiral structure forms around the system. The shape depends on the orbital eccentricity and period, as well as stellar parameters like mass-loss rates and terminal wind speeds. Imaging of the WCd binary WR 140 with JWST/MIRI revealed 17 concentric dust shells surrounding the binary. We present new JWST imaging of four additional WCd systems (WR 48a, WR 112, WR 125, and WR 137) that were imaged in 2024. In this analysis, we show that the dust is long-lived, detected with an age of at least 130 years, but more than 300 years in some systems. Longer duration measurements are limited by sensitivity. Regular spacing of dust features confirms the periodic nature of dust formation, consistent with a connection to binary motion. We use these images to estimate the proper motion of the dust, finding the dust to propagate out to the interstellar medium with motion comparable to the wind speed of the WC stars. In addition to these results, we observe unusual structures around WR 48a, which could represent dusty clumps shaped by photoevaporation and wind ablation like young proplyd objects. These results demonstrate that WC dust is indeed long-lived and should be accounted for in galactic dust budgets.

JWST has revealed a stunning population of bright galaxies at surprisingly early epochs, z&gt;10, where few such sources were expected. Here we present the most distant example of this class yet &ndash; MoM-z14, a luminous (M_UV=-20.2) source in the COSMOS legacy field at z<sub>spec</sub>=14.44^+0.02_-0.02 that expands the observational frontier to a mere 280 million years after the Big Bang. The redshift is confirmed with NIRSpec/prism spectroscopy through a sharp Lyman-&alpha; break and ≈3&sigma; detections of five rest-UV emission lines. The number density of bright z<sub>spec</sub>≈14-15 sources implied by our "Mirage or Miracle" survey spanning ≈350 arcmin<sup>2</sup> is &gt;100× larger (182^+329_-105×) than pre-JWST consensus models. The high EWs of UV lines (≈15-35 &#8491;) signal a rising star-formation history, with a ≈10× increase in the last 5 Myr (SFR_5Myr/SFR_50Myr=9.9^+3.0_-5.8). The source is extremely compact (circularized r_e = 74^+15_-12 pc), and yet resolved, suggesting an AGN is not the dominant source of light. The steep UV slope (&beta;=-2.5^+0.2_-0.2) implies negligible dust attenuation and a young stellar population. The absence of a strong damping wing may indicate that the immediate surroundings of MoM-z14 are partially ionized at a redshift where virtually every reionization model predicts a ≈100&percnt; neutral fraction. The nitrogen emission and highly super-solar [N/C]&gt;1 hint at an abundance pattern similar to local globular clusters that may have once hosted luminous supermassive stars. Since this abundance pattern is also common among the most ancient stars born in the Milky Way, we may be directly witnessing the formation of such stars in dense clusters, connecting galaxy evolution across the entire sweep of cosmic time.

Determining how much mass is removed by stellar winds is crucial to understanding massive star evolution and feedback. However, traditional spectroscopic diagnostics in the UV and optical are not sensitive enough to characterize weak stellar winds of OB stars in low-metallicity environments. A new tool to access weak stellar winds is provided by spectroscopy in the infrared (IR). Stellar atmosphere models indicate that the hydrogen Br&alpha; line at &lambda; 4.05 &mu;m is a useful mass-loss rate indicator, particularly at low metallicity. The unprecedented capabilities of the NIRSpec spectrograph on board of the phJames Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allow us to measure this line in spectra of massive stars in other galaxies. In this work, we present the first NIRSpec spectra of O-type stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), which has a metallicity of only 20&percnt; Solar. Our sample consists of thirteen stars with spectral types ranging from O2 to O9.5 including supergiants, giants, and dwarfs. The stars belong to NGC 346, the most massive young cluster in the SMC. We describe the observing strategy and data reduction, highlighting the treatment of the nebular background emission. The spectra cover the 2.8&ndash;5.1 &mu;m wavelength range, and we detect the Br&alpha; line in emission in each of our sample stars. Using a combination of spectral and photometric data ranging from the UV to the IR, we improve the measurements of stellar luminosity and reddening. A first qualitative comparison of the observed Br&alpha; line with stellar atmosphere models shows its potential as a wind diagnostic for weak-winded stars.

<p>
JADES-GS-z6-0, a high-redshift galaxy (z ~ 6.7) recently observed as part of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), exhibits a distinct bump in its rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) spectrum indicative of a large quantity of hydrocarbon grains, a sign of rapid metal and dust enrichment in its interstellar medium (ISM). This galaxy serves as an ideal case for examining rapid dust formation processes in the early universe. We investigated diverse dust production channels from a possible maximal formation redshift of z_form ≈ 17, enabling dust contributions from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars over the longest possible timescale. Our model simultaneously reproduces key spectral features of JADES-GS-z6-0 such as its Balmer decrement, UV slope, and UV bump. The match is obtained by adopting a star-formation history in which a burst at ~ 600~Myr accounts for approximately 30&percnt; of the galaxy's final stellar mass. Our findings indicate two pathways for the formation of hydrocarbon grains, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs): (1) efficient dust accretion within the ISM, necessitating a low depletion of metals into dust grains from Type II supernovae (≈ 10&percnt;), or (2) dust production predominantly by Type II supernovae, requiring a high depletion fraction (≈ 73&percnt;) without dust accretion. We further demonstrate that PAHs are unlikely to originate solely from AGB stars or from shattering of large grains in the ISM. The evolution of the UV slope with redshift points to a complex and bursty star formation history for galaxies observed by JADES.

In this work, we present photometric emission line measurements and spatially-resolved maps of H&alpha; and Pa&beta; for a sample of 14 galaxies at 1.3≤ z≤ 2.4, observed by the MegaScience medium-band survey and the UNCOVER deep spectroscopic survey. We measure line fluxes directly from the medium-band photometry and compare with spectroscopic measurements from UNCOVER. We find reasonable agreement between the photometric and spectroscopic emission line fluxes for both H&alpha; and Pa&beta;, with scatter &lt;0.15 dex down to emission line equivalent widths of 10&#8491;. We also make a nebular dust measurement from the ratio Pa&beta; / H&alpha;, finding an average nebular A_V of 1.4. Our photometric A_V measurements show a slightly larger scatter of 0.5 magnitudes when compared to spectroscopic measurements; however, this scatter may be partially caused by aperture effects. Finally, we produce spatially resolved maps of H&alpha; emission, Pa&beta; emission, and stellar continuum. We find that offsets in H&alpha; and Pa&beta; emission are common, especially for galaxies with the highest A_V, indicating dusty sub-structures. Furthermore, the correlation between H&alpha; and continuum emission decreases with increasing A_V, suggesting that the dustiest objects have clumpy dust and star formation distributions. Our study demonstrates the power of medium-band photometry to directly probe emission line strengths, star formation, and dust attenuation for hundreds of galaxies in UNCOVER and thousands of galaxies in upcoming JWST medium-band surveys.

We present accurate mass measurements of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) in NGC 4736 (M 94). We used the "gold-standard" stellar absorption features (CO band heads) at ~2.3 &mu; m, as opposed to gas emission lines, to trace the dynamics in the nuclear region, easily resolving the SMBH's sphere of influence. The analysis uses observations made with the integral field unit of the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on the  James Webb Space Telescope and a surface brightness profile derived from  Hubble Space Telescope archival images. We used Jeans anisotropic models within a Bayesian framework, and comprehensive Markov chain Monte Carlo optimization, to determine the best-fit black hole mass, orbital anisotropy, mass-to-light ratio, and nucleus kinematical inclination. We obtained a SMBH mass M_BH=(1.60±0.16)×10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub> (1&sigma; random error), which is consistent with the M_BH-&sigma; and M_BH-M<sub>&sext;</sub> relations. This is the first dynamical measurement of a M_BH in NGC 4736 based on the stellar kinematics observed with NIRSpec. We thus settle a longstanding inconsistency between estimates based on nuclear emission-line tracers and the M_BH-&sigma; relation. Our analysis shows that NIRSpec can detect SMBHs with M_BH,min≈ 5×10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> in galaxies within 5 Mpc and &sigma;≈100 km s<sup>-1</sup>

### 60) [2505.09888](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09888v1): VUV Processing of Nitrile Ice: Direct Comparison of Branching in Ice and TPD Spectra

<p> Travis J. Hager, Bailey M. Moore, Quentin D. Borengasser, Kyle T. Renshaw, Rachel Johnson, Anudha C. Kanaherarachchi, Bernadette M. Broderick </p>
<p>
The interplay between radiation chemistry and sublimation dynamics of condensed organic compounds on cold grains is fundamental to describe observed gas-phase and ice-phase molecular abundances in the ISM. Infrared measurements are generally used to identify molecules synthesized in irradiated ices in lab experiments, while mass spectrometric techniques have been used to monitor the products following temperature programmed desorption. The IR measurements are often used quantitatively to monitor chemical transformation of ices during the course of irradiation, but the gas phase methods applied with TPD generally do not permit quantitative branching determination. Here we combine reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) of ices with broadband rotational spectroscopy of the sublimed products, to study the branching of photoproducts produced by the VUV irradiation of condensed CH3CN and CH3CH2CN ices. This permits direct comparison between the ice-phase and gas-phase branching following temperature programmed desorption. This comparison is analogous to astronomical observations of ices in protostellar disks such as by the James Webb Space Telescope employed in conjunction with ALMA observations in the corresponding warm-up regions of the same objects. In the condensed CH3CN VUV processed ices we quantified the HCN, CH3NC, CH2CCNH, CH3NH2, and CH4 abundances. The CH3CH2CN ices also readily produced the corresponding isocyanide and HCN in addition to a significant yield of CH2CHCN. The ethyl cyanide ice produced CH3CHNH rather than CH3NH2 and no CH4 formation was observed. In the gas phase we detected the isocyanides, HCN and vinyl cyanide. The ice and gas phase relative abundances could be brought into agreement if the unknown IR band strength of the isocyanides C-N stretch is assumed to be ~3 times larger than that of the cyanides.

<p>
We present high-resolution and spatially-matched observations with JWST and ALMA of a starburst galaxy (PACS-830) at z=1.46. The NIRCam observations mainly trace the stellar light while the CO (J=5&ndash;4) observations map the dense molecular gas at kpc scales. Both datasets reveal the morphology to be that of a gas/dust rich bulge with two extending arms, together resembling a grand-design spiral galaxy. The more pronounced arm contributes 21 ± 6&percnt; of the total CO emission. These results demonstrate that starburst activity at high redshift can be triggered, without undergoing a highly disruptive major merger. We assess the strength and distribution of star formation using two tracers: (1) Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) emission detected at 8~&mu;m (L_8) with a MIRI/F1800W image, and (2) L_IR, inferred from the CO (J=5&ndash;4) map. The spatial profiles of the L_IR and L_8 are dissimilar, thus leading to a significant deficit of mid-IR (L_8) emission in the nucleus. We hypothesize that this is due to the destruction of PAH molecules by the intense ionizing radiation field or decreased emission in the photodissociation region, as seen in nearby star-forming regions and consistent with the galaxy-wide properties of distant starbursts. This study reveals spatial variations in the L_8 to L_IR ratio for the first time at z&gt;1, in agreement with expectations from theory. Our analysis underscores the pivotal role of joint high-resolution observations with JWST and ALMA in discerning the different phases of the interstellar medium (ISM) and revealing internal physics in galaxy substructures.

<p>
The role of dust in the cosmic star formation budget remains highly uncertain, especially at z&gt;4, where accurate bookkeeping of the dust-obscured component proves difficult. We address this shortcoming with SCUBADive, a compilation of the \jwst counterparts of (sub-)millimeter galaxies, in order to further analyze the distribution and properties of massive dust-obscured galaxies at early times. In this paper, we present a subset of SCUBADive, focusing on 60 "dark'' galaxies that dropout at 1.5\micron. Motivated by \jwst observations of AzTECC71, a far-infrared bright F150W-dropout with z<sub>phot</sub>=5.7^+0.8_-0.7, we complete a systematic search of F150W-dropouts with SCUBA-2 and ALMA detections to find the highest redshift dusty galaxies. Within our subsample, 16 are most similar to AzTECC71 due to faint F444W magnitudes (&gt;24 mag) and lack of counterparts in COSMOS2020. Despite high star formation rates (&langle;SFR&rangle;=550^+500_-360 \mdot yr^-1) and large stellar masses (&langle;log_10(\mstar)&rangle;=11.2^+0.5_-0.4 \mdot), these galaxies may not be particularly extreme for their presumed epochs according to offsets from the main sequence. We find that heavily obscured galaxies, which have inadvertently been omitted by past galaxy evolution studies, comprise roughly 20&percnt; of their host population by mass. This population may, however, contribute significantly to the high mass end (log_10(\mstar/\mdot)&gt;11) of the z&gt;4 stellar mass function as up to 60&percnt; could have been missed from previous studies.

### 63) [2505.09669](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09669v1): Chandra Rules Out Super-Eddington Accretion For Little Red Dots

<p> Andrea Sacchi, Akos Bogdan </p>
<p>
One of the most puzzling discoveries by JWST is the population of high-redshift, red, and compact galaxies dubbed little red dots (LRDs). Based on broad-line diagnostics, these galaxies have been argued to host accreting 10^7-10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> supermassive black holes (SMBHs), a claim with crucial consequences for our understanding of how the first black holes form and grow over cosmic time. A key feature of LRDs is their extreme X-ray weakness: analyses of individual and stacked sources have yielded non-detections or only tentative, inconclusive X-ray signals, except for a handful of individual cases. As the most natural explanation, high obscuration, is disfavored by JWST spectroscopic evidence, several authors have suggested that the X-ray weakness of LRDs is intrinsic, due to super-Eddington accretion rates. In this work, we test that scenario by stacking X-ray data for 55 LRDs in the Chandra Deep Field South, accumulating a total exposure time of nearly 400 Ms. Despite reaching unprecedented X-ray depths, our stack still yields a non-detection. The corresponding upper limits are deep enough to rule out current super-Eddington accretion models, and are compatible only with extremely high levels of obscuration (N_H≳10^25~cm<sup>2</sup>). To explain the X-ray weakness of LRDs, we therefore speculate that the SMBHs in these systems are neither as massive nor as luminous as currently believed.

### 64) [2505.09542](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09542v2): A weak Lyα halo for an extremely bright Little Red Dot. Indications of enshrouded SMBH growth

<p>
The abundant population of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs)-compact objects with red UV to optical colors and broad Balmer lines at high redshift-is unveiling new insights into the properties of early active galactic nuclei (AGN). Perhaps the most surprising features of this population are the presence of Balmer absorption and ubiquitous strong Balmer breaks. Recent models link these features to an active supermassive black hole (SMBH) cocooned in very dense gas (N_H~10^24 cm<sup>2</sup>). We present a stringent test of such models using VLT/MUSE observations of A2744-45924, the most luminous LRD known to date (L_H&alpha;≈10^44~erg s<sup>-1</sup>), located behind the Abell-2744 lensing cluster at z=4.464 (&mu;=1.8). We detect a moderately extended Ly&alpha; nebula (h≈5.7 pkpc), spatially offset from the point-like H&alpha; seen by JWST. The Ly&alpha; emission is narrow (FWHM=270± 15~km s<sup>-1</sup>), spatially offset to H&alpha;, and faint (Ly&alpha;=0.07H&alpha;) compared to Ly&alpha; nebulae typically observed around quasars of similar luminosity. We detect compact N IV]&lambda;1486 emission, spatially aligned with H&alpha;, and a spatial shift in the far-UV continuum matching the Ly&alpha; offset. We discuss that H&alpha; and Ly&alpha; have distinct physical origins: H&alpha; originates from the AGN, while Ly&alpha; is powered by star formation. In the environment of A2744-45924, we identify four extended Ly&alpha; halos (&Delta; z&lt;0.02, &Delta; r&lt;100 pkpc). Their Ly&alpha; luminosities match expectations based on H&alpha; emission, indicating no evidence for radiation from A2744-45924 affecting its surroundings. The lack of strong, compact, and broad Ly&alpha; and the absence of a luminous extended halo, suggest that the UV AGN light is obscured by dense gas cloaking the SMBH with covering factor close to unity.

### 65) [2505.09510](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09510v1): A 70 pc-Diameter Nova Super-remnant Surrounding the Recurrent Nova RS Ophiuchi

<p>
Recurrent novae undergo thermonuclear-powered eruptions separated by less than 100 years, enabled by subgiant or red giant donors transferring hydrogen-rich matter at very high rates onto their massive white dwarf companions. The most-rapidly moving parts of envelopes ejected in successive recurrent nova events are predicted to overtake and collide with the slowest ejecta of the previous eruption, leading to the buildup of vast (~ 10 - 100 parsec) super-remnants surrounding all recurrent novae; but only three examples are currently known. We report deep narrowband imaging and spectroscopy which has revealed a ~ 70-parsec-diameter shell surrounding the frequently recurring nova RS Ophiuchi. We estimate the super-remnant mass to be ~ 20 - 200 solar masses, expanding at a few tens of km/s, with an age of order 50-100 kyr. Its extremely low surface brightness and large angular size help explain the hitherto surprising absence of nova super-remnants. Our results support the prediction that ALL recurrent novae are surrounded by similar extended structures.

<p>
We present a JWST and ALMA detailed study of the ISM properties of high-redshift galaxies. Our JWST/NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy targeting three galaxies at z=6-7 detects key rest-frame optical emission lines, allowing us to derive [OII]&lambda;&lambda;3726,3729-based electron densities of n_e,optical~1000 cm^-3 on average and [OIII]&lambda;4363-based metallicities of 12+log(O/H)=8.0-8.2 in two galaxies. New ALMA Band 9/10 observations detect the [OIII]52&mu;m line in one galaxy but do not in the others, resulting in FIR-based densities of n_e,FIR≲500 cm^-3 from the [OIII]52&mu;m/[OIII]88&mu;m ratios, systematically lower than the optical [OII]-based measurements. These low FIR-based densities are comparable to those at both z~0 and z&gt;6 in the literature, including JADES-GS-z14-0 at z=14.18, suggesting little evolution up to z~14, in contrast to the increasing trend of optical-based densities with redshift. By conducting a JWST and ALMA joint analysis using emission lines detected with both telescopes, we find that the observed FIR [OIII]52,88&mu;m luminosities are too high to be explained by the optical-based densities at which they would be significantly collisionally de-excited. Instead, a 2-zone model with distinct high- and low-density regions is required to reproduce all observed lines, indicating that FIR [OIII] emission arises predominantly from low-density gas, while optical [OIII] and [OII] lines trace both regions. We further demonstrate that the direct-T_e method can sometimes significantly underestimate metallicities up to 0.8 dex due to the presence of the low-density gas not fully traced by optical lines alone, highlighting the importance of combining optical and FIR lines to accurately determine gas-phase metallicities in the early universe.

<p>
Green Pea galaxies are a class of compact, low-mass, low-metallicity star-forming galaxies in the relatively local universe. They are believed to be analogues of high-redshift galaxies that re-ionised the universe and, indeed, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is now uncovering such populations at record redshifts. Intriguingly, JWST finds evidence suggestive of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in many of these distant galaxies, including the elusive Little Red Dots, that broadly lack any detectable X-ray counterparts. Intuitively, one would expect to detect an AGN in their low-redshift analogues with X-rays, yet no study to date has conclusively identified an X-ray AGN within a Green Pea galaxy. Here we present the deepest X-ray campaign of a Green Pea galaxy performed to date, obtained with the goal of discerning the presence of a (potentially low-luminosity) AGN. The target - SDSS J082247.66 +224144.0 (J0822+2241 hereafter) - was previously found to display a comparable X-ray spectral shape to more local AGN (\Gamma ~ 2) and a high luminosity (L_2-10 keV ~ 10^42 erg s<sup>-1</sup>). We show that over 6.2 years (rest-frame), the 2-10 keV luminosity of J0822+2241 is constant, whereas the soft 0.5-2 keV flux has decreased significantly by ~60%. We discuss possible scenarios to explain the X-ray properties of J0822+2241, finding transient low-column density obscuration surrounding an AGN to be the only plausible scenario. J0822+2241 thus provides further evidence that low-luminosity AGN activity could have contributed to the epoch of reionisation, and that local analogues are useful to derive a complete multi-wavelength picture of black hole growth in high redshift low luminosity AGN.

<p>
We present JWST NIRCam observations of the emerging young star clusters (eYSCs) detected in the nearby spiral galaxy M83. The NIRcam mosaic encompasses the nuclear starburst, the bar, and the inner spiral arms. The eYSCs, detected in Pa&alpha; and Br&alpha; maps, have been largely missed in previous optical campaigns of young star clusters (YSCs). We distinguish between eYSCI, if they also have compact 3.3~&mu;m PAH emission associated to them, and eYSCII, if they only appear as compact Pa&alpha; emitters. We find that the variations in the 3.3~&mu;m PAH feature are consistent with an evolutionary sequence where eYSCI evolve into eYSCII and then optical YSCs. This sequence is clear in the F300M-F335M (tracing the excess in the \PAHlambda feature) and the F115W-F187N (tracing the excess in Pa&alpha;) colors which become increasingly bluer as clusters emerge. The central starburst stands out as the region where the most massive eYSCs are currently forming in the galaxy. We estimate that only about 20~&percnt; of the eYSCs will remain detectable as compact YSCs. Combining eYSCs and YSCs (≤10 Myr) we recover an average clearing timescale of 6~Myr in which clusters transition from embedded to fully exposed. We see evidence of shorter emergence timescales (~5~Myr) for more massive (&gt;5×10^3 \msun) clusters, while star clusters of ~ 10^3 \msun about 7~Myr. We estimate that eYSCs remain associated to the \PAHlambda emission 3&ndash;4~Myr. Larger samples of eYSC and YSC populations will provide stronger statistics to further test environmental and cluster mass dependencies on the emergence timescale.

Early results from JWST suggest that epoch-of-reionization (EoR) galaxies produce copious ionizing photons, which, if they escape efficiently, could cause reionization to occur too early. We study this problem using JWST imaging and prism spectroscopy for 426 galaxies at 4.5 &lt; z &lt; 9.0. We fit these data simultaneously with stellar&ndash;population and nebular&ndash;emission models that include a parameter for the fraction of ionizing photons that escape the galaxy, f<sub>esc</sub>. We find that the ionization production efficiency,  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  = Q(H) / L(UV), increases with redshift and decreasing UV luminosity, but shows significant scatter, &sigma;( log  &xi;<sub>ion</sub> ) ~= 0.3 dex. The inferred escape fractions averaged over the population are &langle; f<sub>esc</sub> &rangle; = 3 +± 1% with no indication of evolution over 4.5 &lt; z &lt; 9.0. This implies that in our models nearly all of the ionizing photons need to be absorbed to account for the nebular emission. We compute the impact of our results on reionization, including the distributions for  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  and f<sub>esc</sub>, and the evolution and uncertainty of the UV luminosity function. Considering galaxies brighter than M(UV) &lt; -16 mag, we would produce an IGM hydrogen-ionized fraction of x_e=0.5 at 5.5 &lt; z &lt; 7.1, possibly too late compared to constraints from from QSO sightlines. Including fainter galaxies, M(UV) &lt; -14 mag, we obtain x_e = 0.5 at 6.7 &lt; z &lt; 9.6, fully consistent with QSO and CMB data. This implies that EoR galaxies produce plenty of ionizing photons, but these do not efficiently escape. This may be a result of high gas column densities combined with burstier star-formation histories, which limit the time massive stars are able to clear channels through the gas for ionizing photons to escape.

### 70) [2505.08867](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08867v1): GA-NIFS: Mapping z≃3.5 AGN-driven ionized outflows in the COSMOS field

Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are a key ingredient in galaxy evolution, possibly shaping galaxy growth through the generation of powerful outflows. Little is known regarding AGN-driven ionized outflows in moderate-luminosity AGN (logLbol[erg/s]&lt;47) beyond cosmic noon (z&gt;3). We present the first systematic analysis of the ionized outflow properties of a sample of X-ray-selected AGN (logLx[erg/s]&gt;44) from the COSMOS-Legacy field at z~3.5 and with logLbol[erg/s]=45.2-46.7, by using JWST NIRSpec/IFU spectroscopic observations as part of the GA-NIFS program. We spectrally isolate and spatially resolve the ionized outflows, by performing a multi-component kinematic decomposition of the rest-frame optical emission lines. JWST/NIRSpec IFU data also revealed a wealth of close-by companions, of both non-AGN and AGN nature, and ionized gas streams likely tracing tidal structures and large-scale ionized gas nebulae, extending up to the circum-galactic medium. Ionized outflows are detected in all COS-AGN targets, which we compare with previous results from the literature up to z~3, opportunely (re-)computed for a coherent comparison. We normalize outflow energetics (M&#775;_out, \dotE_out) to the outflow density to standardize the various assumptions that were made in the literature. Our choice is equal to assuming that each outflow has the same gas density. We find GA-NIFS AGN to show outflows consistent with literature results, within the large scatter shown by the collected measurements, suggesting no strong evolution with redshift in terms of total mass outflow rate, energy budget and outflow velocity for fixed bolometric luminosity. Moreover, we find no clear redshift evolution of the ratio of mass outflow rate and kinetic power over AGN bolometric luminosity beyond z&gt;1. In general, our results indicate no significant evolution of the physics driving outflows beyond z~3. [abridged]

### 71) [2505.08858](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08858v2): Ages and metallicities of quiescent galaxies: confronting broadband (UVJ) colours with stellar absorption lines

<p>
For decades, studying quiescent galaxies beyond z~1 has been challenging due to the reliance on photometric spectral energy distributions, which are highly susceptible to degeneracies between age, metallicity, dust, and star-formation history. Only recently has deep, rest-frame, optical spectroscopy made robust metallicity and age measurements possible, allowing us to empirically assess their effects on continuum shapes. To this end, we measure ages and metallicities of ~700 massive (10.2≲log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≲11.8), quiescent galaxies at 0.6≲ z≲1.0 from the Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census (LEGA-C) via continuum-normalized, absorption-line spectra, and compare with independent rest-frame U-V and V-J colours. Age increases along the quiescent sequence as both colours redden, consistent with stellar population synthesis (SPS) model predictions. Metallicity increases perpendicularly to the age trend, with higher metallicities at redder U-V and bluer V-J colours. Thus, age and metallicity behave differently in the UVJ diagram. Moreover, this trend conflicts with SPS model expectations of increasing metallicity approximately along the quiescent sequence. Independent dynamical mass-to-light ratio trends also differ dramatically from SPS model predictions. These results demonstrate that relying on model fits to continuum shapes alone may lead to systematic biases in ages, metallicities, and stellar masses. The cause of these data-model disparities may stem from non-solar abundance patterns in quiescent galaxies or the treatment of evolved stellar phases in the models. Resolving these discrepancies is crucial, as photometric data remain central even with JWST.

<p>
The embedded phase is a crucial period in the development of a young star. Mid-IR observations, now possible with JWST with unprecedented sensitivity, spectral resolution and sharpness are key for probing many physical and chemical processes on sub-arcsecond scales. JOYS addresses a wide variety of questions, from protostellar accretion and the nature of primeval jets, winds and outflows, to the chemistry of gas and ice, and the characteristics of embedded disks. We introduce the program and show representative results. MIRI-MRS data of 17 low-mass and 6 high-mass protostars show a wide variety of features. Atomic line maps differ among refractory (e.g., Fe), semi-refractory (e.g., S) and volatile elements (e.g., Ne), linked to their different levels of depletion and local (shock) conditions. Nested, stratified jet structures consisting of an inner ionized core seen in [Fe II] with an outer H2 layer are commonly seen. Wide-angle winds are found in low-J H2 lines. [S I] follows the jet in the youngest protostars, but is concentrated on source when more evolved. [Ne II] reveals a mix of jet shock and photoionized emission. H I lines measure accretion, but are also associated with jets. Molecular emission (CO2, C2H2, HCN, H2O, ..) is cool compared with disks, and likely associated with hot cores. Deep ice absorption features reveal not just the major ice components but also ions (as part of salts) and complex organic molecules, with comparable abundances from low- to high-mass sources. A second detection of HDO ice in a solar-mass source is presented with HDO/H2O ~ 0.4%, providing a link with disks and comets. A deep search for solid O2 suggests it is not a significant oxygen reservoir. Only few embedded Class I disks show the same forest of water lines as Class II disks do, perhaps due to significant dust extinction of the upper layers [abridged].

We study the Mpc-scale environments of the three highest redshift luminous quasars at z≥ 7.5 (J031343.84-180636.40, J134208.11+092838.61, and J100758.27+211529.21) to understand their connection to large-scale structure. Cosmological simulations show that these early supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are expected to form in the most massive dark matter halos. Therefore, it is expected that they are anchors of galaxy overdensities if luminous matter traces the underlying dark matter structure of the Universe. Using JWST NIRCam (F090W/F115W/F250M/F360M/F430M) imaging, we observe the large-scale structure out to ~13 comoving Mpc around these quasars. We select F090W-dropout Lyman Break galaxies (LBGs) and F430M-excess [OIII] emitters in the three fields. We find 18, 21, and 6 LBG candidates in the fields of J0313, J1342, and J1007, respectively, resulting in a wide range of overdensities (1+&delta; ~ 19, 24, and 7). The photometric redshifts indicate serendipitous foreground and background overdensities in the J0313 field. The joint angular autocorrelation of the combined LBG sample shows significant clustering on &lt;1.8 comoving Mpc scales, demonstrating that the selected galaxies are likely associated with the large-scale structure surrounding the quasars. This first systematic study of z~ 7.5 quasars shows a diverse set of quasar environments at the onset of their formation, providing empirical data to help constrain theoretical predictions of early structure formation.

<p> Mahsa Kohandel, Andrea Pallottini, Andrea Ferrara </p>
<p>
Synergies between JWST and ALMA are unveiling a population of bright, super-early (z&gt;10) galaxies, including systems like GS-z14-0 (z=14.2) and GHZ2 (z=12.3) with extreme FIR line ratios ([OIII]88&mu; m/[CII]158&mu; m &gt; 3) that challenge galaxy formation models. To clarify this issue, we identify in the SERRA zoom-in simulations a synthetic analogue, Amaryllis, of these sources, and track its evolution from z=16 to z=7. During this period, Amaryllis grows from log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ~ 7.4 to 10.3, linking super-early progenitors to the massive galaxy population at the end of reionization. At z=11.5, Amaryllis closely matches the observed properties of GS-z14-0, including M<sub>&sext;</sub>, SFR, and the luminosity of FIR ([OIII]88&mu;m) and UV (e.g. CIII]1908) lines. We find that high [OIII]/[CII] ratios appear during short, merger-driven starburst episodes, when low metallicity (Z ~ 0.02 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) and high ionization conditions (U<sub>ion</sub> ~ 0.1) push the ISM far from equilibrium. These extreme FIR line ratios are thus transient and linked to major mergers that ignite strong ionized gas outflows. Despite such a dynamically violent environment, strikingly, Amaryllis develops a dynamically cold gaseous disk (V/&sigma; ~ 4-6) as early as z ~ 11, while its stellar component remains dispersion-dominated down to z~7. The co-existence of ordered rotation and merger-driven disturbances in z&gt;10 galaxies can explain the tentative disk signatures in GS-z14-0.

### 75) [2505.07749](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07749v1): Emission Line Diagnostics for IMBHs in Dwarf Galaxies: Accounting for BH Seeding and ULX Excitation

<p>
Dwarf AGN serve as the ideal systems for identifying intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) down to the most elusive regimes (~ 10^3 - 10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>). However, the ubiquitously metal-poor nature of dwarf galaxies gives rise to ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) that can mimic the spectral signatures of IMBH excitation. We present a novel photoionization model suite that simultaneously incorporates IMBHs and ULXs in a metal-poor, highly star-forming environment. We account for changes in M_BH according to formation seeding channels and metallicity, and changes in ULX populations with post-starburst age and metallicity. We find that broadband X-rays and UV emission lines are insensitive to M_BH and largely unable to distinguish between ULXs and IMBHs. Many optical diagnostic diagrams cannot correctly identify dwarf AGN. The notable exceptions include He~II~&lambda;4686 and [O~I]~&lambda;6300, for which we redefine typical demarcations to account for ULX contributions. Emission lines in the mid-IR show the most promise in separating stellar, ULX, IMBH, and shock excitation while presenting sensitivity to M_BH and f_AGN. Overall, our results expose the potential biases in identifying and characterizing dwarf AGN purely on strong line ratios and diagnostic diagrams rather than holistically evaluating the entire spectrum. As a proof of concept, we argue that recently discovered over-massive BHs in high-z JWST AGN might not represent the overall BH population, with many galaxies in these samples potentially being falsely classified as purely star-forming.

Context. We present simulations of a massive young star cluster using scNbody6++GPU and scMOCCA. The cluster is initially more compact than previously published models, with one million stars, a total mass of 5.86 × 10^5~M<sub>&odot;</sub>, and a half-mass radius of 0.1~pc. Aims. We analyse the formation and growth of a very massive star (VMS) through successive stellar collisions and investigate the subsequent formation of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the core of a dense star cluster. Methods. We use both direct itN-body and Monte Carlo simulations, incorporating updated stellar evolution prescriptions (SSE/BSE) tailored to massive stars and VMSs. These include revised treatments of stellar radii, rejuvenation, and mass loss during collisions. While the prescriptions represent reasonable extrapolations into the VMS regime, the internal structure and thermal state of VMSs formed through stellar collisions remain uncertain, and future work may require further refinement. Results. We find that runaway stellar collisions in the cluster core produce a VMS exceeding 5 × 10^4~M<sub>&odot;</sub> within 5 Myr, which subsequently collapses into an IMBH. Conclusions. Our model suggests that dense stellar environments may enable the formation of very massive stars and massive black hole seeds through runaway stellar collisions. These results provide a potential pathway for early black hole growth in star clusters and offer theoretical context for interpreting recent JWST observations of young, compact clusters at high redshift.

### 77) [2505.06965](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06965v1): Black Hole Envelopes in Little Red Dots

<p> Daisaburo Kido, Kunihito Ioka, Kenta Hotokezaka, Kohei Inayoshi, Christopher M. Irwin </p>
<p>
Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope have uncovered a population of compact, red object (z~ 4&ndash;7) known as little red dots (LRDs). The presence of broad Balmer emission lines indicates active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes (BHs), while LRDs exhibit unusually weak X-ray and radio emission and low variability, suggesting super-Eddington accretion that obscures the central engine. We suggest that such an extreme accretion disc inevitably drives strong outflows, which would disrupt the LRDs themselves unless confined within the nuclear region &ndash; posing a general feedback problem for overmassive BHs. To resolve this, we propose that the BH is embedded in a massive, optically thick envelope that gravitationally confines the outflow, making any outflow a no-go. This envelope, powered by accretion on to the BH, radiates at nearly the Eddington limit, and is sustained by an infall of the interstellar medium at a rate on the order of ~ 1 M<sub>&odot;</sub>~yr^-1. A photosphere emerges either within the envelope or in the infalling medium, with a characteristic temperature of 5000 - 7000 K, near the Hayashi limit. The resulting blackbody emission naturally explains the red optical continuum of the distinct V-shaped spectrum observed in most LRDs. Furthermore, the dynamical time-scale at the photosphere, ~ 0.01~pc, is consistent with the observed year-scale variabilities. The nuclear structure and spectral features of LRDs are shaped by this envelope, which not only regulates feedback but also acts as a gas reservoir that sustains rapid BH growth in the early universe.

<p>
The role of mergers in the evolution of massive black holes is still unclear, and their dynamical evolution, from the formation of pairs to binaries and the final coalescence, carries large physical uncertainties. The identification of the elusive population of close massive binary black holes (MBBHs) is crucial to understand the importance of mergers in the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes. It has been proposed that MBBHs may display periodic optical/ultra-violet variability. Optical surveys provide photometric measurements of a large variety of objects, over decades and searching for periodicities coming from galaxies in their long-term optical/UV lightcurves may help identify new MBBH candidates. Using the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS) and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data, we studied the long-term periodicity of variable sources in the centre of galaxies identified using the galaxy catalogue Glade+. We report 36 MBBHs candidates, with sinusoidal variability with amplitudes between 0.1 and 0.8 magnitudes over 3-5 cycles, through fitting 15 years of data. The periodicities are also detected when adding a red noise contribution to the sine model. Moreover, the periodicities are corroborated through Generalized Lomb Scargle (GLS) periodograms analysis, providing supplementary evidence for the observed modulation. We also indicate 58 objects, that were previously proposed to be MBBH candidates from analysis of CRTS data only. Adding ZTF data clearly shows that the previously claimed modulation is due to red noise. We also created a catalogue of 221 weaker candidates which require further observations over the coming years to help validate their nature. Based on our 36 MBBHs candidates, we expect ~20 MBBHs at z&lt;1, which is commensurate with simulations. Further observations will help confirm these results.

<p>
JWST spectroscopy has built large emission line samples at z≳4, but it has yet to confidently reveal many galaxies with the hard radiation fields commonly associated with AGN photoionization. While this may indicate a weaker UV ionizing spectrum in many z&gt;4 AGNs or obscuration from dense neutral gas and dust, the complete picture remains unclear owing to the small number of deep rest-UV spectra. Here we characterize the strength of high ionization lines in 53 new galaxies observed with NIRSpec R=2700 grating spectroscopy. We present new detections of narrow NV&lambda;1240 in two galaxies. One is a previously-confirmed z=6.98 Little Red Dot (LRD) with broad H&beta;, and the other is a z=8.72 galaxy with a narrow line spectrum. Neither source exhibits CIV or HeII emission, indicating large NV/CIV and NV/HeII ratios that may reflect a combination of nitrogen-enhancement and resonant scattering effects. We investigate the incidence of narrow high ionization lines in a large database of 851 NIRSpec grating spectra, and we separately quantify the fraction of LRDs with narrow high ionization UV emission lines. Our results likely suggest that hard radiation fields are indeed present in a small subset of LRDs (12.5^+23.7_-10.4&percnt;) and UV-selected galaxies (2.2^+1.7_-1.0&percnt;) at z&gt;4. The identification of narrow high ionization lines in the population of LRDs with strong Balmer absorption suggests the dense neutral hydrogen gas may not uniformly cover the nucleus. The NV/CIV and NV/HeII ratios suggest that efforts to identify high ionization lines should extend down in wavelength to the NV doublet.

JWST observations uncovered a large number of massive quiescent galaxies (MQGs) at z&gt;3, which theoretical models struggle to reproduce. Explaining the number density of such objects requires extremely high conversion efficiency of baryons into stars in early dark matter halos. Using stellar kinematics, we can investigate the processes shaping the mass assembly histories of MQGs. We present high-resolution JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy of GS-9209, a massive, compact quiescent galaxy at z=4.66 (log ≤ft (M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub> ) = 10.52 ± 0.06 , R_eff = 220 ± 20 pc). Full spectral fitting of the spatially resolved stellar continuum reveals a clear rotational pattern, yielding a spin parameter of &lambda;_R_eff = 0.65 ± 0.12. With its high degree of rotational support, this galaxy challenges the scenario of MQGs growing mainly by dry major mergers. This study suggests that at least a fraction of the earliest quiescent galaxies were fast rotators and that quenching was dynamically gentle process, preserving the stellar disc even in highly compact objects. Using Jeans anisotropic modelling (JAM) and a NFW profile, we measure a dark matter fraction of f_DM ≤ft (&lt; R_eff  ) = 6.3^+2.8_-1.7%, which is plausible given that this galaxy is extremely compact. Our findings use kinematics to independently confirm the massive nature of early quiescent galaxies, previously inferred from stellar population modelling. We suggest that GS-9209 has a similar structure to low-redshift 'relic' galaxies. However, unlike relic galaxies which have bottom-heavy initial mass functions (IMF), the dynamically inferred stellar mass-to-light ratio of GS-9209 is consistent with a Milky-Way like IMF. The kinematical properties of GS-9209 are different from those of z&lt;1 early-type galaxies and more similar to those of recently quenched post-starburst galaxies at z&gt;2.

We present the ALMA-CRISTAL survey, an ALMA Cycle 8 Large Program designed to investigate the physical properties of star-forming galaxies at 4 ≲ z ≲ 6 through spatially resolved, multi-wavelength observations. This survey targets 19 star-forming main-sequence galaxies selected from the ALPINE survey, using ALMA Band 7 observations to study [CII] 158 &mu;m line emission and dust continuum, complemented by JWST/NIRCam and HST imaging to map stellar and UV emission. The CRISTAL sample expanded to 39 after including newly detected galaxies in the CRISTAL fields, archival data, and pilot study targets. The resulting dataset provides a detailed view of gas, dust, and stellar structures on kiloparsec scales at the end of the era of reionization. The survey reveals diverse morphologies and kinematics, including rotating disks, merging systems, [CII] emission tails from potential interactions, and clumpy star formation. Notably, the [CII] emission in many cases extends beyond the stellar light seen in HST and JWST imaging. Scientific highlights include CRISTAL-10, exhibiting an extreme [CII] deficit similar to Arp 220; and CRISTAL-13, where feedback from young star-forming clumps likely causes an offset between the stellar clumps and the peaks of [CII] emission. CRISTAL galaxies exhibit global [CII]/FIR ratios that decrease with increasing FIR luminosity, similar to trends seen in local galaxies but shifted to higher luminosities, likely due to their higher molecular gas content. CRISTAL galaxies also span a previously unexplored range of global FIR surface brightness at high-redshift, showing that high-redshift galaxies can have elevated [CII]/FIR ratios. These elevated ratios are likely influenced by factors such as lower metallicity gas, the presence of significant extraplanar gas, and contributions from shock-excited gas.

### 82) [2505.06101](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06101v1): Spectroscopic Supermassive Dark Star candidates

<p> Cosmin Ilie, Sayed Shafaat Mahmud, Jillian Paulin, Katherine Freese </p>
<p>
Dark Stars, i.e. early stars composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium but powered by Dark Matter, could form in zero metallicity clouds located close to the center of high redshift Dark Matter halos. In 2023 three of us identified (in a PNAS work) the first three photometric Dark Star candidates: JADES-GS-z11-0, JADES-GS-z12-0, and JADES-GS-z13-0. We report here our results of a followup analysis based on available NIRSpec JWST data. We find that JADES-GS-z11-0 and JADES-GS-z-13-0 are spectroscopically consistent with a Dark Star interpretation. Moreover, we find two additional spectroscopic Dark Star candidates: JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z-14-1, with the former being the most distant luminous object ever observed. We furthermore identify a feature in its spectrum indicative of the smoking gun signature of Dark Stars: the He II&lambda;1640 absorption line. In view ALMA's recent identification of a probable OIII nebular emission line in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z14-0, the simple interpretation of this object as an isolated Dark Star is unlikely. If both spectral features survive follow-up observations it would imply a Dark Star embedded in a metal rich environment, requiring theoretical refinements of the formation of evolution of Dark Stars, which in previous studies were assumed to form in isolation, without any companions.

### 83) [2505.05942](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05942v1): Green Flash: Residual Emissions Enshrouded in Low-mass Balmer-break Galaxies at z~5

<p> Kosuke Takahashi, Takahiro Morishita, Tadayuki Kodama, Zhaoran Liu, Kazuki Daikuhara, Nuo Chen </p>
<p>
Recent James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have discovered galaxies that are already passively evolving at z&gt;4, ~1.5 Gyr after the Big Bang. Remarkably, some of these galaxies exhibit strong emission lines such as \ha and [OIII] while showing a strong continuum break at ~3650 &#8491; i.e., Balmer break, giving us a unique insight into the physical mechanisms responsible for early galaxy quenching. In this study, we investigate the nature of four such galaxies at z=5.10&ndash;5.78 identified in the Abell~2744 field, using JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec data. Our spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting analysis reveals that these galaxies have been mostly quiescent since ~100 Myr prior to the observed time. We find a higher dust attenuation in the nebular component than in the continuum in all cases. This suggests the presence of dusty star-forming regions or obscured AGN, which could be a  residual signature of past quenching. For one of the galaxies with sufficient medium-band coverage, we derive the \hb+[OIII] emission line map, finding that the line-emitting region is located in the center and is more compact (R_e=0.7 kpc) than the stellar component (R_e=0.9 kpc). For this specific galaxy, we discuss a scenario where quenching proceeds in the manner of "outside-in", a stark contrast to the inside-out quenching commonly seen in massive galaxies at later cosmic times.

### 84) [2505.05556](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05556v1): Super-Eddington accretion in high-redshift quasar hosts: black-hole driven outflows, galaxy quenching, and the nature of Little Red Dots

<p> Giada Quadri, Alessandro Trinca, Alessandro Lupi, Monica Colpi, Marta Volonteri </p>
<p>
The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope has revolutionised our understanding of the high-redshift Universe, detecting bright, massive galaxies up to z≳ 10, and identifying peculiar sources called "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). The origin of both classes of objects remains uncertain but is likely linked to the formation and early growth of the first massive black holes (MBHs), which may be more easily explained by invoking phases of super-Eddington accretion. In this study, we use a state-of-the-art zoom-in cosmological simulation of a quasar host to investigate whether these objects, during their assembly, can resemble any of the peculiar sources observed with JWST. We find that the impact of MBH feedback on star formation is typically moderate, with outflows preferentially escaping perpendicular to the galactic disc. However, for approximately ten percent of the galaxy's lifetime, the system enters a distinct quenched phase, after a rapid MBH growth driven by super-Eddington accretion. This phase culminates in a powerful feedback event, during which the MBH jet and disc-driven winds interact directly with the galactic disc, carving out a central cavity. We also find that, during the history of the quasar host progenitor, the spectral properties of the system can resemble both LRDs and quenched galaxies, depending on the specific evolutionary stage considered. These findings suggest that both conditions may represent transient phases in the life cycle of high-redshift galaxies.

### 85) [2505.05442](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05442v1): Density modulated star formation efficiency: implications for the observed abundance of ultra-violet luminous galaxies at z&gt;10

<p> Rachel S. Somerville, L. Y. Aaron Yung, Lachlan Lancaster, Shyam Menon, Laura Sommovigo, Steven L. Finkelstein </p>
<p>
The number density of UV luminous galaxies discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope at ultra high redshift (z ≳ 10) is higher, and declines much more slowly with increasing redshift, than expected from extrapolations of lower redshift observations or pre-launch physics-based models. Most of these models assume star formation efficiencies (SFE) of only a few percent, motivated by observations of nearby galaxies. In this work, we incorporate a scaling of SFE with gas surface density (which we refer to as Density Modulated SFE; DMSFE), motivated by cloud-scale simulations and theory, into a semi-analytic cosmological model (SAM) of galaxy formation which is calibrated to match the observed rest-UV sizes of high redshift galaxies. We also model the impact of dust and bursty star formation on the SAM-predicted properties of observed galaxies. We show that with plausible values of the main parameters, such as the fraction of gas in dense clouds f_dense, our new models easily reproduce or even exceed the observed galaxy number densities at z~ 6-17. While no single value of f_dense is able to reproduce the very shallow observed decline of the galaxy number density at z≳ 12, it is plausible and even expected for f_dense to have some effective dependence on cosmic time, which could bring these models into closer agreement with the data. We show that the combined effects of DMSFE, decreasing dust attenuation, and increasingly bursty star formation at earlier cosmic epochs could conspire to reproduce the observed evolution.

<p>
We present the combined 2.5-30&mu;m spectra of four protostars acquired with the infrared camera and the infrared spectrograph on board the AKARI and Spitzer space telescopes, respectively. To analyze the ice absorption features in the 8-22&mu;m, we first performed a continuum determination process on mid-infrared spectra and applied a method to subtract the silicate absorption. We conducted a global fitting process to the absorption features in the combined infrared spectra using the experimental ice absorbance data to identify the intrinsic absorption of each ice component. We first derived the H<sub>2</sub>O ice column densities of both stretch and libration modes at 3.05&mu;m and 13.6&mu;m simultaneously. We also identified the absorption features containing NH_3, CH_3OH, CO<sub>2</sub>, and CO and decomposed their mixed components and compared their ice abundances at different evolutionary stages of the protostars. We explored possible absorptions of the organic ice species such as HCOOH, CH_3CHO, and CH_3CH<sub>2</sub>OH in the mid-infrared ranges. The ice analysis method developed in this study can be applied to the ice spectra obtained by the James Webb Space Telescope.

One of the most remarkable results from the phJames Webb Space Telescope has been the discovery of a large population of compact sources exhibiting strong broad H&alpha; emission, typically interpreted to be low-luminosity broad-line (Type 1) active galactic nuclei (BLAGN). An important question is whether these observations are in tension with galaxy formation models, and if so how? While comparisons have been made using physical properties (i.e.~black hole mass and accretion rate) inferred from observations, these require the use of SED modelling assumptions, or locally inferred scaling relations, which may be unjustified, at least in the distant high-redshift Universe. In this work we take an alternative approach and forward model predictions from the First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom simulations to predict the observable properties of BLAGN. We achieve this by first coupling \flares with the \qsosed model to predict the ionising photon luminosities of high-redshift (z&gt;5) AGN. To model the observed broad H&alpha; emission we then assume a constant conversion factor and covering fraction, and the fraction of AGN that have observable broad-lines. With a reasonable choice of these parameters, \flares is able to reproduce observational constraints on the H&alpha; luminosity function and equivalent width distribution at z=5.

<p>
We report on Chandra X-ray observations of four narrow-line quasar candidates at z~6, selected from the SHELLQs project, based on the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam survey. These objects are characterised by narrow (FWHM&lt;310 km/s), luminous (&gt;1e44 erg/s) Lya and faint UV continuum (M_1450 = -22 - -21), prompting us to examine whether they are obscured luminous AGN at the epoch of reionization. However, none of these objects were detected by Chandra, giving an upper limit to their rest-frame 2-10 keV luminosity (Lx) of 2e44 erg/s (2 sigma), assuming a spectral slope Gamma=2. Subsequent rest-frame optical spectroscopy of these objects by the JWST-NIRSpec, presented in a companion paper, show weak broad Balmer emission at the base of narrow cores. With the scaling relation for low-redshift AGN, the observed strong [OIII]5007 flux of these sources would predict Lx to be around 1e45 erg/s, which is well above the Chandra upper limits. These optical spectra and X-ray quietness are reminiscent of JWST-selected broad-line AGN. We attribute the weak broad Balmer emission to the broad-line regions hidden partially by optically-thick obscuring matter which also hides the optical and X-ray continuum emission from the accretion disc. Compton-thick obscuration, which would strongly suppress X-ray emission, could be due to a dense inter-stellar medium that is often present in galaxies at high redshifts. Alternatively, the same effect could be obtained from an inflated disc at the innermost radii in a supercritical accretion flow, when the disc is viewed at inclined angles.

<p>
The unprecedented sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a surprisingly abundant population of mildly obscured, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the epoch of reionization (EoR). However, the link between these objects and classical unobscured quasars remains a mystery. Here we report the discovery of obscured quasars hosted by the most luminous galaxies at z &gt; 6, possibly bridging the gap between the two AGN populations. The 13 objects presented here were originally selected from a rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) imaging survey over &gt;1000 deg<sup>2</sup>, and were known to have luminous (&gt;10^43 erg s<sup>-1</sup>) narrow Ly&alpha; emission. With JWST/NIRSpec follow-up observations, we found that 7 out of 11 objects with narrow Ly&alpha; exhibit a broad component in H I Balmer lines and He I lines, but not in [O III] and other forbidden lines. Mild dust obscuration (0 &lt; A_V &lt; 3) is inferred from the Balmer decrements. The estimated intrinsic luminosities suggest that our broad line (BL) objects are the long-sought UV-obscured counterparts of luminous quasars in the EoR. They host supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses 10^7.8 - 9.1 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, undergoing sub-Eddington to Eddington accretion. Most of the BL objects are spatially unresolved, and are close to "little red dots" with their blue rest-UV and red rest-optical colors. We estimate the AGN number density among similarly luminous Ly&alpha; emitters to be larger than 2 × 10^-8 Mpc^-3. This density is comparable to that of classical quasars with similar continuum luminosities, suggesting that a substantial fraction of active SMBHs are obscured in the EoR and have been overlooked in past rest-UV surveys.

### 90) [2505.04687](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04687v1): The Impact of Early Massive Galaxy Formation on the Cosmic Microwave Background

<p> Eda Gjergo, Pavel Kroupa </p>
<p>
The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, corrected for foreground effects, form the foundation of cosmology and support the Big Bang model. A previously overlooked foreground component is the formation of massive early-type galaxies (ETGs), which can no longer be ignored, particularly in light of JWST's detection of massive, evolved systems at extreme redshifts (z &gt; 13). The rapid formation of massive ETGs has been advocated in galaxy evolution studies for decades, and recent evidence has compelled even proponents of hierarchical mass assembly to acknowledge the fact that massive ETGs evolve quickly. Constraints from chemical evolution are particularly stringent. Without both intense star formation and a top-heavy galaxy-wide initial mass function of stars (IMF), it is difficult to reconcile stellar population synthesis models with the high metallicity and abundance patterns of alpha elements. We infer from previous studies that the progenitor cloud of each massive ETG must have had a radius of approximately 400 kpc. Comparing this value to the average present-day separation of massive ETGs, their formation may have occurred around 15 &lt; z &lt; 20. We consider this epoch of formation in a flat-LCDM cosmological context, incorporating the known and necessary properties of massive ETGs. Such properties are encapsulated independently by the integrated galaxy-wide IMF (IGIMF) theory. The massive ETG evolution presented in this work is consistent with recent advancements in stellar and galaxy evolution, and is derived entirely without priors or constraints from the CMB. Yet, it emerges as a non-negligible source of CMB foreground contamination. Even in our most conservative estimates, massive ETGs account for 1.4% up to the full present-day CMB energy density.

Stellar populations serve as a fossil record of galaxy formation and evolution, providing crucial information about the history of star formation and galaxy evolution. The color-magnitude diagram (CMD) stands out as the most accurate tool currently available for inferring the star formation histories (SFHs) of nearby galaxies with stellar-resolved multiband data. The launch of new space telescopes, including JWST, EUCLID, and the upcoming CSST and Roman, will significantly increase the number of stellar-resolved galaxies over the next decade. A user-friendly and customizable CMD fitting package would be valuable for galaxy evolution studies with these data. We develop an open-source Python-based package named scpancake, which is fast and accurate in determining SFHs and stellar population parameters in nearby galaxies. We have validated our method via a series of comprehensive tests. First, scpancake performs well on mock data, meanwhile the random and systematic uncertainties are quantified. Second, scpancake performs well on observational data containing a star cluster and 38 dwarf galaxies (50 fields). Third, the star formation rate (SFR) from scpancake is consistent with the SFR from FUV photometry. To ensure compatibility and accuracy, we have included isochrone libraries generated using PARSEC for most of the optical and near-infrared filters used in space telescopes such as HST, JWST, and the upcoming CSST.

Even after three years of successful JWST operations, studies have shown that most galaxies identified to date at z &gt; 5 exhibit a metallicity floor of Z≳2&percnt; Z<sub>&odot;</sub>, possibly due to unknown selection biases toward bright galaxies or rapid metal enrichment. To address this question, we search for galaxies with low R3=[OIII] &lambda;5008/H&beta; ratios as part of the JWST Cycle-3 large treasury program, the Slitless Areal Pure-Parallel HIgh-Redshift Emission Survey (SAPPHIRES). Using deep NIRCam Wide-Field Slitless Spectrscopy (WFSS) data, we report the discovery of seven extremely metal-poor galaxy candidates in the SAPPHIRES Early Data Release field, with estimated 12+log(O/H)&lt;7.0 at z~5-7, including two sources with Z&lt;1&percnt; Z<sub>&odot;</sub>, significantly breaking the metallicity floor observed both locally and at high redshift. These candidates appear extremely faint (~28-30  F200W AB mag) and low-mass (log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)~6.8-7.8), as expected from the mass-metallicity relation. They also exhibit very blue UV slopes (-2.6≲&beta;≲-2.0), likely due to low dust content A_V≲0.2 mag or young stellar ages ~5-20 Myr. Compared to galaxies at similar redshift, they appear exceptionally bursty in their star formation activity. Our results highlight the power of NIRCam/WFSS in identifying extremely metal-poor galaxies, from just a single pointing, with more data to come in SAPPHIRES. This underscores the potential of pure-parallel programs towards achieving JWST's primary science goal: discovering the first pristine stars and galaxies. Deep JWST/NIRSpec follow-up observations will also be essential to confirm their nature and perform detailed chemical abundance analyses.

The advent of JWST has opened new horizons in the study of quasar host galaxies during the reionization epoch (z &gt; 6). Building upon our previous initial uncovering of stellar light from two quasar host galaxies at these redshifts, we now report the detection of the stellar light from the full Cycle 1 sample of 12 distant moderate-luminosity quasar (M_1450&gt;-24 mag) host galaxies at z&gt;6 from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). Using JWST/NIRCam observations at 1.5 and 3.6 &mu;m combined with 2D image decomposition analysis, we successfully detect the host galaxies in 11 out of 12 targets, underscoring the high detection rates achievable with moderate-luminosity quasars. Based on two-band photometry and SED fitting, we find that our host galaxies are massive with log~M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub> = 9.5-11.0. The effective radii range from 0.6 to 3.2 kpc which is comparable to the sizes of inactive galaxies with similar masses as measured with imaging from COSMOS-Web. Intriguingly, the two quasar hosts with post-starburst features, which reside at the high-mass end of our sample and exhibit relatively compact morphologies, are consistent (at the 1-&sigma; level) with quiescent galaxies at z~4-5 in terms of their sizes and stellar mass surface densities. These findings support the so-called galaxy compaction scenario already being valid at the reionization epoch (z&gt;6), in which gas inflows during starburst phases drive centrally concentrated star formation followed by rapid quenching, bridging the structural transition of massive galaxies from relatively extended star-forming disks to compact quiescent systems.

### 94) [2505.03511](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03511v1): The Tip of Red Giant Branch Distances to Nearby Dwarf Galaxies WLM and Sextans A with JWST

<p> Ziming Yan, Shu Wang, Xiaodian Chen, Licai Deng </p>
<p>
Distance measurements to extragalactic systems that are both accurate and precise are cornerstones of modern astrophysics, underpinning the calibration of standard candles and the determination of the Hubble constant. Dwarf galaxies, such as Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM) and Sextans A, provide valuable laboratories for testing distance scales across different stellar populations. In this work, we utilize the high sensitivity and spatial resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to measure the distances to WLM and Sextans A using the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) method. Adopting the TRGB absolute magnitude calibrated by NGC 4258, we determine distance moduli of &mu;_0,WLM = 24.977 ± 0.018 (stat) ± 0.056 (sys) mag for WLM and &mu;_0,SexA = 25.740 ± 0.011 (stat) ± 0.057 (sys) mag for Sextans A. Our results are consistent within a 3% distance uncertainty with previous measurements based on TRGB, Cepheids, and J-Region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) methods. With improved distance measurements in the future, these two galaxies have the potential to serve as additional anchor points for TRGB calibration, aiming to reduce the TRGB-based distance uncertainty to below 2%.

### 95) [2505.03183](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03183v1): The Physical Nature of the Off-centered Extended Emission Associated with the Little Red Dots

<p> Chang-Hao Chen, Luis C. Ho, Ruancun Li, Kohei Inayoshi </p>
<p>
A significant fraction of little red dots (LRDs) exhibit nearby extended emission of unknown origin. If physically associated with the LRD, this component may trace stellar emission from an off-centered host galaxy, neighboring companions, or nebular gas illuminated by the active nucleus. We investigate the detailed spectral energy distribution of the extended emission near four LRDs in the JWST UNCOVER and MegaScience surveys. We accurately decompose the extended emission from the dominant point source by simultaneously fitting the images in eight broad-band and nine medium-band filters. After considering both the results from photometric redshift fitting and the probability of galaxies at different redshift overlapping, we confirm that the off-centered blobs in three sources are physically associated with the LRDs, with two of them showing strong [\ionO 3] &lambda;&lambda; 4959, 5007 emission captured by the medium-band filters. While the spectral energy distributions of all three blobs can be modeled assuming star-forming galaxies with stellar mass ~ 10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, the exceptionally strong [\ionO 3] emission of two sources is best interpreted as pure nebular emission from low-density (n&lt;10  cm^-3), low-metallicity (Z≈ 0.05 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) gas photoionized by the ultraviolet radiation from the nearby LRD. Adopting LRD halo masses constrained by clustering measurements and theoretical considerations, we estimate a typical baryonic halo mass accretion rate of ~ 2-9  M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1. If the halo accretion rate is sustained to z=4 and stars form with an efficiency of 10&percnt;, the accreted gas would form a galaxy with stellar mass ~ 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, potentially rendering them spatially resolved at lower redshift.

We present the morphological properties of 17 spectroscopically confirmed massive quiescent galaxies (10.2 &lt; log(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &lt; 11.2) at 3.0 &lt; z &lt; 4.3, observed with JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam. Using S\'ersic profile fits to the F277W and F444W imaging, we derive the size-mass relation and find typical sizes of ~0.6-0.8 kpc at M<sub>&ast;</sub> = 5 × 10^10~M<sub>&odot;</sub>, consistent with a factor of ~7 growth from z ~ 4 to the present day, including a factor of ~2 by z ~ 2. Galaxies with earlier formation times (z_50 ≳ 5) tend to be larger (up to 0.3 dex above the relation), while late-forming galaxies are more compact. Using a random forest regressor, we identify local environmental density, quantified by log(1+&delta;^&prime;_3) from the distances to the three nearest neighbors, as the strongest predictor of bulge-to-total ratio (B/T), which ranges from 0.25 to 1. Applying the same method to the IllustrisTNG simulation, the ex-situ stellar mass fraction (f<sub>&ast;</sub>,ex-situ) &ndash; a proxy for mergers &ndash; is the dominant predictor of B/T. Galaxies with high B/T in dense environments show bursty star formation and short quenching timescales (≲0.4 Gyr), consistent with bulge growth via merger-induced starbursts; in simulations, such galaxies exhibit elevated ex-situ fractions (~20&percnt;-30&percnt;). In contrast, some high-B/T galaxies in intermediate-density environments have low ex-situ fractions, suggesting that additional mechanisms &ndash; such as violent disk instabilities &ndash; may contribute. These findings point to multiple bulge growth pathways at high redshift, unified by rapid gas accretion, central starbursts, and AGN feedback, as predicted by cosmological simulations.

### 97) [2505.02918](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02918v1): Carbon from massive binary-stripped stars over cosmic time: effect of metallicity

<p> Jing-Ze Ma, Rob Farmer, Selma E. de Mink, Eva Laplace </p>
<p>
The origin of carbon in the Universe remains uncertain. At solar metallicity, binary-stripped massive stars &ndash; stars that lost their envelope through stable interaction with a companion &ndash; have been suggested to produce twice as much carbon as their single-star counterparts. However, understanding the chemical evolution of galaxies over cosmic time requires examining stellar yields across a range of metallicities. Using the stellar evolution code MESA, we compute the carbon yields from wind mass loss and supernova explosions of single and binary-stripped stars across a wide range of initial masses (10-46,M<sub>&odot;</sub>), metallicities (Z = 0.0021, 0.0047, 0.0142), and initial orbital periods (10-5000 days). We find that metallicity is the dominant factor influencing the carbon yields of massive stars, outweighing the effects of binarity and detailed orbital parameters. Since the chemical yields from binary massive stars are highly sensitive to metallicity, we caution that yields predicted at solar metallicity should not be directly extrapolated to lower metallicities. At sub-solar metallicities, particularly below 1/7 solar, weak stellar winds and inefficient binary stripping result in carbon yields from binary-stripped stars that closely resemble those of single stars. This suggests that binary-stripped massive stars are unlikely to explain the presence of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars or the carbon enrichment observed in high-redshift galaxies as probed by the James Webb Space Telescope. Our findings only concern the stripped stars in massive binaries. The impact of other outcomes of binary star evolution, in particular stellar mergers and accretors, remains largely unexplored but will be necessary for a full understanding of the role of massive binaries in nucleosynthesis.

<p>
We present a spectroscopic search for broad H&alpha; emitters at z~3.7-6.5 in the GOODS-N field, utilizing JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopy from FRESCO and CONGRESS, complemented by JADES imaging. We identify 19 broad H&alpha; emitters with FWHM &gt; 1000 km/s at z~4-5.5, including 9 new sources. The black hole masses and AGN bolometric luminosities, inferred from the broad H&alpha; components, indicate that most sources are accreting at ~10% of the Eddington limit. We derive their host stellar masses via SED fitting and find higher M_BH/M_* ratios relative to the local M_BH-M_* relations, consistent with previous studies. We find that 42% of the sample do not satisfy the widely-used color selection criteria for Little Red Dots (LRDs), with the majority of these sources lacking the characteristic steep red slope. A comparison of the average SEDs between our sample and LRDs selected in the same field reveals that the steep red slopes observed in some LRDs are likely due to line-boosting effects as previously suggested. Furthermore, we find that 68% of color-selected LRDs with H&alpha; detections in the NIRCam/Grism spectra do not exhibit broad-line features. While the limited sensitivity of the grism spectra may hinder the detection of broad-line components in faint sources, our findings still highlight the enigmatic nature of the LRD population.

Willmer, Chris Willott, Yongda Zhu </p>
<p>
We study the large-scale environments and clustering properties of 28 low-luminosity AGNs at z=3.9-6 in the GOODS-N field. Our sample, identified from the JWST NIRCam Imaging and WFSS data in CONGRESS and FRESCO surveys with either broad H&alpha; emission lines or V-shape continua, are compared to 782 H&alpha; emitters (HAEs) selected from the same data. These AGNs are located in diverse large-scale environments and do not preferentially reside in denser environments compared to HAEs. Their overdensity field, &delta;, averaged over (15 h^-1cMpc)^3, ranges from -0.56 to 10.56, and shows no clear correlation with broad-line luminosity, black hole (BH) masses, or the AGN fraction. It suggests that &gt; 10 cMpc structures do not significantly influence BH growth. We measure the two-point cross-correlation function of AGNs with HAEs, finding a comparable amplitude to that of the HAE auto-correlation. This indicates similar bias parameters and host dark matter halo masses for AGNs and HAEs. The correlation length of field AGNs is 4.26 h^-1cMpc, and 7.66 h^-1cMpc at 3.9 &lt; z &lt; 5 and 5 &lt; z &lt; 6, respectively. We infer a median host dark matter halo mass of log (M_h/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≈ 11.0-11.2 and host stellar masses of log (M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≈ 8.4-8.6 by comparing with the UniverseMachine simulation. Our clustering analysis suggests that low-luminosity AGNs at high redshift reside in normal star-forming galaxies with overmassive BHs. They represent an intrinsically distinct population from luminous quasars and could be a common phase in galaxy evolution.

<p>
We study the evolution of the bar fraction in disc galaxies between 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 4.0 using multi-band coloured images from JWST CEERS. These images were classified by citizen scientists in a new phase of the Galaxy Zoo project called GZ CEERS. Citizen scientists were asked whether a strong or weak bar was visible in the host galaxy. After considering multiple corrections for observational biases, we find that the bar fraction decreases with redshift in our volume-limited sample (n = 398); from 25^+6_-4% at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.0 to 3^+6_-1% at 3.0 &lt; z &lt; 4.0. However, we argue it is appropriate to interpret these fractions as lower limits. Disentangling real changes in the bar fraction from detection biases remains challenging. Nevertheless, we find a significant number of bars up to z = 2.5. This implies that discs are dynamically cool or baryon-dominated, enabling them to host bars. This also suggests that bar-driven secular evolution likely plays an important role at higher redshifts. When we distinguish between strong and weak bars, we find that the weak bar fraction decreases with increasing redshift. In contrast, the strong bar fraction is constant between 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5. This implies that the strong bars found in this work are robust long-lived structures, unless the rate of bar destruction is similar to the rate of bar formation. Finally, our results are consistent with disc instabilities being the dominant mode of bar formation at lower redshifts, while bar formation through interactions and mergers is more common at higher redshifts.

<p> Michael Rowan-Robinson </p>
<p>
In Paper I (Rowan-Robinson 2024), models derived in 2009 to fit mid-infrared (8-24 micron) source counts from the IRAS, ISO and Spitzer missions, were found to provide an excellent fit to deep counts at 7.7-21 mu with JWST, demonstrating that the evolution of dusty star-forming galaxies is well understood. Here the treatment of optical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) is improved and the counts are extended to 5.6 mu and optical wavelengths. The models proved a good fit to the latest, deeper, JWST counts. The models are also extended to radio and X-ray wavelengths. Predicted redshift distributions are given for a range of wavelengths and flux-densities.

We present a spectral stacking analysis of galaxies at z≥6 observed with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We curate a sample of 64 galaxies spanning redshifts z<sub>spec</sub> = 6.0 - 9.4 which have NIRSpec medium resolution data. The stacks achieve sufficient signal-to-noise to measure equivalent widths (EW) and velocity centroids (v_cen) of low-ionization species (LIS) absorption features, transmitted Lyman-alpha (Ly&alpha;) emission, and nebular emission lines. Overall, we find our sample has weaker LIS absorption lines (EW(LIS) ≈ 1 &#8491;), smaller v_cen,LIS ≈ -20 ± 50~ km  s<sup>-1</sup>, and significantly suppressed Ly&alpha; emission (EW(Ly&alpha;) ≈ 5~&#8491;), compared to similar studies undertaken at lower redshift. The weaker LIS absorption may suggest a lower covering fraction of HI and larger escape fraction of ionizing photons from our sample. Additionally, the smaller blueshifted v_cen,LIS indicates less prevalent or weaker outflows in z&gt;6 galaxies. Stacking our sub-sample of Ly&alpha; emitters (LAEs), we find high EW(H&beta;) ≈ 170 ± 4~&#8491; and a detection of nebular C IV emission suggesting higher  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  in LAEs at z&gt;6. This work showcases the enormous potential for stacked JWST spectra revealing properties of galaxies and their diffuse interstellar medium in the epoch of reionization.

<p>
The evolution of dust in core-collapse supernovae (SNe), in general, is poorly constrained owing to a lack of infrared observations after a few years from explosion. Most theories of dust formation in SNe heavily rely only on SN 1987A. In the last two years, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled us to probe the dust evolution in decades-old SNe, such as SN 2004et, SN 2005ip, and SN 1980K. In this paper, we present two decades of dust evolution in SN 2005af, combining early-time infrared observations with Spitzer Space Telescope and recent detections by JWST. We have used a chemical kinetic model of dust synthesis in SN ejecta to develop a template of dust evolution in SN 2005af. Moreover, using this approach, for the first time, we have separately quantified the dust formed in the pre-explosion wind that survived after the explosion, and the dust formed in the metal-rich SN ejecta post-explosion. We report that in SN 2005af, predominantly carbon-rich dust is formed in the ejecta, where the total mass of ejecta dust is about 0.02-0.03 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, while in the circumstellar medium the amount of surviving oxygen-rich dust is 0.001-0.004 M<sub>&odot;</sub>.

### 104) [2504.20164](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20164v1): The H2 Glow of a Quiescent Molecular Cloud Observed with JWST

<p>
We report JWST MIRI/MRS observations of the H2 S(1) 17.04 micron transition in two regions in the boundary of the Taurus Molecular Cloud. The two regions, denoted Edge (near the relatively sharp boundary of the 13CO J=1-0 emission) and Peak (the location of the strongest H2 emission observed with Spitzer), have average intensities of 14.5 MJy/sr and 32.1 MJy/sr, respectively. We find small scale structures of characteristic size 1.0 to 2.5 arcseconds, corresponding to 140 AU to 350 AU, with characteristic intensity above the extended background of 10 MJy/sr, corresponding to a J = 3 column density of 1.6x1017/cm2. The most plausible explanation for the observed intensities from level 845 K above the J = 1 ortho-H2 ground state level is excitation by collisions with H2 molecules (the hydrogen in this region being predominantly molecular). Two mechanisms, turbulent dissipation and shocks, have been proposed for heating of localized regions of the ISM to temperatures ~1000 K to explain abundances of and emission from particular molecules. While we cannot determine unique values of density and kinetic temperature, the solutions in best agreement with predictions of shock models are H2 density = 370 /cm3 and kinetic temperature = 1000 K. The total H2 column density of the small-scale structures under these conditions is ~8x1017/cm2. This first direct detection of heated tiny scale structure in the quiescent molecular interstellar medium has significant implications for the physical structure of this phase of the ISM and maintaining supersonic motions within it.

### 105) [2504.20043](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20043v2): Starlight from JWST: Implications for star formation and dark matter models

<p> John Ellis, Malcolm Fairbairn, Juan Urrutia, Ville Vaskonen </p>
<p>
We confront the star formation rate in different dark matter (DM) models with UV luminosity data from JWST up to z≃25 and legacy data from HST. We find that a transition from a Salpeter population to top-heavy Pop-III stars is likely at z≃10 and that beyond z=10-15 the feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei is progressively reduced, so that at z≃25 the production of stars is almost free from any feedback. We compare fuzzy and warm DM models that suppress small-scale structures with the CDM paradigm, finding that the fuzzy DM mass &gt; 4.5 × 10^-22 eV and the warm DM mass &gt; 1.5  keV at the 95&percnt; CL. The fits of the star formation rate parametrization do not depend strongly on the DM properties within the allowed range. We find no preference over CDM for enhanced matter perturbations associated with axion miniclusters or primordial black holes. The scale of the enhancement of the power spectrum should be &gt; 27 Mpc^-1 at the 95&percnt; CL, excluding axion miniclusters produced for m_a &lt; 7.5 × 10^-17 eV or heavy primordial black holes that constitute a fraction f_PBH &gt; Max[88 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/m_PBH, 10^-4 (m_PBH/10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>)^-0.09] of DM.

### 106) [2504.19696](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19696v1): On the unique evolutionary mechanisms of massive quiescent galaxies in the epoch of reionisation

<p> Harry George Chittenden, Karl Glazebrook, Themiya Nanayakkara, Lalitwadee Kawinwanichakij, Claudia Lagos, Lucas Kimmig, Rhea-Silvia Remus </p>
<p>
We investigate the evolutionary histories of a population of high mass, high redshift, quiescent galaxies in the cosmohydrodynamical simulation Thesan; studying the characteristic properties of their haloes and environments over the epoch of reionisation. Thesan employs a modified version of the Arepo moving-mesh code utilised in IllustrisTNG, whose explicit handling of ionising radiation couples haloes and galaxies with cosmic reionisation. This results in a regime of rapid growth and quenching, producing nine massive quiescent galaxies at z = 5.5, in a 95.5cMpc^3 volume, with no counterpart in IllustrisTNG. We find that the rapid assembly of stellar mass is attributed to smooth accretion of mass onto their haloes in dense environments, particularly from massive neighbouring structures; while these galaxies exhibit fast-growing potential wells hosting massive central black holes. With insignificant merger activity, we find AGN feedback to be the primary source of quenching. We find megaparsec-scale densities and halo masses to continue growing after quenching, suggesting that massive quiescent galaxies will be found in some of the largest haloes and densest regions of space by observations. With an unprecedented plethora of massive quiescent galaxies found in JWST data, these reionisation simulations may provide the paradigm for the evolutionary histories of these galaxies, while constraining the relatively unknown physics of reionisation. Despite the rarity of simulated massive quiescent galaxies, their identification in Thesan enables identification of halo and environmental properties most conducive to their quenching, hopefully guiding future efforts into the study of analogous systems in deep observational surveys and large-volume N-body simulations.

<p> Qing-Bo Ma, Xiao-Rong Chen, Ming Li, Qi Guo, Benedetta Ciardi, Anshuman Acharya, Xin Wang </p>
<p>
We use high resolution N-body dark matter simulations and L-Galaxies semi-analytical galaxy formation models to explore the high-z galaxy properties and estimate the budget of ionizing photons. The parameters within L-Galaxies are obtained using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with high-z galaxy observations from JWST and other telescopes. We consider two versions of L-Galaxies with and without dust correction on galaxy UV luminosities. With the best-fit parameters, both L-Galaxies 2015 and L-Galaxies 2020 reproduce well observations of UV luminosity functions, stellar mass functions, star formation rate densities and ionizing photon emission efficiency. With the assumption of escape fraction of 20&percnt;, all models produce more ionizing photons than the number of Hydrogen atoms in the Universe at z&gt;6. The inclusion of dust correction within MCMC results in higher star formation efficiency, which predicts ~ 50&percnt; more ionizing photons, with better consistency between the predicted stellar mass functions and observations.

### 108) [2504.18820](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18820v2): Potential-Driven Metal Cycling: JADES Census of Gas-Phase Metallicity for galaxies at 1 &lt; z &lt; 7

<p> Cheng Jia, Enci Wang, Cheqiu Lyu, Chengyu Ma, Jie Song, Yangyao Chen, Kai Wang, Haoran Yu, Zeyu Chen, Jinyang Wang, Yifan Wang, Xu Kong </p>
<p>
The gravitational potential is established as a critical determinant of gas-phase metallicity (12+log(O/H)) in low-redshift galaxies, whereas its influence remains unconfirmed at high redshifts. We investigate the correlation between gas-phase metallicity and effective radius (R_e) for a sample of galaxies with redshifts ranging from 1 to 7, drawn from JADES (JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey) Data Release 3. We calculate the metallicities using four strong-line methods: N2S2H&alpha;, R23, N2, and O3N2, respectively. After taking out the evolution of size, we find that the offsets of mass-size relation (&Delta; log R_e) are significantly negatively correlated with the offset of mass-metallicity relation (&Delta; log(O/H)) for the four metallicity tracers. Regardless of the metallicity tracer used, we obtain Spearman rank p-values much less than 0.01, rejecting the null hypothesis that the observed correlation is statistically nonsignificant and attributable to random chance. This is also true for galaxies with z&gt;3, with p-values less than 0.05 for the four metallicity tracers. We for the first time find evidence of size playing a key role in determining gas-phase metallicity towards cosmic dawn, suggesting that the gravitational potential influences their material-exchange processes with the surrounding environment at very early universe.

### 109) [2504.18618](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18618v1): ΛCDM is still not broken: empirical constraints on the star formation efficiency at z ~ 12-30

<p> L. Y. Aaron Yung, Rachel S. Somerville, Kartheik G. Iyer </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope continues to push back the redshift frontier to ever earlier cosmic epochs, with recent announcements of galaxy candidates at redshifts of 15 ≲ z ≲ 30. We leverage the recent GUREFT suite of dissipationless N-body simulations, which were designed for interpreting observations in the high redshift Universe, and provide predictions of dark matter halo mass functions and halo growth rates for a state-of-the-art cosmology over a wide range of halo masses from 6 &lt; z&lt; 30. We combine these results with an empirical framework that maps halo growth rate to galaxy star formation rate and then to rest-frame UV luminosity. We find that even if all of the photometrically selected 15 ≲ z ≲ 30 galaxy candidates are real and actually at these extreme redshifts, there is no fundamental tension with &Lambda;CDM, nor are exotic explanations required. With stellar light-to-mass ratios similar to those in well-studied lower redshift galaxies, our simple model can account for the observed extreme ultra-high redshift populations with star formation efficiencies that peak at values of 20-65 percent. Bursty star formation, or higher light-to-mass ratios such as are expected for lower metallicity stellar populations or a top-heavy Initial Mass Function, would result in even lower required star formation efficiencies, comparable to values predicted by high resolution numerical simulations of high-surface density star forming clouds.

### 110) [2504.18616](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18616v1): Insights on Metal Enrichment and Environmental Effect at z≈5-7 with JWST ASPIRE/EIGER and Chemical Evolution Model

<p>
We present the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) for a parent sample of 604 galaxies at z=5.34-6.94 with [O~sciii] doublets detected, using the deep JWST/NIRCam wide field slitless spectroscopic (WFSS) observations in 26 quasar fields. The sample incorporates the full observations of 25 quasar fields from JWST Cycle 1 GO program ASPIRE and the quasar SDSS J0100+2802 from JWST EIGER program. We identify 204 galaxies residing in overdense structures using friends-of-friends (FoF) algorithm. We estimate the electron temperature of 2.0^+0.3_-0.4×10^4 K from the Hg and [O~sciii]_4363 lines in the stacked spectrum, indicating a metal-poor sample with median gas phase metallicity 12+log(O/H)=7.64^+0.23_-0.11. With the most up-to-date strong line calibration based on NIRSpec observations, we find that the MZR shows a metal enhancement of ~0.2 dex at high mass end in overdense environments. However, compared to the local Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR), our galaxy sample at z&gt;5 shows a metal deficiency of ~0.2 dex relative to FMR predictions. We explain the observed trend of FMR with a simple analytical model, and we favor dilution from intense gas accretion over outflow to explain the metallicity properties at z&gt;5. Those high redshift galaxies are likely in a rapid gas accretion phase when their metal and gas contents are in a non-equilibrium state. According to model predictions, the protocluster members are closer to the gas equilibrium state than field galaxies and thus have higher metallicity and are closer to the local FMR. Our results suggest that the accelerated star formation during protocluster assembly likely plays a key role in shaping the observed MZR and FMR, indicating a potentially earlier onset of metal enrichment in overdense environments at z≈5-7.

### 111) [2504.18006](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18006v1): Do cosmological simulations reproduce the [OIII] 88 μm line emission and properties of JWST-discovered galaxies at z ≥ 12?

<p> Shengqi Yang, Adam Lidz, Hui Li, Gergo Popping, Jorge A. Zavala, Guochao Sun </p>
<p>
Recent ALMA observations of the [OIII] 88 &mu;m line provide spectroscopic confirmation of two JWST photometric candidates, GS-z14 and GHZ2, at z=14.2 and z=12.3, respectively. These discoveries reveal that star formation and chemical enrichment were already underway when the universe was merely 300 Myr old, posing a challenge to galaxy formation models. Here we construct post-processed models for the [OIII] emission lines from galaxies in the state-of-the-art FIRE and IllustrisTNG simulations. Neither simulation suite contains galaxies directly comparable to GS-z14 or GHZ2. However, one simulated FIRE galaxy closely resembles GS-z14 in its star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass, metallicity, [OIII] luminosity and line-width, albeit at z=8.7, lagging GS-z14's formation by roughly 300 Myr. Although further investigation is required, we argue that the lack of simulated galaxies matching GS-z14 and GHZ2 may largely be a consequence of the limited volume of the FIRE simulations and the limited mass resolution of Illustris-TNG. We quantify the prospects for follow-up spectroscopic detections of GS-z14 in the [OIII] 52 &mu;m line with ALMA, and in rest-frame optical [OIII] and Balmer lines with the MIRI instrument on JWST.

### 112) [2504.17254](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17254v1): Efficient simulation of discrete galaxy populations and associated radiation fields during the first billion years

<p> James E. Davies, Andrei Mesinger, Steven Murray </p>
<p>
Understanding the epochs of cosmic dawn and reionisation requires us to leverage multi-wavelength and multi-tracer observations, with each dataset providing a complimentary piece of the puzzle. To interpret such data, we update the public simulation code, 21cmFASTv4, to include a discrete source model based on stochastic sampling of conditional mass functions and semi-empirical galaxy relations. We demonstrate that our new galaxy model, which parametrizes the means and scatters of well-established scaling relations, is flexible enough to characterize very different predictions from hydrodynamic cosmological simulations of high-redshift galaxies. Combining a discrete galaxy population with approximate, efficient radiative transfer allows us to self-consistently forward-model galaxy surveys, line intensity maps (LIMs), and observations of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Not only does each observable probe different scales and physical processes, but cross-correlation will maximise the information gained from each measurement by probing the galaxy-IGM connection at high-redshift. We find that a stochastic source field produces significant shot-noise in 21cm and LIM power spectra. Scatter in galaxy properties can be constrained using UV luminosity functions and/or 21cm power spectra, especially if astrophysical scatter is higher than expected (as might be needed to explain recent JWST observations). Our modelling pipeline is both flexible and computationally efficient, facilitating high-dimensional, multi-tracer, field-level Bayesian inference of cosmology and astrophysics during the first billion years.

<p> N. Galikyan, A. A. Kocharyan, V. G. Gurzadyan </p>
<p>
JWST galaxy deep spectral surveys provide a unique opportunity to trace a broad range of evolutionary features of galaxies and the intergalactic medium given the huge distance the photons are propagating. We have analyzed the spectral data of JWST galaxies up to a redshift of around 7 using the Kolmogorov technique, which is an efficient tool for testing the tiny comparative randomness properties of cumulative signals, that is, for distinguishing the contributions of regular and stochastic sub-signals. Our aim is to determine if certain identical spectral features of galaxies have undergone any distortions or systematic evolution across a broad range of redshifts. Our results indicate a change in the spectral properties of the sample galaxies at around z ≃ 2.7 at over a 99% confidence level.

<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discovered 79 transients out to z~4.8 through the JADES Transient Survey (JTS), but the JTS did not find any z&gt;5 transients. Here, we present the first photometric evidence of a z&gt;5 transient/variable source with JWST. The source, AT 2023adya, resides in a z<sub>spec</sub>=5.274 galaxy in GOODS-N, which dimmed from m_F356W=26.05±0.02 mag to 26.24±0.02 mag in the rest-frame optical over approximately two rest-frame months, producing a clear residual signal in the difference image (m_F356W=28.01±0.17 mag; SN_var=6.09) at the galaxy center. Shorter-wavelength bands (F090W/F115W) show no rest-frame ultraviolet brightness change. Based on its rest-frame V-band absolute magnitude of M_V=-18.48 mag, AT 2023adya could be any core-collapse supernova (SN) subtype or an SN Ia. However, due to low SN Ia rates at high redshift, the SN Ia scenario is unlikely. Alternatively, AT 2023adya may be a variable active galactic nucleus (AGN). However, the JWST NIRCam/Grism spectrum shows no broad H&alpha; emission line (FWHM=130±26 km s<sup>-1</sup>), disfavoring the variable AGN scenario. It is also unlikely that AT 2023adya is a tidal disruption event (TDE) because the TDE models matching the observed brightness changes have low event rates. Although it is not possible to determine AT 2023adya's nature based on the two-epoch single-band photometry alone, this discovery indicates that JWST can push the frontier of transient/variable science past z=5 and towards the epoch of reionization.

<p>
The cluster environment has been shown to affect the molecular gas content of cluster members, yet a complete understanding of this often subtle effect has been hindered due to a lack of detections over the full parameter space of galaxy star formation rates and stellar masses. Here we stack CO(2-1) spectra of z~1.6 cluster galaxies to explore the average molecular gas fractions of galaxies both at lower mass (log(M/solar mass)~9.6) and further below the Star Forming Main Sequence (SFMS; DeltaMS~ -0.9) than other literature studies; this translates to a 3sigma gas mass limit of ~7x10^9 solar masses for stacked galaxies below the SFMS. We divide our sample of 54 z~1.6 cluster galaxies, derived from the Spitzer Adaptation of the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey, into 9 groupings, for which we recover detections in 8. The average gas content of the full cluster galaxy population is similar to coeval field galaxies matched in stellar mass and star formation rate. However, when further split by CO-undetected and CO-detected, we find that galaxies below the SFMS have statistically different gas fractions from the field scaling relations, spanning deficiencies to enhancements from 2sigma below to 3sigma above the expected field gas fractions, respectively. These differences between z=1.6 cluster and field galaxies below the SFMS are likely due to environmental processes, though further investigation of spatially-resolved properties and more robust field scaling relation calibration in this parameter space are required.

### 116) [2504.15357](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15357v1): ALMA reveals bright circumgalactic emission and a biconical outflow in z~6.4 quasar PSOJ183+05

<p> Manuela Bischetti, Chiara Feruglio, Stefano Carniani, Valentina D'Odorico, Francesco Salvestrini, Fabrizio Fiore </p>
<p>
Understanding gas flows between galaxies and their surrounding circum-galactic medium (CGM) is crucial to unveil the mechanisms regulating galaxy evolution, especially in the early Universe. However, observations of the CGM around massive galaxies at z&gt;6 remain limited, particularly in the cold gas phase. In this work, we present multi-configuration ALMA observations of [CII]&lambda;158,&mu;m and millimetre continuum emission in the z~6.4 quasar PSOJ183+05, to trace the cold CGM and investigate the presence of outflows. We find clumpy [CII] emission, tracing gas up to a ~6 kpc radius, consistent with the interface region between the interstellar medium (ISM) and CGM. The [CII] kinematics shows a rotating disk and a high-velocity, biconical outflow extending up to 5 kpc. The inferred mass outflow rate is ~930 MSun/yr, among the highest at z&gt;6, and comparable to the star-formation rate. These findings suggest that quasar-driven outflows can rapidly transfer energy and momentum to the CGM, without immediately quenching star formation in the host galaxy ISM. This supports a delayed feedback scenario, in which outflows reshape CGM conditions and regulate future gas accretion over longer timescales. Combining high-resolution and sensitive ALMA data with observations from JWST and MUSE will be crucial to map the CGM across its different phases and build a comprehensive picture of the baryon cycle in the first massive galaxies.

The dust attenuation of galaxies is highly diverse and closely linked to stellar population properties and the star dust geometry, yet its relationship to galaxy morphology remains poorly understood. We present a study of 141 galaxies (9&lt;log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;11.5) at 1.7&lt;z&lt;3.5 from the Blue Jay survey combining deep JWST/NIRCam imaging and R~1000 JWST/NIRSpec spectra. Using ttProspector to perform a joint analysis of these data with non-parametric star-formation histories and a two-component dust model with flexible attenuation laws, we constrain stellar and nebular properties. We find that the shape and strength of the attenuation law vary systematically with optical dust attenuation (A_V), stellar mass, and star formation rate (SFR). A_V correlates strongly with stellar mass for starbursts, star-forming galaxies and quiescent galaxies. The inclusion of morphological information tightens these correlations: attenuation correlates more strongly with stellar mass and SFR surface densities than with the global quantities. The Balmer decrement-derived nebular attenuation for 67 of these galaxies shows consistent trends with the stellar continuum attenuation. We detect a wavelength-dependent size gradient: massive galaxies (M<sub>&sext;</sub>≳ 10^10~M<sub>&odot;</sub>) appear ~30&percnt; larger in the rest-optical than in the rest-NIR, driven by central dust attenuation that flattens optical light profiles. Lower-mass systems exhibit more diverse size ratios, consistent with either inside-out growth or central starbursts. These results demonstrate that dust attenuation significantly alters observed galaxy structure and highlight the necessity of flexible attenuation models for accurate physical and morphological inference at cosmic noon.

### 118) [2504.15255](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15255v2): Population Models for Star Formation Timescales in Early Galaxies: The First Step Towards Solving Outshining in Star Formation History Inference

JWST have revealed temporarily-quenched and ultraviolet-luminous galaxies in the early universe, suggesting enhanced star formation stochasticity. Verifying this hypothesis is critical, yet challenging; outshining, wherein light from young stars dominates the spectral energy distribution, represents perhaps the greatest challenge in inferring the formation histories of unresolved galaxies. In this paper, we take a simple model of burstiness and show that state-of-the-art inference methods with flexible star formation histories (SFHs) and neutral priors, while recovering average star formation rates (SFRs; ~0.1 dex median offset), fail to recover the complexities of fluctuations on tens of Myr timescales, and typically underestimate masses in bursty systems (~0.15 dex). Surprisingly, detailed SFH recovery is still sensitive to priors even when data quality is optimal, e.g., including high signal-to-noise (20~pixel^-1) spectroscopy with wide coverage (rest-frame 0.12-1.06~&mu;m). Crucially, however, refitting the same data with a prior correctly encoding the bursty expectation eliminates these biases: median offsets in mass and SFRs decrease to ~ 0.04 dex and ~ 0.05 dex, respectively. Under the assumption that current population burstiness predicts past SFH, the solution to outshining in modeling statistical samples is empirically measuring recent galaxy SFHs with population modeling. A prototype is H&alpha;/UV: while helpful, it is insufficient to constrain the expected complex burstiness. To this end, we introduce a more complete, quantitative population-level approach and demonstrate that it promises to recover the typical amplitude, timescale, and slope of the recent SFH to high accuracy. This approach thus has the strong potential to solve outshining using observations from JWST.

<p>
We have discovered a substantial sodium doublet (Na D &lambda;&lambda;5890, 5896&#8491;)-traced neutral outflow in a quenching galaxy JADES-GS-206183 at z=1.317 in GOODS-S field. Its JWST NIRSpec/MSA spectrum shows a significantly blueshifted and deep Na D absorption, revealing a neutral outflow with a velocity of v_out=828^+79_-49 km s<sup>-1</sup> and a mass outflow rate of log(M&#775;_out/M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1)=2.40^+0.11_-0.16. The mass outflow rate of this outflow is higher than any of the neutral outflows identified previously beyond z~1 by the same line diagnostic and is comparable with those in local galaxies with extremely strong star formation activities or luminous AGN. Nonetheless, the best-fit SED modeling of JADES-GS-206183, based on its multi-band photometry from HST/ACS to JWST/NIRCam, suggests that the host galaxy now is quenched, and the Paschen &alpha; (Pa&alpha;) emission in the FRESCO NIRCam grism spectrum confirms its current low star formation rate (10.78± 0.55 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1). More surprisingly, optical line ratio diagnostics indicate that the current AGN activity of JADES-GS-206183, if present, is weak. Even though we tentatively detect a broad component of the H&alpha; line, it is more likely tracing the ionized outflow than an AGN. The results demonstrate that the Na D outflow in JADES-GS-206183 is highly unlikely to be driven by current star formation or nuclear activity. Instead, we propose that the outflow that we are witnessing in JADES-GS-206183 may be a long-lasting fossil outflow, powered by previous AGN activity that has recently shut down.

### 120) [2504.14592](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14592v1): The fate of the progenitors of Luminous Red Novae: Infrared detection of LRNe years after the outburst

<p> A. Reguitti, A. Pastorello, G. Valerin </p>
<p>
We present late-time optical and infrared (IR) observations of a sample of nine extragalactic Luminous Red Novae (LRNe) discovered in the last three decades. In all these cases, the LRN survivors fade below the pre-outburst luminosity of the progenitors in the optical region. Instead, they remain visible in the near-IR (NIR), and bright in the mid-IR (MIR) domains for years. We recover AT 1997bs in Spitzer images from 2004, and a residual source is visible in HST and JWST NIR images 27 years after the outburst. Its spectral energy distribution (SED) is consistent with that of a red supergiant star with a photospheric temperature of 3200 K and a radius of 220 R<sub>&odot;</sub>, without a significant circumstellar dust attenuation, as the source is not detected at 4.5 &mu;m. Another LRN, AT 2011kp, is detected by JWST 12.5 years after the outburst. From its SED, we find evidence for three black-body components: a warm/hot stellar component, a colder component from cool dust at 425 K, emitting between 3 and 6 &mu;m, and a third even colder component responsible for the excess at 8 &mu;m, possibly due to an IR echo. We construct the [3.6]-[4.5] colour curves extending up to +7 years for six LRNe, which show a similar evolution: the MIR colour is ~0 before the optical maximum light, it becomes bluer (~-0.5 mag) at around +1 year, then it gradually turns to redder colours (~+0.5 mag) in the following years, before reaching [3.6]-[4.5]~+1.5 mag 7 years after the outburst. Finally, we also estimate the masses and the temperatures of newly-formed dust years after the LRN onset for different chemical compositions (silicates or graphite) and grain sizes (0.1 or 1.0 &mu;m). We find that LRNe produce dust masses of the order of (0.1-30)×10^-6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> between 3.6 and 13 years after the outbursts, with temperatures in the range from 350 to 770 K.

<p> Manish Kataria, Kanak Saha, Bruce Elmegreen </p>
<p>
Understanding how supermassive black holes (SMBHs) form in the early universe is one of the most challenging problems in astrophysics. Their high abundance in the first billion years, as observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, hints towards black hole seeds that accrete mass rapidly. The origin of this accreted mass is not known. Here, we consider a billion solar mass clumpy galaxy at z=5.48 with a 30 million solar mass black hole in the center. We show that the clumps should migrate to the central region because of torques from dynamical friction with the halo, funneling in at least 14 solar masses per year. This is fast enough to grow the observed SMBH, with only 1% of the accreted mass getting in and the rest going to a bulge. Clump-fed accretion could explain most young SMBHs because young galaxies are highly irregular with massive star-forming clumps.

Robertson, Marko Shuntov, Matthew R. Siebert, Sune Toft, Thomas Wevers, Yossef Zenati </p>
<p>
The rates and properties of tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide valuable insights into their host galaxy central stellar densities and the demographics of their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). TDEs have been observed only at low redshifts (z ≲ 1), due to the difficulty in conducting deep time-domain surveys. In this work, we present the discovery of a high-redshift TDE candidate, HZTDE-1, in the COSMOS-Web survey with JWST's NIRCam, using a novel selection technique based on color and morphology. We first outline a methodology for identifying high-z TDEs in deep infrared imaging surveys, leveraging their unique spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and morphologies of these transients. We apply this technique to COSMOS-Web in filters F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W, and identify HZTDE-1, a transient point source relative to archival UltraVISTA infrared observations. If we assume it is a TDE, we estimate its photometric redshift to be z=5.02^+1.32_-1.11. HZTDE-1 cannot be explained by reasonable supernova or AGN models. However, we cannot rule out a superluminous supernova at z≳3. If confirmed with follow-up observations, HZTDE-1 would represent the highest-redshift TDE discovery to date, and would suggest an enhancement of the TDE rate in the high-redshift universe. Our method, which can be applied to future deep surveys with JWST and Roman, offers a pathway to identify TDEs at z&gt;4 and probe black hole demographics at early cosmic times.

<p>
We present the first results from the CAPERS survey, utilizing PRISM observations with the JWST/NIRSpec MSA in the PRIMER-UDS field. With just 14 % of the total planned data volume, we spectroscopically confirm two new bright galaxies (M_UV~ -20.4) at redshifts z = 10.562±0.034 and z = 11.013±0.028. We examine their physical properties, morphologies, and star formation histories, finding evidence for recent bursting star formation in at least one galaxy thanks to the detection of strong (EW_0~70 A) H&gamma; emission. Combining our findings with previous studies of similarly bright objects at high-z, we further assess the role of stochastic star formation processes in shaping early galaxy populations. Our analysis finds that the majority of bright (M_UV≲ -20) spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at z&gt;10 were likely observed during a starburst episode, characterized by a median SFR_10/SFR_100~2, although with substantial scatter. Our work also finds tentative evidence that z&gt;10 galaxies are more preferentially in a bursting phase than similarly bright z~6 galaxies. We finally discuss the prospects of deeper spectroscopic observations of a statistically significant number of bright galaxies to quantify the true impact of bursting star formation on the evolution of the bright end of the ultraviolet luminosity function at these early epochs.

Approximately half of all disc galaxies exhibit appreciable warps in both their stellar and HI discs. The typical warp amplitude is small (a few degrees), and only becomes noticeable at the periphery of the galaxy disc. As a result, warps remain a relatively poorly studied phenomenon. In this study, we investigate a large sample of distant edge-on galaxies (approximately 1,000 objects) in order to examine the frequency and characteristics of stellar disc warps up to a redshift of z ~ 2. For the selected galaxies, we utilize HST data from the Cosmic Evolution Survey field and JWST observations from the Cosmic Dawn Center Archive. We measured the properties of disc warps and investigate their evolution as a function of redshift. Our results indicate a potential evolution in the observed frequency of strong S-shaped warps (with an amplitude greater than 4&deg;) in stellar discs as a function of redshift. At z ≈ 2, the frequency of strong warps reaches approximately 50%, while at z ≈ 0, this fraction decreases to around 10-15%. We attribute the observed evolution in the occurrence of strong warps to the changing frequency of galaxy interactions and mergers. If galaxy interactions represent one of the primary mechanisms responsible for the formation of warps, then the prevalence of vertical disc deformations should increase in tandem with the rising interaction and merger rate.

<p>
A variety of dust attenuation/extinction curves have been observed in high-redshift galaxies, with mixed results regarding their correlations with global galaxy properties. These variations are likely driven by factors such as intrinsic dust properties, total dust content, and the dust-star geometry. In this work, we explore how the shape of dust attenuation curves-quantified by the UV-optical slope (S) and UV bump strength (B)-correlates with galaxy properties. Our goal is to identify the key physical mechanisms shaping attenuation curves through cosmic time. We build on arXiv:2402.05996, analyzing 173 dusty galaxies at z ~ 2-11.5, with attenuation curves inferred via SED fitting of JWST data using a modified version of BAGPIPES (arXiv:2304.11178). We investigate trends between S, B, and properties inferred from SED fitting: AV, SFR, stellar mass (M<sub>&sext;</sub>), specific SFR (sSFR), mass-weighted stellar age (a*), ionization parameter (U), and metallicity (Z). For a subset, we also consider oxygen abundance (12 + log(O/H)), derived via Te-based methods. We find that lower AV galaxies tend to have steeper slopes and stronger UV bumps, consistent with radiative transfer predictions involving dust geometry and content. S also correlates with a* and sSFR, suggesting that strong radiation fields in young, bursty galaxies may destroy small grains, flattening the slope. B correlates with 12 + log(O/H), possibly due to metallicity-driven dust composition changes. Overall, attenuation curve shapes appear most strongly linked to: (1) redshift (dust evolution), (2) AV (RT effects), (3) a* or sSFR (radiation field), and (4) oxygen abundance (dust composition). Disentangling these effects requires spatially resolved data and theoretical models including dust evolution.

<p> Zeyuan Tang, Frederik G. Doktor, Rijutha Jaganathan, Julianna Palotás, Jos Oomens, Liv Hornekær, Bjørk Hammer </p>
<p>
Studying the anharmonicity in the infrared (IR) spectra of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at elevated temperatures is important to understand vibrational features and chemical properties of interstellar dust, especially in the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) era. We take pyrene as an example PAH and investigate how different degrees of superhydrogenation affects the applicability of the harmonic approximation and the role of temperature in IR spectra of PAHs. This is achieved by comparing theoretical IR spectra generated by classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and experimental IR spectra obtained via gas-phase action spectroscopy which utilizes the Infrared Multiple Photon Dissociation (IRMPD). All simulations are accelerated by a machine learning interatomic potential, in order to reach first principle accuracies while keeping low computational costs. We have found that the harmonic approximation with empirical scaling factors is able to reproduce experimental band profile of pristine and partially superhydrogenated pyrene cations. However, a MD-based anharmonic treatment is mandatory in the case of fully superhydrogenated pyrene cation for matching theory and experiment. In addition, band shifts and broadenings as the temperature increases are investigated in detail. Those findings may aid in the interpretation of JWST observations on the variations in band positions and widths of interstellar dust.

### 127) [2504.11595](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11595v1): Dark Matter Genesis

<p> Jeremy Mould </p>
<p>
Recent discoveries of primordial black hole (PBH) candidates by means of high cadence microlensing open the way to a physical understanding of the formation of dark matter as a chapter in the thermal history of the Universe. Two complementary sites of PBH formation are considered, inflation and the early Universe at TeV to MeV energies. In the latter case the Friedman equation, together with the measurement of the mass of the PBH, reveal the threshold energy, the mass spectrum and the likely end point of this epoch. Some of the many recent exoplanet detections may conceivably have been detections of PBHs. When the Universe cools to MeV temperatures, larger mass PBH would form similarly, reaching the supermassive regime. The discovery of numerous supermassive black holes (SMBH) at high redshift with JWST fulfils this expectation. We corroborate the idea that Planck mass relics could be an important component of dark matter, and find that these are formed by PBH with initial mass less than approximately 6 x 10^-16 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and cosmic temperature above 10^9 GeV. Although in some mass ranges PBH can only make up a modest fraction of &Omega;matter, it is possible that all astrophysical dark matter, as distinct from axions and WIMPs, is of PBH origin.

<p>
Galaxies grow alongside their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs), linked through fueling and feedback. However, the origins and details of this co-evolution remain unclear and differ significantly amongst modeling frameworks. Using a suite of semi-analytic models (SAMs), we trace SMBH mass assembly across M_BH ~ 10^6-10, M<sub>&odot;</sub>. We find significant discrepancies between observations and physics-based models of the local black hole mass function (BHMF), likely due to differences in the underlying stellar mass function and the scaling relations therefrom used to infer the BHMF. However, most physics-based models agree at z ~ 1-4 and align reasonably well with broad-line AGN BHMF from JWST observations at z=4-5. Most physics-based models reproduce the bolometric AGN luminosity evolution, except \sc Dark Sage, which predicts an excess deviating from models and observations. Interestingly, this pronounced "knee' in the bolometric AGN luminosity function predicted by \sc Dark Sage around L_bol ~ 10^46   erg   s<sup>-1</sup> is consistent with the inferred luminosity of "Little Red Dots'' at z=5-6, assuming that their entire emission originates from AGN activity. We analyze black hole mass build-up and accretion histories in \sc Dark Sage, which, unlike other models, allows for super-Eddington accretion. We report that on average, SMBHs in \sc Dark Sage primarily grow through secular disk instabilities and merger-driven cold gas accretion, while black hole mergers contribute 60&percnt; of the total mass budget only for the most massive SMBHs by z=0.

<p>
Extended emission line nebulae around galaxies or active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide a unique window to investigate the galactic ecosystem through the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Using Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam narrow-band imaging and spectroscopic follow-up, we serendipitously discover "Oxyster" - a large ionized nebula next to an interacting starburst galaxy at z=0.924. The nebula is traced by extended [OII]3726,3729 (~ 30 kpc) and [OIII]5007 (~ 20 kpc) emission lines. On the nebula luminosity-size plane, Oxyster surpasses the extended narrow-line regions around low-z AGNs, resembling a higher-z analog of "Hanny's Voorwerp". However, its uniformly low [OIII]/[OII] ratio (O32) sets it apart from typical AGN light echoes. For the host galaxy, HST and JWST images reveal a disturbed red disk galaxy with a single blue spiral "arm". Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting suggests the 2-6× 10^10 ~M<sub>&odot;</sub> host galaxy sits above the star-forming main sequence with an ongoing starburst, especially in the "arm", and have &lt;5&percnt; luminosity contribution from AGN, consistent with X-ray non-detection and radio continuum. Standard photoionization and shock models struggle to explain simultaneously Oxyster's emission line luminosities, low O32 ratio, and the non-detection of H&beta; line. A plausible explanation could involve the combination of a recent (&lt;10^8 yrs) starburst and a low-luminosity AGN (L_bol ~ 1×10^42 erg/s). While Oxyster's nature awaits future investigation, its discovery highlights the potential of ground-based narrow-band imaging to uncover extended emission line nebulae around non-AGN systems, opening new avenues for studying the CGM of normal galaxies in the early Universe.

2MASS J04381486+2611399 (or J0438) is one of the few young brown dwarfs (BD) with a highly inclined (i\!~\!70&deg;) disk. Here we report results from JWST-MIRI MRS, HST-ACS and ALMA Band 7 observations. Despite its late spectral type (M7.25), the spectrum of J0438 resembles those of inner disks around earlier-type stars (K1-M5, T Tauri stars), with a volatile reservoir lacking hydrocarbons (except for acetylene, C_2H<sub>2</sub>) and dominated by water. Other identified species are H<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, HCN, [Ar^+], and [Ne^+]. The dominance of water over hydrocarbons is driven by multiple factors such as disk dynamics, young disk age, low accretion rate and possible inner disk clearing. J0438 appears highly dynamic, showing a seesaw-like variability and extended emission in H<sub>2</sub>     S(1), S(3), S(5), [Ne^+] and CO (J=3-2). Interestingly, the CO emission reaches up to 400 au from the brown dwarf, suggesting ongoing infalling/outflowing activity impacting the disk chemistry. These observations underscore the combined power of JWST, HST and ALMA in characterizing the chemical diversity and dynamics of brown dwarf disks.

### 131) [2504.10731](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10731v1): Unveiling faint X-ray AGN populations in the NewAthena era: Insights from cosmological simulations

<p> Nuno Covas, Israel Matute, Stergios Amarantidis, José Afonso, Giorgio Lanzuisi, Andrea Comastri, Stefano Marchesi, Ciro Pappalardo, Rodrigo Carvajal, Polychronis Papaderos </p>
<p>
Recent observations expanded our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, yet key challenges persist in the X-ray regime, crucial for studying Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). These limitations drive the development of next-generation observatories such as ESA's NewAthena. Now in phase B (preliminary design), the mission requires extensive testing to ensure compliance with its scientific goals, particularly given the uncertainties surrounding high redshift AGN. This work leverages the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation to build an X-ray AGN mock catalogue and assess the performance of NewAthena's WFI. We created a Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH) light cone, spanning 10 deg2, with corrections to account for the limited resolution of the simulation and X-ray properties derived in post-processing. The resulting catalogue reveals a 5* overabundance of faint AGN compared to current X-ray constraints, an inconsistency potentially resolved by invoking a higher Compton-thick (CTK) fraction and intrinsic X-ray weakness, as suggested by recent JWST findings. An end-to-end survey simulation using SIXTE predicts 250000 AGN detections, including 20,000 at z &gt; 3 and 35 in the Epoch of Reionization (z &gt; 6); notably, only AGN with LX &gt; 43.5 erg/s are detectable at z &gt; 6. The analysis also forecasts a significant population of detectable CTK AGN, even beyond z &gt; 4. These findings suggest X-ray observations will, for the first time, probe a significant AGN population in the EoR, offering new insights into SMBH growth. They also provide key input for refining NewAthena's mission design and optimizing its survey strategy.

### 132) [2504.10581](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10581v1): Massive Black Hole Seed Formation in Strong X-ray Environments at High Redshift

<p> Kazutaka Kimura, Kohei Inayoshi, Kazuyuki Omukai </p>
<p>
Direct collapse of pristine gas in early galaxies is a promissing pathway for forming supermassive black holes (BHs) powering active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at the epoch of reionization (EoR). This seeding mechanism requires suppression of molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) cooling during primordial star formation via intense far-ultraviolet radiation from nearby starburst galaxies clustered in overdense regions. However, non-detection of 21 cm signals from the EoR reported by the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) experiment suggests that such galaxies may also emit X-rays more efficiently than in the local universe, promoting H<sub>2</sub> production and thereby potentially quenching massive BH seed formation. In this study, we examine the thermal and chemical evolution of collapsing gas in dark matter halos using a semi-analytic model incorporating observationally calibrated X-ray intensities. We find that strong X-ray irradiation, as suggested by HERA, significantly suppresses direct collapse and leads most halos to experience H<sub>2</sub> cooling. Nevertheless, massive BH seeds with M_BH ≳ 10^4~M<sub>&odot;</sub> still form by z≃ 15, particularly in regions with baryonic streaming motion, and their abundance reaches ~ 10^-4~Mpc^-3 sufficient to explain the SMBHs identified by JWST spectroscopy at 3&lt;z&lt;6. While the formation of highly overmassive BHs with masses comparable to their host galaxies is prohibited by X-ray ionization, our model predicts that BH-to-stellar mass ratios of ≃ 0.01-0.1 were already established at seeding.

### 133) [2504.10572](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10572v1): The Structure and Formation Histories of Low-Mass Quiescent Galaxies in the Abell 2744 Cluster Environment

Suess, Bingjie Wang </p>
<p>
Low-mass quiescent galaxies are thought to predominantly reside in overdense regions, as environmental effects are often invoked to explain their shutdown of star formation. These longer-timescale quenching mechanisms - such as interactions with hot gas in the intracluster medium and dynamical encounters with other cluster galaxies - leave imprints on galaxy morphologies, emphasizing the importance of quantifying the structures of low-mass quiescent galaxies in galaxy clusters at z&lt;0.5. Using spectrophotometric data from the UNCOVER and MegaScience programs, we present the first measurement of the quiescent size-mass relation between 7&lt;log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;10 using JWST imaging, based on a sample of 1100 galaxies in the z=0.308 Abell 2744 galaxy cluster. The resulting size-mass relation is systematically larger and flatter than samples of dwarf galaxies in less-rich environments (low-mass clusters and groups), and has a higher scatter than similar-redshift field samples. Both "progenitor bias," where larger, diskier low-mass galaxies enter the cluster at later epochs, and a general expansion of galaxy structure from dynamical interactions could be at play. This evolutionary framework is further supported by the tentative evidence that older low-mass quiescent galaxies in the cluster are more spheroidal. The star-formation histories derived for our cluster sample imply their formation and quenching occurs relatively late, at z&lt;1.5. In this scenario, the progenitor population would have disky axis-ratio distributions at cosmic noon, in agreement with recent observations. While this leaves ample time for dynamical interactions to maintain quiescence and drive the observed subsequent morphological evolution post-quenching, the data disfavors an onset of quenching due to the environment.

<p> Peter H. Sims, Harry T. J. Bevins, Anastasia Fialkov, Dominic Anstey, Will J. Handley, Stefan Heimersheim, Eloy de Lera Acedo, Rajesh Mondal, Rennan Barkana </p>
<p>
Observations of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) have the potential to answer long-standing questions of astrophysical interest regarding the nature of the first luminous sources and their effects on the intergalactic medium (IGM). We present astrophysical constraints from a Neural Density Estimation-Accelerated Bayesian joint analysis of constraints deriving from Cosmic Microwave Background power spectrum measurements from Planck and SPT, IGM neutral fraction measurements from Lyman-line-based data sets and 21-cm power spectrum upper limits from HERA, LOFAR and the MWA. In the context of the model employed, the data is found to be consistent with galaxies forming from predominantly atomic-cooled hydrogen gas in dark matter halos, with masses M_min ≳ 2.6 × 10^9~M<sub>&odot;</sub> ((1+z)/10)^\frac1 2 at 95% credibility (V_c ≳ 50~km~s<sup>-1</sup>) being the dominant galactic population driving reionization. These galaxies reionize the neutral hydrogen in the IGM over a narrow redshift interval (&Delta; z_re &lt; 1.8 at 95% credibility), with the midpoint of reionization (when the sky-averaged IGM neutral fraction is 50%) constrained to z_50 = 7.16^+0.15_-0.12. Given the parameter posteriors from our joint analysis, we find that the posterior predictive distribution of the global 21-cm signal is reduced in amplitude and shifted to lower redshifts relative to the model prior. We caution, however, that our inferences are model-dependent. Future work incorporating updated, mass-dependent star formation efficiencies in atomic cooling halos, informed by the latest UV luminosity function constraints from the James Webb Space Telescope, promises to refine these inferences further and enhance our understanding of cosmic reionization.

### 135) [2504.08921](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08921v1): The Complete Sample of Available SNe Ia Luminosity Calibrations from the TRGB Observed with either HST or JWST

<p> Siyang Li, Adam G. Riess, Gagandeep S. Anand, Daniel Scolnic, Yukei S. Murakami, Dillon Brout, Erik R. Peterson </p>
<p>
Distance ladders which calibrate the luminosity of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) currently provide the strongest constraints on the local value of H0. Recent studies from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) show good consistency between measurements of SNe Ia host distances. These are calibrated to NGC 4258 using different primary distance indicators (Cepheids, Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB), J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch, and Miras). However, some sub-samples of calibrated SNe Ia employed to measure H0 yield noteworthy differences due to small sample statistics but also due to differences in sample selection. This issue is particularly important for TRGB-derived calibrations owing to the smaller volume they reach compared to Cepheids, reducing sample size and enhancing the size of statistical fluctuations. To mitigate this issue, we compile the largest and complete (as currently available) sample of HST or JWST measurements of the TRGB in the hosts of normal SNe Ia for a total of N=35, 50% larger than the previous largest. Most are present in the literature, and we compile multiple measures when available. We also add 5 SNe Ia hosts from the HST archive not previously published. The full sample together with the Pantheon+ SN catalog gives H0=72.1-73.3 +/- 1.8 km/s/Mpc (depending on methodology), in good agreement with the value of 72.5 +/- 1.5 km/s/Mpc from HST Cepheids in hosts of 42 SNe Ia calibrated by the same anchor, NGC 4258. We trace the difference in the result of H0=70.4 +/- 1.9 km/s/Mpc from Freedman et al. 2025 to 11 hosts not selected for that CCHP compilation (of N=24) which alone yield H0=74.1 km/s/Mpc, 2&sigma; higher than the selected sample. A smaller increase of 0.6 km/s/Mpc comes from a commonly employed correction for peculiar velocities.

### 136) [2504.08879](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08879v1): Is Earendel a Star?: Investigating the Sunrise Arc Using JWST Strong and Weak Gravitational Lensing Analyses

<p> Zachary P. Scofield, M. James Jee, Sangjun Cha, Hyosun Park </p>
<p>
The galaxy cluster WHL J013719.8-08284 at z = 0.566 exhibits a strong-lensing feature known as the Sunrise Arc, which hosts the candidate star Earendel at z ≈ 6.2, the most distant star candidate observed to date. If this object is a star, or a system of a few stars, its apparent magnitude implies both extreme gravitational lensing magnification and unusually high luminosity. This study revisits Earendel's magnification, which, in previous literature, exhibits significant uncertainty across various lens models (2&mu; = 4,000-35,000). We present an improved cluster mass reconstruction and a tighter constraint on Earendel's magnification using a joint strong- and weak-lensing analysis with JWST data. Our strong-lensing mass model, incorporating newly identified multiple-image systems from JWST imaging data and modifying the existing multiple-image assignment scheme, produces a root-mean-square (RMS) lens-plane scatter of less than 0.''3. Additionally, our weak-lensing catalog achieves a source density of ~ 100 galaxies arcmin^-2, providing constraints on the mass profile beyond the strong-lensing regime. In our best-fit model, we estimate the magnification of Earendel to be &mu; = 43-67, significantly lower than previously proposed and thus calling into question its classification as a star.

We present 0.7-3.3 pc resolution mid-infrared (MIR) JWST images at 7.7 &mu;m (F770W) and 21 &mu;m (F2100W) covering the main star-forming regions of two of the closest star-forming low-metallicity dwarf galaxies, NGC6822 and Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM). The images of NGC6822 reveal filaments, edge-brightened bubbles, diffuse emission, and a plethora of point sources. By contrast, most of the MIR emission in WLM is point-like, with a small amount of extended emission. Compared to solar metallicity galaxies, the ratio of 7.7 &mu;m intensity (I_&nu;^F770W), tracing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), to 21 &mu;m intensity (I_&nu;^F2100W), tracing small, warm dust grain emission, is suppressed in these low-metallicity dwarfs. Using ALMA CO(2-1) observations, we find that detected CO intensity versus I_&nu;^F770W at ~2 pc resolution in dwarfs follows a similar relationship to that at solar metallicity and lower resolution, while the CO versus I_&nu;^F2100W relationship in dwarfs lies significantly below that derived from solar metallicity galaxies at lower resolution, suggesting more pronounced destruction of CO molecules at low metallicity. Finally, adding in Local Group L-Band Survey VLA 21 cm HI observations, we find that I_&nu;^F2100W and I_&nu;^F770W vs. total gas ratios are suppressed in NGC6822 and WLM compared to solar metallicity galaxies. In agreement with dust models, the level of suppression appears to be at least partly accounted for by the reduced galaxy-averaged dust-to-gas and PAH-to-dust mass ratios in the dwarfs. Remaining differences are likely due to spatial variations in dust model parameters, which should be an exciting direction for future work in local dwarf galaxies.

<p>
Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is crucial for regulating galaxy evolution. Motivated by observations of broad absorption line winds from rapidly accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs), we introduce the Mistral AGN feedback model, implemented in the Arepo code. Mistral comes in two versions: continuous radial (Mistral-continuous) and stochastic bipolar momentum deposition (Mistral-stochastic). Using the framework of the IllustrisTNG simulations, we explore the effect of Mistral on BH and galaxy properties, through an idealized Milky Way-mass galaxy and cosmological zoom simulations run down to z=2. Unlike standard thermal AGN feedback prescriptions, Mistral generates galaxy-scale winds that mimic outflows driven by BH accretion. Mistral-continuous produces short-lived galactic fountains, and is inefficient at regulating the growth of massive galaxies at z=2. In contrast, Mistral-stochastic efficiently suppresses star formation in massive galaxies, and reproduces the empirical stellar-to-halo mass and (z=0) BH-stellar mass relations. By supporting large-scale (&gt;50 kpc) outflows while simultaneously preventing gas inflows, Mistral-stochastic additionally regulates the cold and hot gas fractions at both galaxy and halo scales. Mistral-stochastic therefore works self-consistently across the halo mass range explored ≤ft(10^12-3×10^13 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), without adopting a SMBH-mass dependent AGN feedback scheme such as the one used in IllustrisTNG. Our model is a promising tool for predicting the impact of radiatively efficient AGN winds on galaxy evolution, and interpreting the growing population of high-redshift galaxies and quasars observed by JWST. This work is part of the "Learning the Universe" collaboration, which aims to infer the physical processes governing the evolution of the Universe.

We report the discovery of 13 broad-line AGNs at z = 5 - 8 from the first 10% data of the JWST Cycle 3 Treasury Program COSMOS-3D. These AGNs are identified by their broad H&alpha; or H&beta; emission lines through the NIRCam grism wide-field slitless spectroscopy. One object at z = 7.646 with broad H&beta; emission has an F444W magnitude of 23.6 mag, making it one of the brightest z &gt; 7.5 broad-line AGNs yet known. Among the 13 AGNs, 10 objects have reddened optical continua with slopes &beta;_opt&gt;0. The remaining three objects have their overall SEDs that resemble those of UV-luminous quasars at similar redshifts, but their &beta;_opt, though negative, are not as blue as those of unobscured quasars. We also obtain MIRI photometry at 7.7-18 &mu;m for two AGNs and place strong constraints on their rest-frame near-IR SED. We find no significant variability in the rest-frame UV by comparing the COSMOS-3D and COSMOS-Web F115W images taken apart by 60 days in the rest-frame. We compute the H&alpha; luminosity functions (LFs) for the broad H&alpha; emitters at z ≈ 5-6 and find a potential redshift evolution when compared with that of the z ≈ 4-5 sample. We also derive the H&beta; LF at z~8 for AGNs and galaxies by combining our sample with those from the literature. The broad H&beta; emitters in this work suggest a number density two orders of magnitude higher than that predicted by the quasar LF based on rest-frame UV-selected samples. As a preview, our work showcases the ability of the COSMOS-3D grism survey to provide a complete view of the properties, growth, and evolution of bright broad-line AGNs at z&gt;5.

Little red dots (LRDs) are a population of red, compact objects discovered by JWST at z&gt;4. At 4&lt;z&lt;8, they are roughly 100 times more abundant than UV-selected quasars. However, their number density is uncertain at z&lt;4 due to the small sky coverage and limited blue wavelength coverage of JWST. We present our ground-based search for LRDs at 2≲ z≲4, combining ultra-deep Hyper Suprime-Cam photometry and various (near-)infrared surveys within a total area of ~3.1 deg<sup>2</sup>. We find that for LRDs with M_5500&lt;-22.5, their number density declines from ~10^-4.5 cMpc^-3 at z&gt;4 to ~10^-5.3 cMpc^-3 at 2.7&lt;z&lt;3.7 and ~10^-5.7 cMpc^-3 at 1.7&lt;z&lt;2.7. We also present the Magellan/FIRE spectrum of our first followed-up candidate, DEEP23-z2LRD1 at z<sub>spec</sub>=2.26, as a proof of concept for our sample selection. Similar to high-redshift LRDs, the spectrum of DEEP23-z2LRD1 exhibits broad H&alpha; emission with FWHM≈2400 km s<sup>-1</sup> and with nearly symmetric narrow H&alpha; absorption. Additionally, DEEP23-z2LRD1 has extremely narrow [OIII] lines with FWHM≈140 km s<sup>-1</sup>, suggesting the presence of an accreting black hole in a low-mass host galaxy. Limited by the angular resolution of ground-based surveys, we emphasize that spectroscopic follow-ups are required to characterize the contamination fraction of this sample and pin down LRD number density at z&lt;4.

### 141) [2504.08028](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08028v1): The Luminosity Function and Clustering of Hα Emitting Galaxies at z≈4-6 from a Complete NIRCam Grism Redshift Survey

Willmer, Chris Willott, Junyu Zhang, Yongda Zhu </p>
<p>
We study the luminosity function (LF) and clustering properties of 888 H&alpha; emitters (HAEs) at 3.75 &lt; z &lt; 6 in the GOODS-N field. The sample, built from JWST CONGRESS and FRESCO NIRCam grism surveys using a novel redshift assignment algorithm, spans ~62 arcmin<sup>2</sup> and reaches L_H&alpha; ~ 10^41.2 erg s<sup>-1</sup>. We identify two prominent filamentary protoclusters at z ≈ 4.41 and z ≈ 5.19, hosting 98 and 144 HAEs, respectively. The observed H&alpha; LFs show similar shallow faint-end slopes for both protocluster and field galaxies at z=3.75-5, and for the protocluster at z=5-6 (&alpha;≈ 1.2 to -1.3). In contrast, the field LF at z=5-6 is much steeper (&alpha;=-1.87_-0.23^+0.30), suggesting that protocluster galaxies at z &gt; 5 are more evolved, resembling those at z=3.75-5. The observed star formation rate density from H&alpha;, integrated down to 0.45 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1, is 0.050^+0.002_-0.003 and 0.046^+0.006_-0.004 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1 Mpc^-3 at z=3.75-5 and z=5-6, with protoclusters contributing ~25% and 55%, respectively. This implies that a large fraction of star formation at z &gt; 4 occurs in protoclusters. We conduct the first star-formation-rate-limited 3D clustering analysis at z &gt; 4. We find the filamentary protocluster geometry flattens the power-law shape of the HAE auto-correlation functions, with slopes much shallower than typically assumed. The auto-correlation function of field HAEs have correlation lengths of r_0 = 4.61^+1.00_-0.68 h^-1 Mpc at z ≈ 4-5 and r_0 = 6.23^+1.68_-1.13 h^-1 Mpc at z=5-6. Comparing the observed correlation functions with the UniverseMachine simulation, we infer the dark matter (sub-)halo masses of HAEs to be log (M_h/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=11.0-11.2 at z≈ 4-6, with a scatter of 0.4 dex.

### 142) [2504.07890](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07890v1): Stupendously Large Primordial Black Holes from the QCD axion

<p> Miguel Faria, Ricardo Z. Ferreira, Fabrizio Rompineve </p>
<p>
The inflationary diffusion of (pseudo-)scalar fields with discrete symmetries can seed the formation of a gas of closed domain walls after inflation, when the distance between degenerate minima in field space is not too far from the inflationary Hubble scale. Primordial black holes (PBHs) can then be formed once sufficiently heavy domain walls re-enter the Hubble sphere. In this scenario, inflation determines a distinctive PBH mass distribution that is rather flat and can thus lead to a sizable total abundance of PBHs, while avoiding some of the downsides of PBH formation from critical collapse. We show that generic QCD axion models, with decay constant close to the inflationary Hubble scale, can yield up to 1&percnt; of the dark matter (DM) today in the form of PBHs, while being compatible with isocurvature constraints from Cosmic Microwave Background observations. This occurs for values of axion decay constants around f_a≃ 10^8~GeV, that is the region targeted by axion helioscopes and partially constrained by astrophysical observations. The resulting PBHs have itstupendously large masses, above 10^11M<sub>&odot;</sub>, and their existence can be probed by Large Scale Structure observations. Larger PBH abundances can be generated by axion-like particles. Alternatively, in scenarios where isocurvature constraints can be relaxed, we find that the totality of the DM can be produced by the QCD axion misalignment mechanism, accompanied by a  O(10^-3) DM fraction in PBHs of masses (10^5-10^6)~M<sub>&odot;</sub>. These can act as seeds for the formation of massive black holes at large redshifts, as suggested by recent JWST observations.

### 143) [2504.07325](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07325v2): Resolved ALMA [CII] 158 micron Observations at Cosmic Noon: ISM Structure and Dynamics of Starbursting QSO SDSSJ1000

<p> Christopher Rooney, Bo Peng, Amit Vishwas, Gordon Stacey, Thomas Nikola, Cody Lamarche, Catie Ball, Carl Ferkinhoff, Drew Brisbin, Steven Hailey-Dunsheath </p>
<p>
We present spatially resolved Alma Band-9 observations of the [CII] 158 &mu;m fine structure line from an optically selected quasar, SDSS J100038.01+020822.4 (J1000), at z=1.8275. By utilizing [OI] 63 &mu;m line observations from Herschel/PACS and constructing a detailed dust SED using Herschel and Spitzer archival imaging data, we show that the [CII] line emission is well explained by a photodissociation region (PDR) model, in which the emission arises from the surfaces of molecular clouds exposed to far-UV radiation fields ~ 5\cdot10^3 times the local interstellar radiation field (G_0). We find a factor of 30 variation in spatially resolved [CII]/Far-IR continuum across the source which is explained by the reduced fraction of cooling via [CII] line emission at such high far-UV field strengths. By matching derived PDR parameters to the observed far-IR line and continuum intensities we derive cloud size-scales and find that typical cloud radii in J1000 are ~3.5 pc perhaps indicating an ISM that is highly fractured due to intense star formation activity. We model the galaxy dynamically and find that the [CII] emission is contained within a compact, dynamically cold disk with v/&sigma;=6.2, consistent with cosmological simulations. We also report the discovery of a companion galaxy to j1000 confirmed by the detection of [CII] and use recently obtained JWST/NirCAM imaging of the system to argue for J1000 being an interacting system. With total stellar mass ~ 1.5 × 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and main-component dynamical mass ≳ 10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, the J1000 system is a progenitor to the most massive galaxies seen in the local Universe.

<p>
We present the HST ACS G800L grism spectroscopy observation of the faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates in the COSMOS field at redshift of 6 selected by the point-source morphology and the photometry drop-off at 8000&#8491;. Among the sample of 7 objects, only one is detected by multiple bands, and has similar shape of spectral energy distribution as the so-called "little red dots'' JWST selected AGN candidates, but our object is 3 magnitude brighter than the JWST sample. We draw the upper limit of the AGN luminosity function &Phi;=1.1× 10^-7Mpc^3 mag^-1 for M_UV=-21 at redshift of 6. The rest of the sample shows inconsistent flux density when comparing magnitudes of HST ACS F814W to the Subaru i-band and z-band magnitudes combined. The HST ACS G800L grism observation shows that this inconsistency cannot be created from an emission line. Therefore, we speculate that these objects are transients with the light curve decay timescale at most 6 years in observed frame.

<p>
We measure galaxy sizes from 2 &lt; z &lt; 10 using COSMOS-Web, the largest-area JWST imaging survey to date, covering ~0.54 deg<sup>2</sup>. We analyze the rest-frame optical (~5000A) size evolution and its scaling relation with stellar mass (R_e&prop; M_*^&alpha;) for star-forming and quiescent galaxies. For star-forming galaxies, the slope &alpha; remains approximately 0.20 at 2 &lt; z &lt; 8, showing no significant evolution over this redshift range. At higher redshifts, the slopes are -0.13 ± 0.15 and 0.37 ± 0.36 for 8 &lt; z &lt; 9 and 9 &lt; z &lt; 10, respectively. At fixed galaxy mass, the size evolution for star-forming galaxies follows R_e &prop; (1+z)^-&beta;, with &beta; = 1.21 ± 0.05. For quiescent galaxies, the slope is steeper &alpha;~ 0.5-0.8 at 2 &lt; z &lt; 5, and &beta;=0.81±0.26. We find that the size-mass relation is consistent between UV and optical at z &lt; 8 for star-forming galaxies. However, we observe a decrease in the slope from UV to optical at z &gt; 8, with a tentative negative slope in the optical at 8 &lt; z &lt; 9, suggesting a complex interplay between intrinsic galaxy properties and observational effects such as dust attenuation. We discuss the ratio between galaxies' half-light radius, and underlying halos' virial radius, R_vir, and find the median value of R_e/R_vir=2.7&percnt;. The star formation rate surface density evolves as log&Sigma;_SFR = (0.20±0.08) z+(-0.65±0.51), and the &Sigma;_SFR-M_* relation remains flat at 2&lt;z&lt;10. Lastly, we identify a threshold in stellar mass surface density log&Sigma;_e~9.5-10  M<sub>&odot;</sub>/kpc<sup>2</sup> marking the transition to compact, quenched galaxies from extended, star-forming progenitors. In summary, our findings show that the extensive COSMOS-Web dataset at z &gt; 3 provides new insights into galaxy size and related properties in the rest-frame optical.

<p>
Highly magnified stars (&mu; &gt; 100) are now outinely identified as transient events at cosmological distances thanks to microlensing by intra-cluster stars near the critical curves of galaxy clusters. Using the  James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in combination with the  Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we outline here an analytical framework that is applied to the Warhol arc (at z=0.94) in the MACS 0416 galaxy cluster (at z=0.396) where over a dozen microlensed stars have been detected to date. This method is general and can be applied to other lensed arcs. Within this lensed galaxy we fit the spatially resolved SED spanned by eight JWST-NIRCam filters combined with three ACS filters, for accurate lensed star predictions in 2D. With this tool we can generate 2D maps of microlensed stars for well resolved arcs in general, including dependence on wavelength and limiting apparent magnitude, for comparison with with planned cadenced campaigns for JWST and Hubble, for constraining directly the IMF and the level of dark matter substructure.

<p> Kana Morokuma-Matsui, Hidenobu Yajima, Makito Abe </p>
<p>
Using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with radiative transfer, we investigate star formation and overdensity (&delta;) in Coma-type cluster progenitors from z=14 to 6. Our simulations reproduce observed M_star-SFR relations and &delta; at these redshifts. We find: (1) protocluster (PC) and mean-density field (MF) galaxies show similar M_star-SFR relations, with PC galaxies extending to higher M_star and SFR. (2) UV-bright PC galaxies (M_UV≲ -20~mag) have &gt;2 mag higher UV attenuation and shallower UV slopes than MF galaxies. (3) &delta; increases with redshift, depending on observational parameters (e.g., &delta;~50 at z=14 to &delta;~3 at z=6 for a search volume of ~3000~cMpc^3 and a limiting magnitude of M_UV=-17~mag). These results indicate that enhanced star formation in PCs is driven by massive galaxy overdensity, not anomalously high specific SFR. While simulated &delta; agrees with observed PC candidates (potential Coma progenitors), some MF galaxies show comparable &delta;. We propose a robust PC identification method using both &delta; and M_star of the most massive member. Critical M_star thresholds for Coma progenitors are estimated (10^7.1 to 10^10.2 M<sub>&odot;</sub> from z=14 to 6). Comparison with JWST observations suggests GS-z14-0 and GS-z14-1, the current highest redshift holders, are likely progenitors of Coma-type clusters.

### 148) [2504.06701](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06701v1): A multi-scale view of the magnetic field morphology in the hot molecular core G31.41+0.31

<p>
Multiscale studies of the morphology and strength of the magnetic field are crucial to properly unveil its role and relative importance in high-mass star and cluster formation. G31.41+0.31 (G31) is a hub-filament system that hosts a high-mass protocluster embedded in a hot molecular core (HMC). G31 is one of the few sources showing a clear hourglass morphology of the magnetic field on scales between 1000 au and a few 100 au in previous interferometric observations. This strongly suggests a field-regulated collapse. To complete the study of the magnetic field properties in this high-mass star-forming region, we carried out observations with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope 850 &mu;m of the polarized dust emission. These observations had a spatial resolution of ~0.2 pc at 3.75 kpc. The aim was to study the magnetic field in the whole cloud and to compare the magnetic field orientation toward the HMC from ~50,000 au to ~260 au scales. The large-scale (~5 pc) orientation of the magnetic field toward the position of the HMC is consistent with that observed at the core (~4,000 au) and circumstellar (~260 au) scales. The self-similarity of the magnetic field orientation at these different scales might arise from the brightest sources in the protocluster, whose collapse is dragging the magnetic field. These sources dominate the gravitational potential and the collapse in the HMC. The cloud-scale magnetic field strength of the G31 hub-filament system, which we estimated using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, is in the range 0.04&ndash;0.09 mG. The magnetic field orientation in the star-forming region shows a bimodal distribution, and it changes from an NW&ndash;SE direction in the north to an E&ndash;W direction in the south [abridged abstract].

Setton, Adi Zitrin </p>
<p>
Environmental quenching &ndash; where interactions with other galaxies and/or the intra-cluster medium (ICM) suppress star formation in low-mass galaxies &ndash; has long been proposed as the primary driver to establish the red sequence for low-mass galaxies within clusters at low redshift (z&lt;1). However, we still do not know whether these environmental quenching mechanisms are also active at higher redshifts in proto-cluster environments that have yet to fully virialize. In large part, this regime has remained unexplored due to observational limitations; however, the James Webb Space Telescope has recently opened a new window into the role of environmental quenching on low-mass (log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;9.5) galaxies at cosmic noon (2 &lt; z &lt; 3). Here, we use data from the JWST UNCOVER and MegaScience programs to directly probe the role of environmental quenching on low-mass galaxies in a newly-discovered z≈ 2.6 overdensity. Leveraging the deep imaging and R ~ 15 spectrophotometry enabled by these JWST/NIRCam data, we analyze the stellar populations and inferred star formation histories (SFHs) of 20 low-mass (8.5&lt;log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≤9.0) quiescent galaxies in the overdense environment and compare to a similar sample of 18 such galaxies in the field. The SFHs of quiescent galaxies in the proto-cluster and field across the entire probed stellar mass regime (8.5&lt;log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≤11.0) are indistinguishable, demonstrating that the environment at cosmic noon is not yet accelerating quenching compared to the field. This is consistent with expectations that proto-clusters at z&gt;2 have yet to virialize and develop a dense enough environment to efficiently quench low-mass galaxies.

### 150) [2504.06252](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06252v2): A systematic method to identify runaways from star clusters produced from single-binary interactions: A case study of M67

<p>
One hypothesis for runaway stars (RSs) is that they are ejected from star clusters with high velocities relative to the cluster center-of-mass motion. There are two competing mechanisms for their production: supernova-based ejections in binaries, where one companion explodes, leaves no remnant, and launches the other companion at the instantaneous orbital velocity, and the disintegration of triples (or higher-order multiples), which produces a recoiled runaway binary (RB) and an RS. We search for RS candidates using data from the Gaia DR3 survey with a focus on triple disintegration since in this case the product is always a binary and a single star that should be moving in opposite directions. We created a systematic methodology to look for candidate RS-RB runaway pairs produced from the disintegration of bound three-body systems formed from single-binary interactions based on momentum conservation and causality. The method we use is general and can be applied to any cluster with a 5D kinematic data set. We used our criteria to search for these pairs in a 150 pc circular field of view surrounding the open cluster M67, which we used as a benchmark cluster to test the robustness of our method. Our results reveal only one RS-RB pair that is consistent with all of our selection criteria out of an initial sample of 10^8 pairs.

<p>
Photodissociation Regions (PDRs) are key to understanding the feedback processes that shape interstellar matter in galaxies. One important type of PDR is the interface between HII regions and molecular clouds, where far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation from massive stars heats gas and dissociates molecules. Photochemical models predict that the C/CO transition occurs deeper in the PDR compared to the H/H2 transition in low-metallicity environments, increasing the extent of CO-dark H2 gas. This prediction has been difficult to test outside the Milky Way due to the lack of high spatial resolution observations tracing H2 and CO. This study examines a low-metallicity PDR in the N13 region of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) where we spatially resolve the ionization front, the H2 dissociation front, and the C/CO transition using 12CO J=2-1, 3-2 and [CI] (1-0) observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-mm Array (ALMA) and near-infrared spectroscopy of H2 vibrational lines from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Our analysis shows that the separation between the H/H2 and C/CO boundaries is approximately 0.043 +- 0.013(stat.) +- 0.0036(syst.) pc (equivalent to 0."146 +- 0."042 (stat.) +- 0."012 (syst.) at the SMC's distance of 62 kpc), defining the spatial extent of the CO-dark H2 region. Compared to our plane-parallel PDR models, we find that a constant pressure model matches the observed structure better than a constant density one. Overall, we find that the PDR model does well at predicting the extent of the CO-dark H2 layer in N13. This study represents the first resolved benchmark for low metallicity PDRs.

We designed customized Lyman-break color selection techniques to identify galaxy candidates in the redshift ranges 15 ≤ z ≤ 20 and 20 ≤ z ≤ 28. The selection was performed on the ASTRODEEP-JWST multi-band catalogs of the CEERS, Abell-2744, JADES, NGDEEP, and PRIMER survey fields, covering a total area of ~0.2 sq. deg. We identify nine candidates at 15 ≤ z ≤ 20, while no objects are found based on the z≳20 color selection criteria. Despite exhibiting a &gt;1.5 mag break, all the objects display multimodal redshift probability distributions across different SED-fitting codes and methodologies. The alternative solutions correspond to poorly understood populations of low-mass quiescent or dusty galaxies at z~3-7. This conclusion is supported by the analysis of a NIRSpec spectrum recently acquired by the CAPERS program for one interloper object, which is confirmed to be a dusty (E(B-V)=0.8 mag) starburst galaxy at z=6.56. We measured the UV luminosity function under different assumptions on the contamination level within our sample. We find that if even a fraction of the candidates is indeed at z≳15, the resulting UV LF points to a very mild evolution compared to estimates at z&lt;15, implying a significant tension with existing theoretical models. In particular, confirming our bright (M_UV&lt;-21) candidates would require substantial revisions to the theoretical framework. In turn, if all these candidates will be confirmed to be interlopers, we conclude that future surveys may need ten times wider areas to select M_UV≲-20 galaxies at z&gt;15. Observations in the F150W and F200W filters at depths comparable to those in the NIRCam LW bands are also required to mitigate contamination from rare red objects at z≲8.

<p>
Specifically selected to leverage the unique ultraviolet capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope, the Hubble Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) is a Director's Discretionary program of approximately 1000 orbits - the largest ever executed - that produced a UV spectroscopic library of O and B stars in nearby low metallicity galaxies and accreting low mass stars in the Milky Way. Observations from ULLYSES combined with archival spectra uniformly sample the fundamental astrophysical parameter space for each mass regime, including spectral type, luminosity class, and metallicity for massive stars, and the mass, age, and disk accretion rate for low-mass stars. The ULLYSES spectral library of massive stars will be critical to characterize how massive stars evolve at different metallicities; to advance our understanding of the production of ionizing photons, and thus of galaxy evolution and the re-ionization of the Universe; and to provide the templates necessary for the synthesis of integrated stellar populations. The massive star spectra are also transforming our understanding of the interstellar and circumgalactic media of low metallicity galaxies. On the low-mass end, UV spectra of T Tauri stars contain a plethora of diagnostics of accretion, winds, and the warm disk surface. These diagnostics are crucial for evaluating disk evolution and provide important input to assess atmospheric escape of planets and to interpret powerful probes of disk chemistry, as observed with ALMA and JWST. In this paper we motivate the design of the program, describe the observing strategy and target selection, and present initial results.

<p>
Power spectra (PS) of high-resolution images of M51 (NGC 5194) taken with the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope have been examined for evidence of disk thickness in the form of a change in slope between large scales, which map two-dimensional correlated structures, and small scales, which map three-dimensional correlated structures. Such a slope change is observed here in H-alpha, and possibly Pa-alpha, using average PS of azimuthal intensity scans that avoid bright peaks. The physical scale of the slope change occurs at ~120 pc and ~170 pc for these two transitions, respectively. A radial dependence in the shape of the H-alpha PS also suggests that the length scale drops from ~180 pc at 5 kpc, to ~90 pc at 2 kpc, to ~25 pc in the central ~kpc. We interpret these lengths as comparable to the thicknesses of the star-forming disk traced by HII regions. The corresponding emission measure is ~100 times larger than what is expected from the diffuse ionized gas. PS of JWST Mid-IR Instrument (MIRI) images in 8 passbands have more gradual changes in slope, making it difficult to determine a specific value of the thickness for this emission.

### 155) [2504.05244](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05244v1): Behind the Spotlight: A systematic assessment of outshining using NIRCam medium-bands in the JADES Origins Field

<p>
The spatial resolution and sensitivity of JWST's NIRCam instrument has revolutionised our ability to probe the internal structure of early galaxies. By leveraging deep medium-band imaging in the Jades Origins Field, we assemble comprehensive spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using 19 photometric bands for over 200 high-redshift galaxies (z ≥ 4.5). We present an analysis of this sample with particular emphasis on investigating the "outshining" phenomenon, which can bias the inferred stellar populations by masking the presence of evolved stellar populations (≥ 100 Myr) with the light of bright, young O and B-type stars. We address this problem by performing spatially-resolved SED-fitting of both binned and full pixel-by-pixel photometry, which we compare to the traditional integrated approach. We find evidence for systematic underestimation of stellar mass in low-mass galaxies (≤ 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) with bursty star formation, which can exceed a factor of 10 in individual cases, but on average is typically a factor of 1.25-2.5, depending on the binning methodology and SFH model used. The observed mass offset correlates with burstiness (SFR_10  Myr/SFR_100  Myr) and sSFR, such that galaxies with recently rising SFHs have larger mass offsets. The integrated SFH models which produce the most consistent stellar masses are the double power-law and non-parametric `continuity' models, although no integrated model fully reproduces all resolved SFHs. We apply an outshining correction factor to the Stellar Mass Function at z=7, finding little impact within the uncertainties. We conclude that outshining can be important in individual low-mass galaxies, but the overall impact is limited and should be considered alongside other systematic SED fitting effects.

### 156) [2504.04683](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04683v1): Probing the Cosmic Reionization History with JWST: Gunn-Peterson and Lyα Damping Wing Absorption at 4.5 &lt; z &lt; 13

<p> Hiroya Umeda, Masami Ouchi, Yuta Kageura, Yuichi Harikane, Minami Nakane, Tran Thi Thai, Kimihiko Nakajima </p>
<p>
We present a statistical analysis of Ly&alpha; absorption using 581 galaxies at z=4.5-13 observed with multiple JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy programs, including JADES, UNCOVER, CEERS, and GO/DDT. We carefully construct composite spectra binned by redshift with homogeneous UV properties (UV magnitudes, UV slopes, and Ly&alpha; equivalent widths) and identify significant Ly&alpha; forest signals in galaxies at z~5-6, which diminish toward higher redshifts. We also find UV continuum breaks at rest-frame 1216&#8491; that soften beyond z≳6, confirming the effects of cosmic reionization through a self-consistent transition from Gunn-Peterson to Ly&alpha; damping wing absorption in galaxies. Fair comparisons of composite spectra with matched UV magnitudes and slopes across redshift reveal that UV-faint galaxies clearly show stronger Ly&alpha; absorption than UV-bright galaxies towards high redshift, providing insights into the topological evolution of reionization. We estimate Ly&alpha; transmission at the Gunn-Peterson trough and Ly&alpha; damping wing absorption by comparing the galaxy spectra to low-z (z~2-5) galaxy templates that include galactic and circumgalactic absorption and Ly&alpha; emission. Using these measurements together with reionization simulations, we derive volume average neutral hydrogen fractions of &langle; x_HI &rangle; = 0.00^+0.12_-0.00, 0.25^+0.10_-0.20, 0.65^+0.27_-0.35, 1.00^+0.00_-0.20, and 1.00^+0.00_-0.40 at z~5, 6, 7, 9, and 10, respectively. These values align with a reionization history characterized by a rapid transition around z~7-8, consistent with Ly&alpha; emitter observations. While the physical driver of this rapid reionization remains unclear, it may involve the emergence of hidden AGN populations and/or the onset of Lyman-continuum escape from galaxies.

### 157) [2504.03839](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03839v1): MARTA: Temperature-temperature relationships and strong-line metallicity calibrations from multiple auroral lines detections at cosmic noon

Chakraborty, M. Cirasuolo, F. Cullen, C. Kobayashi, N. Kumari, R. Maiolino, C. Marconcini, M. Scialpi, L. Ulivi </p>
<p>
We present the first results from MARTA (Measuring Abundances at high Redshift with the T_e Approach), a programme leveraging ultra-deep, medium-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy to probe the interstellar medium (ISM) of star-forming galaxies at z ~ 2 - 3. We report detections of one or more auroral lines, including [O III]&lambda;4363, [O II]&lambda;&lambda;7320,7330, [S II] &lambda;4068, and [S III] &lambda;6312 for 16 galaxies in the sample, providing measurements of multiple ionic temperatures. We tested the validity of the T[O II]-T[O III] relation at high redshift considering a total sample of 21 objects including literature data, and obtained a shallower slope than in the low-z literature. However, such a slope is consistent with low-redshift data when ultra-low metallicity objects are considered. We assessed the correlation of the T[O II]-T[O III] relationship and its scatter on different physical parameters, finding a mild correlation with the ionisation parameter and radiation field hardness, while no significant correlation with gas density. The location of high-redshift data is also consistent with the low-z literature in the T[O II]-T[S II], and T[S III]-T[O III] relations, although this conclusion is limited with low-number statistics. Finally, we leveraged our sample together with a comprehensive compilation of galaxies with [O III]&lambda;4363 detections from the literature to recalibrate classical strong-line diagnostics at high redshift. MARTA represents a key addition in this space because it provides direct metallicities at moderately high oxygen abundances (12+log(O/H) ~8.0-8.4).

Rowland, Mauro Stefanon, Yuma Sugahara, Joris Witstok, Paul P. van der Werf </p>
<p>
We present results of new observations of [OI]145um and [NII]205um emission lines from four star-forming galaxies at redshifts between z=6.58 and 7.68 that have previous detections of \Ciium and dust continua. Using ALMA, we successfully detect [OI]145um emission from all targets at &gt;4 &sigma; significance. However, [NII]205um emission is undetected in all galaxies (SNR &lt;3.5 &sigma;) except for a tentative detection from A1689-zD1. From the observed high [CII]/[NII] emission line ratios (≳20 - 80), we find that most of the [CII]158um emission arise from neutral gas regions (3 &sigma; lower limits of ≳ 74 - 96&percnt;). From [OI]145um, [CII]158um lines, and infrared luminosities, we estimate the neutral gas densities of n_H=10^3.5 - 10^6 cm^-3 and the far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation strengths of G_0~10^2.5-10^3. While the neutral gas densities are similar to those of high-redshift starburst galaxies, the FUV strengths are lower compared to both local and high-redshift starbursts. Finally, we estimate atomic hydrogen masses using [OI]145um emission lines and the oxygen abundances measured from recent JWST observations. We find gas mass ratios of f_gas~0.3 - 0.8, which are similar to earlier studies using [CII]158um. Starting from this pilot observation, future large [OI]145um emission line surveys will provide us with currently little-known neutral gas properties of star-forming galaxies in the early Universe.

<p>
We present the discovery, and initial lensing analysis, of a high-redshift galaxy-galaxy lensing system within the JWST-PEARLS/HST-TREASUREHUNT North Ecliptic Pole Time Domain Field (designated NEPJ172238.9+655143.1). The lensing geometry shears a z=3.6±0.1 star-forming galaxy into a near-Einstein ring with a radius of 0\farcs92, consisting of 4 primary images, around a foreground massive elliptical galaxy at z=1.258±0.005. The system is fortuitously located within the NIRISS F200W footprint of the PEARLS survey, enabling spectroscopic identification of the 8500A TiO band in the foreground galaxy and allowing tight constraints to be placed on the redshift of the background galaxy based on its continuum detection and lack of strong emission lines. We calculate magnification factors of 2.6&lt;&mu;&lt;8.4 for the four images and a total lensing mass of (4.08 ± 0.07)×10^11M<sub>&odot;</sub>. SED fitting of the foreground elliptical galaxy within the Einstein radius reveals a stellar mass of ~1.26×10^11M<sub>&odot;</sub>, providing a mass/light ratio of 3.24. Employing simple scaling relations and assumptions, an NFW dark matter halo is found to provide the correct remaining mass within 0.12^+0.21_-0.09dex. However, if a bottom-heavy IMF for elliptical galaxies is employed, stellar mass estimations increase and can account for the majority of the lensing mass (up to ~83&percnt;), reducing the need for dark matter. This system further demonstrates the new discovery space that the combined wavelength coverage, sensitivity and resolution of JWST now enables.

<p>
The depth and coverage of the first years of JWST observations have revealed low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) across a wide redshift range, shedding light on black hole (BH) assembly and feedback. We present our spectroscopic sample of 34 Type 1 AGN obtained from JADES survey data and spanning 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 9. Our sample of AGN probes a BH mass range of 10^6-9~M<sub>&odot;</sub> at bolometric luminosities down to 10^43~erg~s<sup>-1</sup>, implying generally sub-Eddington ratios of &lt;0.5L_Edd. Most of these AGN are hosted in low mass (M<sub>&sext;</sub>~10^8~M<sub>&odot;</sub>) galaxies and are overmassive relative to the local M_BH-M<sub>&sext;</sub> relation, while remaining consistent with the local M_BH-&sigma;_* relation. The wide redshift range provided by our sample allows us to trace the emergence of local M_BH-M_* scaling relation across the cosmic epoch. Additionally, we explore the capability of narrow-line diagnostics in identifying Type 2 AGN and find that a significant fraction of our AGN would be missed by them due to low metallicity or lack of high energy ionizing photons (potentially due to dust absorption, dense gas blanketing the broad and narrow line regions, or intrinsically soft ionizing spectra). We explore the UV luminosity function of AGN and their hosts and find that it is subject to significant cosmic variance and is also dependent on the AGN bolometric luminosity. Finally, we show that the electron and Balmer scattering scenarios recently proposed to explain the broad components of the Balmer lines are untenable on multiple grounds. There is no evidence that the black hole masses have been overestimated by orders of magnitude as proposed in those scenarios.

### 161) [2504.03384](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03384v1): Capturing Small-Scale Reionization Physics: A Sub-Grid Model for Photon Sinks with SCRIPT

<p> Tirthankar Roy Choudhury, Anirban Chakraborty </p>
<p>
The epoch of reionization represents a major phase transition in cosmic history, during which the first luminous sources ionized the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, the small-scale physics governing ionizing photon sinks - particularly the interplay between recombinations, photon propagation, and self-shielded regions - remains poorly understood. Accurately modeling these processes requires a framework that self-consistently links ionizing emissivity, the clumping factor, mean free path, and photoionization rate. In this work, we extend the photon-conserving semi-numerical framework, SCRIPT, by introducing a self-consistent sub-grid model that dynamically connects these quantities to the underlying density field, enabling a more realistic treatment of inhomogeneous recombinations and photon sinks. We validate our model against a comprehensive set of observational constraints, including the UV luminosity function from HST and JWST, CMB optical depth from Planck, and Lyman-&alpha; forest measurements of the IGM temperature, photoionization rate, and mean free path. Our fiducial model also successfully reproduces Lyman-&alpha; opacity fluctuations, reinforcing its ability to capture large-scale inhomogeneities in the reionization process. Notably, we demonstrate that traditionally independent parameters, such as the clumping factor and mean free path, are strongly correlated, with implications for the timing, morphology, and thermal evolution of reionization. Looking ahead, we will extend this framework to include machine learning-based parameter inference. With upcoming 21cm experiments poised to provide unprecedented insights, SCRIPT offers a powerful computational tool for interpreting high-redshift observations and refining our understanding of the last major phase transition in the universe.

We propose a deep learning model that can detect Spitzer bubbles accurately using two-wavelength near-infrared data acquired by the Spitzer Space Telescope and JWST. The model is based on the Single Shot MultiBox Detector as an object detection model, trained and validated using Spitzer bubbles identified by the Milky Way Project (MWP-Bubble). We found that using only MWP-Bubbles with clear structures, along with normalization and data augmentation, significantly improved performance. To reduce the dataset bias, we also use the data without bubbles in the dataset selected by combining two techniques: negative sampling and clustering. The model was optimized by hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian optimization. Applying this model to a test region of the Galactic plane resulted in a 98 &percnt; detection rate for MWP-Bubbles with 8 &mu; m emission clearly encompassing 24 &mu; m emission. Additionally, we applied the model to a broader area of 1&deg; ≤ |l| ≤ 65&deg;, |b| ≤ 1&deg;, including both training and validation regions, and the model detected 3,006 bubbles, of which 1,413 were newly detected. We also attempted to detect bubbles in the high-mass star-forming region Cygnus X, as well as in the external galaxies Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and NGC 628. The model successfully detected Spitzer bubbles in these external galaxies, though it also detected Mira-type variable stars and other compact sources that can be difficult to distinguish from Spitzer bubbles. The detection process takes only a few hours, demonstrating the efficiency in detecting bubble structures. Furthermore, the method used for detecting Spitzer bubbles was applied to detect shell-like structures observable only in the 8 &mu; m emission band, leading to the detection of 469 shell-like structures in the LMC and 143 in NGC 628.

### 163) [2504.03156](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03156v1): Comprehensive JWST+ALMA Study on the Extended Lyα Emitters, Himiko and CR7 at z~ 7: Blue Major Merger Systems in Stark Contrast to Submillimeter Galaxies

<p>
We present various properties of two bright extended Ly&alpha; objects, Himiko and CR7, at z=6.6 thoroughly investigated with JWST/NIRCam photometry, NIRSpec-IFU spectroscopy, and ALMA data, uncovering their physical origins. Himiko (CR7) shows at least five (four) clumps with small separations of 2.4&ndash;7.3 kpc and velocity offsets of &Delta; v&lt;220~km~s<sup>-1</sup> in the [OIII]&lambda;&lambda;4959,5007 line maps, three of which exhibit stellar components with comparable stellar masses ranging in log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=8.4&ndash;9.0 (8.3&ndash;8.8), indicative of major merger systems that are consistent with our numerical simulations. The [CII]158&mu;m and Ly&alpha; lines are found in the middle of two clumps (the brightest clump) in Himiko (CR7), suggesting that the distribution of neutral gas does not always coincide with that of ionized gas or stars in merging processes. We find that some of the clumps have broad [OIII] components (250&ndash;400~km~s<sup>-1</sup>) in Himiko and CR7, likely tracing outflow and tidal features, while the central clump in Himiko presents a broad H&alpha; (~1000~km~s<sup>-1</sup>) line explained by an AGN with a low mass black hole of M_BH=10^6.6~M<sub>&odot;</sub>, which contribute to the extended and bright nature of Himiko and CR7. We find low metallicities of 12+log(O/H)=7.9&ndash;8.1 in Himiko and CR7 based on auroral [OIII]&lambda;4363 and strong lines that are consistent with no 1-mm continuum detection corresponding to the dust mass limits of M_dust≲ 9× 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Himiko and CR7 are metal- and dust-poor blue merger systems with stellar and dust masses ≳2 orders of magnitude smaller than the massive dust-rich merger systems represented by submillimeter galaxies.

### 164) [2504.02683](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02683v1): Probing patchy reionisation with JWST: IGM opacity constraints from the Lyman-α forest of galaxies in legacy extragalactic fields

<p> Romain A. Meyer, Guido Roberts-Borsani, Pascal Oesch, Richard S. Ellis </p>
<p>
We present the first characterization of the Gunn-Peterson trough in high-redshift galaxies using public JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy. This enables us to derive the first galaxy-based IGM opacity measurements at the end of reionisation. Using galaxy spectra has several advantages over quasar spectra: it enables measurements of the IGM opacity in any extragalactic field over a continuous redshift range 4≲ z≲ 7, as well as measurements of the intrinsic Lyman-&beta; opacity. Our novel constraints are in good agreement with state-of-the-art ground-based quasar Lyman-&alpha; forest observations, and will become competitive as the number of JWST z&gt;5 galaxy spectra rapidly increases. We also provide the first constraints on the uncontaminated Lyman-&beta; opacity at 5&lt;z&lt;6. Finally, we demonstrate the power of JWST to connect the ionisation state of the IGM to the sources of reionisation in a single extragalactic field. We show that a previously reported galaxy overdensity and an excess of Lyman-&alpha; emitters detected with JWST in GOODS-South at z=5.8-5.9 coincides with an anomalously low IGM opacity to Lyman-&alpha; at this redshift. The local photo-ionisation rate excess can be fully accounted for by the cumulative ionising output of M_UV≲ -10 galaxies in the overdensity, provided they have log_10&langle;  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  f<sub>esc</sub> /  [erg^-1 Hz]&rangle; = 24.7 (or equivalently log_10 &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  /  [erg^-1 Hz]=25.4 and f<sub>esc</sub>=20&percnt;). Overall, this breakthrough offers a new way to connect the galaxy large-scale structure to the state of the IGM, potentially enabling us to precisely identify the sources of reionisation.

### 165) [2504.02538](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02538v2): Detection of Deuterated Hydrocarbon Nanoparticles in the Whirlpool Galaxy, M51

<p>
Deuteration of hydrocarbon material, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), has been proposed to account for the low gas-phase abundances of D in the interstellar medium. JWST spectra of four star-forming regions in M51 show an emission feature, with central wavelength ~4.647&mu;m and FWHM 0.0265&mu;m, corresponding to the C-D stretching mode in aliphatic hydrocarbons. The emitting aliphatic material is estimated to have (D/H)_aliph≈ 0.17±0.02 &ndash; a factor ~10^4 enrichment relative to the overall interstellar medium (ISM). On ~50 pc scales, deuteration levels toward four H II regions in M51 are 2-3 times higher than in the Orion Bar photodissociation region (PDR), with implications for the processes responsible for the formation and evolution of hydrocarbon nanoparticles, including PAHs. The deuteration of the aliphatic material is found to anticorrelate with helium ionization in the associated H II, suggesting that harsh FUV radiation may act to lower the deuteration of aliphatics in PDRs near massive stars. No evidence is found for deuteration of aromatic material, with (D/H)_arom ≲ 0.016: deuteration of the aliphatic material exceeds that of the aromatic material by at least a factor 10. The observed levels of deuteration may account for the depletion of D observed in the Galactic interstellar medium. If so, the 4.65&mu;m feature may be detectable in absorption.

### 166) [2504.02305](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02305v1): Nuclear Winds Drive Large-Scale Cold Gas Outflows in Quasars during the Reionization Epoch

<p>
Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) regulate the evolution of their host galaxies through powerful outflows and multi-phase feedback. This process plays a crucial role in shaping SMBH-galaxy co-evolution across cosmic time, but direct evidence linking nuclear winds to large-scale cold gas outflows, particularly in high-redshift quasars, has remained elusive. Here we present statistical evidence of a connection between nuclear winds and large-scale cold gas outflows in quasars at z ~ 5.5. Using stacked [C II] 158 &mu;m emission profiles from ALMA observations, which trace galactic-scale neutral gas, we compare broad absorption line (BAL) quasars &ndash; tracing parsec- to sub-kiloparsec-scale nuclear winds &ndash; with non-BAL quasars. The BAL stack reveals a significant (S/N=4.45) broad component in the [C II] emission, indicating high-velocity neutral gas outflows with a velocity offset of &Delta; v_b = -2.1 × 10^2   km s<sup>-1</sup> and a full width at half maximum of 1.18 × 10^3   km s<sup>-1</sup>, while the non-BAL stack shows no such feature. We estimate that a few percent up to one-quarter of the BAL wind energy is transferred to neutral gas on kiloparsec scales. These findings provide direct observational evidence that nuclear winds couple with galactic-scale neutral gas flows, supporting multi-phase AGN feedback models. This mechanism may contribute to explaining the diversity of M_BH/M_* ratios observed in some luminous AGN recently observed by JWST, compared to the Magorrian relation.

### 167) [2504.02136](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02136v1): Mid-infrared extinction curve for protostellar envelopes from JWST-detected embedded jet emission: the case of TMC1A

<p>
Context: Dust grains are key components of the interstellar medium and play a central role in star formation, acting as catalysts for chemical reactions and as building blocks of planets. Extinction curves are essential for characterizing dust properties, but mid-infrared (MIR) extinction remains less constrained in protostellar environments. Gas-phase line ratios from embedded protostellar jets provide a spatially resolved method for probing extinction through protostellar envelopes, complementing background starlight approaches. Aims: We aim to derive MIR extinction curves along sightlines toward a protostellar jet embedded in an envelope and assess whether they differ from those in dense molecular clouds. Methods: We analyze JWST NIRSpec IFU and MIRI MRS observations of four positions along the blue-shifted TMC1A jet. We extract observed [Fe II] line intensities and model intrinsic ratios using the Cloudy spectral synthesis code across a range of electron densities and temperatures. By comparing observed near-IR (NIR) and MIR line ratios to Cloudy predictions, we infer the relative extinction between NIR and MIR wavelengths. Results: Electron densities (ne) derived from NIR [Fe II] lines range from ~5 x 10^4 to ~5 x 10^3 cm^-3 at scales &lt;~350 AU. MIR extinction values show stronger reddening than the empirical dark cloud curve from McClure (2009) at similar ne and temperatures (~10^3 to 10^4 K). If MIR emission arises from cooler, lower-density gas, extinction curves remain consistent with background starlight measurements. Conclusions: This method enables spatially resolved MIR extinction curves in embedded protostellar systems. Results suggest either a change in dust size distribution (e.g., from grain growth) or that MIR emission originates from cooler, less dense regions than NIR emission. (Abstract shortened for arXiv.

We present a comprehensive analysis of the MIRI Extremely Red Object Virgil, a Lyman-&alpha; emitter at z<sub>spec</sub> = 6.6379 ± 0.0035 with the photometric properties of a Little Red Dot. Leveraging new JWST/MIRI imaging from the MIDIS and PAHSPECS programs, we confirm Virgil's extraordinary nature among galaxies in JADES/GOODS-South, exhibiting a strikingly red NIRCam-to-MIRI color (F444W - F1500W = 2.84±0.04 mag). Deep NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy from the OASIS program offers key insights into the host galaxy, revealing properties of an average star-forming galaxy during Cosmic Reionization, such as a subsolar metallicity, low-to-moderate dust content, and a relatively high ionization parameter and electron temperature. By estimating the star formation rate of Virgil from UV and H&alpha;, we find evidence that the galaxy is either entering or fading out of a bursty episode. Although line-ratio diagnostics employed at high-z would classify Virgil as an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), this classification becomes ambiguous once redshift evolution is considered. Nonetheless, Virgil occupies the same parameter space as recently confirmed AGNs at similar redshifts. The new deep MIRI data at 15 &mu;m reinforce the AGN nature of Virgil, as inferred from multiple spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes. Virgil's rising infrared SED and UV excess resemble those of Dust-Obscured Galaxies (DOGs) studied with Spitzer at Cosmic Noon, particularly blue-excess HotDOGs. Our results highlight the need for a multi-wavelength approach incorporating MIRI to uncover such extreme sources at z≳6 and to shed light on the interplay between galaxy evolution and early black hole growth during Cosmic Reionization.

The standard model of cosmology has provided a good phenomenological description of a wide range of observations both at astrophysical and cosmological scales for several decades. This concordance model is constructed by a universal cosmological constant and supported by a matter sector described by the standard model of particle physics and a cold dark matter contribution, as well as very early-time inflationary physics, and underpinned by gravitation through general relativity. There have always been open questions about the soundness of the foundations of the standard model. However, recent years have shown that there may also be questions from the observational sector with the emergence of differences between certain cosmological probes. In this White Paper, we identify the key objectives that need to be addressed over the coming decade together with the core science projects that aim to meet these challenges. These discordances primarily rest on the divergence in the measurement of core cosmological parameters with varying levels of statistical confidence. These possible statistical tensions may be partially accounted for by systematics in various measurements or cosmological probes but there is also a growing indication of potential new physics beyond the standard model. After reviewing the principal probes used in the measurement of cosmological parameters, as well as potential systematics, we discuss the most promising array of potential new physics that may be observable in upcoming surveys. We also discuss the growing set of novel data analysis approaches that go beyond traditional methods to test physical models. [Abridged]

### 170) [2504.01595](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01595v1): JWST MIRI reveals the diversity of nuclear mid-infrared spectra of nearby type-2 quasars

<p>
Type-2 quasars (QSO2s) are active galactic nuclei (AGN) seen through a significant amount of dust and gas that obscures the central supermassive black hole and the broad line region. Here we present new mid-infrared spectra of the central kiloparsec of five optically-selected QSO2s at redshift z~0.1 obtained with JWST/MIRI/MRS. These QSO2s belong to the QSOFEED sample and they have log Lbol=45.5-46.0 erg/s, global SFRs that place them above the main sequence, and practically identical optical spectral shape and [OIII] luminosity, but their nuclear mid-infrared spectra exhibit an unexpected diversity of both continua and features. They show: 1) 9.7 micron silicate features going from emission (strength of S9.7=0.5) to relatively strong absorption (S9.7=-1.0) and 18 and 23 micron silicates either in emission or flat. In addition, two of the QSO2s show absorption bands of CO, H2O, and aliphatic grains, indicating different levels of nuclear obscuration across the sample. 2) [NeV]/[NeII] ratios ranging from 0.1 to 2.1 and [NeIII]/[NeII] from 1.0 to 3.5, indicating different coronal line and ionizing continuum strengths. 3) Warm molecular gas masses of 1-4x10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and warm-to-cold gas mass ratios of 1-2%, with molecular gas excitation likely due to jet-induced shocks in J1430+1339, and to UV heating and/or turbulence in J1509+0434. 4) PAH emission features with equivalent widths ranging from &lt;0.002 to 0.075 micron, from which we measure a larger contribution from neutral molecules (PAH 11.3/6.2=1.3-3.4) and SFRs&lt;3-7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr. This unprecedented dataset allowed us to start exploring the role of various AGN and galaxy properties including ionizing continuum, obscuration, electron density, and jet-ISM interactions on some of the spectral differences listed above, but larger samples are now required to fully understand the diversity of QSO2s' nuclear mid-infrared spectra.

<p> Amaël Ellien </p>
<p>
In this work an analysis of the intracluster light (ICL) in the galaxy cluster SMACS J0723.3-7327 (hereafter, SMACS J0723) using JWST/NIRCam deep imaging in six filters (F090W to F444W) is presented. The images were processed for low surface brightness (LSB) science, with additional correction for instrumental scattering in the short-wavelength channels, and analysed using wavelet-based decomposition. The ICL, brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), and satellite galaxies were extracted and modelled, with 2D maps for each component. ICL and ICL+BCG fractions, computed across all filters within a 400 kpc radius, exhibit a flat trend with wavelength, averaging 28% and 34%, respectively. Flux ratios between the BCG and the next brightest members (M_12, M_13 and M_14) also display minimal wavelength dependence. These results indicate that SMACS J0723 is a dynamically evolved cluster with a dominant BCG and well-developed ICL. Five prominent ICL substructures are analysed, contributing to 10-12% of the total ICL+BCG flux budget, slightly exceeding simulation predictions. Their short dynamical timescales suggest an instantaneous ICL injection rate of several 10^3 L<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1, consistent with active dynamical assembly. These findings support a scenario where SMACS J0723's ICL growth is currently driven by galaxy mergers involving the BCG and other bright satellites, rather than by the accretion of pre-processed ICL from a recent cluster merger. However, extrapolating the current injection rate to the cluster's lifetime indicates that additional mechanisms are required to match the growth observed in other clusters over cosmic times.

### 172) [2504.01327](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01327v1): Multi-wavelength properties of z≳ 6 LISA detectable events

<p> Srija Chakraborty, Simona Gallerani, Fabio Di Mascia, Tommaso Zana, Milena Valentini, Stefano Carniani, Fabio Vito, Maulik Bhatt </p>
<p>
We investigate the intrinsic and observational properties of z≳ 6 galaxies hosting coalescing massive black holes (MBHs) that gives rise to gravitational waves (GWs) detectable with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We adopt a zoom-in cosmological hydrodynamical simulation of galaxy formation and black hole (BH) co-evolution, zoomed-in on a M_h ~ 10^12~M<sub>&odot;</sub> dark matter halo at z = 6, which hosts a fast accreting super-massive black hole (SMBH) and a star-forming galaxy. Following the SMBH formation backward in time, we identify the merging events that concurred to its formation and we pick up the ones that are detectable with LISA. Among these LISA detectable events (LDEs), we select those that, based on their intrinsic properties are expected to be bright in one or more electromagnetic (EM) bands. We post-process these events with dust radiative transfer calculations to make predictions about their spectral energy distributions and continuum maps in the JWST to ALMA wavelength range. We compare the spectra arising from galaxies hosting the merging MBHs with those arising from AGN powered by single accreting BHs. We find that it will be impossible to identify an LDE from the continuum SEDs because of the absence of specific imprints from the merging MBHs. We also compute the profile of the H_&alpha; line arising from LDEs, considering the contribution from their star-forming regions and the accreting MBHs. We find that the presence of two accreting MBHs would be difficult to infer even if both MBHs accrete at super-Eddington rates. We conclude that the combined detection of GW and EM signals from z≳ 6 MBHs is challenging not only because of the poor sky-localization provided by LISA, but also because the loudest GW emitters are not massive enough to leave significant signatures in the emission lines arising from the broad line region.

<p> Maria Emilia De Rossi, Volker Bromm </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is challenging our understanding of the nature of the very first galaxies in the Universe, having discovered a surprising abundance of very massive galaxies in early cosmic epochs. By applying a model of primeval dust, we estimate the far-infrared (FIR)-continuum luminosities for galaxies of different masses at redshifts z≳7. In particular, we predict observed fluxes for different available bands (3-10) of the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-mm Array (ALMA), considering typical conservative values expected for the properties of first galaxies (e.g., gas-phase metallicities, dust-to-metal ratio, star formation efficiency). As expected, FIR fluxes increase with stellar mass for all ALMA bands, but with a steeper slope for bands 9 and 10. Encouragingly, first galaxies are affected by a strong negative-K correction, in such a way that sources with similar properties are brighter in bands 3-8 at higher redshifts. Such behavior is stronger for bands 6-7. Although the trends for bands 9-10 are not clear, the highest fluxes for such bands are reached towards extreme z≳ 15. Counterintuitively, our results suggest that JWST sources with similar masses and dust properties would be more easily detectable with ALMA if they are located at higher z.

We investigate the capabilities of the mid-infrared instrument (MIRI) of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to advance our knowledge of AGN dust using the spectral fitting technique on an AGN collection of 21 nearby (z&lt;0.05) AGN (7 type-1 and 14 type-2) observations obtained with the medium resolution spectroscopy (MRS) mode. This collection includes publicly available AGN and data from the collaboration of Galactic Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS). We developed a tool named MRSPSFisol that decomposes MRS cubes into point-like and extended contributions. We found statistically good fits for 12 targets with current AGN dust models. The model that provides good fits (chi2/dof&lt;2) for these 12 targets assumes a combination of clumpy and smooth distribution of dust in a flare-disk geometry where the dust grain size is a free parameter. Still, two and one AGN statistically prefer the disk+wind and the classical clumpy torus model, respectively. However, the currently available models fail to reproduce 40% of the targets, likely due to the extreme silicate features not well reproduced by the models and signatures of water-ice and aliphatic hydrocarbon absorption features in most targets. New models exploring, for instance, new chemistry, are needed to explain the complexity of AGN dust continuum emission observed by JWST.

<p>
We present deep JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging of Ion1, a previously confirmed Lyman Continuum (LyC)-emitting galaxy at z<sub>spec</sub>=3.794. Together with existing HST imaging, these new observations from the JADES program enable a joint analysis of Ion1's LyC, rest-frame UV, stellar, and dust emission with unprecedented detail. We report the first detection of dust emission at rest-frame ~3 &mu;m in a high-redshift LyC-emitting galaxy using MIRI/F1500W. Our analysis suggests a porous distribution of dust in Ion1, with regions exhibiting evidence of dust deficit coinciding both with LyC-emitting regions and with the peak of H&alpha; emission. Furthermore, multi-band NIRCam imaging reveals a strong FUV-to-optical color gradient, where LyC-emitting regions appear significantly bluer than the rest of Ion1. Spatially resolved SED fitting confirms that this color gradient is primarily driven by spatially varying dust attenuation. Together, these findings suggest that Ion1's LyC emission originates from a compact star-forming complex near its stellar-light centroid, where stellar feedback carves out low HI column density channels, facilitating LyC escape. However, only a fraction of these LyC photons - specifically those along sightlines with minimal HI obscuration - ultimately escape and reach observers. This work underscores the critical role of dust and neutral gas geometry in shaping LyC escape in galaxies at high redshifts. Anisotropic LyC escape may be a common feature in the early Universe, which must be properly incorporated to constrain the Epoch of Reionization.

### 176) [2504.01070](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01070v1): Formation and Environmental Context of Giant Bulgeless Disk Galaxies in the Early Universe: Insights from Cosmological Simulations

<p> Fangzhou Jiang, Jinning Liang, Bingcheng Jin, Zeyu Gao, Weichen Wang, Sebastiano Cantalupo, Xuejian Shen, Luis C. Ho, Yingjie Peng, Jing Wang </p>
<p>
Giant bulgeless disk galaxies, theoretically expected to be rare in the early Universe, have been confirmed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to exist as early as 2 billion years after the Big Bang. These morphologically extreme systems offer valuable insights into the physics of disk formation and the interplay between galaxies and their dark-matter halos. Using cosmological simulations, we identify analogs of such galaxies with stellar masses around 10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and half-light radii up to 6 kpc at z ~ 3 and characterize the factors that contribute to their formation. These galaxies form in young cosmic knots, populating host halos of high spin, low concentration, and spherical shapes. They feature dynamically coherent circum-galactic medium, as well as gas-rich, coherent mergers, which preserve their disk morphology and drive their large sizes. Interestingly, all the simulated giant disks harbor a compact, aligned inner disk, marginally resolvable in JWST images with a S\'ersic index near unity. These findings highlight the environmental and structural conditions necessary for forming and sustaining giant bulgeless disks and provide a theoretical framework for interpreting JWST observations of extreme disk morphologies in the early Universe.

<p> Charlie Lind-Thomsen, Albert Sneppen, Charles L. Steinhardt </p>
<p>
The interstellar medium (ISM) consists of a diversity of structures across a range of spatial scales, intimately tied to galactic evolution. In this work, Fourier analysis is used to characterize the spatial structures of dust and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the ISM of PHANGS-JWST galaxies, observed in the four photometric mid-infrared (MIR) filters from F770W to F2100W (i.e., 7.7 to 21&mu;m)). We quantify the abundance of structure on different spatial scales using the power-law slope, &alpha;, of the spatial power spectra. The distribution of &alpha; across all length scales differs significantly between filters, with steeper slopes for PAH-dominated filters (&alpha;_F770W = 2.19^+0.16_-0.15, &alpha;_F1130W = 1.88^+0.25_-0.37) and shallower for the dust-continuum (&alpha;_F1000W = 1.48^+0.33_-0.47, &alpha;_F2100W = 0.94^+0.23_-0.28). The distribution of &alpha; across galaxies is narrower for PAH-dominated than for thermal dust-dominated bands, highlighting that PAHs trace photo-dissociation regions dominated by similar physical processes, whereas dust structures are an integrated property over the diverse evolutionary histories of their host galaxies. Unlike dust structures, PAH-sensitive bands display a break in the power spectrum: below a characteristic scale, &ell;_0=160pc^+110pc_-50pc, PAH structures are suppressed.

We release a spectroscopic redshift catalogue of sources in the Abell 2744 cluster field, derived from JWST/NIRISS observations taken as part of the GLASS-JWST Early Release Science programme. We describe the data reduction, contamination modelling and source detection, as well as the data quality assessment, redshift determination and validation. The catalogue consists of 354 secure and 134 tentative redshifts, of which 245 are new spectroscopic redshifts, spanning a range 0.1 ≤ z ≤ 8.2. These include 17 galaxies at the cluster redshift, one galaxy at z ≈ 8, and a triply-imaged galaxy at z = 2.653 ± 0.002. Comparing against galaxies with existing spectroscopic redshifts z<sub>spec</sub>, we find a small offset of &Delta; z = (z<sub>spec</sub> - z_NIRISS )/(1 + z<sub>spec</sub> ) = (1.3 ± 1.6) × 10^-3. We also release a forced extraction tool "pygrife" and a visualisation tool "pygcg" to the community, to aid with the reduction and classification of grism data. This catalogue will enable future studies of the spatially-resolved properties of galaxies throughout cosmic noon, including dust attenuation and star formation. As the first exploitation of the catalogue, we discuss the spectroscopic confirmation of multiple image systems, and the identification of multiple overdensities at 1 &lt; z &lt; 2.7.

<p> Tingwei Shen, Xuejian Shen, Huangyu Xiao, Mark Vogelsberger, Fangzhou Jiang </p>
<p>
Observations of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshifts challenge standard seeding scenarios. We examine a dissipative self-interacting dark matter (dSIDM) model in which gravothermal collapse leads to the formation of massive BH seeds ab initio. We utilize a semi-analytical framework to predict properties of the dSIDM-seeded SMBH population. Billion solar mass quasars are reproduced along with low-mass faint active galactic nuclei (known as little red dots) with SMBH-to-galaxy stellar mass ratios consistent with recent James Webb Space Telescope observations. To match the abundance of the observed bright quasars, a percent-level duty-cycle is suggested, implying a large population of dormant SMBHs. The gravitational wave (GW) signals from mergers of these massive SMBHs can be detected by LISA while remaining within the NANOGrav constraints on the GW background. These results provide testable signatures of DM-driven SMBH formation, offering a pathway to probe hidden-sector physics through SMBH and GW observables.

### 180) [2503.24316](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24316v1): Structure and Fragmentation Scale of a Massive Star-Forming Filament in NGC6334: High-Resolution Mid-Infrared Absorption Imaging with JWST

<p> Philippe André, Michael Mattern, Doris Arzoumanian, Yoshito Shimajiri, Annie Zavagno, Daisei Abe, Delphine Russeil </p>
<p>
Dense filaments are believed to be representative of the initial conditions of star formation in molecular clouds. We have used the MIRI instrument on JWST to image the massive filament NGC6334M at d~1.3 kpc with unprecedented resolution and dynamic range at 7.7 and 25.5 microns. Our observations reveal the fine structure of the filament in absorption against mid-infrared background emission. From the absorption data, we derive high-resolution column density maps and perform a detailed analysis of the filament structure. We find a median filament width of 0.12+/-0.02 pc at both wavelengths, resolved by almost two orders of magnitude by MIRI, and consistent with the typical half-power width of Herschel filaments in nearby (d&lt;0.5 kpc) clouds. The JWST data also reveal the presence of a quasi-periodic series of side filaments with a similar projected spacing of 0.125+/-0.015 pc. Combining our JWST results with Spitzer and APEX/Herschel data, we perform a study of cloud structure over four orders of magnitude in linear scale. A convergence test shows that our width estimates for NGC6334M are robust and reflect the presence of a true characteristic scale. While there is evidence of a Kolmogorov-like spectrum of small-scale fluctuations down the 1.6x10^-3 pc resolution of the JWST observations, we identify a break in the power spectrum of column density fluctuations at a scale ~0.1-0.4 pc comparable to the width of NGC6334M and its side filaments. This characteristic scale ~0.1pc has important implications for the origin of the star formation efficiency in dense gas and the IMF.

<p>
The Lyman-break technique has been used to successfully identify high-redshift candidates in broad-band photometric data in the rest-frame optical and NIR using the dropout technique. We pioneer the application of this technique to new wavelength regimes, and search for dropouts in combined ALMA and JWST data. We find a candidate that is undetected in NIRCam imaging including and blueward of the F444W filter, but clearly identified in ALMA band 3. Assuming this is a Lyman-break candidate, we measure a redshift in the range 40 &lt; z &lt; 21 380. This is the highest redshift galaxy candidate discovered to date, and is in significant tension with current and future predictions from cosmological simulations, with implications for galaxy evolution in the (very) early Universe.

### 182) [2503.23202](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23202v1): Using Wavelet Decomposition to Determine the Dimension of Structures from Projected Images

<p> Svitlana Mayboroda, David N Spergel </p>
<p>
Mesoscale structures can often be described as fractional dimensional across a wide range of scales. We consider a &gamma; dimensional measure embedded in an N dimensional space and discuss how to determine its dimension, both in N dimensions and projected into D dimensions. It is a highly non-trivial problem to decode the original geometry from lower dimensional projection of a high-dimensional measure. The projections are space-feeling, the popular box-counting techniques do not apply, and the Fourier methods are contaminated by aliasing effects. In the present paper we demonstrate that under the "Copernican hypothesis'' that we are not observing objects from a special direction, projection in a wavelet basis is remarkably simple: the wavelet power spectrum of a projected &gamma; dimensional measure is P_j &prop; 2^-j&gamma;. This holds regardless of the embedded dimension, N, and the projected dimension, D. This approach could have potentially broad applications in data sciences where a typically sparse matrix encodes lower dimensional information embedded in an extremely high dimensional field and often measured in projection to a low dimensional space. Here, we apply this method to JWST and Chandra observations of the nearby supernova Cas A. We find that the emissions can be represented by projections of mesoscale substructures with fractal dimensions varying from &gamma; = 1.7 for the warm CO layer observed by JWST, up to &gamma; = 2.5 for the hot X-ray emitting gas layer in the supernova remnant. The resulting power law indicates that the emission is coming from a fractal dimensional mesoscale structure likely produced by magneto-hydrodynamical instabilities in the expanding supernova shell.

### 183) [2503.22130](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22130v1): The Formation of Direct Collapse Black Holes at Cosmic Dawn and 21 cm Global Spectrum

<p> Meng Zhang, Bin Yue, Yidong Xu, Andrea Ferrara </p>
<p>
JWST reveals numerous high-z galaxies and Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs), suggesting that stars and SMBH seeds formation at z ≳ 10 may be more efficient than previously derived. One popular SMBH seed scenario is the Direct Collapse Black Holes (DCBHs) formed in pristine atomic-cooling halos irradiated by nearby galaxies. Therefore, the efficient star formation likely facilitates the formation of DCBH. We calculate the first critical k_H<sub>2</sub>-k_H^- curves for DCBH formation under the influence of X-ray radiation using the one-zone model. We then build the UV luminosity function consistent with JWST observations and incorporate it into the model that calculates the DCBH-triggering probability. We confirm that enhanced star formation promotes the DCBH formation. However, the DCBH abundance n_DCBH is significantly influenced by the X-ray radiation that is also related to star formation. Since the 21 cm global spectrum is also X-ray dependent, the 21 cm absorption depth &delta; T_b^trough at Cosmic Dawn encodes the DCBH abundance information. We provide a tentative trend in the n_DCBH - &delta; T^trough_b relation, which could be a useful guide. In our fiducial model, if &delta; T_b^trough≳ -100 mK, then the DCBH is rather rare; if -150~mK ≲ &delta; T_b^trough≲ -100 mK, n_DCBH ~ O(10^-2-10^-3) cMpc^-3 (comoving Mpc^-3), consistent with the HST/JWST observed SMBHs abundance at z≳ 6; if &delta; T_b^trough≲ -150 mK, n_DCBH can largely exceed O(10^-2) cMpc^-3. The 21 cm global spectrum observations will help to constrain the DCBH abundance.

Amiri </p>
<p>
We present the analysis of the multi-phase gas properties in the Seyfert II galaxy NGC 424, using spatially resolved spectroscopic data from JWST/MIRI, part of the Mid-InfraRed Activity of Circumnuclear Line Emission (MIRACLE) program, as well as VLT/MUSE and ALMA. We trace the properties of the multi-phase medium, from cold and warm molecular gas to hot ionised gas, using emission lines such as CO(2-1), H2 S(1), [OIII]5007, [NeIII]15, and [NeV]14. These lines reveal the intricate interplay between the different gas phases within the circumnuclear region, spanning approximately 1.4x1.4 kpc<sup>2</sup>, with a resolution of 10 pc. Exploiting the multi-wavelength and multi-scale observations of gas emission we model the galaxy disc rotation curve from scales of a few parsec up to 5 kpc from the nucleus and infer a dynamical mass of 1.09±0.08x10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> with a disc scale radius of 0.48±0.02 kpc. We detect a compact ionised outflow with velocities up to 10^3 km/s, traced by the [OIII], [NeIII], and [NeV] transitions, with no evidence of cold or warm molecular outflows. We suggest that the ionised outflow might be able to inject a significant amount of energy into the circumnuclear region, potentially hindering the formation of a molecular wind, as the molecular gas is observed to be denser and less diffuse. The combined multi-band observations also reveal, in all gas phases, a strong enhancement of the gas velocity dispersion directed along the galaxy minor axis, perpendicular to the high-velocity ionised outflow, and extending up to 1 kpc from the nucleus. Our findings suggest that the outflow might play a key role in such enhancement by injecting energy into the host disc and perturbing the ambient material.

### 185) [2503.21896](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21896v1): A Mysteriously Tight Hα-[O III] Correlation and Non-Case B Balmer Decrements Revealed by the Spectra from the James Webb Space Telescope NIRSpec Instrument

<p> Bangzheng Sun, Haojing Yan </p>
<p>
We report an extremely tight, linear relation between H&alpha; and [O III] line fluxes in logarithm, discovered using a large sample of low and mid-resolution spectra (totaling 563) obtained by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec instrument in three widely separated extragalactic fields. While a certain correlation between H&alpha; and [O III] is expected for star forming galaxies, such a log-linear and tight (dispersion of ~0.1 dex) and trend is hard to explain because dust reddening would skew any intrinsic relation between the two. Furthermore, another surprising finding emerges from investigating the dust reddening properties of these galaxies. We find that the classic method of using the Balmer decrements under the standard Case B assumption does not work: a high fraction (~40&percnt;) of our objects have H&alpha;/H&beta; line ratios even smaller than the canonical Case B ratio of 2.86. Such a high fraction of non-Case B Balmer decrements is also present in other JWST and ground-based spectroscopic studies, but the universal applicability of the Case B assumption was not questioned until recently. The mysterious H&alpha;&ndash;[O III] correlation and the high fraction of non-Case B Balmer decrements, which may or may not be related, should be further investigated to put our spectral analysis onto a more solid footing.

### 186) [2503.21879](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21879v1): A rapid channel for the collisional formation and gravitational wave driven mergers of supermassive black hole seeds at high redshift

<p> Antti Rantala, Thorsten Naab </p>
<p>
Motivated by JWST observations of dense, clumpy and clustered high redshift star formation, we simulate the hierarchical assembly of nine M_cl=10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> star clusters using the BIFROST N-body code. Our low metallicity models (0.01Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) with post-Newtonian equations of motion for black holes include evolving populations of single, binary and triple stars. Massive stars grow by stellar collisions and collapse into intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) up to M<sub>&bull;</sub>~6200 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, stellar multiplicity boosting the IMBH masses by a factor of 2&ndash;3. The IMBHs tidally disrupt (TDE) ~50 stars in 10 Myr with peak TDE rates of \Gamma~10^-5 yr^-1 per cluster. These IMBHs are natural seeds for supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and the hierarchical assembly frequently leads to &gt;2 SMBH seeds per cluster and their rapid mergers (t&lt;10 Myr). We propose that a gravitational wave (GW) driven merger of IMBHs with 1000 M<sub>&odot;</sub> ≲ M<sub>&bull;</sub> ≲ 10000 M<sub>&odot;</sub> with comparable masses is a characteristic GW fingerprint of SMBH seed formation at redshifts z&gt;10, and IMBH formation in similar environments at lower redshifts. Massive star clusters provide a unique environment for the early Universe GW studies for the next-generation GW observatories including the Einstein Telescope and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.

### 187) [2503.21869](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21869v1): Galaxy Zoo JWST: Up to 75% of discs are featureless at 3&lt;z&lt;7

<p>
We have not yet observed the epoch at which disc galaxies emerge in the Universe. While high-z measurements of large-scale features such as bars and spiral arms trace the evolution of disc galaxies, such methods cannot directly quantify featureless discs in the early Universe. Here we identify a substantial population of apparently featureless disc galaxies in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey by combining quantitative visual morphologies of ~ 7,000 galaxies from the Galaxy Zoo JWST CEERS project with a public catalogue of expert visual and parametric morphologies. While the highest-redshift featured disc we identify is at z<sub>phot</sub>=5.5, the highest-redshift featureless disc we identify is at z<sub>phot</sub>=7.4. The distribution of S\'ersic indices for these featureless systems suggests that they truly are dynamically cold: disc-dominated systems have existed since at least z~ 7.4. We place upper limits on the featureless disc fraction as a function of redshift, and show that up to 75&percnt; of discs are featureless at 3.0&lt;z&lt;7.4. This is a conservative limit assuming all galaxies in the sample truly lack features. With further consideration of redshift effects and observational constraints, we find the featureless disc fraction in CEERS imaging at these redshifts is more likely ~29-38&percnt;. We hypothesise that the apparent lack of features in a third of high-redshift discs is due to a higher gas fraction in the early Universe, which allows the discs to be resistant to buckling and instabilities.

### 188) [2503.21870](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21870v3): A High-Caliber View of the Bullet Cluster Through JWST Strong and Weak Lensing Analyses

<p> Sangjun Cha, Boseong Young Cho, Hyungjin Joo, Wonki Lee, Kim HyeongHan, Zachary P. Scofield, Kyle Finner, M. James Jee </p>
<p>
The Bullet Cluster (1E 0657-56) is a key astrophysical laboratory for studying dark matter, galaxy cluster mergers, and shock propagation in extreme environments. Using new JWST imaging, we present the highest-resolution mass reconstruction to date, combining 146 strong lensing constraints from 37 systems with high-density (398 sources arcmin^-2) weak lensing data, without assuming that light traces mass. The main cluster's mass distribution is highly elongated (NW-SE) and consists of at least three subclumps aligned with the brightest cluster galaxies. The subcluster is more compact but elongated along the E-W direction, with a single dominant peak. We also detect a possible mass and ICL trail extending from the subcluster's eastern side toward the main cluster. Notably, these detailed features are closely traced by the intracluster light, with a modified Hausdorff distance of 19.80 ± 12.46 kpc. Together with multi-wavelength data, the complex mass distribution suggests that the merger history of the Bullet Cluster may be more complex than previous binary cluster merger scenarios.

<p>
Recent studies of gas kinematics at high redshift have reported disky systems which appear to challenge models of galaxy formation, but it is unclear whether they are representative of the underlying galaxy population. We present the first statistical sample of spatially resolved ionised gas kinematics at high redshift, comprised of 272 H&alpha; emitters in GOODS-S and GOODS-N at redshifts z≈3.9-6.5, observed with JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopy and imaging from JADES, FRESCO and CONGRESS. The sample probes two orders of magnitude in stellar mass (log (M<sub>&sext;</sub>[M<sub>&odot;</sub>])≈8-10) and star formation rate (SFR≈0.3-100\thinspace M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr), and is representative down to log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>[M<sub>&odot;</sub>])≈ 9. Using a novel inference tool, ttgeko, we model the grism data to measure morphological and kinematic properties of the ionised gas, as probed by H&alpha;. Our results are consistent with a decrease of the rotational support v/&sigma;_0 and increase of the velocity dispersion &sigma;_0 with redshift, with &sigma;_0≈100 km/s and v/&sigma;_0≈1-2 at z≈3.9-6.5. We study the relations between &sigma;_0, and v/&sigma;_0, and different star formation tracers and find a large scatter and diversity, with the strongest correlations between &sigma;_0 and SFR and SFR surface density. The fraction of rotationally supported systems (v/&sigma;_0&gt;1) slightly increases with cosmic time, from (36±6)&percnt; to (41±6)&percnt; from z~ 5.5 to z~ 4.5, for galaxies with masses 9&lt;log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>[M<sub>&odot;</sub>])&lt;10. Overall, disks do not dominate the turbulent high-redshift galaxy population in the mass range probed by this work. When placed in the context of studies up to cosmic noon, our results are consistent with a significant increase of disk-like systems with cosmic time.

How radial flows shape galaxy structure and evolution remains an open question. Internal drivers of such flows, such as bars and spiral arms, known to mediate gas flows in the local Universe, are now observable at high redshift thanks to JWST's unobscured view. We investigate the morphology of massive star-forming galaxies at 0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.3 and 2.0 &lt; z &lt; 2.5, epochs marking the peak and decline of cosmic star formation, both well-covered by kinematic surveys. Using JWST/NIRCam imaging, we visually classify 1,451 galaxies, identify non-axisymmetric features, count the number of spiral arms, analyze non-parametric morphological indicators and study the dynamical support of the sample covered by kinematics (10% of the sample) as measured via v/&sigma;. Disk galaxies dominate the sample (82%), with 48% exhibiting spiral structure and 11% hosting bars. Both fractions decline with redshift, consistent with previous studies. The proportion of two- and three-armed spirals remains largely unchanged across redshift, with roughly two-thirds showing two arms and one-third showing three arms in both bins. Notably, we find a higher incidence of three-armed spirals than reported in the local Universe, suggesting a mild evolution in spiral arm multiplicity. Non-parametric morphological metrics strongly correlate with stellar mass but show no significant redshift evolution. Finally, kinematic analysis reveals a strong correlation between disk morphology and rotational support, with most disks exhibiting v/&sigma; &gt; 3 and median values of v/&sigma; &gt; 7 for spirals and v/&sigma; &gt; 5 for barred galaxies. This study establishes a population-wide framework for linking galaxy morphology and dynamics at cosmic noon, providing a key reference for future studies on the role of detailed structural features in galaxy evolution.

Galaxy clusters in the local Universe are dominated by massive quiescent galaxies with old ages, formed at high redshifts. It is debated whether their quenching is driven by internal processes or environmental effects, which has been challenging due to the lack of observations during their peak formation epoch. Here we report clear evidence from ALMA of extended and elongated gas tails in nine galaxies in a forming cluster at z = 2.51. The distinct gas distribution compared to the stellar emission probed by JWST, which is rather isolated without signatures of mergers or interactions, provides evidence of ram-pressure stripping (RPS). This represents the most distant confirmed case of RPS, highlighting the critical role of environmental effects in gas removal at high redshifts, an often overlooked quenching pathway.

### 192) [2503.21706](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21706v1): Flashlights: Prospects for constraining the Initial Mass Function around cosmic noon with caustic-crossing events

<p> Ashish Kumar Meena, Sung Kei Li, Adi Zitrin, Patrick L. Kelly, Tom Broadhurst, Wenlei Chen, Jose M. Diego, Alexei V. Filippenko, Lukas J. Furtak, Liliya L. R. Williams </p>
<p>
The Flashlights program with the Hubble Space Telescope imaged the six Hubble Frontier Fields galaxy clusters in two epochs and detected twenty transients. These are primarily expected to be caustic-crossing events (CCEs) where bright stars in distant lensed galaxies, typically at redshift z≈1&ndash;3, get temporarily magnified close to cluster caustics. Since CCEs are generally biased toward more massive and luminous stars, they offer a unique route for probing the high end of the stellar mass function. We take advantage of the Flashlights event statistics to place preliminary constraints on the stellar initial mass function (IMF) around cosmic noon. The photometry (along with spectral information) of lensed arcs is used to infer their various stellar properties, and stellar synthesis models are used to evolve a recent stellar population in them. We estimate the microlens surface density near each arc and, together with existing lens models and simple formalism for CCEs, calculate the expected rate for a given IMF. We find that, on average, a Salpeter-like IMF (&alpha;=2.35) underpredicts the number of observed CCEs by a factor of ~0.7, and a top-heavy IMF (&alpha;=1.00) overpredicts by a factor of ~1.7, suggesting that the average IMF slope may lie somewhere in between. However, given the large uncertainties associated with estimating the stellar populations, these results are strongly model-dependent. Nevertheless, we introduce a useful framework for constraining the IMF using CCEs. Observations with JWST are already yielding many more CCEs and will soon enable more stringent constraints on the IMF at a range of redshifts.

In this work, we run a suite of simulations using the code 21cmSPACE, to explore the astrophysical properties of galaxies in the early Universe, and their impact on high-redshift observables. We use multi-wavelength observational data including the global 21-cm signal and power spectrum limits from SARAS~3 and HERA respectively, present-day diffuse X-ray and radio backgrounds, and UV luminosity functions (UVLFs) from HST and JWST in the range z=6-14.5 to derive our constraints. We constrain a flexible model of halo-mass and redshift dependent star-formation efficiency (SFE), defined as the gas fraction converted into stars, and find that it is best described by little to no redshift evolution at z≈6-10 and rapid evolution at z≈10-15. We derive Bayesian functional posterior distributions for the SFE across this redshift range, inferring that a halo of mass M_h=10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> has an efficiency of 2-3&percnt; at z≲10, 12&percnt; at z=12 and 26&percnt; at z=15. We also find, through synergy between SARAS~3 and UVLFs, that the minimum circular velocity for star-formation in halos is V_c = 16.9^+25.7_-9.5 km s<sup>-1</sup> or equivalently log_10(M_crit/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 8.29^+1.21_-1.08 at z=6. Alongside these star-formation constraints, we find the X-ray and radio efficiencies of early galaxies to be f_X = 0.5^+6.3_-0.3 and f_r ≲ 11.7 respectively, improving upon existing works that do not use UVLF data. Our results demonstrate the critical role of UVLFs in constraining the early Universe, and its synergies with 21-cm observations, alongside other multi-wavelength observational datasets.

<p>
We present the survey design and initial results from the Parallel Ionizing Emissivity (PIE) survey. PIE is a large HST survey designed to detect Lyman continuum (LyC) emitting galaxies at 3.1&lt;z&lt;3.5 and stack the images of galaxies at these redshifts in order to measure average LyC escape fractions as a function of galaxy properties. PIE has imaged 37 independent fields in three filters (F336W, F625W and F814W), of which 18 are observed with a fourth band (F475W) from the accompanying PIE+ program. We use photometric colors to select candidate Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) at 3.1&lt;z&lt;3.5, which can be followed-up using ground-based spectrographs to confirm their redshifts. Unlike previous surveys, our use of many independent fields allows us to remove any biases caused by correlated absorption in the IGM. In this paper, we describe the survey design, photometric measurements, and the use of mock galaxy samples to optimize our color selection. We find that a 3-filter selection allows us to select a galaxy sample of which ≈90&percnt; are LBGs and over 30&percnt; lie in the 3.1&lt;z&lt;3.5 range for which we can detect uncontaminated LyC emission in F336W. We also use mock IGM sightlines to measure the expected transmission of the IGM, which will allow us to determine escape fractions from our stacked galaxies. We find ≈1000 galaxies within our selection window, and predict that this includes ≈80 LyC-emitting galaxies and ≈350 that we can use in stacking. Finally, we present our first ground-based spectra, including a plausible LyC emitter at z=3.067.

### 195) [2503.20721](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20721v1): Imprints of Stellar Feedback on Magnetic Fields in the Iris Nebula NGC 7023

<p> Ekta Sharma, Kate Pattle, Di Li, Chang Won Lee, Maheswar Gopinathan, Tao-Chung Ching, Mehrnoosh Tahani, Shinyoung Kim </p>
<p>
We present 850 &mu;m polarized continuum observations carried out with the POL-2 polarimeter mounted on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) towards NGC 7023 located in the Cepheus Flare region. NGC 7023 is a reflection nebula powered by a Herbig Ae Be star HD 200775 and also identified as a hub in the hub-filament cloud, LDN 1172/1174. We detect submillimetre emission well towards the northern (identified as C1) and the eastern region of the reflection nebula. We investigated the polarization structure and the magnetic field (B-field) morphology, which is found to be curved and follows the clump morphology. The comparison of the B-field morphology at the clump scales (~0.02 pc) with that of the envelope (~0.5 pc) suggests that the field lines are not preserved from envelope to clump scales, implying that an external factor may be responsible for disturbing the B-field structure. We estimated a magnetic field strength of 179±50 &mu;G in the starless core, 121±34 &mu;G in the protostellar core with a class I source and 150±42 &mu;G in the protostellar core with a class II source using the N<sub>2</sub>H^+ (1-0) line observed with 13.7 m single dish radio telescope at Taeduk Radio Astronomy Observatory (TRAO). The stability analysis using these B-field strengths gives magnetically sub-critical values, while the magnetic, gravitational, and outflow kinetic energies are roughly balanced. We also suggest that the reordering of the magnetic field lines could be due to the interaction with the already evolved high-velocity outflow gas around the central star, which hints at the presence of outflow feedback.

### 196) [2503.20640](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20640v1): The planetary nebula NGC 3132 revisited: high definition 3D photoionization model

<p> H. Monteiro, C. Mendes de Oliveira, P. Amram, L. Stanghellini, R. Wesson, K. Bouvis, S. Akras, M. Matsuura, B. C. Quint </p>
<p>
We present a detailed 3D photoionization model of the planetary nebula NGC 3132, constrained by the latest observations. Using the MOCASSIN code, the model incorporates integrated and spatially resolved spectroscopy, velocity-resolved line profiles, emission line maps, and photometry, including recent high-quality data from MUSE (VLT) and JWST among others. Based on new data from the SAMFP instrument at SOAR, the three-dimensional density structure of the nebula was obtained by assuming homologous expansion of the surrounding nebular gas. The final fitted model successfully reproduces all key observational constraints available, particularly in terms of the detailed emission line integrated fluxes and ionization structures across different ionic stages. The results of the model show that the progenitor star had a mass of (2.7 ± 0.2)M<sub>&odot;</sub> and is surrounded by a He poor shell of dust and gas. The abundances of He, C, N, O, and S determined by the model show that the nebula has C/O=(2.02 ± 0.28) and N/O=(0.39 ± 0.38) consistent with the progenitor mass found.

[Abridged] SFGs are the dominant population in the faint radio sky, corresponding to flux densities at 1.4 GHz &lt; 0.1 mJy. A panchromatic approach is essential for selecting SFGs in the radio band and understanding star formation processes over cosmic time. Semi-empirical models are valuable tools to effectively study galaxy formation and evolution, relying on minimal assumptions and exploiting empirical relations between galaxy properties and enabling us to take full advantage of the recent progress in radio and optical/near-infrared (NIR) observations. In this paper, we develop the Semi-EMPirical model for Extragalactic Radio emission (SEMPER) to predict radio luminosity functions and number counts at 1.4 GHz and 150 MHz for SFGs. SEMPER is based on state-of-the-art empirical relations and combines the redshift-dependent galaxy stellar mass functions obtained from the recent COSMOS2020 catalogue, which exploits deep near-infrared observations, with up-to-date observed scaling relations, such as the galaxy main sequence and the mass-dependent far-infrared/radio correlation across cosmic time. Our luminosity functions are compared with recent observational determinations from several radio telescopes, along with previous semi-empirical models and simulations. Our semi-empirical model successfully reproduces the observed luminosity functions at 1.4 GHz and 150 MHz up to z~ 5 and the most recent number count statistics from radio observations in the LoTSS deep fields. Our model, based on galaxies selected in the NIR, naturally predicts the presence of radio-selected massive and/or dust-obscured galaxies already in place at high redshift (z≳3.5), as suggested by recent results from JWST. Our predictions offer an excellent benchmark for upcoming updates from JWST and future ultra-deep radio surveys planned with the SKA and its precursors.

### 198) [2503.20415](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20415v1): Massive black hole formation in Population III star clusters

<p> B. Reinoso, M. A. Latif, D. R. G. Schleicher </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that challenge existing black hole (BH) formation models. These newly observed BHs are overmassive compared to the host galaxies and have an unexpectedly high abundance. Their exact origin remains elusive. The primary goal of this work is to investigate the formation of massive BH seeds in dense Population III (Pop III) star clusters. Using a cosmological simulation of Pop III cluster formation, we present models for the assembly and subsequent evolution of these clusters. The models account for background gas potential, stellar collisions and associated mass loss, gas accretion, stellar growth, their initial mass function (IMF), and subsequent star formation. We conduct N-body simulations of these models over a span of 2 million years. Our results show that BHs of &gt; 400 M<sub>&odot;</sub> are formed in all cases, reaching up to ~ 5000 M<sub>&odot;</sub> under optimistic yet reasonable conditions and potentially exceeding 10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub> provided that high accretion rates of 10^-3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1 onto the stars can be sustained. We conclude that massive BHs can be formed in Pop III stellar clusters and are likely to remain within their host clusters. These BHs may experience further growth as they sink into the galaxy's potential well. This formation channel should be given further consideration in models of galaxy formation and BH demographics.

### 199) [2503.20147](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20147v1): Infrared Emission of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Molecules in Titan: Cyanonaphthalenes

<p> Li Zhou, Kaijun Li, Aigen Li, Zheng Zhou </p>
<p>
As the only moon in the solar system with a thick atmosphere, Titan is a compelling and enigmatic world containing a complex organic haze. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules are believed to play an essential role in the formation of Titan's aerosols and haze layers. The existence of PAHs in Titan's upper atmosphere has been revealed by the detection of the 3.28-micron emission band with Cassini's Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS). However, there is little knowledge about the identity, composition, size and abundance of PAH molecules in Titan's atmosphere. Due to its unprecedented sensitivity and spectral coverage and resolution, the advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) could possibly enable a full characterization of the chemical makeups of Titan's aerosols. In particular, with a much better spectral resolution than Cassini's VIMS, JWST's Near Infrared Spectrograph (and Mid Infrared Instrument) could enable the spectral bands to be better resolved, potentially providing crucial information about which PAHs are really present in Titan's upper atmosphere. To facilitate JWST to search for and identify Titan's PAH molecules, we are performing a systematic study of the photophysics of PAHs in Titan's upper atmosphere. As a pilot study, here we report the infrared emission spectra of vibrationally excited cyanonapthalenes and their ions which are composed of two fused benzene rings and one nitrile (-CN) group. The calculated emission spectra will help JWST to quantitatively determine or place an upper limit on the abundances of cyanonapthalenes in Titan's upper atmosphere.

Almost all globular clusters (GCs) contain multiple populations consisting of stars with varying helium and light-element abundances. These populations include first-population stars, which exhibit similar chemical compositions to halo-field stars with comparable [Fe/H], and second-population stars, characterized by enhanced He and N abundances along with reduced levels of O and C. Nowadays, one of the most intriguing open questions about GCs pertains to the formation and evolution of their multiple populations. Recent works based on N-body simulations of GCs show that the fractions and characteristics of binary stars can serve as dynamic indicators of the formation period of multiple-population in GCs and their subsequent dynamical evolution. Nevertheless, the incidence of binaries among multiple populations is still poorly studied. Moreover, the few available observational studies are focused only on the bright stars of a few GCs. In this work, we use deep images of the GC 47 Tucanae collected with the JWST and HST to investigate the incidence of binaries among multiple populations of M-dwarfs and bright main-sequence stars. To reach this objective, we use UV, optical, and near infrared filters to construct photometric diagrams that allow us to disentangle binary systems and multiple populations. Moreover, we compared these observations with a large sample of simulated binaries. In the cluster central regions, the incidence of binaries among first-population stars is only slightly higher than that of second-population stars. In contrast, in the external regions, the majority (&gt;85%) of the studied binaries are composed of first population stars. Results are consistent with the GC formation scenarios where the second-population stars originate in the cluster's central region, forming a compact and dense stellar group within a more extended system of first-population stars

We present the MIRI EGS Galaxy and AGN (MEGA) survey, a four band MIRI survey with 25 pointing in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) extragalactic field. Three of the pointings utilized only the three reddest bands (F1000W, F1500W, F2100W) while the remainder of the pointings also add a blue filter (F770W). MEGA builds upon the existing observations in the EGS field by providing MIRI imaging for 68.9% of CEERS NIRCam imaging, filling a cruciality gap in order to understand galaxy evolution by observing the obscured Universe. Here, we present the technical design, data reduction, photometric catalog creation, the first data release, and science drivers of the MEGA survey. Our data reduction starts with the standard JWST calibration pipeline, but adds additional warm pixel masking and custom background subtraction steps to improve the quality of the final science image. We estimate the image depth of the reduced mosaics and present new galaxy number counts in four MIRI bands.

### 202) [2503.19020](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19020v1): A Spectroscopic Survey of Metal-Poor OB Stars in Local Dwarf Galaxy NGC 3109

<p> Abby Mintz, O. Grace Telford, Evan N. Kirby, John Chisholm, Kristen B. W. McQuinn, Danielle Berg </p>
<p>
As JWST uncovers increasingly strong evidence that metal-poor, massive stars in early galaxies dominated reionization, observational constraints on the properties of such stars are more relevant than ever before. However, spectra of individual O- and B-type stars are rare at the relevant metallicities (≲ 0.2 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>), leaving models of stellar evolution and ionizing flux poorly constrained by data in this regime. We present new medium-resolution (R~ 4000) Keck/DEIMOS optical spectra of 17 OB stars in the local low-metallicity (0.12 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) dwarf galaxy NGC 3109. We assign spectral types to the stars and present new criteria for selecting O stars using optical and NUV photometry from Hubble Space Telescope imaging. We fit the spectra and photometry with grids of stellar atmosphere models to measure stellar temperatures, surface gravities, luminosities, radii, and masses. We find evidence of strong mass loss via radiation-driven stellar winds in two O stars, one of which is the hottest, youngest, and most massive star confirmed in the host galaxy to date. Though its spectrum does not meet conventional Wolf-Rayet spectral classification criteria, this metal-poor O If star produces strong He II 4686 emission and its evolutionary status is ambiguous. This work nearly doubles the number of OB stars with measured parameters in NGC 3109, including ten stars with no previously reported parameters, four with no published spectroscopy, and four binary candidates. This large sample of OB stellar parameters provides a new observational testbed to constrain the stellar astrophysics that drove cosmic reionization and influenced the evolution of the earliest galaxies.

### 203) [2503.18850](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18850v1): Beyond the first galaxies primordial black holes shine

<p> Antonio Matteri, Andrea Ferrara, Andrea Pallottini </p>
<p>
The presence of nine candidate galaxies at z=17 and z=25 discovered by the itJames Webb Space Telescope in relatively small sky areas, if confirmed, is virtually impossible to reconcile with current galaxy formation model predictions. We show here that the implied UV luminosity density can be produced by a population of primordial black holes (PBH) of mass M_PBH = 10^4-5   M<sub>&odot;</sub> residing in low-mass halos (M_h ≈ 10^7   M<sub>&odot;</sub>), and accreting at a moderate fraction of the Eddington luminosity, &lambda;_E ≃ 0.36. These sources precede the first significant episodes of cosmic star formation. At later times, as star formation is ignited, PBH emission becomes comparable or subdominant with respect to the galactic one. Such a PBH+galaxy scenario reconciles the evolution of the UV LF from z=25 to z=11. If ultra-early sources are purely powered by accretion, this strongly disfavours seed production mechanisms requiring the presence of stars (massive/Pop III stars or clusters) or their UV radiation (direct collapse BHs), leaving PBH as the only alternative solution available so far. Alternative explanations, such as isolated, large clusters (≈ 10^7   M<sub>&odot;</sub>) of massive (m<sub>&sext;</sub> =10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) of Pop III are marginally viable, but require extreme and unlikely conditions, that can be probed via UV/FIR emission lines or gravitational waves.

The PHANGS project is assembling a comprehensive, multi-wavelength dataset of nearby (~5-20 Mpc), massive star-forming galaxies to enable multi-phase, multi-scale investigations into the processes that drive star formation and galaxy evolution. To date, large survey programs have provided molecular gas (CO) cubes with ALMA, optical IFU spectroscopy with VLT/MUSE, high-resolution NUV&ndash;optical imaging in five broad-band filters with HST, and infrared imaging in NIRCAM+MIRI filters with JWST. Here, we present PHANGS-HST-Halpha, which has obtained high-resolution (~2-10 pc), narrow-band imaging in the F658N or F657N filters with the HST/WFC3 camera of the warm ionized gas in the first 19 nearby galaxies observed in common by all four of the PHANGS large programs. We summarize our data reduction process, with a detailed discussion of the production of flux-calibrated, Milky Way extinction corrected, continuum-subtracted Halpha maps. PHANGS-MUSE IFU spectroscopy data are used to background subtract the HST-Halpha maps, and to determine the [NII] correction factors for each galaxy. We describe our public data products and highlight a few key science cases enabled by the PHANGS-HST-Halpha observations.

<p>
Brown dwarfs are failed stars with very low mass (13 to 75 M_J), and an effective temperature lower than 2500 K. Thus, they play a key role in understanding the gap in the mass function between stars and planets. However, due to their faint nature, previous searches are inevitably limited to the solar neighbourhood (20 pc). To improve our knowledge of the low mass part of the initial stellar mass function and the star formation history of the Milky Way, it is crucial to find more distant brown dwarfs. Using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) COSMOS-Web data, this study seeks to enhance our comprehension of the physical characteristics of brown dwarfs situated at a distance of kpc scale. The exceptional sensitivity of the JWST enables the detection of brown dwarfs that are up to 100 times more distant than those discovered in the earlier all-sky infrared surveys. The large area coverage of the JWST COSMOS-Web survey allows us to find more distant brown dwarfs than earlier JWST studies with smaller area coverages. To capture prominent water absorption features around 2.7 &mu;m, we apply two colour criteria, F115W-F277W+1&lt;F277W-F444W and F277W-F444W&gt;0.9. We then select point sources by CLASS_STAR, FLUX_RADIUS, and SPREAD_MODEL criteria. Faint sources are visually checked to exclude possibly extended sources. We conduct SED fitting and MCMC simulations to determine their physical properties and associated uncertainties. Our search reveals 25 T-dwarf and 2 Y-dwarf candidates, more than any previous JWST brown dwarf searches. They are located from 0.3 kpc to 4 kpc away from the Earth. The cumulative number count of our brown dwarf candidates is consistent with the prediction from a standard double exponential model. Three of our brown dwarf candidates were detected by HST, with transverse velocities 12±5 km s<sup>-1</sup>, 12±4 km s<sup>-1</sup>, and 17±6 km s<sup>-1</sup>.

### 206) [2503.18326](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18326v1): The properties of the obscuring material of an AGNs sample from mid-IR and X-ray simultaneous fitting

Over ten mid-infrared (mid-IR) and X-ray models are currently attempting to describe the nuclear obscuring material of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), but many questions remain unresolved. This study aims to determine the physical parameters of the obscuring material in nearby AGNs and explore their relationship with nuclear activity. We selected 24 nearby Seyfert AGNs with X-ray luminosities ranging from 10^41 to 10^44 erg/s, using NuSTAR and Spitzer spectra. Our team fitted the spectra using a simultaneous fitting technique. Then, we compared the resulting parameters with AGN properties, such as bolometric luminosity, accretion rate, and black hole mass. Our analysis shows that dust and gas share a similar structure in most AGNs. Approximately 70% of the sample favors a combination of the X-ray UXclumpy model with the Clumpy and two-phases models at IR wavelengths. We found that linking the half-opening angle and torus angular width parameters from X-ray and mid-IR models helps constrain other parameters and break degeneracies. The study reveals that Sy1 galaxies are characterized by low covering factors, half-opening angles, and column densities but high Eddington rates. In contrast, Sy2 galaxies display higher covering factors and column densities, with a broader range of half-opening angles. We also observed that the distribution of obscuring material is closer to the nucleus in intermediate-luminosity sources, while it is more extended in more luminous AGNs. Our findings reinforce the connection between the properties of gas-dust material within 10 pc and AGN activity. Applying this methodology to a larger sample and incorporating data from facilities such as JWST and XRISM will be crucial in further refining these results.

### 207) [2503.17921](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17921v2): Empirical SED Templates for Star Clusters Observed with HST and JWST: No Strong PAH or IR Dust Emission after Five Myr

<p>
JWST observations, when combined with HST data, promise to improve age estimates of star clusters in nearby spiral galaxies. However, feedback from young cluster stars pushes out the natal gas and dust, making cluster formation and evolution a challenge to model. Here, we use JWST + HST observations of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 628 to produce spectral energy distribution (SED) templates of compact star clusters spanning 275 nm through 21 &mu;m. These preliminary SEDs capture the cluster stars and associated gas and dust within radii of 0.12" to 0.67" (corresponding to 6 to 33 pc at the distance of NGC 628). One important finding is that the SEDs of 1, 2, 3, and 4 Myr clusters can be differentiated in the infrared. Another is that in 80-90% of the cases we study, the PAH and H_alpha emission track one another, with the dust responsible for the 3.3 &mu;m PAH emission largely removed by 4 Myr, consistent with pre-supernova stellar feedback acting quickly on the surrounding gas and dust. Nearly-embedded cluster candidates have infrared SEDs which are quite similar to optically visible 1 to 3 Myr clusters. In nearly all cases we find there is a young star cluster within a few tenths of an arcsec (10 - 30 pc) of the nearly embedded cluster, suggesting the formation of the cluster was triggered by its presence. The resulting age estimates from the empirical templates are compatible both with dynamical estimates based on CO superbubble expansion velocities, and the TODDLERS models which track spherical evolution of homogeneous gas clouds around young stellar clusters.

### 208) [2503.17585](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17585v2): How do Massive Primordial Black Holes Impact the Formation of the First Stars and Galaxies?

<p> Saiyang Zhang, Boyuan Liu, Volker Bromm, Junehyoung Jeon, Michael Boylan-Kolchin, Florian Kuhnel </p>
<p>
We investigate the impact of massive primordial black holes (PBHs; m_BH~ 10^6~M<sub>&odot;</sub>) on the star formation and first galaxy assembly process using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations from z = 1100 to z ~ 9. We find that PBH accretion is self-regulated by feedback, suppressing mass growth unless feedback is weak. PBHs accelerate structure formation by seeding dark matter halos and gravitationally attracting gas, but strong feedback can delay cooling and suppress star formation. In addition, the presence of baryon-dark matter streaming creates an offset between the PBH location and the peaks induced in gas density, promoting earlier and more efficient star formation compared to standard &Lambda;CDM. By z ~ 10, PBH-seeded galaxies form dense star clusters, with PBH-to-stellar mass ratios comparable to observed high-z AGN like UHZ-1. Our results support PBHs as viable SMBH seeds but do not exclude alternative scenarios. We emphasize that PBH-seeding provides a natural explanation for some of the newly-discovered overmassive SMBHs at high redshift, in particular those with extreme ratios of BH-to-dynamical (virial) mass that challenge standard formation channels. Future studies with ultra-deep JWST surveys, the Roman Space Telescope, and radio surveys with facilities such as SKA and HERA will be critical in distinguishing PBH-driven SMBH growth from other pathways.

### 209) [2503.16595](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16595v3): JWST's little red dots: an emerging population of young, low-mass AGN cocooned in dense ionized gas

<p>
JWST has uncovered large numbers of compact galaxies at high redshift with broad hydrogen/helium lines. These include the enigmatic population known as "little red dots" (LRDs). Their nature is debated, but they are thought to be powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) or intense star formation. They exhibit unusual properties for SMBHs, such as black holes that are overmassive for their host galaxies and extremely weak X-ray and radio emission. Using the highest-quality JWST spectra, we show here that the lines are broadened by electron scattering with a narrow intrinsic line core. The data require high electron column densities and compact sizes (light days), which, when coupled with their high luminosities can only be explained by SMBH accretion. The narrow intrinsic cores of the lines imply upper limits on the black hole masses of 10^5-7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, two orders of magnitude lower than previous estimates. These are among the lowest mass SMBHs known at high redshift and suggest that this is a population of young, rapidly growing SMBHs. They are enshrouded in a dense cocoon of ionized gas, probably related to their youth, from which they are accreting close to the Eddington limit. Reprocessed nebular emission from the dense cocoon dominates the optical spectrum, explaining most LRD spectral characteristics and helping to suppress radio and X-ray emission.

### 210) [2503.10958](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10958v2): Dot to dot: high-z little red dots in M_bh-M<sub>&sext;</sub> diagrams with galaxy-morphology-specific scaling relations

<p> Alister W. Graham, Igor V. Chilingarian, Dieu D. Nguyen, Roberto Soria, Mark Durre, Duncan A. Forbes </p>
<p>
The high redshift 'little red dots' (LRDs) detected with the James Webb Space Telescope are considered to be the cores of emerging galaxies that host active galactic nuclei (AGN). For the first time, we compare LRDs with local compact stellar systems and an array of galaxy-morphology-dependent stellar mass-black hole mass scaling relations in the M_bh-M<sub>&sext;</sub> diagrams. When considering the 2023-2024 masses for LRDs, they are not equivalent to nuclear star clusters (NSCs), with the latter having higher M_bh/M<sub>&sext;</sub> ratios. However, the least massive LRDs exhibit similar M_bh and M<sub>&sext;</sub>,gal values as ultracompact dwarf (UCD) galaxies, believed to be the cores of stripped/threshed galaxies. We show that the LRDs span the M_bh-M<sub>&sext;</sub>,gal diagram from UCD galaxies to primaeval lenticular galaxies. In contrast, local spiral galaxies and the subset of major-merger-built early-type galaxies define M_bh-M<sub>&sext;</sub>,gal relations that are offset to higher stellar masses. Based on the emerging 2025 masses for LRDs, they may yet have similarities with NSCs, UCD galaxies, and green peas. Irrespective of this developing situation, we additionally observe that low-redshift galaxies with AGN align with the quasi-quadratic or steeper black hole scaling relations defined by local disc galaxies with directly measured black hole masses. This highlights the benefits of considering a galaxy's morphology - which reflects its accretion and merger history - to understand the coevolution of galaxies and their black holes. Future studies of spatially-resolved galaxies with secure masses at intermediate-to-high redshift hold the promise of detecting the emergence and evolution of the galaxy-morphology-dependent M_bh-M<sub>&sext;</sub> relations.

### 211) [2503.07711](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07711v2): Where Have All the Little Red Dots Gone? Supermassive Black Hole Binary Dynamics and its Impact on Galaxy Properties

<p> Fazeel Mahmood Khan, Benjamin L. Davis, Andrea Valerio Macciò, Kelly Holley-Bockelmann </p>
<p>
Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations have revealed a peculiar class of galaxies at redshifts z ≳ 6, characterized by extremely high central stellar densities and overmassive central supermassive black holes (SMBHs), "little red dots" (LRDs). A critical question remains: If LRDs were common at high redshifts, how would they evolve into local elliptical galaxies with significantly lower central densities? To address this, we performed direct N-body simulations of LRD mergers, focusing on the coevolution of host galaxies and central SMBHs. We track the complete evolution of SMBH binaries into the three-body hardening and gravitational-wave (GW) emission phase. Our results demonstrate that during galaxy mergers, the central SMBHs can eject a substantial amount of mass from the galactic core via the three-body slingshot effect, leading to a decrease in central stellar surface density by an order of magnitude. Additionally, GW recoil can further contribute in making the galaxy centers less dense and more in alignment with low-redshift quiescent galaxies. This transformation occurs on a relatively short timescale of a few ~100 Myr, implying that LRDs can evolve into lower-redshift elliptical galaxies by z&lt;4. The timescales for our SMBH mergers vary between 100 Myr and 800 Myr, depending on the initial orbital parameters of the merging galaxies and the mass ratio of the SMBHs. Our findings provide a plausible mechanism for the transformation of LRDs into elliptical galaxies while highlighting the efficiency of SMBH mergers in such high-density environments, which plays a crucial role in SMBH growth.

<p>
We report the discovery of an intriguing, low-mass galaxy-scale strong-lens system in the SMACS J0723.3-7327 galaxy cluster. By modeling James Webb Space Telescope imaging and Very Large Telescope Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer spectroscopic data, we find that the lens is cluster member galaxy at z=0.397 with an Einstein radius of 0&prime;&prime;.424 ± 0&prime;&prime;.012, stellar mass of M_* = (3.3 ± 0.8) × 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, half-light radius of ~ 1 kpc, and central stellar velocity dispersion of 140 ± 6 km s<sup>-1</sup>. This lens galaxy is one of the few strong lens galaxies known to date that have stellar mass as low as M_* ~ 10^10.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, offering an exceptional opportunity to peek into the population of low-mass galaxies that has largely remained unexplored in the context of strong-lensing studies. This strong lens system can also assist in assessing the systematic uncertainty in the lens modeling of cluster member galaxies.

<p>
We present a sample of 146 high-redshift (z&gt;7.5) galaxies from the CANUCS/Technicolor surveys, showcasing photometry in every wide- and medium-band NIRCam filter in addition to ancillary HST data sampling 0.4-5 &mu; m (22 JWST bands out of 29 bands total). Additionally, 48 (33&percnt;) galaxies in our sample meet criteria to be classified as extreme emission line galaxies, 15 (10&percnt;) of which are completely missed by typical dropout selections due to faint UV emission. By fitting the SEDs covering the rest-frame UV to optical at z &gt; 7.5, we investigate the dust obscuration properties, giving an unbiased view of dust buildup in high-redshift galaxies free from spectroscopic follow-up selection effects. Dust attenuation correlates with stellar mass, but more strongly with star formation rate. We find typical galaxies at z&gt;7.5 have ~ 25 &percnt; of their star formation obscured. However, since galaxies with higher star formation rates suffer more attenuation, ~ 50 &percnt; of the total star formation rate density at 7.5&lt;z&lt;9 is obscured. The obscured fraction drops to ~ 35 &percnt; in our 9&lt;z&lt;12 bin, possibly due to substantial dust grain growth in the interstellar medium not having time to occur. Extrapolating the decline in dust obscuration of galaxies to higher redshifts, we infer that dust obscuration should approach zero at z &gt; 15, implying that epoch as when dust first forms in bright galaxies.

### 214) [2503.01172](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01172v2): Detection Prospects of Electromagnetic Signatures from OGLE-2011-BLG-0462

<p> Shigeo S. Kimura, Lena Murchikova, Kailash C. Sahu </p>
<p>
Stellar-mass isolated black holes (IsoBHs) wandering in interstellar medium (ISM) are expected to be abundant in our Galaxy. Recently, an IsoBH, OGLE-2011-BLG-0462, was unambiguously discovered using astrometric microlensing. We examine prospects for detecting electromagnetic signatures from an accretion flow surrounding the IsoBH. The accretion rate onto the IsoBH should be highly sub-Eddington, which leads to formation of a hot accretion flow. In this paper, we evaluate the detectability of electromagnetic signals from the hot accretion flows in two accretion states: magnetically arrested disk (MAD) and classical radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs). For the MAD scenario, we find that the optical, infrared, and X-ray signals can be detectable by the current best facilities, such as HST, JWST, and Chandra, if the IsoBH is in a warm neutral medium. In contrast, for the classical RIAF scenario, the optical and X-ray emissions are weaker than MAD scenario, leading to unobservable signals for a typical parameter set. Future follow-up observations of OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 will provide a good test for theories of accretion processes.

### 215) [2503.00155](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00155v2): Late-time growth weakly affects the significance of high-redshift massive galaxies

<p> Qianran Xia, Dragan Huterer, Nhat-Minh Nguyen </p>
<p>
Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed massive galaxies at very high redshift (z≃ 7-15). The question of whether the existence of such galaxies is expected in the corresponding JWST surveys has received a lot of attention, though the answer straddles areas of cosmology and complex astrophysical details of high-redshift galaxy formation. The growth rate of density fluctuations determines the amplitude of overdensities that collapse to form galaxies. Late-time modifications of growth, combined with measurements at both z~ 1 from large-scale structure and z~ 1000 from the cosmic microwave background, affect the predictions for the abundance of first galaxies in the universe. In this paper, we point out that the late-time growth rate of structure affects the statistical significance of high-redshift, high-mass objects very weakly. Consequently, if the existence and abundance of these objects are confirmed to be unexpected, the variations in the late-time growth history are unlikely to explain these anomalies.

### 216) [2502.21281](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21281v2): JWST/MIRI Study of the Enigmatic Mid-Infrared Rings in the Planetary Nebula NGC 1514

<p> Michael E. Ressler, Alba Aller, David Jones, Ryan M. Lau, Luis F. Miranda, Karen Willacy </p>
<p>
While NGC 1514 is an elliptical, but complex, planetary nebula at optical wavelengths, it was discovered to have a pair of infrared-bright, axisymmetric rings contained within its faint outer shell during the course of the WISE all-sky survey. We have obtained JWST mid-infrared imaging and spectroscopy of the nebula through the use of simultaneous observations with the MIRI Imager and Medium Resolution Spectrometer, selecting the F770W, F1280W, and F2550W filters to match each of the MRS's three grating positions. These observations show that the rings are clearly resolved and relatively distinct structures, with both filamentary and clumpy detail throughout. There is also cloud-like material that has a turbulent appearance in the interior of the rings, particularly at the longest wavelengths, and faint ejecta-like structures just outside the ring boundaries. Despite their brightness, the emission from the rings within the three imager passbands is shown to be dominated by thermal emission from very small grains, not line emission from atomic hydrogen or forbidden atomic lines, shocked molecular hydrogen, or PAHs. The doppler velocities derived from the two brightest emission lines in the rings, however, suggest that the material from which the rings were formed was ejected during an early period of very heavy mass loss from the PN progenitor, then shaped by asymmetrical fast winds from the central binary pair.

### 217) [2502.18464](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18464v2): Unveiling the Aromatic and Aliphatic Universe at Redshifts z~0.2&ndash;0.5 with JWST NIRCam/WFSS

<p>
Utilizing deep NIRCam/WFSS data from JWST's FRESCO program, we spectroscopically survey the 3.3 &mu; m aromatic and 3.4 &mu; m aliphatic C&ndash;H stretching emission bands of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules in galaxies at redshifts z~0.2&ndash;0.5. Unlike pre-JWST studies, largely limited to infrared (IR)-bright galaxies (L_IR≳10^11~L<sub>&odot;</sub>) at z≲0.1, we probe 200 galaxies down to L_IR~10^8.5&ndash;10^10~L<sub>&odot;</sub> well beyond the local Universe. The 3.3 &mu; m emission is detected at ≥3-&sigma; in 88 out of 187 galaxies, correlating tightly with galaxy IR luminosity and star formation rate (SFR) and confirming the 3.3 &mu; m PAH as a viable SFR tracer. Despite a large scatter, the 3.3 &mu; m-to-IR luminosity ratio (L_3.3/L_IR) exhibits a strong metallicity dependence with a drop of L_3.3/L_IR by a factor of ≳10 at 12+log(O/H)~8.4&ndash;8.5 towards lower metallicities. The 3.4 &mu; m emission is detected in 37 out of 159 galaxies, with the 3.4 &mu; m-to-3.3 &mu; m luminosity ratio (L_3.4/L_3.3) spanning from ~0.05 to ~0.58 (median ~0.19), corresponding to PAH aliphatic fractions of ~0.78%&ndash;8.3% (median ~2.9%) in terms of fractional carbon atoms in aliphatic units. While L_3.4/L_3.3 does not depend significantly on redshift, stellar mass, metallicity, or galaxy morphology, it does decrease with various SFR tracers, suggesting that ultraviolet photons in active star-forming regions may strip aliphatic sidegroups from PAH molecules. Our study showcases the unique power of JWST's NIRCam/WFSS to systematically map PAH aromatic and aliphatic content in statistically significant, less-biased galaxy samples, providing critical insights into PAH chemistry and its connection to galaxy properties.

### 218) [2502.10271](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10271v2): The Rich JWST Spectrum of the Western Nucleus of Arp 220: Shocked Hot Core Chemistry Dominates the Inner Disk

<p>
We present full 3-28 &mu; m JWST MIRI/MRS and NIRSpec/IFU spectra of the western nucleus of Arp 220, the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxy. This nucleus has long been suggested to possibly host an embedded Compton-thick AGN. Millimeter observations of the dust continuum suggest the presence of a distinct 20 pc core with a dust temperature of T_d ≳ 500~K, in addition to a 100 pc circumnuclear starburst disk. However, unambiguously identifying the nature of this core is challenging, due to the immense obscuration, the nuclear starburst activity, and the nearby eastern nucleus. With the JWST integral field spectrographs, we can, for the first time, separate the two nuclei across this full wavelength range, revealing a wealth of molecular absorption features towards the western nucleus. We analyse the rovibrational bands detected at 4-22 &mu; m, deriving column densities and rotational temperatures for 10 distinct species. Optically thick features of C_2H<sub>2</sub>, HCN and HNC suggest that this molecular gas is hidden behind a curtain of cooler dust, and indicate that the column densities of C_2H<sub>2</sub> and HCN are an order of magnitude higher than previously derived from Spitzer observations. We identify a warm HCN component with rotational temperature T_rot = 330~K, which we associate with radiative excitation by the hot inner nucleus. We propose a geometry where the detected molecular gas is located in the inner regions of the starburst disk, directly surrounding the hot 20 pc core. The chemical footprint of the western nucleus is reminiscent of that of hot cores, with additional evidence for shocks. Despite the molecular material's close proximity to the central source, no evidence for the presence of an AGN in the form of X-ray-driven chemistry or extreme excitation is found.

<p>
We leverage JWST data from the COSMOS-Web Survey in order to provide updated measurements on the auto-power spectrum of the now resolved Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) and its coherence with the unresolved soft Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB) observed by Chandra at z &gt; 6. Maps of the CIB in the F277W and F444W NIRCam filters are constructed with sources fainter than AB mag = 25 and cross-correlated with the CXB in the [0.5-2] keV band. We find that on scales between 1 and 1000'' the CIB-CXB cross-power in both NIRCam filters is statistically significant with signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) of 4.80 and 6.20 respectively from redshifts 0 &lt; z &lt; 13. In our high-z (6 &lt; z &lt; 13) interval we find coherence in both filters with a S/N of 7.32 and 5.39 respectively. These results suggest that there are X-ray emitting galaxies resolved by JWST, including star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We fit the large-scale biasing of the IR sources producing the CIB as a function of z with results consistent with prior measurements and place constraints on the CXB flux and biasing at low- and high-z. The CXB flux measurements presented in this study suggest that approximately 94% of the [0.5-2] keV CXB is resolved, and this value is consistent within 2&sigma; with the complete resolution of the [0.5-2] keV CXB.

### 220) [2502.07875](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07875v3): Investigating photometric and spectroscopic variability in the multiply-imaged Little Red Dot A2744-QSO1

Price, Katherine A. Suess, Bingjie Wang, John R. Weaver, Katherine E. Whitaker </p>
<p>
JWST observations have uncovered a new population of red, compact objects at high redshifts dubbed `Little Red Dots' (LRDs), which typically show broad emission lines and are thought to be dusty Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Some of their other features, however, challenge the AGN explanation, such as prominent Balmer breaks and extremely faint or even missing metal high-ionization lines, X-ray, or radio emission, including in deep stacks. Time variability is another, robust, test of AGN activity. Here, we exploit the z=7.045 multiply-imaged LRD A2744-QSO1, which offers a particularly unique test of variability due to lensing-induced time delays between the three images spanning 22 yr (2.7 yr in the rest-frame), to investigate its photometric and spectroscopic variability. We find the equivalent widths (EWs) of the broad H&alpha; and H&beta; lines, which are independent of magnification and other systematics, to exhibit significant variations, up to 18±3 % for H&alpha; and up to 22±8 % in H&beta;, on a timescale of 875 d (2.4 yr) in the rest-frame. This suggests that A2744-QSO1 is indeed an AGN. We find no significant photometric variability beyond the limiting systematic uncertainties, so it currently cannot be determined whether the EW variations are due to line-flux or continuum variability. These results are consistent with a typical damped random walk (DRW) variability model for an AGN like A2744-QSO1 (M_BH=4×10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) given the sparse sampling of the light-curve with the available data. Our results therefore support the AGN interpretation of this LRD, and highlight the need for further photometric and spectroscopic monitoring in order to build a detailed and reliable light-curve.

<p>
Nearby blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCDs) share similar properties with objects from the Epoch of Reionization revealed by JWST, in terms of low stellar mass, low metallicity and high specific star-formation rate. Thus, they represent ideal local laboratories for detailed multi-wavelength studies to understand their properties and the mechanisms shaping them. We report the first JWST MIRI/MRS observations of the BCD SBS 0335-052 E, analyzing MIR emission lines tracing different levels of ionization (e.g., [NeII], [SIV], [NeIII], [OIV], [NeV]) of the ionized gas. SBS 0335-052 E MIR emission is characterized by a bright point source, located in one of the youngest and most embedded stellar clusters (t~3 Myr, A_V~15), and underlying extended high-ionization emission (i.e., [OIV], [NeV]) from the surroundings of the older and less dusty stellar clusters (t&lt; 20 Myr, A_V~8). From the comparison with state-of-the-art models, we can exclude shocks, X-ray binaries, and old stellar populations as the main sources of the high ionization. Interestingly, a 4-16% contribution of a ~10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> intermediate massive black hole (IMBH) is needed to justify the strong [NeV]/[NeII] and would be consistent with optical/UV line ratios from previous studies. However, even IMBH models cannot explain the strongest [OIV]/[NeIII]. Also, star-forming models (regardless of including X-ray binaries) struggle to reproduce even the lower ionization line ratios (e.g., [SIV]/[NeII]) typically observed in BCDs. Overall, while current models suggest the need to account for an accreting IMBH in this high-z analog, limitations still exist in predicting high-ionization emission lines (I.P. &gt;54 eV) when modeling these low-metallicity environments, thus other sources of ionization cannot be fully ruled out.

### 222) [2502.06942](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06942v2): Shedding light on the star formation rate-halo accretion rate connection and halo quenching mechanism via DECODE, the Discrete statistical sEmi-empiriCal mODEl

<p>
Aims: The relative roles of the physical mechanisms involved in quenching galaxy star formation are still unclear. We tackle this fundamental problem with our cosmological semi-empirical model DECODE (Discrete statistical sEmi-empiriCal mODEl), designed to predict galaxy stellar mass assembly histories, from minimal input assumptions. Methods: Specifically, in this work the star formation history of each galaxy is calculated along its progenitor dark matter halo by assigning at each redshift a star formation rate extracted from a monotonic star formation rate-halo accretion rate (SFR-HAR) relation derived from abundance matching between the (observed) SFR function and the (numerically predicted) HAR function, a relation that is also predicted by the TNG100 simulation. SFRs are integrated across cosmic time to build up the mass of galaxies, which may halt their star formation following input physical quenching recipes. Results: In this work we test the popular halo quenching scenario and we find that: 1) the assumption of a monotonic relation between SFR and HAR allows to reproduce the number densities of the bulk of star-forming galaxies in the local Universe; 2) the halo quenching is sufficient to reproduce the statistics of the quenched galaxies and flat (steep) high-mass end of the SMHM relation (SMF); and 3) to align with the observed steep (flat) low-mass end of the SMHM (SMF) additional quenching processes in the least massive haloes are needed. Conclusions: DECODE is an invaluable tool and will pave the way to investigate the origin of newly observed high-redshift objects from the latest ongoing facilities such as JWST and Euclid.

### 223) [2502.05751](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05751v2): On The Very Bright Dropouts Selected Using the James Webb Space Telescope NIRCam Instrument

<p> Bangzheng Sun, Haojing Yan </p>
<p>
The selection of candidate high-redshift galaxies using the dropout technique targeting the Lyman-break signature sometimes yields very bright objects that are too luminous to be easily explained if they are indeed at the expected redshifts. Here we present a systematic study of very bright dropouts selected through successive bands of the NIRCam instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Using the public NIRCam data in four blank fields over 500~arcmin<sup>2</sup>, 300 such objects were found. They have F356W magnitudes &lt;25.1~mag or &lt;26.0~mag depending on the dropout passband, and the majority of them (&gt;80&percnt;) have very red F115W-F356W colors &gt; 2.0~mag, qualifying them as "extremely red objects'' (EROs). We focus on 137 objects that also have mid-IR observations from the JWST MIRI instrument. Their spectral energy distribution analysis shows that these objects are dominated by low-redshift (z~1&ndash;4) galaxies (≳67&percnt;). However, a non-negligible fraction (≳7&percnt;) could be at high redshifts. Seven of our objects have secure spectroscopic redshifts from JWST NIRSpec identifications, and the results confirm this picture: while six are low-redshift galaxies (z≈3), one is a known galaxy at z=8.679 (with M_UV=-22.4~mag and stellar mass M_*=10^9.1M<sub>&odot;</sub>) recovered in our sample. In light of recent theoretical models on early galaxy formation, this confirmed high-redshift galaxy does not pose a challenge. However, as our sample contains very luminous high-redshift candidates in the regime still underexplored (M_UV≤ -23~mag and M_*&gt;10^10.5M<sub>&odot;</sub>), spectroscopic identifications are necessary to ensure they do not create tension with these new models.

### 224) [2502.03522](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03522v2): Towards characterizing dark matter subhalo perturbations in stellar streams with graph neural networks

<p> Peter Xiangyuan Ma, Keir K. Rogers, Ting S. Li, Renée Hložek, Jeremy Webb, Ruth Huang, Julian Meunier </p>
<p>
The phase space of stellar streams is proposed to detect dark substructure in the Milky Way through the perturbations created by passing subhalos - and thus is a powerful test of the cold dark matter paradigm and its alternatives. Using graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) data compression and simulation-based inference (SBI) on a simulated GD-1-like stream, we improve the constraint on the mass of a [10^8, 10^7, 10^6] M<sub>&odot;</sub> perturbing subhalo by factors of [11, 7, 3] with respect to the current state-of-the-art density power spectrum analysis. We find that the GCNN produces posteriors that are more accurate (better calibrated) than the power spectrum. We simulate the positions and velocities of stars in a GD-1-like stream and perturb the stream with subhalos of varying mass and velocity. Leveraging the feature encoding of the GCNN to compress the input phase space data, we then use SBI to estimate the joint posterior of the subhalo mass and velocity. We investigate how our results scale with the size of the GCNN, the coordinate system of the input and the effect of incomplete observations. Our results suggest that a survey with 10 × fewer stars (300 stars) with complete 6-D phase space data performs about as well as a deeper survey (3000 stars) with only 3-D data (photometry, spectroscopy). The stronger constraining power and more accurate posterior estimation motivate further development of GCNNs in combining future photometric, spectroscopic and astrometric stream observations.

<p>
Recent work with JWST has demonstrated its capability to identify and chemically characterize multiple populations in globular clusters down to the H-burning limit. In this study, we explore the kinematics of multiple populations in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae by combining data from JWST, HST, Gaia, and ground-based telescopes. We analyzed velocity dispersion and anisotropy profiles from the cluster center out to ~10R_h. Our findings indicate that while first population (1G) stars' motions are isotropic, second population (2G) stars' motions are significantly radially anisotropic. These results align with the predictions of simulations of the dynamical evolution of clusters where 2G stars are initially more centrally concentrated than 1G stars. Furthermore, we subdivided the 2G population into two subpopulations: 2G_A and 2G_B, with the latter being more chemically extreme. We compared their dynamical profiles and found no significant differences. For the first time, we measured the degree of energy equipartition among the multiple populations of 47 Tucanae. Overall, within the analyzed radial range (~2-4R_h), both populations exhibit a low degree of energy equipartition. The most significant differences between 1G and 2G stars are observed in the tangential velocity component, where 2G stars are characterized by a stronger degree of energy equipartition than 1G stars. In the radial component, the behavior of 1G and 2G stars is more variable, with differences largely dependent on radius. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the ratio of rotational velocity to velocity dispersion is larger for the 2G population. Finally, we found that 1G stars exhibit higher skewness in their tangential proper motions than 2G stars, providing additional evidence of kinematic differences between the two stellar generations.

### 226) [2502.02647](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02647v2): Synergising semi-analytical models and hydrodynamical simulations to interpret JWST data from the first billion years

<p> Valentin Mauerhofer, Pratika Dayal, Martin G. Haehnelt, Taysun Kimm, Joakim Rosdahl, Romain Teyssier </p>
<p>
The field of high redshift galaxy formation has been revolutionised by JWST, which is yielding unprecedented insights on galaxy assembly at early times. Our key aim is to study the physical mechanisms that can explain the unexpected abundance of bright galaxies at z ≥ 11, as well as their metal enrichment and spectral properties. We also use recent data to determine the key sources of reionisation. To do so, we implement cold gas fractions and star formation efficiencies derived from the SPHINX20 high-resolution radiation-hydrodynamics simulation into DELPHI, a semi-analytic model that tracks the assembly of dark matter halos and their baryonic components from z ~ 4.5-40. In addition, we explore two different methodologies to boost galaxy luminosities at z ≥ 11: a stellar initial mass function (IMF) that becomes increasingly top-heavy with decreasing metallicity and increasing redshift (eIMF model), and star formation efficiencies that increase with increasing redshift (eSFE model). Our key findings are: (i) both the eIMF and eSFE models can explain the abundance of bright galaxies at z ≥ 11; (ii) dust attenuation plays an important role for the bright-end of the UV LF at z ≤ 11; (iii) the mass-metallicity relation is in place as early as z ~ 17 in all models although its slope is model-dependent; (iv) within the spread of both models and observations, all of our models are in good agreement with current estimates of &beta; slopes at z ~ 5-17 and Balmer break strengths at z ~ 6-10; (v) in the eIMF model, galaxies at z≥12 or with M_UV≥-18 show values of  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  ~ 10^25.55~[Hz~erg^-1], twice larger than in other models; (vi) star formation in galaxies below 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> is the key driver of reionisation, providing the bulk (~ 85&percnt;) of ionising photons down to its midpoint at z ~ 7.

Rosolowsky, Karin Sandstrom, Sumit Sarbadhicary, Jiayi Sun, Leonardo 'Ubeda </p>
<p>
Radiation pressure is a key mechanism by which stellar feedback disrupts molecular clouds and drives HII region expansion. This includes direct radiation pressure exerted by UV photons on dust grains, pressure associated with photoionization, and infrared (IR) radiation pressure on grains due to dust-reprocessed IR photons. We present a new method that combines high resolution mid-IR luminosities from JWST-MIRI, optical attenuation and nebular line measurements from VLT-MUSE, and HST H&alpha;-based region sizes to estimate the strength of radiation pressure in ≈ 18,000 HII regions across 19 nearby star-forming galaxies. This is the most extensive and direct estimate of these terms beyond the Local Group to date. In the disks of galaxies, we find that the total reprocessed IR pressure is on average 5% of the direct UV radiation pressure. This fraction rises to 10% in galaxy centers. We expect reprocessed IR radiation pressure to dominate over UV radiation pressure in regions where L_F2100W/L_H&alpha;^corr ≳ 75. Radiation pressure due to H ionizations is lower than pressure on dust in our sample, but appears likely to dominate the radiation pressure budget in dwarf galaxies similar to the Small Magellanic Cloud. The contribution from all radiation pressure terms appears to be subdominant compared to thermal pressure from ionized gas, reinforcing the view that radiation pressure is most important in compact, heavily embedded, and young regions.

### 228) [2501.14026](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14026v2): Luminous Mid-IR Selected Type-2 Quasars at Cosmic Noon in SDSS Stripe82 I: Selection, Composite Photometry, and Spectral Energy Distributions

<p>
We analyze 23 spectroscopically confirmed Type-2 quasars (QSOs) selected from the WISE 22&mu;m band in the SDSS Stripe 82 region, focusing on their multi-band photometry and spectral energy distributions (SEDs). These objects were selected to be IR-luminous (flux_W4 &gt; 5mJy, i.e., 12.62 &lt; W4 &lt; 14.62  AB   magnitude), optically faint (r &gt; 23) or with red color (r - W4 &gt;8.38). Gemini/GNIRS observations were conducted for all 24 candidates, and 18/24 were also observed with Keck/LRIS. The observations confirm 23 to be real Type-2 QSOs in the redshift range 0.88 - 2.99 (12 are at z&gt;2). We collect multi-band photometry and conduct SED fitting. The composite photometry probes the wavelength from 0.1&mu;m to 10&mu;m at the rest frame. The IR emission is dominated by dust torus implying an average torus luminosity for the sample of L_torus 10^46.84 erg/s. The origin of the rest-UV/optical light is not definitive, but we present three possible scenarios: scattered light, stellar emission, and the reddened accretion disk. Assuming an obscured:unobscured ratio of approximately 1:1, our targets have L_bol = 10^46.28 erg  s<sup>-1</sup> - 10^47.49 erg  s<sup>-1</sup> and around SMBH masses 10^8.18 M<sub>&odot;</sub> - 10^9.39 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, assuming they accreate at the Eddington limit. Compared to previous Type-2 AGN SEDs, our targets have a brighter dust torus and redder optical-IR color. By comparing the SED to the results from JWST `little red dots' (LRDs), we find that these IR-selected Type-2 QSOs have similar SED shapes to the LRDs. This pilot Type-2 QSO survey demonstrates that mid-IR selection is an efficient way to find luminous Type-2 QSOs at z&gt;2. Finally, the composite photometry and Type-2 QSOs SED model generated by this sample provide a guide for finding more Type-2 QSOs at higher redshift.

### 229) [2501.13899](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13899v2): The Pitfalls of Using Lyman Alpha Damping Wings in High-z Galaxy Spectra to Measure the Intergalactic Neutral Hydrogen Fraction

<p> Mason Huberty, Claudia Scarlata, Matthew J. Hayes, Simon Gazagnes </p>
<p>
The Lyman Alpha damping wing is seen in absorption against the spectra of high-redshift galaxies. Modeling of this wing is a way to measure the volume neutral hydrogen fraction of the Universe, as well as to measure the strength of HI absorption in the form of a damped Ly&alpha; absorber (DLA). We use very high-quality ultraviolet spectra of low-z galaxies to create mock high-redshift, low-resolution spectra complete with a damping wing resulting from the IGM and HI absorption from local, dense gas to mimic current James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of the early universe. The simulated spectra are used to test the ability to recover the "true" values of the column density of the DLA (N_DLA) and the volume neutral hydrogen fraction (x_HI) of the IGM through modified stellar continuum fitting. We find that the ability to recover the true values of N_DLA and x_HI simultaneously is compromised by degeneracies between these two parameters, and the spectral shape itself at low-resolution (R~100). The root mean squared error between the recovered and true column density of the DLAs is on the order of 1 dex. This error somewhat decreases with improved resolution (R~1000), but systematically underestimates N_DLA when Ly&alpha; emission is present in the mock spectra. The recovered values of x_HI are poorly constrained and do not improve substantially with the higher resolution. We recommend accounting for these sources of uncertainty and biases when using galaxies' Ly&alpha; damping wings to measure the intergalactic neutral hydrogen fraction.

We explore the evolving relationship between galaxies and their dark matter halos from z ~ 0.1 to z ~ 12 using mass-limited angular clustering measurements in the 0.54 deg<sup>2</sup> of the COSMOS-Web survey. This study provides the first measurements of the mass-limited two-point correlation function at z ≥ 10 and a consistent analysis spanning 13.4 Gyr of cosmic history, setting new benchmarks for future simulations and models. Using a halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework, we derive characteristic halo masses and the stellar-to-halo mass relationship (SHMR) across redshifts and stellar mass bins. Our results first indicate that HOD models fit data at z ≥ 2.5 best when incorporating a non-linear scale-dependent halo bias, boosting clustering at non-linear scales (r = 10-100 kpc). We find that galaxies at z &gt; 10.5 with log(M<sub>&sext;</sub> / M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 8.85 are hosted by halos with M_h ~ 10^10.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, achieving a star formation efficiency (SFE) M<sub>&sext;</sub> / (f_b M_h) up to 1 dex higher than at z ≤ 1. The high galaxy bias at z ≥ 8 suggests that these galaxies reside in massive halos with intrinsic high SFE. Our SHMR evolves significantly with redshift, starting high at z ≥ 10.5, decreasing until z ~ 2 - 3, then increasing again until the present. Current simulations fail to reproduce both massive high-z galaxies and this evolution, while semi-empirical models linking SFE to halo mass, accretion rates, and redshift align with our findings. We propose that z &gt; 8 galaxies experience bursty star formation without significant feedback altering their growth, driving the rapid growth of massive galaxies observed by JWST. Over time, increasing feedback efficiency and exponential halo growth suppress star formation. At z ~ 2 - 3 and after, halo growth slows down while star formation continues, supported by gas reservoirs in halos.

<p>
We present an analysis of the rest-frame optical (&lambda; ≃ 3100-5600  &#8491;) spectrum of a log_10(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 8.6 star-forming galaxy at z=8.271 from JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution observations taken as part of the EXCELS survey. The galaxy (EXCELS-63107) is compact, with a size consistent with the size of local star-forming cluster complexes (r_e &lt; 200   pc) and has an extremely steep UV continuum measured from JWST/NIRCam photometry (&beta;=-3.3±0.3). The JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectrum of EXCELS-63107 is notable for its strong [OIII]&lambda;4363 auroral-line emission relative to the [OIII]&lambda;5007 forbidden line. Via a detailed emission-line and photoionization-modelling analysis, we find that the the observed properties of EXCELS-63107 are consistent with the presence of an ionizing source with an effective temperature of T_eff ≳ 80   000 K heating ionized gas with a density of n_e &lt; 10^4   cm^-3 to a volume-averaged electron temperature of T_e ≃ 34   000 K. Crucially, we find that stellar population models assuming a standard IMF are not capable of producing the required heating. We determine an oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H)= 6.89^+0.26_-0.21 which is one of the lowest directly constrained oxygen abundances measured in any galaxy to date, and ≃ 10 × lower than is typical for z≃8 galaxies with the same stellar mass. The extremely low metallicity of EXCELS-63107 places it in a regime in which theoretical models expect a transition to a top-heavy IMF, and we speculate that a ≃ 10-30   × excess of M &gt; 50   M<sub>&odot;</sub> stars is one plausible explanation for its observed properties. However, more exotic scenarios, such as Pop III star formation within a mildly enriched halo, are also consistent with the observations.

### 232) [2501.09810](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09810v2): The cosmic evolution of FRBs inferred from CHIME/FRB Baseband Catalog 1

<p> Om Gupta, Paz Beniamini, Pawan Kumar, Steven L. Finkelstein </p>
<p>
Redshift and luminosity distributions are essential for understanding the cosmic evolution of extragalactic objects and phenomena, such as galaxies, gamma-ray bursts, and fast radio bursts (FRBs). For FRBs, these distributions are primarily estimated using the fluence and the Dispersion Measure (DM). Calibrating their joint distribution has been challenging due to a lack of accurate fluences in the intensity data of the CHIME/FRB survey. Using the baseband update of CHIME/FRB Catalog 1, we calibrate the 2D fluence-DM distribution for the first time. We find the energy distribution is described well by a Schechter function with power-law slope of -1.94^+0.14_-0.12. Testing two types of redshift evolution models suggests a likely combination of young and old formation channels. 31^+31_-21% of FRB sources may track star formation, or correspondingly, FRB sources may have delay times of 1.94^+1.54_-1.31 Gyr. A pure star formation tracking population is excluded by only one model at &gt; 2&sigma; confidence. An updated cosmic star formation rate density evolution up to redshift 14 is constrained by compiling results from several JWST studies. The furthest FRB detection with planned radio facilities is expected to be at z ≈ 5. A radio telescope operating at 200 MHz with a system-equivalent flux density of ≤ 0.07 Jy (equivalent to a detection threshold of 1 mJy ms) and instantaneous sky coverage of ≳ 400 square degrees should be able to detect 630^+730_-485 FRBs year^-1 at z ≳ 6 and 53^+83_-43 FRBs year^-1 at z≳ 8, which is sufficient to differentiate between reionization histories.

Galaxy groups with M_tot ≲ 10^14 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and up to a few tens of members are the most common galaxy environment, marking the transition between field and massive clusters. Identifying groups plays a crucial role in understanding structure formation and galaxy evolution. Modern deep surveys allow us to build well-characterized samples of groups up to the regime where structures were taking shape. We aimed to build the largest deep catalog of galaxy groups to date over the COSMOS-Web field effective area of 0.45 deg<sup>2</sup>, leveraging the deep high quality data of the new COSMOS-Web photometric catalog resulted from the James Webb Space Telescope observations of the COSMOS-Web field. We performed the group search with the AMICO algorithm, a linear matched filter based on an analytical model for the group signal. AMICO has already been tested in wide and deep field surveys, including COSMOS data up to z=2. In this work, we tested the algorithm performances at even higher redshift and searched for protocluster cores at z&gt;2. We compiled a list of known protoclusters in COSMOS at 2 ≤ z ≤ 3.7, matched them with our detections and studied the clustering of the detected cores. We estimated purity and completeness of our sample by creating data-driven mocks with the SinFoniA code and linked signal-to-noise to purity. We detected 1678 groups in the COSMOS-Web field up to z=3.7, including lists of members extending nearly two magnitudes deeper than the previous AMICO-COSMOS catalog. 756 groups were detected with purity of 80&percnt;. More than 500 groups have their redshift confirmed by assigning spectroscopic counterparts. This group catalog offers a unique opportunity to explore galaxy evolution in different environments spanning ~12 Gyr and to study groups, from the least rich population to the formation of the most massive clusters.

<p>
In this work we estimate the explosion and progenitor properties of six Type II supernovae (SNe) at 0.675 ≤ z ≤ 3.61 discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) transient survey by modeling their light curves. Two Type II SNe are found to have high explosion energies of 3e51 erg, while the other four Type II SNe are estimated to have typical explosion energies found in the local Universe [(0.5-2)e51 erg]. The fraction of Type II SNe with high explosion energies might be higher at high redshifts because of, e.g., lower metallicity, but it is still difficult to draw a firm conclusion because of the small sample size and potential observational biases. We found it difficult to constrain the progenitor masses for Type II SNe in our sample because of the sparse light-curve data. We found two Type II SN light curves can be better reproduced by introducing confined, dense circumstellar matter. Thus, the confined, dense circumstellar matter frequently observed in nearby Type II SNe is likely to exist in Type II SNe at high redshifts as well. Two Type II SNe are estimated to have high host galaxy extinctions, showing the ability of JWST to discover dust-obscured SNe at high redshifts. More high-redshift Type II SNe are required to investigate the differences in the properties of Type II SNe near and far, but here we show the first glimpse into the high-redshift population of Type II SNe.

### 235) [2501.07291](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07291v2): TP-AGB stars and stellar population properties of a post-starburst galaxy at z ~ 2 through optical and NIR spectroscopy with JWST

<p>
We present a detailed optical and NIR spectral analysis of J-138717, a post-starburst galaxy at z = 1.8845 observed with JWST/NIRSpec, for which we derive a stellar mass of 3.5 ± 0.2 × 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and a stellar velocity dispersion of 198 ± 10 km s<sup>-1</sup>. We estimate an age of ~0.9 Gyr and a sub-solar metallicity (between -0.4 and -0.2 dex). We find generally consistent results when fitting the optical and NIR wavelength ranges separately or using different model libraries. The reconstruction of the star formation history indicates that the galaxy assembled most of its mass quickly and then rapidly quenched, ~0.4 Gyr prior to observation. Line diagnostics suggest that the weak emission is probably powered by residual star formation (SFR~0.2M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1) or a low-luminosity AGN, with no strong evidence for outflows in ionized or neutral gas. We perform a detailed study of the NIR spectral indices by comparing observations with predictions of several state-of-the-art stellar population models. This is unprecedented at such a high redshift. In particular, the analysis of several CO and CN features argues against a heavy contribution of Thermally Pulsating (TP-)AGB stars. Observations align better with models that include a minimal contribution from TP-AGB stars, but they are also consistent with a mild contribution from TP-AGB stars, assuming a younger age (consistent with the fits). The analysis of other NIR spectral indices shows that current models struggle to reproduce observations. This highlights the need for improved stellar population models in the NIR, especially at young ages and low metallicities, which is most relevant for studying high redshift galaxies in the JWST era.

### 236) [2501.07119](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07119v3): Can Dark Stars account for the star formation efficiency excess at very high redshifts?

<p> Lei Lei, Yi-Ying Wang, Guan-Wen Yuan, Tong-Lin Wang, Martin A. T. Groenewegen, Yi-Zhong Fan </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently conducted observations of massive galaxies at high redshifts, revealing a notable anomaly in their star formation efficiency (SFE). Motivated by the recent identification of three ~ 10^6M<sub>&odot;</sub> dark star candidates, we investigate whether dark stars can be the origin of the SFE excess. It turns out that the excess can be reproduced by a group of dark stars with M ≳ 10^3  M<sub>&odot;</sub>, because of their domination in generating primary UV radiation in high-redshift galaxies. The genesis of these dark stars is attributed to the capture of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) within a mass range of tens of GeV to a few TeV. However, if the top-heavy initial mass function of dark stars holds up to ~ 10^5M<sub>&odot;</sub>, the relic black holes stemming from their collapse would be too abundant to be consistent with the current observations of Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). We thus suggest that just a small fraction of SFE excess may be contributed by the very massive dark stars and the majority likely originated from other reasons such as the Population III stars in view of their rather similar UV radiation efficiencies.

<p> Yuta Kageura, Masami Ouchi, Minami Nakane, Hiroya Umeda, Yuichi Harikane, Shintaro Yoshiura, Kimihiko Nakajima, Hidenobu Yajima, Tran Thi Thai </p>
<p>
We present the statistical properties of Ly&alpha; emission in 586 galaxies at z=4.5-14.2, observed by multiple JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy projects, including JADES, GLASS, CEERS, and GO/DDT programs. We obtain Ly&alpha; equivalent width (EW), Ly&alpha; escape fraction, and ionizing photon production efficiency measurements or upper limits for these galaxies, and confirm that the Ly&alpha; emitting galaxy fraction decreases towards higher redshifts. We derive Ly&alpha; luminosity functions from z~ 5 to z~ 10-14 with the observed Ly&alpha; EW distributions and galaxy UV luminosity functions, and find a ~3 dex decrease in number density at L_Ly&alpha;=10^42-10^43 erg s<sup>-1</sup> over the redshift range. Notably, this study presents the first constraints on the Ly&alpha; luminosity function at z~ 8-14. We obtain the neutral hydrogen fractions of x_HI=0.17_-0.16^+0.23, 0.63_-0.28^+0.18, 0.79_-0.21^+0.13, and 0.88_-0.13^+0.11 at z~6, 7, 8-9, and 10-14, respectively, via comparisons of the reionization models developed by semi-numerical simulations with 21cmFAST explaining the observations of Ly&alpha;, UV continuum, and Planck electron optical depth. The high x_HI values over z~ 7-14 suggest a late and sharp reionization, with the primary reionization process occurring at z~ 6-7. Such a late and sharp reionization is not easily explained by either a clumpy inter-galactic medium or sources of reionization in a classical faint-galaxy or a bright-galaxy/AGN scenario, unless a very high escape fraction or AGN duty cycle is assumed at z~ 6-7.

### 238) [2501.03309](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03309v2): Little Red Dots are Tidal Disruption Events in Runaway-Collapsing Clusters

<p> Jillian Bellovary </p>
<p>
I hypothesize a physical explanation for the "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The first star formation in the universe occurs in dense clusters, some of which may undergo runaway collapse and form an intermediate mass black hole. This process would appear as a very dense stellar system, with recurring tidal disruption events (TDEs) as stellar material is accreted by the black hole. Such a system would be compact, UV-emitting, and exhibit broad H-alpha emission. If runaway collapse is the primary mechanism for forming massive black hole seeds, this process could be fairly common and explain the large volume densities of LRDs. In order to match the predicted number density of runaway collapse clusters, the tidal disruption rate must be on the order of 10^-4 per year. A top-heavy stellar initial mass function may be required to match observations without exceeding the predicted LambdaCDM mass function. The TDE LRD hypothesis can be verified with followup JWST observations looking for TDE-like variability.

### 239) [2501.03217](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03217v2): No evidence (yet) for increased star-formation efficiency at early times

<p> C. T. Donnan, J. S. Dunlop, R. J. McLure, D. J. McLeod, F. Cullen </p>
<p>
Early JWST observations have revealed substantial numbers of galaxies out to redshifts as high as z ≃ 14, reflecting a slow evolution of the galaxy UV luminosity function (LF) not anticipated by many models of galaxy evolution. The discovery of fairly massive galaxies at early times has again been viewed as a challenge to our understanding of early galaxy growth or even &Lambda;CDM cosmology. Here we develop and test a simple theoretical model which shows that these observations are unsurprising, but instead are arguably as expected if one assumes a non-evolving halo-mass dependent galaxy-formation efficiency consistent with that observed today. Crucially, this model matches the observed galaxy UV LF at z ≃ 6-13 and the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) at z ≃ 6-8. Using new constraints on Lyman continuum escape and the ionizing photon production efficiency, we also predict the progress of cosmic hydrogen reionization consistent with current observations. The requirement to fit both the UV LF and the GSMF breaks the degeneracy between mass-to-light ratio and star-formation efficiency, where the typical mass-to-light ratio of galaxies increases systematically with redshift beyond z ≃ 6. However, at present this does not require changes to the IMF, cosmic dust, or any other new astrophysics. Rather, the current data can be reproduced simply by assuming ever-younger stellar populations consistent with a formation epoch at z ≃ 15. A key prediction of our model therefore is that there should be a more rapid drop-off in the galaxy number density beyond z ≃ 15, where one can no longer appeal to ever younger ages to offset the precipitous descent of the halo mass function.

### 240) [2412.18654](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18654v2): Diffuse Neutrino Signals from Dark Stars Seeding Super-Massive Black Holes

<p> Thomas Schwemberger, Volodymyr Takhistov </p>
<p>
Dark stars (DSs) &ndash; first stars powered by dark-matter (DM) heating rather than fusion &ndash; could form in the early Universe. They can grow to ≳ 10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> masses and collapse into seeds of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We demonstrate that diffuse neutrino flux generated by DSs can be observable in existing experiments and have energies reaching hundreds of MeV, providing novel window for probing SMBH progenitors. We establish first constraints on DSs and DM annihilations powering them using data from Super-Kamiokande and IceCube neutrino experiments, and consistent with James Webb Space Telescope observations. Upcoming experiments such as Hyper-Kamiokande, DUNE, JUNO will be able to explore DS properties with enhanced sensitivity.

### 241) [2412.16440](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16440v2): Coevolution of Dwarf Galaxies and Their Circumgalactic Medium Across Cosmic Time

<p> Pei-Cheng Tung, Ke-Jung Chen </p>
<p>
Dwarf galaxies are thought of as the building blocks of large galaxies such as our Milky Way. This paper presents new high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies and their intergalactic medium with the ttGIZMO code. Our simulations consider the key physical processes of galaxy evolution, such as gas cooling, chemistry, and stellar and black hole feedback. Unlike the previous work, the initial conditions of our simulations taking the dwarf galaxies of 2-5 × 10^10   M<sub>&odot;</sub> from the realistic cosmology simulations, ttIllustrisTNG. We further increase the original resolution of ttIllustrisTNG by a factor of ~ 100 via a particle splitting scheme. Our results show that the evolution of complex multiphase CGM and its metal content is sensitive to the redshift of dwarf galaxies. The accretion of CGM into dwarf galaxies plays a key role in providing 20 &percnt; - 50 &percnt; of the star-forming gas and replenishing 40 &percnt; - 70 &percnt; of the total mass in the galactic disk. Furthermore, the accretion history of supermassive black holes in the centers of high-z dwarf galaxies shows episodic patterns with high-accreting states close to ~ 10 &percnt; of the Eddington mass accretion rate, implying the rapid growth of supermassive black holes in the early universe, which may be revealed by the coming observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

### 242) [2412.14685](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14685v3): The JWST/NIRSpec view of the nuclear region in the prototypical merging galaxy NGC 6240

<p>
Merger events are thought to be an important phase in the assembly of massive galaxies. At the same time, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) play a fundamental role in the evolution of their star formation histories. Both phenomena can be observed at work in NGC 6240, a local prototypical merger, classified as an UltraLuminous InfraRed Galaxy (ULIRG) thanks to its elevated infrared luminosity. Interestingly, NGC 6240 hosts two AGN separated by 1.5''(~ 735 pc), detected in both X-ray and radio band. Taking advantage of the unprecedented sensitivity and wavelength coverage provided by the Integral Field Unit (IFU) of the NIRSpec instrument onboard JWST, we observed the nuclear region of NGC 6240 in a FoV of 3.7'' x 3.7''(1.9 x 1.9 kpc<sup>2</sup>), to investigate gas kinematics and InterStellar Medium (ISM) properties with a high spatial resolution of ~ 0.1'' (or ~ 50 pc). We separated the different gas kinematic components through multi-Gaussian fitting and studied the excitation properties of the ISM from the NIR diagnostic diagram based on the H<sub>2</sub> 1-0 S(1)/BrGamma and [Fe II]1.257micron/PaBeta lines ratios. We isolated the ionization cones of the two nuclei, and detected coronal lines emission from both of them. Using H<sub>2</sub> line ratios, we found that the molecular hydrogen gas is excited mostly by thermal processes. We computed a hot molecular gas mass of 1.3 x 10^5 M_sun and an ionized gas mass in the range of 10^5 - 10^7 M_sun. We studied with unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity the kinematics of the molecular and ionized gas phases. We revealed the complex structure of the molecular gas and found a blueshifted outflow near the Southern nucleus, together with filaments connecting a highly redshifted H<sub>2</sub> cloud with the two nuclei. We speculate on the possible nature of this H<sub>2</sub> cloud and propose two possible scenarios: either outflowing gas, or a tidal cloud falling onto the nuclei.

<p>
We present a spectroscopic analysis of two star-forming galaxies at z≃5 observed with JWST/NIRSpec as part of the EXCELS survey. The detection of the CIII]~&lambda;&lambda;1906,09, [OII] &lambda;&lambda;3726,29, [OIII] &lambda;&lambda;4363,5007, and [NII] &lambda;6584 emission lines enables an investigation of the C/O, N/O, and C/N abundance ratios using the temperature-sensitive method. The galaxies have stellar masses of log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 8.09^+  0.24_-0.15 and log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 8.02^+  0.06_-0.08 with metallicities of Z ≃ 0.2   Z<sub>&odot;</sub> and Z ≃ 0.3   Z<sub>&odot;</sub>. These metallicities are somewhat higher than is typical for other z≳ 5 galaxies with similar stellar mass and are comparable to z ≃ 0 analogues. Both galaxies display evidence for elevated N/O ratios with respect to the typical star-forming galaxies at z≃0, with log(N/O) = -1.07^+ 0.17_-0.13 and log(N/O) = -0.86^+ 0.15_-0.11 respectively. In contrast, we find low C abundances, with log(C/O)=-0.82±0.22 and log(C/O)=-1.02±0.22, consistent with the predicted yields of core-collapse supernovae. Following the trend observed in other high-redshift sources, we find that the C/N ratios are lower at fixed O/H compared to the majority of local galaxies. Via a comparison to detailed chemical evolution models, we find that a standard or bottom-heavy IMF can explain the observed abundance ratios where the N-enrichment comes from intermediate mass (≃ 4-7   M<sub>&odot;</sub>) stars. Our results demonstrate that robust measurements of CNO abundances with phJWST can reveal unique enrichment pathways in galaxies as a function of both metallicity and redshift.

<p>
We use hierarchical Bayesian modelling to calibrate a network of 32 all-sky faint DA white dwarf (DA WD) spectrophotometric standards (16.5 &lt; V &lt; 19.5) alongside three CALSPEC standards, from 912 &#8491; to 32 &mu;m. The framework is the first of its kind to jointly infer photometric zeropoints and WD parameters (surface gravity log g, effective temperature T_eff, extinction A_V, dust relation parameter R_V) by simultaneously modelling both photometric and spectroscopic data. We model panchromatic Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (HST/WFC3) UVIS and IR photometry, HST/STIS UV spectroscopy and ground-based optical spectroscopy to sub-percent precision. Photometric residuals for the sample are the lowest yet yielding &lt;0.004 mag RMS on average from the UV to the NIR, achieved by jointly inferring time-dependent changes in system sensitivity and WFC3/IR count-rate nonlinearity. Our GPU-accelerated implementation enables efficient sampling via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, critical for exploring the high-dimensional posterior space. The hierarchical nature of the model enables population analysis of intrinsic WD and dust parameters. Inferred spectral energy distributions from this model will be essential for calibrating the James Webb Space Telescope as well as next-generation surveys, including Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

### 245) [2412.05668](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05668v3): Kinematic evidence of magnetospheric accretion for Herbig Ae stars with JWST NIRSpec

<p> Ciarán Rogers, Bernhard Brandl, Guido de Marchi </p>
<p>
Hydrogen emission lines have been used to estimate the mass accretion rate of pre-main-sequence stars for over 25 years, although the physical origin of these lines is still unclear. Magnetospheric accretion (MA) and magneto-centrifugal winds are the two most often invoked mechanisms. Using a combination of HST photometry and new JWST NIRSpec spectra in the range 1.66 - 3.2  &mu; m, we analysed the emission line spectra of five sources to attempt to reveal the physical origin of their hydrogen emission lines. These sources reside in NGC 3603, a Galactic massive star forming region. We performed fits of the SEDs of the five sources employing a Markov chain Monte Carlo exploration to estimate T_eff, R_*, M_*, and A(V) for each source. We performed a kinematic analysis across three spectral series of hydrogen lines (Paschen, Brackett, and Pfund). We studied the full width at half maximum and optical depth of the lines in order to constrain the emission origin. We calculated the expected velocities from MA as well as gas in Keplerian orbit for our sources. All five sources have SEDs consistent with young intermediate-mass stars. We classified three of these sources as Herbig Ae type stars based on their T_eff. Hydrogen lines with high upper energy levels n_up tend to be significantly broader than lines with a lower n_up. The optical depth of the emission lines is also highest for the high-velocity component of each line, and it becomes optically thin in the low-velocity component. Emission from magneto-centrifugal winds is not consistent with any of our observations. Two sources are consistent with emission from a Keplerian disc, or MA. The remaining three sources are only consistent with emission from MA. In the future, this approach can be applied to more statistically significant samples of Herbig AeBe spectra, including existing archival observations.

<p> Ciarán Rogers, Guido de Marchi, Bernhard Brandl </p>
<p>
NGC 3603 is the optically brightest massive star forming region (SFR) in the Milky Way, representing a small scale starburst region. Studying young stars in regions like this allows us to assess how star and planet formation proceeds in a dense clustered environment with high levels of UV radiation. JWST provides the sensitivity, unbroken wavelength coverage, and spatial resolution required to study individual pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars in distant massive SFRs in detail for the first time. Using the Micro-Shutter Assembly (MSA) onboard the Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec), multi-object spectroscopy was performed, yielding 100 stellar spectra. We fit the PMS spectra to derive their photospheric properties, extinction, and NIR veiling. From this, we determined the masses and ages of our sources by placing them on the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram (HRD). Their accretion rates were determined by converting the luminosity of hydrogen emission lines to an accretion luminosity. We have classified 42 as actively accreting. Our sources span a range of masses from 0.5 to 7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Twelve of these accreting sources have ages consistent with ≥ 10 Myrs, with four having ages of ≥ 15 Myrs. Their mass accretion rates span 5 orders of magnitude and are systematically higher for a given stellar age and mass than for a comparative sample taken from low-mass SFRs. We report an environmental relationship between M&#775;_acc and the density of ambient molecular gas as traced by nebular H<sub>2</sub> emission.

### 247) [2412.05363](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05363v3): High N/O ratio at high redshift as a result of a strong burst of star formation and differential galactic winds

<p> F. Rizzuti, F. Matteucci, P. Molaro, G. Cescutti, R. Maiolino </p>
<p>
Recent observations by JWST have revealed supersolar ^14N abundances in galaxies at very high redshift. On the other hand, these galaxies show subsolar metallicity. The observed N/O ratios are difficult to reproduce in the framework of chemical evolution models for the Milky Way. Our aim is to reproduce these high N/O ratios with chemical evolution models assuming different histories of star formation triggering galactic winds coupled with detailed nucleosynthesis prescriptions for ^14N, ^12C, ^16O and ^56Fe. We compute several models for small galaxies (10^9  - 10^10  M<sub>&odot;</sub>) with high star formation efficiency and strong galactic winds. These winds are assumed to be differential, carrying out mainly the products of the explosion of core-collapse supernovae. We find that only models with high star formation rates, normal initial mass function, and differential galactic winds can reproduce the observed chemical abundances. We also find that with the same assumptions about star formation and galactic winds, but with a very rapid formation resulting from fast gas infall, we can also reproduce the estimated ages of these objects. We find no necessity to invoke peculiar nucleosynthesis from Population III stars, very massive stars and supermassive stars.

### 248) [2412.03653](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03653v2): Weakness of X-rays and Variability in High-redshift AGNs with Super-Eddington Accretion

<p> Kohei Inayoshi, Shigeo S. Kimura, Hirofumi Noda </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations enable the exploration of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with broad-line emission in the early universe. Despite their clear radiative and morphological signatures of AGNs in rest-frame optical bands, complementary evidence of AGN activity - such as X-ray emission and UV/optical variability - remains rarely detected. The weakness of X-rays and variability in these broad-line emitters challenges the conventional AGN paradigm, indicating that the accretion processes or environments around the central black holes (BHs) differ from those of low-redshift counterparts. In this work, we study the radiation spectra of super-Eddington accretion disks enveloped by high-density coronae. Radiation-driven outflows from the disk transport mass to the poles, resulting in moderately optically-thick, warm coronae formed through effective inverse Comptonization. This mechanism leads to softer X-ray spectra and larger bolometric correction factors for X-rays compared to typical AGNs, while being consistent with those of JWST AGNs and low-redshift super-Eddington accreting AGNs. In this scenario, UV/optical variability is suppressed due to photon trapping within super-Eddington disks, while X-ray emissions remain weak yet exhibit significant relative variability. These characteristics are particularly evident in high-redshift AGNs powered by lower-mass BHs with ≲ 10^7-8~M<sub>&odot;</sub>, which undergo rapid mass accretion following overmassive evolutionary tracks relative to the BH-to-stellar mass correlation in the local universe.

<p>
We report integral field spectroscopy observations with the Near-Infrared Spectrograph on board JWST targeting the 60 kpc environment surrounding the most luminous obscured quasar known at z=4.6. We detect ionized gas filaments on 40 kpc scales connecting a network of merging galaxies likely to form a cluster. We find regions of low ionization consistent with large-scale shock excitation surrounding the central dust-obscured quasar, out to distances nearly eight times the effective stellar radius of the quasar host galaxy. In the nuclear region, we find an ionized outflow driven by the quasar with velocities reaching 13,000 km s<sup>-1</sup>, one of the fastest discovered to date with an outflow rate of 2000 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1 and a kinetic luminosity of 6×10^46 erg s<sup>-1</sup> resulting in coupling efficiency between the bolometric luminosity of the quasar and the outflow of 5%. The kinetic luminosity of the outflow is sufficient to power the turbulent motion of the gas on galactic and circumgalactic scales and is likely the primary driver of the radiative shocks on interstellar medium and circumgalactic medium scales. This provides compelling evidence supporting long-standing theoretical predictions that powerful quasar outflows are a main driver in regulating the heating and accretion rate of gas onto massive central cluster galaxies.

Papovich, N. Pirzkal, P. Santini </p>
<p>
Investigating the ionizing emission of star-forming galaxies is critical to understanding their contribution to reionization and their impact on the surrounding environment. The number of ionizing photons available to reionize the intergalactic medium (IGM) depends not only on the abundance of galaxies but also on their efficiency in producing ionizing photons ( &xi;<sub>ion</sub> ). We aim to estimate the  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  using Balmer lines in a sample of 761 galaxies at 4≤ z ≤ 10 selected from different JWST surveys. We used the available HST and JWST photometry to perform a SED fitting in the sample to determine their physical properties. We used the BAGPIPES code and assumed a delayed exponential model for the star formation history. We used the NIRSpec spectra from prism or grating configurations to estimate Balmer luminosities and then constrained  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  values after dust correction. We find a mean value of 10^25.22Hz erg^-1 for  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  in the sample with an observed scatter of 0.42dex. We find an increase in the median values of  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  which confirms the redshift evolution of  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  found in other works. Regarding the relation with physical properties, we find a decrease of  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  with increasing stellar mass, indicating that low-mass galaxies are efficient producers of ionizing photons. We also find an increase of  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  with increasing specific star formation rate (sSFR) and increasing UV absolute magnitude, which indicates that faint galaxies and with high sSFR are also efficient producers. We also investigated the relation of  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  with the EW([OIII]&lambda;5007) and find that galaxies with the higher EW([OIII]) are the more efficient producers of ionizing photons. Similarly, we find that galaxies with higher O32 ratios and lower gas-phase metallicities (based on the R23 calibration) show higher  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  values.

We investigate UV continuum slopes &beta; of 863 galaxies at z=4-14 using archival JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectra obtained from major JWST GTO, ERS, and GO programs, including JADES, CEERS, and UNCOVER. Among these galaxies, we identify a remarkable galaxy at z=9.25, dubbed EBG-1, with a significantly blue UV slope &beta;=-2.99±0.15, unlike the rest of the galaxies that exhibit red continua or ambiguous blue continua hindered by large uncertainties. We confirm that the &beta; value negligibly changes by the data reduction and fitting wavelength ranges for UV emission/absorption line masking. The extreme blue slope, &beta;=-3.0, rules out significant contributions from dust extinction or AGN activity. Comparing with stellar and nebular emission models, we find that such a blue UV slope cannot be reproduced solely by stellar models even with very young, metal-poor, or top-heavy contiguous star formation associated with strong nebular continua making the UV slopes red, but with a high ionizing photon escape fraction, f<sub>esc</sub>^ion ≳ 0.5, for a weak nebular continuum. While the H&beta; emission line is not detected, likely due to the limited sensitivity of the spectrum, we find moderately weak [O III] &lambda;&lambda;4959,5007 emission lines for the given star-formation rate (3  M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1) and stellar mass (10^8.0   M<sub>&odot;</sub>) that are about three times weaker than the average emission lines, again suggestive of the high ionizing photon escape fraction, f<sub>esc</sub>^ion ~ 0.7 or more. EBG-1 would provide crucial insights into stellar and nebular continuum emission in high-redshift galaxies, serving as an example of the ionizing photon escaping site at the epoch of reionization.

We report the discovery of two galaxy candidates at redshifts between 15.7&lt;z&lt;16.4 in JWST observations from the GLIMPSE survey. These robust sources were identified using a combination of Lyman-break selection and photometric redshift estimates. The ultra-deep NIRCam imaging from GLIMPSE, combined with the strong gravitational lensing of the Abell S1063 galaxy cluster, allows us to probe an intrinsically fainter population (down to M_UV =-17.0 mag) than previously achievable. These galaxies have absolute magnitudes ranging from M_UV = -17.0 to -17.2 mag, with blue (&beta; ≃ -2.87) UV continuum slopes, consistent with young, dust-free stellar populations. The number density of these objects, log_10(&phi;/[Mpc^-3 mag^-1])=-3.47^+0.13_-0.10 at M_UV=-17 is in clear tension with pre-JWST theoretical predictions, extending the over-abundance of galaxies from z~10 to z~ 17. These results, together with the scarcity of brighter galaxies in other public surveys, suggest a steep decline in the bright-end of the UV luminosity function at z ~ 16, implying efficient star formation and possibly a close connection to the halo mass function at these redshifts. Testing a variety of star formation histories suggests that these sources are plausible progenitors of the unusually UV-bright galaxies that JWST now routinely uncovers at z = 10-14. Overall, our results indicate that the luminosity distribution of the earliest star-forming galaxies could be shifting towards fainter luminosities, implying that future surveys of cosmic dawn will need to explore this faint luminosity regime.

### 253) [2411.11972](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11972v2): Disc asymmetry characterisation in JWST-observed galaxies at 1 &lt; z &lt; 4

<p> Ananya Ganapathy, Michael S. Petersen, Rashid Yaaqib, Carrie Filion </p>
<p>
We present a novel technique using Fourier series and Laguerre polynomials to represent morphological features of disc galaxies. To demonstrate the utility of this technique, we study the evolution of disc asymmetry in a sample of disc galaxies drawn from the Extended Groth Strip and imaged by the JWST Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey as well as archival HST observations. We measure disc asymmetry as the amplitude of the of the m = 1 Fourier harmonic for galaxies within redshift ranges of 1 &lt; z &lt; 4 relative to the amplitude of m = 0 harmonic. We show that when viewed in shorter rest frame wavelengths, disc galaxies have a higher asymmetry as the flux is dominated by star forming regions. We find generally low asymmetry at rest frame infrared wavelengths, where our metric tracks asymmetry in morphological features such as bars and spiral arms. We show that higher mass galaxies have lower asymmetry and vice versa. Higher asymmetry in lower mass galaxies comes from lower mass galaxies (typically) having higher star formation rates. We measure the relation between disc galaxy asymmetry and redshift and find no conclusive relationship between them. We demonstrate the utility of the Fourier-Laguerre technique for recovering physically informative asymmetry measurements as compared to rotational asymmetry measurements. We also release the software pipeline and quantitative analysis for each galaxy.

Massive, intensely star-forming galaxies at high redshift require a supply of molecular gas from their gas reservoirs, replenished by infall from the surrounding circumgalactic medium, to sustain their immense star-formation rates. However, our knowledge of the extent and morphology of their cold-gas reservoirs is still in its infancy. We present the results of stacking 80 hours of JVLA observations of CO(1&ndash;0) emission &ndash; which traces the cold molecular gas &ndash; in nineteen z=2.0-4.5 dusty, star-forming galaxies from the AS2VLA survey. The visibility-plane stack reveals extended emission with a half-light radius of 3.8±0.5~kpc, 2&ndash;3× more extended than the dust-obscured star formation and 1.4±0.2× more extended than the stellar emission revealed by JWST. Stacking the [CI](1&ndash;0) observations for ten galaxies from our parent sample yields a half-light radius ≤2.6~kpc, marginally smaller than CO(1&ndash;0). The CO(1&ndash;0) size is also comparable to the [CII] halos detected around high-redshift star-forming galaxies, suggesting these arise from molecular gas. Photo-dissociation region modelling indicates that the extended CO(1&ndash;0) emission arises from clumpy, dense clouds rather than smooth, diffuse gas. Our results show that the bulk (up to 80&percnt;) of molecular gas resides outside the star-forming region; with only a small part directly contributing to their current star formation.

(Abridged) JWST continues to deliver incredibly detailed infrared (IR) images of star forming regions in the Milky Way and beyond. IR emission from star-forming regions is very spectrally rich due to emission from gas-phase atoms, ions, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Physically interpreting IR images of these regions relies on assumptions about the underlying spectral energy distribution in the imaging bandpasses. We aim to provide empirical prescriptions linking line, PAH, and continuum intensities from JWST images, to facilitate the interpretation of JWST images in a wide variety of contexts. We use JWST PDRs4All Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) imaging and Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) integral field unit (IFU) and MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) spectroscopic observations of the Orion Bar photodissociation region (PDR), to directly compare and cross-calibrate imaging and IFU data at ~100 AU resolution over a region where the radiation field and ISM environment evolves from the hot ionized gas to the cold molecular gas. We measure the relative contributions of line, PAH, and continuum emission to the NIRCam and MIRI filters as functions of local physical conditions. We provide empirical prescriptions based on NIRCam and MIRI images to derive intensities of emission lines and PAH features. Within the range of the environments probed in this study, these prescriptions accurately predict Pa-&alpha;, Br-&alpha;, PAH 3.3 &mu;m and 11.2 &mu;m intensities, while those for FeII 1.644 &mu;m, H<sub>2</sub> 1&ndash;0 S(1) 2.12 &mu;m and 1&ndash;0 S(9) 4.96 &mu;m, and PAH 7.7 &mu;m show more complicated environmental dependencies. Linear combinations of JWST NIRCam and MIRI images provide effective tracers of ionized gas, H<sub>2</sub>, and PAH emission in PDRs. We expect these recipes to be useful for both the Galactic and extragalactic communities.

<p> Zijian Zhang, Linhua Jiang, Weiyang Liu, Luis C. Ho </p>
<p>
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a population of red and compact sources at z ≳ 5 known as "Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) that are likely active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here we present a comprehensive study of the variability of 314 LRDs with multi-epoch JWST observations in five deep fields: UDS, GOODS-S, GOODS-N, Abell 2744, and COSMOS. Our analyses use all publicly available JWST NIRCam imaging data in these fields, together with multi-epoch JWST MIRI images available. We measure the significance (signal-to-noise ratio or SNR_var) of the variabilities for all LRDs and statistically evaluate their variabilities using the SNR_var distributions. We pay particular attention to the systematic offsets of photometric zero points among different epochs that seem to commonly exist. The derived SNR_var distributions of the LRDs, including those with broad H&alpha;/H&beta; emission lines, follow the standard Gaussian distribution, and are generally consistent with those of the comparison samples of objects detected in the same images. This finding suggests that the LRD population on average does not show strong variability, which can be explained by super-Eddington accretion of the black holes in AGNs. Alternatively, many of them may be dominated by galaxies. We also find eight strongly variable LRD candidates with variability amplitudes of 0.24 &ndash; 0.82 mag. The rest-frame optical SEDs of these variable LRDs should have significant AGN contribution. Future JWST observations will provide more variability information of LRDs.

<p>
During the last decade, studies about highly attenuated and massive red star-forming galaxies (RedSFGs) at z ~ 4 have suggested that they could constitute a crucial population for unraveling the mechanisms driving the transition from vigorous star formation to quiescence at high redshifts. Since such a transition seems to be linked to a morphological transformation, studying the morphological properties of these RedSFGs is essential to our understanding of galaxy evolution. To this end, we are using JWST/NIRCam images from the CEERS survey to assemble a mass-complete sample of 188 massive galaxies at z=3-4, for which we perform resolved-SED fit. After classifying galaxies into typical blue SFGs (BlueSFGs), RedSFGs and quiescent galaxies (QGs), we compare the morphologies of each population in terms of stellar mass density, SFR density, sSFR, dust-attenuation and mass-weighted age. We find that RedSFGs and QGs present similar stellar surface density profiles and that RedSFGs manifest a dust attenuation concentration significantly higher than that of BlueSFGs at all masses. This indicates that to become quiescent, a BlueSFG must transit through a major compaction phase once it has become sufficiently massive. At the same time, we find RedSFGs and QGs to account for more than 50&percnt; of galaxies with log(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&gt; 10.4 at this redshift. This transition mass corresponds to the "critical mass" delineating the bimodality between BlueSFGs and QGs in the local Universe. We then conclude that there is a bimodality between extended BlueSFGs and compact, highly attenuated RedSFGs that have undergone a major gas compaction phase enabling the latter to build a massive bulb in situ. There is evidence that this early-stage separation is at the origin of the local bimodality between BlueSFGs and QGs, which we refer to as a "primeval bimodality".

<p> Aadarsh Pathak, J. Stuart B. Wyithe, Ralph S. Sutherland, L. J Kewley </p>
<p>
We present [OIII]/H_&beta; emision line flux ratio predictions for galaxies at z ~ 7-9 using the MAPPINGS V v5.2.0 photoionization modelling code combined with an analytic galaxy formation model. Properties such as pressure and ionization parameter that determine emission line properties are thought to evolve towards high redshift. In order to determine the range of expected interstellar conditions we extend previous modelling of the Star Formation Rate Density (SFRD) function to calculate the metallicity and ionization parameter, and incorporate the potential impact of turbulence on the density of the ISM. To validate our emission line predictions we calculate the [OIII] line luminosity and its dependence on UV luminosity, as well as the flux ratio [OIII]/H_&beta; and its variation with the line luminosity, finding that both reproduce recent JWST observations from the FRESCO survey. We also use our model to predict the number counts of emission line galaxies across a range of redshift as well as the dependence of [OIII]/H_&beta; on ionization parameter and metallicity. Finally, we show that the dependence of flux ratio on luminosity may provide a diagnostic of turbulent motion in galactic discs.

### 259) [2410.21409](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21409v2): Constraining bursty star formation histories with galaxy UV and Hα luminosity functions and clustering

<p> Guochao Sun, Julian B. Muñoz, Jordan Mirocha, Claude-André Faucher-Giguère </p>
<p>
The observed prevalence of galaxies exhibiting bursty star formation histories (SFHs) at z≳6 has created new challenges and opportunities for understanding their formation pathways. The degenerate effects of the efficiency and burstiness of star formation on the observed UV luminosity function are separable by galaxy clustering. However, quantifying the timescales of burstiness requires more than just the continuum UV measurements. Here we develop a flexible semi-analytic framework for modeling both the amplitude of star formation rate (SFR) variations and their temporal correlation, from which the luminosity function and clustering can be derived for SFR indicators tracing different characteristic timescales (e.g., UV continuum and H&alpha; luminosities). Based on this framework, we study the prospect of using galaxy summary statistics to distinguish models where SFR fluctuations are prescribed by different power spectral density (PSD) forms. Using the Fisher matrix approach, we forecast the constraints on parameters in our PSD-based model that can be extracted from mock JWST observations of the UV and H&alpha; luminosity functions and clustering bias factors at z~6. These constraints demonstrate the feasibility of constraining the burstiness of high-z galaxies solely from their one-point and two-point statistics and underscore the importance of combining tracers of both long-term and short-term SFR variations. Our flexible framework can be readily extended to characterize the SFH of high-redshift galaxies with a wider range of observational diagnostics.

### 260) [2410.20530](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20530v2): On the Origin of the High Star-Formation Efficiency in Massive Galaxies at Cosmic Dawn

<p> Zachary Lee Andalman, Romain Teyssier, Avishai Dekel </p>
<p>
Motivated by the early excess of bright galaxies seen by JWST, we run zoom-in cosmological simulations of a massive galaxy at Cosmic Dawn, in a halo of 10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z = 9, using the hydro-gravitational code RAMSES at an effective resolution ~ 10~pc. We investigate physical mechanisms that enhance the star-formation efficiencies (SFEs) at the high gas densities of the star-forming regions in this galaxy (~ 3× 10^3~cm^-3, ~ 10^4~M<sub>&odot;</sub>/pc^2). Our fiducial star formation recipe uses a physically-motivated, turbulence-based, multi-freefall model, avoiding ad hoc extrapolation from lower redshifts. By z = 9, our simulated galaxy is a clumpy, thick, rotating disc with a high stellar mass ~ 3× 10^9~M<sub>&odot;</sub> and high star formation rate ~ 50~M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr. The high gas density makes supernova (SN) feedback less efficient, producing a high local SFE ≳ 10&percnt;. The global SFE is set by feedback-driven outflows and only weakly correlated with the local SFE. Photoionization heating makes SN feedback more efficient, but the integrated SFE always remains high. Intense accretion at Cosmic Dawn seeds turbulence which reduces local SFE, but this only weakly affects the global SFE. The star formation histories of our simulated galaxies are similar to observed massive galaxies at Cosmic Dawn, despite our limited resolution. We set the stage for future simulations which treat radiation self-consistently and use a higher effective resolution ~ 1~pc that captures the physics of star-forming clouds.

### 261) [2410.18909](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18909v2): A Study of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Emission in 30 Dor as seen by JWST

<p> Congcong Zhang, Joelene Hales, Els Peeters, Jan Cami, Ameek Sidhu, Junfeng Zhen </p>
<p>
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are responsible for strong mid-IR emission features near star-forming regions. It is well known that low-metallicity environments exhibit weaker PAH emission, but it is not clear how the metallicity affects the properties of the emitting PAH population. We present a detailed study of the PAH emission in the low-metallicity regime represented by 30 Dor in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and we compare it to the PAH emission in the Orion Bar to investigate the characteristics of the PAH population and how the environments affects the resulting IR emission. We analyze JWST observations of 30 Dor that include imaging (NIRCam, MIRI) and spectroscopy (NIRSpec/IFU, MIRI/MRS). We extracted NIRSpec/IFU and MIRI/MRS spectra from 18 apertures that cover the morphological structures of 30 Dor. We characterize the profiles and relative intensities of PAH emission in these apertures. The detailed profiles of the PAH emission bands in 30 Dor are all very similar, and compare well to those from one of the dissociation fronts (DF2) in the Orion Bar. The relative band ratios on the other hand show a much larger range than in the Orion Bar. The PAH emission in 30 Dor originates from a population with a higher ionization fraction than in the Orion Bar, and a size distribution that has more smaller PAHs. Since smaller PAHs typically photo-fragment before larger PAHs, our findings support the hypothesis that the lower PAH emission for lower metallicities is the result of inhibition of growth toward larger PAHs rather than photo-fragmentation.

We present archival HST and JWST ultraviolet through near infrared time series photometric observations of a massive minimal-contact binary candidate in the metal-poor galaxy WLM (Z = 0.14 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>). This discovery marks the lowest metallicity contact binary candidate observed to date. We determine the nature of the two stars in the binary by using the eclipsing binary modeling software (PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs; PHOEBE) to train a neural network to fit our observed panchromatic multi-epoch photometry. The best fit model consists of two hot MS stars (T_1=29800^+2300_-1700 K, M_1=16^+2_-3~M<sub>&odot;</sub>, and T_2=18000^+5000_-5000 K, M_2=7^+5_-3~M<sub>&odot;</sub>). We discuss plausible evolutionary paths for the system, and suggest the system is likely to be currently in a contact phase before ultimately ending in a merger. Future spectroscopy will help to further narrow down evolutionary pathways. This work showcases a novel use of data of JWST and HST imaging originally taken to characterize RR Lyrae. We expect time series imaging from LSST, BlackGEM, etc. to uncover similar types of objects in nearby galaxies.

<p>
The topology of reionization and the environments where galaxies efficiently produce ionizing photons are key open questions. For the first time, we investigate the trend between ionizing photon production efficiency,  &xi;<sub>ion</sub> , and galaxy overdensity, log(1+&delta;). We analyze the ionizing properties of 79 galaxies between 1.0 &lt; z &lt; 5.2 using JWST NIRSpec medium-resolution spectra from the Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument (MIRI) Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES) program. Among these, 67 galaxies have H&alpha; coverage, spanning 1.0 &lt; z &lt; 3.1. The galaxy overdensity, log(1+&delta;), is measured using the JADES photometric catalog, which covers the SMILES footprint. For the subset with H&alpha; coverage, we find that log &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  is positively correlated with log(1+&delta;), with a slope of 0.94_-0.46^+0.46. Additionally, the mean  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  for galaxies in overdense regions (log(1+&delta;) &gt; 0.1) is 2.43 times that of galaxies in lower density regions (log(1+&delta;) &lt; 0.1). This strong trend is found to be independent of redshift evolution. Furthermore, our results confirm the robust correlations between  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  and the rest-frame equivalent widths of the [O III] or H&alpha; emission lines. Our results suggest that galaxies in high-density regions are efficient producers of ionizing photons.

We analyze two galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses, SPT0418-47 and SPT2147-50, using JWST NIRCam imaging across multiple filters. To account for angular complexity in the lens mass distribution, we introduce multipole perturbations with orders m=1, 3, 4. Our results show strong evidence for angular mass complexity in SPT2147, with multipole strengths of 0.3-1.7 &percnt; for m=3, 4 and 2.4-9.5 &percnt; for m=1, while SPT0418 shows no such preference. We also test lens models that include a dark matter substructure, finding a strong preference for a substructure in SPT2147-50 with a Bayes factor (log-evidence change) of ~ 60 when multipoles are not included. Including multipoles reduces the Bayes factor to ~ 11, still corresponding to a 5&sigma; detection of a subhalo with an NFW mass of log_10(M_200/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 10.87\substack+0.53\ -0.71. While SPT2147-50 may represent the fourth detection of a dark matter substructure in a strong lens, further analysis is needed to confirm that the signal is not due to systematics associated with the lens mass model.

The near-infrared (NIR) emission of the youngest protostars still needs to be characterized to better understand the evolution of their accretion and ejection activity. We analyze James Webb Space Telescope NIRSpec 1.7 &ndash; 5.3 &mu;m observations of two deeply embedded sources in the S68N protostellar core in Serpens. The North Central (NC) source exhibits a highly obscured spectrum (A_K ~ 4.8 mag) that is modeled with a pre-main-sequence photosphere and a hot disk component. The photospheric parameters are consistent with a young, low-mass photosphere, as suggested by the low surface gravity, log g of 1.95 ± 0.15 cm s^-2. The hot disk suggests that accretion onto the central protostellar embryo is ongoing, although prototypical accretion-tracing emission lines HI are not detected. The South Central (SC) source, which is even more embedded (A_K ~ 8 mag; no continuum is detected shortward of 3.6 &mu;m) appears to be driving the large-scale S68N protostellar outflow, and launches a collimated hot molecular jet detected in \Ht and CO ro-vibrational lines. Shock modeling of the \Ht (ro)vibrational lines establishes that fast C-type shocks (≥ 30 km s<sup>-1</sup>), with high pre-shock density (≥ 10^7 cm^-3), and strong magnetic field (b ~ 3&ndash;10, where B = b × \sqrtrmn_rmH (rmcm^-3) &mu;rmG) best match the data. The bright CO fundamental line forest suggests energetic excitation, with the contribution of non-LTE effects, ie irradiation pumping. Detected OH and CH^+ ro-vibrational lines support this hypothesis. These two Class 0 protostars seem to be in very young evolutionary stages and still have to acquire the bulk of their final stellar masses. These results demonstrate that JWST enables unprecedented diagnostics of these first stages of the protostellar evolutionary phase.

<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope is revolutionising our ability to understand the host galaxies and local environments of high-z quasars. Here we obtain a comprehensive understanding of the host galaxy of the z=7.08 quasar J1120+0641 by combining NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy with NIRCam photometry of the host continuum emission. Our emission line maps reveal that this quasar host is undergoing a merger with a bright companion galaxy. The quasar host and the companion have similar dynamical masses of ~10^10M<sub>&odot;</sub>, suggesting that this is a major galaxy interaction. Through detailed quasar subtraction and SED fitting using the NIRCam data, we obtain an estimate of the host stellar mass of M<sub>&ast;</sub>=(3.0^+2.5_-1.4)×10^9M<sub>&odot;</sub>, with M_*=(2.7^+0.5_-0.5)×10^9M<sub>&odot;</sub> for the companion galaxy. Using the H&beta; Balmer line we estimate a virial black hole mass of M_BH=(1.9^+2.9_-1.1)×10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Thus, J1120+0641 has an extreme black hole-stellar mass ratio of M_BH/M<sub>&ast;</sub>=0.63^+0.54_-0.31, which is ~3 dex larger than expected by the local scaling relations between black hole and stellar mass. J1120+0641 is powered by an overmassive black hole with the highest reported black hole-stellar mass ratio, in a quasar host that is currently undergoing a major merger &ndash; these new insights highlight the power of JWST for measuring and understanding these extreme first quasars.

### 267) [2410.07377](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07377v2): Constraining Reionization with Lyα Damping-Wing Absorption in Galaxy Spectra: A Machine Learning Model Based on Reionization Simulations

<p>
Recently, NIRSpec PRISM/CLEAR observations by JWST have begun providing rest-frame UV continuum measurements of galaxies at z≳7, revealing signatures of Ly&alpha; damping-wing (DW) absorption by the intergalactic medium (IGM). We develop a methodology to constrain the global ionization fraction of the IGM (Q_HII) using low-resolution spectra, employing the random forest classification (RFC) method. We construct mock spectra using the simulated galaxies and the IGM from the Cosmic Dawn II simulation and train RFC models to estimate Q_HII at the redshift of the source and to detect the presence of a damped Ly&alpha; absorber (DLA). We find that individual galaxy spectra with spectral bins between 1220 and 1270 &#8491; and with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 20 can place tight constraints on Q_HII, provided the UV continuum is accurately modeled. This method is particularly effective for the early phase of reionization (Q_HII&lt;50&percnt;), when the IGM opacity is high in the DW. As a demonstration, we apply our model to existing NIRSpec PRISM/CLEAR spectra, placing upper bounds of Q_HII=59.6&percnt;, 5.6&percnt;, and 18.5&percnt; at z=7.7,~9.4, and 10.6, respectively, with 68&percnt; confidence, though several modeling uncertainties remain to be discussed. These constraints favor late-starting reionization models, where ≳ 80&percnt; of the IGM is ionized after z=8. We conclude that high-SNR observations of carefully selected targets around z~7-9 can effectively constrain reionization models.

### 268) [2410.03337](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03337v2): A negligible contribution of two luminous z ~ 7.5 galaxies to the ionizing photon budget of reionization

<p>
We present indirect constraints on the absolute escape fraction of ionizing photons (f<sub>esc</sub>^LyC) of the system GN 42912 which comprises two luminous galaxies (M_UV magnitudes of -20.89 and -20.37) at z~7.5, GN 42912-NE and GN 42912-SW, to determine their contribution to the ionizing photon budget of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The high-resolution James Webb Space Telescope NIRSpec and NIRCam observations reveal the two galaxies are separated by only ~0.1" (0.5 kpc) on the sky and have a 358 km s<sup>-1</sup> velocity separation. GN 42912-NE and GN 42912-SW are relatively massive for this redshift (log(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ~ 8.4 and 8.9, respectively), with gas-phase metallicities of 18 per cent and 23 per cent solar, O_32 ratios of 5.3 and &gt;5.8, and &beta; slopes of -1.92 and -1.51, respectively. We use the Mg II&lambda;&lambda;2796,2803 doublet to constrain f<sub>esc</sub>^LyC. Mg II has an ionization potential close to that of neutral hydrogen and, in the optically thin regime, can be used as an indirect tracer of the LyC leakage. We establish realistic conservative upper limits on f<sub>esc</sub>^LyC of 8.5 per cent for GN 42912-NE and 14 per cent for GN 42912-SW. These estimates align with f<sub>esc</sub>^LyC trends observed with &beta;, O_32, and the H&beta; equivalent width at z&lt;4. The small inferred ionized region sizes (&lt;0.3 pMpc) around both galaxies indicate they have not ionized a significant fraction of the surrounding neutral gas. While these z&gt;7 f<sub>esc</sub>^LyC constraints do not decisively determine a specific reionization model, they support a minor contribution from these two relatively luminous galaxies to the EoR.

Among the remarkable strides made by JWST is the discovery of the earliest star clusters found to date. These have been proposed as early progenitors of globular clusters, which are known to come from the early stages of star formation in the Universe. This is an exciting development in modern astronomy, as it offers an opportunity to connect theoretical models of globular cluster formation to actual observations of these high-redshift structures. In this work, we aim to develop observational signatures of a star cluster formation route known as supersonically induced gas objects, which are dark matter-less gas clouds in the early Universe proposed as a potential origin of some globular clusters. For the first time, we follow the star formation process of these early Universe objects using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, including mechanical feedback. Our results suggest that the first dark matter-less star clusters are top-heavy, meaning that they have a flatter IMF slope compared to very young low-metallicity star clusters in the local Universe, and they also have extremely high stellar mass surface densities compared to their local counterparts.

<p>
In this paper, we present a simple but compelling argument, focusing on galaxy science, for preserving the main imagers and operational modes of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) for as long as is technically feasible. While star-formation started at redshifts z≳10-13, when the universe was less than 300-500 Myr old, the CSFH did not peak until z≃1.9, and has steadily declined since that time. Hence, at least half of all stars in the universe formed in the era where HST provides its unique rest-frame UV view of unobscured young, massive stars tracing cosmic star-formation. By rendering a subset of the 556.3 hours of available HST images in 12 filters of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) in an appropriate mix of colors, we illustrate the unique capabilities of HST for galaxy science emphasizing that rest-frame UV-optical wavelength range. We then contrast this with the 52.7 publicly available hours of JWST/NIRCam images in 8 filters of the same HUDF area from the JADES project, rendering these at the redder near-IR wavelengths to illustrate the unique capabilities of JWST to detect older stellar populations at higher redshifts, as well as very dusty stellar populations and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). HST uniquely probes (unobscured) young, hot, massive stars in galaxies, while JWST reveals more advanced stages of older stellar populations, as well as relatively short-lived phases where galaxies produce and shed a lot of dust from intense star-formation, and the very high redshift universe (z≳10-11) not accessible by HST. We conclude that HST and JWST are highly complementary facilities that took decades to build to ensure decades of operation. To maximize return on investment on both HST and JWST, ways will need to be found to operate HST imaging instruments in all relevant modes for as long as possible into the JWST mission.

### 271) [2409.18208](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18208v2): "Little red dots" cannot reside in the same dark matter halos as comparably luminous unobscured quasars

<p> Elia Pizzati, Joseph F. Hennawi, Joop Schaye, Anna-Christina Eilers, Jiamu Huang, Jan-Torge Schindler, Feige Wang </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a new population of candidate broad-line AGN emerging in the early Universe, named ''little red dots'' (LRDs) because of their compactness and red colors at optical wavelengths. LRDs appear to be surprisingly abundant (≈ 10^-5 cMpc^-3) given that their inferred bolometric luminosities largely overlap with the ones of the UV-luminous quasars identified at high z in wide-field spectroscopic surveys. In this work, we investigate how the population of LRDs and/or other UV-obscured AGN relates to the one of unobscured, UV-selected quasars. By comparing their number densities, we infer an extremely large and rapidly evolving obscured:unobscured ratio, ranging from ≈20:1 at z≈4 to ≈2300:1 at z≈7, and possibly extending out to very high (≈10^47 erg s<sup>-1</sup>) bolometric luminosities. This large obscured:unobscured ratio is incompatible with the UV-luminous duty cycle measured for unobscured quasars at z≈4-6, suggesting that LRDs are too abundant to be hosted by the same halos as unobscured quasars. This implies that either (a) the bolometric luminosities of LRDs are strongly overestimated (possibly because LRDs are dominated by stellar galaxy light) or (b) LRDs follow different scaling relations than the ones of UV-selected quasars, representing a new population of accreting SMBHs emerging in the early Universe. A direct comparison between the clustering of LRDs and the one of faint UV-selected quasars will ultimately confirm these findings, and shed light on key properties of LRDs such as their host mass distribution and duty cycle. We provide a mock analysis for the clustering of LRDs and show that it is feasible with current and upcoming JWST surveys.

### 272) [2409.15909](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15909v2): The emergence of galactic thin and thick discs across cosmic history

<p> Takafumi Tsukui, Emily Wisnioski, Joss Bland-Hawthorn, Ken Freeman </p>
<p>
Present-day disc galaxies often exhibit distinct thin and thick discs. The formation mechanisms of the two discs and the timing of their onset remain open questions. To address these questions, we select edge-on galaxies from flagship JWST programs and investigate their disc structures in rest-frame, near-infrared bands. For the first time, we identify thick and thin discs at cosmological distances, dating back over 10 Gyr, and investigate their decomposed structural properties. We classify galaxies into those that require two (i.e. thin and thick) discs and those well fitted by a single disc. Disc radial sizes and vertical heights correlate strongly with the total galaxy mass and/or disc mass, independent of cosmic time. The structure of the thick disc resembles discs found in single-disc galaxies, suggesting that galaxies form a thick disc first, followed by the subsequent formation of an embedded thin disc. The transition from single to double discs occurred around 8 Gyr ago in high-mass galaxies (10^9.75 - 10^11M<sub>&odot;</sub>), earlier than the transition which occurred 4 Gyr ago in low-mass galaxies (10^9.0 - 10^9.75M<sub>&odot;</sub>), indicating sequential formation proceeds in a "downsizing" manner. Toomre Q-regulated disc formation explains the delayed thin disc formation in low-mass galaxies, leading to the observed anti-correlation between the thick-to-thin disc mass ratio and the total galaxy mass. Despite the dominant sequential formation, observations suggest that thick discs may continue to build up mass alongside their thin-disc counterparts.

<p>
JWST has revealed diverse new populations of high-redshift (z~4-11) AGN and extreme star-forming galaxies that challenge current models. In this paper, we use rest-frame UV emission-line diagnostics to identify AGN candidates and other exceptional ionizing sources, complementing previous studies predominantly focused on broad-line AGN. From a parent sample of 205 z<sub>spec</sub>&gt;3 UNCOVER galaxies with NIRSpec/PRISM follow-up, we identify 12 C IV, He II, and C III] emitters. Three of these galaxies also exhibit clear N III] and/or N IV] lines. Leveraging the combined rest-optical and UV coverage of PRISM, we limit the emission-line model space using the sample's [O III]/H&beta; distribution, significantly decreasing the overlap between AGN and star-formation models in the UV diagnostics. We then find that the five He II emitters are the strongest AGN candidates, with further support from two [Ne V] detections and one X-ray detection from Chandra. Our Balmer line fits also reveal one new broad-line AGN at z=6.87. We cannot robustly quantify the AGN fraction in this sample, but we note that close to 20% of M_*&gt;2×10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> parent sample galaxies are AGN candidates. The lower-mass line emitters, which are consistent with both AGN and star-forming photoionization models, have more compact sizes and higher specific star formation rates than the parent sample. Higher-resolution and deeper data on these UV line emitters should provide much stronger constraints on the obscured AGN fraction at z &gt; 3.

We present a spatially resolved analysis of four star-forming galaxies at z = 4.44-5.64 using data from the JWST PRIMER and ALMA-CRISTAL surveys to probe the stellar and inter-stellar medium properties on the sub-kpc scale. In the 1-5 &mu;m JWST NIRCam imaging we find that the galaxies are composed of multiple clumps (between 2 and ~ 8) separated by ≃ 5 kpc, with comparable morphologies and sizes in the rest-frame UV and optical. Using BAGPIPES to perform pixel-by-pixel SED fitting to the JWST data we show that the SFR (≃ 25 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr) and stellar mass (log_10(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≃ 9.5) derived from the resolved analysis are in close ( ≲ 0.3 dex) agreement with those obtained by fitting the integrated photometry. In contrast to studies of lower-mass sources, we thus find a reduced impact of outshining of the older (more massive) stellar populations in these normal z ≃ 5 galaxies. Our JWST analysis recovers bluer rest-frame UV slopes (&beta; ≃ -2.1) and younger ages (≃ 100 Myr) than archival values. We find that the dust continuum from ALMA-CRISTAL seen in two of these galaxies correlates, as expected, with regions of redder rest-frame UV slopes and the SED-derived A_V, as well as the peak in the stellar mass map. We compute the resolved IRX-&beta; relation, showing that the IRX is consistent with the local starburst attenuation curve and further demonstrating the presence of an inhomogeneous dust distribution within the galaxies. A comparison of the CRISTAL sources to those from the FirstLight zoom-in simulation of galaxies with the same M<sub>&sext;</sub> and SFR reveals similar age and colour gradients, suggesting that major mergers may be important in the formation of clumpy galaxies at this epoch.

<p> Danial Langeroodi, Jens Hjorth </p>
<p>
We introduce genesis-metallicity, a gas-phase metallicity measurement python software employing the direct and strong-line methods depending on the available oxygen lines. The non-parametric strong-line estimator is calibrated based on a kernel density estimate in the 4-dimensional space of O2 = [O II]&lambda;&lambda; 3727,29/H&beta;; O3 = [O III]&lambda; 5007/H&beta;; H&beta; equivalent width EW(H&beta;); and gas-phase metallicity 12 + log(O/H). We use a calibration sample of 1510 galaxies at 0 &lt; z &lt; 10 with direct-method metallicity measurements, compiled from the JWST/NIRSpec and ground-based observations. In particular, we report 122 new NIRSpec direct-method metallicity measurements at z &gt; 1. We show that the O2, O3, and EW(H&beta;) measurements are sufficient for a gas-phase metallicity estimate that is more accurate than 0.09 dex. Our calibration is universal, meaning that its accuracy does not depend on the target redshift. Furthermore, the direct-method module employs a non-parametric T_e(O II) electron temperature estimator based on a kernel density estimate in the 5-dimensional space of O2, O3, EW(H&beta;), T_e(O III), and T_e(O II). This T_e(O II) estimator is calibrated based on 1004 spectra with detections of both [O III]&lambda; 4363 and [O II]&lambda;&lambda; 7320,30, notably reporting 20 new NIRSpec detections of the [O II]&lambda;&lambda; 7320,30 doublet. We make genesis-metallicity and its calibration data publicly available and commit to keeping both up-to-date in light of the incoming data.

We present a sample of 50 H-alpha detected broad-line active galactic nuclei (BLAGN) at redshifts 3.5&lt;z&lt;6.8 using data from the CEERS and RUBIES surveys. We select these sources directly from JWST/NIRSpec G395M/F290LP spectra. We use a multi-step pre-selection and a Bayesian fitting procedure to ensure a high-quality sample of sources with broad Balmer lines and narrow forbidden lines. We compute rest-frame ultraviolet and optical spectral slopes for these objects, and determine that 10 BLAGN in our sample are also little red dots (LRDs). These LRD BLAGN, when examined in aggregate, show broader H-alpha line profiles and a higher fraction of broad-to-narrow component H-alpha emission than non-LRD BLAGN. Moreover, we find that ~66% of these objects are intrinsically reddened (beta (optical)&gt;0), independent of the contributions of emission lines to the broadband photometry. We construct the black hole (BH) mass function at 3.5&lt;z&lt;6 after computing robust observational and line detection completeness corrections. This BH mass function shows broad agreement with both recent JWST/NIRSpec and JWST/NIRCam WFSS based BH mass functions, though we extend these earlier results to log(M(BH)/M(sun)) &lt; 7. The derived BH mass function is consistent with a variety of theoretical models, indicating that the observed abundance of black holes in the early universe is not discrepant with physically-motivated predictions. The BH mass function shape resembles a largely featureless power-law, suggesting that any signature from black-hole seeding has been lost by redshift z~5-6. Finally, we compute the BLAGN UV luminosity function and find good agreement with JWST-detected BLAGN samples from recent works, finding that BLAGN hosts constitute &lt;10% of the total observed UV luminosity at all but the brightest luminosities.

<p>
We present the Red Unknowns: Bright Infrared Extragalactic Survey (RUBIES), providing JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of red sources selected across ~150 arcmin<sup>2</sup> from public JWST/NIRCam imaging in the UDS and EGS fields. RUBIES novel observing strategy offers a well-quantified selection function: the survey is optimised to reach high (&gt;70%) completeness for bright and red (F150W-F444W&gt;2) sources that are very rare. To place these rare sources in context, we simultaneously observe a reference sample of the 2&lt;z&lt;7 galaxy population, sampling sources at a rate that is inversely proportional to their number density in the 3D space of F444W magnitude, F150W-F444W colour, and photometric redshift. In total, RUBIES observes ~3000 targets across 1&lt;z<sub>phot</sub>&lt;10 with both the PRISM and G395M dispersers, and ~1500 targets at z<sub>phot</sub>&gt;3 using only the G395M disperser. The RUBIES data reveal a highly diverse population of red sources that span a broad redshift range (z<sub>spec</sub>~1-9), with photometric redshift scatter and outlier fraction that are 3 times higher than for similarly bright sources that are less red. This diversity is not apparent from the photometric SEDs. Only spectroscopy reveals that the SEDs encompass a mixture of galaxies with dust-obscured star formation, extreme line emission, a lack of star formation indicating early quenching, and luminous active galactic nuclei. As a first demonstration of our broader selection function we compare the stellar masses and rest-frame U-V colours of the red sources and our reference sample: red sources are typically more massive (M_*~10^10-11.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) across all redshifts. However, we find that the most massive systems span a wide range in U-V colour. We describe our data reduction procedure and data quality, and publicly release the reduced RUBIES data and vetted spectroscopic redshifts of the first half of the survey through the DJA.

### 278) [2409.03997](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03997v2): A New Framework for ISM Emission Line Models: Connecting Multi-Scale Simulations Across Cosmological Volumes

<p> Shengqi Yang, Adam Lidz, Andrew Benson, Yizhou Zhao, Hui Li, Amelia Zhao, Aaron Smith, Yucheng Zhang, Rachel Somerville, Anthony Pullen, Hui Li </p>
<p>
The JWST and ALMA have detected emission lines from the ionized interstellar medium (ISM) in some of the first galaxies at z ≳ 6. These measurements present an opportunity to better understand galaxy assembly histories and may allow important tests of state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulations. It is challenging, however, to model these lines in their proper cosmological context. In order to meet this challenge, we introduce a novel sub-grid line emission modeling framework. The framework uses the high-z zoom-in simulation suite from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) collaboration. The line emission signals from HII regions within each simulated FIRE galaxy are modeled using the semi-analytic HIILines code. A machine learning approach is then used to determine the conditional probability distribution for the line luminosity to stellar-mass ratio from the HII regions around each simulated stellar particle. This conditional probability distribution can then be applied to predict the line luminosities around stellar particles in lower resolution, yet larger volume cosmological simulations. As an example, we apply this approach to the IllustrisTNG simulations at z=6. The resulting predictions for the [OII], [OIII], and Balmer line luminosities as a function of star-formation rate (SFR) agree well with current observations. Our predictions differ, however, from related work in the literature which lack detailed sub-grid ISM models. This highlights the importance of our multi-scale simulation modeling framework. Finally, we provide forecasts for future line luminosity function measurements from the JWST and quantify the cosmic variance in such surveys.

<p> Christopher Cain, Garett Lopez, Anson D'Aloisio, Julian B. Munoz, Rolf A. Jansen, Rogier A. Windhorst, Nakul Gangolli </p>
<p>
Recent JWST observations at z &gt; 6 may imply galactic ionizing photon production above prior expectations. Under observationally motivated assumptions about escape fractions, these suggest a z ~ 8-9 end to reionization, in tension with the z &lt; 6 end required by the Ly&alpha; forest. In this work, we use radiative transfer simulations to understand what different observations tell us about when reionization ended and when it started. We consider a model that ends too early (z_end ≈ 8) alongside two more realistic scenarios with z_end ≈ 5: one starting late (z ~ 9) and another early (z ~ 13). We find that the latter requires up to an order-of-magnitude evolution in galaxy ionizing properties at 6 &lt; z &lt; 12, perhaps in tension with measurements of  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  by JWST, which indicate little evolution. We study how these models compare to recent measurements of the Ly&alpha; forest opacity, mean free path, IGM thermal history, visibility of z &gt; 8 Ly&alpha; emitters, and the patchy kSZ signal from the CMB. We find that neither of the late-ending scenarios is strongly disfavored by any single data set. However, a majority of observables, spanning several distinct types of observations, prefer a late start. Not all probes agree with this conclusion, hinting at a possible lack of concordance arising from deficiencies in observations and/or theoretical modeling. Observations by multiple experiments (including JWST, Roman, and CMB-S4) in the coming years will establish a concordance picture of reionization's beginning or uncover such deficiencies.

<p>
\requiremediawiki-texvcCosmic Reionisation commenced when ultraviolet (UV) radiation produced in the first galaxies began illuminating the cold, neutral gas that filled the primordial Universe. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have shown that surprisingly UV-bright galaxies were in place beyond redshift z = 14, when the Universe was less than 300   Myr old. Smooth turnovers of their UV continua have been interpreted as damping-wing absorption of Lyman-&alpha; (Ly&alpha;), the principal hydrogen transition. However, spectral signatures encoding crucial properties of these sources, such as their emergent radiation field, largely remain elusive. Here we report spectroscopy from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) of a galaxy at redshift z = 13.0 that reveal a singular, bright emission line unambiguously identified as Ly&alpha;, in addition to a smooth turnover. We observe an equivalent width of EW_Ly&alpha; &gt; 40   &#8491; (rest frame), previously only seen at z &lt; 9 where the intervening intergalactic medium (IGM) becomes increasingly ionised. Together with an extremely blue UV continuum, the unexpected Ly&alpha; emission indicates the galaxy is a prolific producer and leaker of ionising photons. This suggests massive, hot stars or an active galactic nucleus (AGN) have created an early reionised region to prevent complete extinction of Ly&alpha;, thus shedding new light on the nature of the earliest galaxies and the onset of Reionisation only 330   Myr after the Big Bang.

### 281) [2408.13396](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13396v2): Unveiling galaxy chemical enrichment mechanisms out to z~8 from direct determination of O & Ar abundances from JWST/NIRSPEC spectroscopy

<p> Souradeep Bhattacharya, Magda Arnaboldi, Ortwin Gerhard, Chiaki Kobayashi, Kanak Saha </p>
<p>
Galaxy chemical enrichment mechanisms have primarily been constrained by [&alpha;/Fe] and [Fe/H] measurements of individual stars and integrated light from stellar populations. However such measurements are limited at higher redshifts (z&gt;1). Recently, we proposed an analogous diagram of the oxygen-to-argon abundance ratio, log(O/Ar), vs Ar abundance, 12+log(Ar/H), as a new diagnostic window for emission nebulae. In this Letter, using robust line flux measurements including temperature sensitive auroral lines, we present direct determination of O and Ar abundances in nine SFGs from JWST/NIRSPEC spectra at z~1.3-7.7, and two more with Keck/MOSFIRE spectra at z~2.2. Utilising their positions on the log(O/Ar) vs 12+log(Ar/H) plane, we present the first inference of galaxy chemical enrichment mechanisms from an ensemble of galaxies. The SFGs at z~1.3-3.4 are consistent with the solar neighbourhood galactic chemical enrichment models of the Milky Way Galaxy that are driven by core-collapse and Type Ia supernovae. Such enrichment mechanisms thus occur at least out to z~3.4. However, the highest-redshift SFGs (z~3.6-7.7) have very low log(O/Ar) values, revealing a different enrichment process at z&gt;3.6. Such low log(O/Ar) values may be caused by a rapid but intermittent star-formation and/or additional sources. The new diagnostic window for SFGs enables us to reveal the unique fingerprints of galaxy chemical enrichment out to cosmic dawn.

### 282) [2408.03474](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03474v3): The Chicago-Carnegie Hubble Program: The JWST J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) Extragalactic Distance Scale

<p> Abigail J. Lee, Wendy L. Freedman, Barry F. Madore, In Sung Jang, Kayla A. Owens, Taylor J. Hoyt </p>
<p>
The J-region asymptotic giant branch (JAGB) method is a new standard candle based on the constant luminosities of carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars in the J band. The JAGB method is independent of the Cepheid and TRGB distance indicators. Therefore, we can leverage it to both cross-check Cepheid and TRGB distances for systematic errors and use it to measure an independent local Hubble constant. The JAGB method also boasts a number of advantages in measuring distances relative to the TRGB and Cepheids, several of which are especially amplified when combined with JWST's revolutionary resolving power. First, JAGB stars are 1 mag brighter in the NIR than the TRGB, and can be discovered from single-epoch NIR photometry unlike Cepheids which require congruent optical imaging in at least 12 epochs. Thus, JAGB stars can be used to measure significantly farther distances than both the TRGB stars and Cepheids using the same amount of observing time. Further advantages include: JAGB stars are easily identified solely via their colors and magnitudes, dust extinction is reduced in near-infrared observations, and JAGB stars are ubiquitous in all galaxies with intermediate-age populations. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that identifies the optimal location in a galaxy for applying the JAGB method, so as to minimize effects from crowding. We then deploy this algorithm in JWST NIRCam imaging of seven SN Ia host galaxies to measure their JAGB distances, undertaking a completely blind analysis. The zero-point of this JAGB distance scale is set in the water mega-maser galaxy NGC 4258. In our CCHP overview paper Freedman et al. (2025), we apply the JAGB distances measured in this paper to the Carnegie Supernova Program (CSP) SNe Ia sample, measuring a Hubble constant of H0 = 67.80 +/- 2.17 (stat) +/- 1.64 (sys) km/s/Mpc.

### 283) [2408.00061](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00061v2): The mass-metallicity relation as a ruler for galaxy evolution: insights from the James Webb Space Telescope

<p> A. Pallottini, A. Ferrara, S. Gallerani, L. Sommovigo, S. Carniani, L. Vallini, M. Kohandel, G. Venturi </p>
<p>
Galaxy evolution emerges from the balance between cosmic gas accretion, fueling star formation, and supernova (SN) feedback, regulating the metal enrichment. Hence, the stellar mass (M_*) - gas metallicity relation (MZR) is key to understanding the physics of galaxies. High-quality JWST data enable accurate measurements of the MZR up to redshift z=10. Our aims are to understand the observed MZR, its connection with the star formation rate (SFR), the role played by SFR stochasticity, and how it is regulated by SN feedback. We compare the MZR from the JADES, CEERS, and UNCOVER surveys, which comprise about 180 galaxies at z=3-10 with 10^6&lt;M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>&lt;10^10, with 200 galaxies from the SERRA cosmological simulations. To interpret the MZR, we develop a minimal model for galaxy evolution that includes: cosmic accretion modulated with an amplitude A_100 on 100 Myr; a time delay t_d between SFR and SN; SN-driven outflows with a varying mass loading factor &epsilon;_SN. Using our minimal model, we find the observed mean MZR is reproduced by weak outflows (&epsilon;_SN=1/4), in line with findings from JADES. Matching the observed MZR dispersion requires t_d=20 Myr and a A_100=1/3 modulation of the accretion rate. Successful models have low stochasticity (&sigma;_SFR=0.2), yielding a MZR dispersion of &sigma;_Z=0.2. Such values are close but lower than SERRA predictions (&sigma;_SFR=0.24, &sigma;_Z=0.3), clarifying why SERRA shows flatter trend and some tension with the observations. As the MZR is very sensitive to SFR stochasticity, models predicting high r.m.s. values (&sigma;_SFR=0.5) result in a "chemical chaos'' (i.e. &sigma;_Z=1.4), virtually destroying the MZR. As a consequence, invoking a highly stochastic SFR (&sigma;_SFR=0.8) to explain the overabundance of bright, super-early galaxies leads to inconsistencies with the observed MZR.

### 284) [2407.19534](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19534v2): Measuring Resolved Star Formation Histories from High-Precision Color-Magnitude Diagrams with StarFormationHistories.jl

<p> Christopher T. Garling, Nitya Kallivayalil, Kristen B. W. McQuinn, Jack T. Warfield, Mario Gennaro, Roger E. Cohen </p>
<p>
Understanding how and when galaxies formed stars over the history of the Universe is fundamental to the study of galaxy evolution. The star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies in the local Universe can be measured with high precision using deep imaging with space telescopes. Such phresolved SFHs are based on modelling the observed color-magnitude diagram (CMD) with stellar evolution models and rely on age-sensitive features like the main sequence turn-off to measure a galaxy's star formation rate as a function of time. There are many other population-level parameters that factor into these measurements, such as the stellar initial mass function (IMF), binary fraction, and metallicity, to name a few. We present and release StarFormationHistories.jl, a modular, open-source Julia package for measuring resolved SFHs with a focus on model flexibility for these types of population parameters. The code can model unresolved photometric binaries and supports arbitrary IMFs. Random uncertainties in the SFH measurements can be quantified with Monte Carlo posterior sampling methods. We illustrate the performance of the package on JWST/NIRCAM data of the Local Group dwarf irregular galaxy WLM ≤ft(M_v≈-14.2  mag), which exhibits a complex, well-sampled CMD, and HST/ACS data of the ultra-faint Milky Way satellite dwarf galaxy Horologium I ≤ft(M_v≈-3.7  mag), which has a much simpler but sparser CMD.

### 285) [2407.17552](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17552v2): Preliminary Evidence for Lensing-Induced Alignments of High-Redshift Galaxies in JWST-CEERS

<p>
The majority of low-mass (log_10 M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>=9-10) galaxies at high redshift (z&gt;1) appear elongated in projection. We use JWST-CEERS observations to explore the role of gravitational lensing in this puzzle. The typical galaxy-galaxy lensing shear &gamma;~1&percnt; is too low to explain the predominance of elongated early galaxies with ellipticity e≈0.6. However, non-parametric quantile regression with Bayesian Additive Regression Trees reveals hints of an excess of tangentially-aligned source-lens pairs with &gamma;&gt;10&percnt;. On larger scales, we also find evidence for weak lensing shear. We rule out the null hypothesis of randomly oriented galaxies at ≳99&percnt; significance in multiple NIRCam chips, modules and pointings. The number of such regions is small and attributable to chance, but coherent alignment patterns suggest otherwise. On the chip scale, the average complex ellipticity &langle; e&rangle;~10&percnt; is non-negligible and beyond the level of our PSF uncertainties. The shear variance &langle;&gamma;^2&rangle;~10^-3 is an order of magnitude above the conventional weak lensing regime but is more sensitive to PSF systematics, intrinsic alignments, cosmic variance and other biases. Taking it as an upper limit, the maximum implied "cosmic shear'' is only a few percent and cannot explain the elongated shapes of early galaxies. The alignments themselves may arise from lensing by a protocluster or filament at z~0.75 where we find an overabundance of massive lens galaxies. We recommend a weak lensing search for overdensities in "blank'' deep fields with JWST and the Roman Space Telescope.

### 286) [2407.10900](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10900v2): Accelerated by Dark Matter: a High-redshift Pathway to Efficient Galaxy-scale Star Formation

<p> Michael Boylan-Kolchin </p>
<p>
In the local Universe, star formation is typically inefficient both globally and when considered as the fraction of gas converted into stars per local free-fall time. An important exception to this inefficiency is regions of high gravitational accelerations g, or equivalently surface densities &Sigma; = g/(&pi; G), where stellar feedback is insufficient to overcome the self-gravity of dense gas clouds. In this paper, I explore whether dark matter can play an analogous role in providing the requisite accelerations on the scale of entire galaxies in the early cosmos. The key insight is that characteristic accelerations in dark matter halos scale as (1+z)^2 at fixed halo mass. I show this is sufficient to make dark matter the source of intense accelerations that might induce efficient star formation on galactic scales at cosmic dawn in sufficiently massive halos. The mass characterizing this regime scales as (1+z)^-6 and corresponds to a relatively constant comoving number density of n(&gt;\!M_vir) ≈ 10^-4 Mpc^-3 at z ≳ 8. For somewhat rarer halos, this model predicts stellar masses of M<sub>&sext;</sub> ~ 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> can form in regions that end up with sizes O(100 pc) over 40 Myr time-scales at z≈ 12-14; these numbers compare well to measurements for some of the brightest galaxies at that epoch from James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations. Dark matter and standard cosmological evolution may therefore be crucial for explaining the surprisingly high levels of star formation in the early Universe revealed by JWST.

We present a full analysis of galaxy major merger pair fractions, merger rates, and mass accretion rates, thus uncovering the role of mergers in galaxy formation at the earliest previously unexplored epoch of 4.5&lt;z&lt;11.5. We target galaxies with masses log_10(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 8.0 - 10.0, utilizing data from eight JWST Cycle-1 fields (CEERS, JADES GOODS-S, NEP-TDF, NGDEEP, GLASS, El-Gordo, SMACS-0723, MACS-0416), covering an unmasked area of 189.36 arcmin<sup>2</sup>. We develop a new probabilistic pair-counting methodology that integrates full photometric redshift posteriors and corrects for detection incompleteness to quantify close pairs with physical projected separations between 20 and 50 kpc. Our analysis reveals an increase in pair fractions up to z = 8, reaching 0.211 ± 0.065, followed by a statistically flat evolution to z = 11.5. We find that the galaxy merger rate increases from the local Universe up to z = 6 and then stabilizes at a value of ~ 6 Gyr^-1 up to z = 11.5. The redshift evolution of both pair fractions and merger rates is well described by a power-law plus exponential model. In addition, we measure that the average galaxy increases its stellar mass due to mergers by a factor of 2.77 ± 0.99 from redshift z = 10.5 to z = 5.0. Lastly, we investigate the impact of mergers on galaxy stellar mass growth, revealing that mergers contribute as much as 71 ± 25&percnt; to galaxy stellar mass growth. This indicates that mergers drive about half of galaxy assembly at high redshift.

Thanks to decades of observations using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the structure of galaxies at redshift z&gt;2 has been widely studied in the rest-frame ultraviolet regime, which traces recent star formation from young stellar populations. But, we still have little information about the spatial distribution of the older, more evolved stellar populations, constrained by the rest-frame infrared portion of the galaxies' spectral energy distribution. We present the morphological characterization of a sample of 49 massive galaxies (log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&gt;9) at redshift 3&lt;z&lt;5. The MIRI 5.6~&mu;m imaging allows us to characterize the rest-frame near-infrared structure of galaxies beyond cosmic noon, at higher redshifts than possible with NIRCam, tracing their older and dust-insensitive stellar populations. We derive the non-parametric morphology of galaxies and model the light distribution of galaxies with a single S\'ersic component and derive their parametric morphology. We find that at z&gt;3 massive galaxies show a smooth distribution of their rest-infrared light, strongly supporting the increasing number of regular disk galaxies already in place at early epochs. On the contrary, the ultraviolet structure obtained from HST/WFC3 and JWST/NIRCam observations at ~1.5~&mu;m is generally more irregular, catching the most recent episodes of star formation. Importantly, we find a segregation of morphologies across cosmic time, where galaxies at redshift z&gt;3.75 show later-type morphologies compared to z~3 galaxies. These findings suggest a transition phase in galaxy assembly and central mass build-up, which is already taking place at z~3-4. The combined analysis of NIRCam and MIRI imaging datasets allows us to prove that the rest-frame near-infrared morphology of massive galaxies at cosmic noon is typical of compact disk galaxies with a smooth mass distribution.

<p>
(Abridged) The strong lensing models of galaxy clusters rely on the number and quality of multiple images with spectroscopic redshifts. We present an updated strong lensing model of MACS J0416.1-2403 with the largest sample of multiple images with spectroscopic redshifts in a galaxy cluster field to date. Furthermore, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of JWST, particularly its NIRISS camera, for strong lensing studies. We used NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec and NIRISS spectroscopy from the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). The cluster mass model was constrained using Lenstool software. Our new dataset, which we used for constraining the lens model, comprises 303 secure multiple images with spectroscopic redshifts from 111 background sources and includes 95 systems with previously known MUSE redshift and 16 systems (with 46 multiple images) for which we obtained spectroscopic redshift for the first time using NIRISS and NIRSpec spectroscopy. Three of the spectroscopic systems were not identified by previous JWST studies. The total number of secure spectroscopic systems is more than 20% higher than in the previous strong lensing studies of this cluster. The model can reproduce multiple images with the root-mean-square distance of ~ 0.52''. We also provide a full catalogue with 415 multiple images, including less reliable candidates. In total, we provide 15 new multiple-image system candidates (with 38 multiple images) not reported in previous studies. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of JWST, particularly NIRISS, for obtaining spectroscopic redshifts of multiple images. As NIRISS F115W, F150W, and F200W grism spectroscopy captures at least two of the [OII], [OIII] and H&alpha; lines at 1 &lt; z &lt; 3 (a redshift range particularly relevant for strong lensing studies) without target pre-selection, it complements MUSE and NIRSpec observations extremely well.

<p> Emmanuel Durodola, Fabio Pacucci, Ryan C. Hickox </p>
<p>
JWST is revolutionizing our view of the early Universe by pushing the boundaries of detectable galaxies and black holes in redshift (upward) and mass (downward). The Little Red Dots (LRDs), detected by several surveys at z &gt; 4, present a significant interpretational challenge, as their Spectral Energy Distributions (SED) can mimic both AGN and stellar population templates. This study analyzes 19 LRDs from the JADES survey, utilizing NIRCam and MIRI photometry. By performing SED fitting across a vast parameter space, we explore a broad range of AGN fractions, defined as the ratio of the monochromatic luminosities (AGN, galaxy, and dust) over a specified wavelength range, 0.4 - 0.7 &mu; m rest-frame. We find that 17 of the 19 LRDs investigated are consistent with having significant AGN contributions, with best-fitting AGN fractions ranging between 20% and 70%, while one galaxy shows a low AGN contribution (2%) and another appears to be purely star-forming. Moreover, assuming these LRDs do indeed host AGN, we can place limits on their black hole masses using the inferred AGN bolometric luminosities and adopting the Eddington limit. We find that, independent of the specific AGN fraction adopted, the LRDs' black holes are significantly overmassive relative to their host galaxies (by ~ 1 dex, and up to ~ 4 dex in the most extreme cases) compared to the local M<sub>&bull;</sub> - M<sub>&sext;</sub> relation. The presence of overmassive black holes in the high-z Universe may provide the strongest evidence yet of heavy black hole seeding occurring during the cosmic dark ages.

### 291) [2405.19953](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19953v3): Do high redshift QSOs and GRBs corroborate JWST?

<p> Eoin Ó Colgáin, M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari, Lu Yin </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is reporting massive high redshift galaxies that appear challenging from the &Lambda;CDM perspective. Interpreted as a cosmological problem, this necessitates the Planck collaboration underestimating either matter density &Omega;_m or physical matter density &Omega;_m h^2 at higher redshifts. Through standard frequentist profile likelihoods, we identify corroborating quasar (QSO) and gamma-ray burst (GRB) data sets where &Omega;_m increases with effective redshift z_rmeff and remains anomalously large at higher redshifts. We relax the traditional priors by allowing for &Omega;_m &gt; 1, consistent with negative dark energy density, to locate profile likelihood peaks where possible. While the variation of &Omega;_m with z_rmeff is at odds with the &Lambda;CDM model, demarcating frequentist confidence intervals through differences in &chi;<sup>2</sup> in profile likelihoods, the prevailing technique in the literature, points to 3.9 &sigma; and 7.9 &sigma; tensions between GRBs and QSOs, respectively, and Planck-&Lambda;CDM. We explain the approximations inherent in the existing profile likelihood literature, and highlight fresh methodology that generalises the prescription. We show that alternative methods, including Bayesian approaches, lead to similar tensions. Finally, in the large sample limit, we show that Feldman-Cousins prescription for frequentist confidence intervals in the presence of a boundary (prior) leads to confidence intervals that are bounded above by Wilks' theorem.

### 292) [2405.13108](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13108v3): The impact of mass-dependent stochasticity at cosmic dawn

<p> Viola Gelli, Charlotte Mason, Christopher C. Hayward </p>
<p>
JWST is unveiling a surprising lack of evolution in the number densities of ultraviolet-selected (UV) galaxies at redshift z≳ 10. At the same time, observations and simulations are providing evidence for highly bursty star formation in high-z galaxies, resulting in significant scatter in their UV luminosities. Galaxies in low-mass dark matter halos are expected to experience most stochasticity due to their shallow potential wells. Here, we explore the impact of a mass-dependent stochasticity using a simple analytical model. We assume that scatter in the M_UV-M_h relation increases towards lower halo masses, following the decrease in halo escape velocity, &sigma;_UV ~ M_h^-1/3, independent of redshift. Since low-mass halos are more dominant in the early universe, this model naturally predicts an increase in UV luminosity functions (LFs) at high redshifts compared to models without scatter. We make predictions for additional observables which would be affected by stochasticity and could be used to constrain its amplitude, finding: (i) galaxies are less clustered compared to the no-scatter scenario, with the difference increasing at higher-z; (ii) assuming star-bursting galaxies dominate the ionizing photon budget implies reionization starts earlier and is more gradual compared to the no-scatter case, (iii) at fixed UV magnitude galaxies should exhibit wide ranges of UV slopes, nebular emission line strengths and Balmer breaks. Comparing to observations, the mass-dependent stochasticity model successfully reproduces the observed LFs up to z~12. However, the model cannot match the observed z~14 LFs, implying additional physical processes enhance star formation efficiency in the earliest galaxies.

<p>
We present observations of the z~5.7 Lyman-break galaxy HZ10 with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU in high and low spectral resolution (G395H, spectral resolving power R~2700 and PRISM, R~100, respectively), as part of the GA-NIFS program. By spatially resolving the source (spatial resolution ~0.15'' or ~0.9kpc), we find three spatially and spectrally distinct regions of line emission along with one region of strong continuum emission, all within a projected distance of &lt;10kpc. The R2700 data features strong detections in H&beta;, [OIII]&lambda;&lambda;4959,5007, [NII]&lambda;&lambda;6548,6584, H&alpha;, and [SII]&lambda;&lambda;6716,6731. The R100 data additionally contains a strong detection of the Ly&alpha; break, rest-frame UV and optical continuum, and [OII]&lambda;&lambda;3726,3729. None of the detected lines present strong evidence for AGN excitation from line diagnostic diagrams, and no high-ionisation lines are detected. Using the detected lines, we constrain the electron density ≤ft( log_10≤ft( n_e / cm^-3)~ 3) and metallicity (~0.5-0.7 solar) in each component. Spaxel-by-spaxel fits reveal a strong east-west velocity gradient and significant line asymmetries (possibly indicating tidal features or outflows). The western component features a very red UV slope (&beta;_UV~-0.9) and significant H&alpha; emission, suggesting an evolved population and active star formation. A comparison to high resolution (~0.3'' or ~1.8kpc) [CII]158&mu;m imaging obtained with the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) reveals areas of dust obscuration. Altogether, these data suggest that HZ10 represents an ongoing merger, with a complex distribution of stars, gas, and dust &lt;1Gyr after the Big Bang.

<p>
Understanding the sources that power nebular emission in high-redshift galaxies is fundamentally important not only for shedding light onto the drivers of reionisation, but to constrain stellar populations and the growth of black holes. Here we focus on an individual object, GS9422, a galaxy at z<sub>spec</sub>=5.943 with exquisite data from the JADES, JEMS and FRESCO surveys, including 14-band JWST/NIRCam photometry and deep NIRSpec prism and grating spectroscopy. We map the continuum emission and nebular emission lines across the galaxy on 0.2-kpc scales. GS9422 has been claimed to have nebular-dominated continuum and an extreme stellar population with top-heavy initial mass function. We find clear evidence for different morphologies in the emission lines, the rest-UV and rest-optical continuum emission, demonstrating that the full continuum cannot be dominated by nebular emission. While multiple models reproduce the spectrum reasonably well, our preferred model with a type-2 active galactic nucleus (AGN) and local damped Ly-&alpha; (DLA) clouds can explain both the spectrum and the wavelength-dependent morphology. The AGN powers the off-planar nebular emission, giving rise to the Balmer jump and the emission lines, including Ly-&alpha;, which therefore does not suffer DLA absorption. A central, young stellar component dominates the rest-UV emission and &ndash; together with the DLA clouds &ndash; leads to a spectral turn-over. A disc-like, older stellar component explains the flattened morphology in the rest-optical continuum. We conclude that GS9422 is consistent with being a normal galaxy with an obscured, type-2 AGN &ndash; a simple scenario, without the need for exotic stellar populations.

<p>
We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Integral Field Spectrograph observations of NGC 3256, a local infrared-luminous late-stage merging system with two nuclei roughly 1kpc apart, both of which have evidence of cold molecular outflows. Using JWST/NIRSpec and MIRI datasets, we investigate this morphologically complex system on spatial scales of &lt;100pc, where we focus on the warm molecular H<sub>2</sub> gas surrounding the nuclei. We detect collimated outflowing warm H<sub>2</sub> gas originating from the southern nucleus, though we do not find significant outflowing H<sub>2</sub> gas surrounding the northern nucleus. We measure maximum intrinsic outflow velocities of ~1,000kms<sup>-1</sup>, which extend out to a distance of 0.7kpc. Based on H<sub>2</sub> S(7)/S(1) ratios, we find a larger fraction of warmer gas near the S nucleus, which decreases with increasing distance from the nucleus, signifying the southern nucleus as a primary source of H<sub>2</sub> heating. The gas mass of the warm H<sub>2</sub> outflow component is estimated to be M_warm,out=(1.4±0.2)×10^6M<sub>&odot;</sub>, as much as 6&percnt; of the cold H<sub>2</sub> mass estimated using ALMA CO data. The outflow time scale is about 7×10^5yr, resulting in a mass outflow rate M&#775; _warm,out=2.0±0.8M<sub>&odot;</sub>yr^-1 and kinetic power P_warm,out~4×10^41ergs<sup>-1</sup>. Lastly, regions within our 3.0"x3.0" NIRSpec data where the outflowing gas reside show high [Fe II]/Pa&beta; and H<sub>2</sub>/Br&gamma; line ratios, indicate enhanced mechanical heating caused by the outflows. The fluxes and ratios of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) in these regions are not significantly different compared to those elsewhere in the disk, suggesting the outflows may not significantly alter the PAH ionization state or grain size.

### 296) [2402.17140](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17140v2): Direct Detection of Dark Photon Dark Matter with the James Webb Space Telescope

<p> Haipeng An, Shuailiang Ge, Jia Liu, Zhiyao Lu </p>
<p>
In this study, we propose an investigation into dark photon dark matter (DPDM) within the infrared frequency band, utilizing highly sensitive infrared light detectors commonly integrated into space telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The presence of DPDM induces electron oscillations in both the reflectors and the interior of the detectors. Consequently, these oscillating electrons can emit monochromatic electromagnetic waves with a frequency almost equivalent to the mass of DPDM. By estimating the signal generated by DPDM inside the detector and comparing with observation data, we establish constraints on the kinetic mixing between the photon and dark photon within the range [10, 500] THz. Despite JWST not being optimized for DPDM searches, our findings reveal constraints comparable to those obtained from the XENON1T experiment in the laboratory, as well as astrophysical constraints from solar emission. Additionally, we propose to modify the configuration of JWST optical elements to focus the DPDM induced signal onto the detector. By employing the stationary phase approximation, we can demonstrate that when the size of the reflector significantly exceeds the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave, the contribution to the electromagnetic wave field at a given position primarily stems from the surface unit perpendicular to the relative position vector. This simplification results in the reduction of electromagnetic wave calculations to ray optics. We show that by rearranging the position of reflectors, JWST can achieve a sensitivity stronger than the existing limits by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude.

We study the Bianchi-I cosmological model motivated by signals of statistical isotropy violation seen in cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations and others. To that end, we consider various kinds of anisotropic matter that source anisotropy in our model, specifically Cosmic strings, Magnetic fields, Domain walls and Lorentz violation generated magnetic fields. These anisotropic matter sources, taking one at a time, are studied for their co-evolution with standard model (isotropic) sources viz., dust-like (dark/normal) matter, and dark energy modelled as cosmological constant. We constrain the Hubble parameter, density fractions of anisotropic matter, cold dark matter (CDM), and dark energy (&Lambda;) in a Bianchi-I universe with planar symmetry i.e., which has a global ellipsoidal geometry, and try to find signatures of a cosmic preferred axis if any. The latest compilation of Type Ia Supernova (SNIa) data from Pantheon+SH0ES collaboration is used in our analysis to obtain constraints on cosmological parameters and any preferred axis for our universe. In our analysis, we found mild evidence for a cosmic preferred axis. It is interesting to note that this preferred axis lies broadly in the vicinity of other prominent cosmic anisotropy axes reported in the literature from diverse data sets. Also we find some evidence for non-zero (negative) cosmic shear and eccentricity that characterize different expansion rates in different directions and deviation from an isotropic scale factor respectively. The energy density fractions of two of the sources considered are found to be non-zero at a 2&sigma; confidence level. To be more conclusive, we require more SNIa host galaxy data for tighter constraints on distance and absolute magnitude calibration which are expected to be available from the future JWST observations and others.

We study outflows in 130 galaxies with -22&lt;MUV&lt;-16 at z=3-9 identified in JWST NIRSpec and NIRCam WFSS data taken by the ERO, CEERS, FRESCO, GLASS, and JADES programs. We identify 30 out of the 130 galaxies with broad components of FWHM~200-700 km s<sup>-1</sup> in the emission lines of H&alpha; and [OIII] that trace ionized outflows, and find no excesses from the star-formation main sequence. Four out of the 30 outflowing galaxies are Type-1 AGN whose H&alpha; emission lines include line profile components as broad as FWHM&gt;1000 km s<sup>-1</sup> while one galaxy is identified as a Type-2 AGN by high ionization emission lines. With the velocity shift and line widths of the outflow broad lines, we obtain ~80-500 km s<sup>-1</sup> for the outflow velocities. We find that the outflow velocities are slower than low-z galaxies with similar SFRs, which may be explained by the low stellar masses of high-z galaxies. The outflow velocities of AGNs are large but not significantly different from the others. Interestingly, these outflow velocities are typically not high enough to escape from the galactic potentials, possibly suggesting fountain-type outflows. We estimate mass loading factors &eta; to be 0.1-1 that are not particularly large, but comparable with those of z~1 outflows. The large fraction of galaxies with outflows (30% with high resolution data) provides constraints on outflow parameters, suggesting a wide opening angle of &gt;45 deg and a large duty-cycle of &gt;30%, which gives a picture of more frequent and spherical outflows in high-z galaxies.

We present the survey design and initial results of the ALMA Cycle 9 program of DUALZ, which aims to establish a joint ALMA and JWST public legacy field targeting the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744. DUALZ features a contiguous 4'×6' ALMA 30-GHz-wide mosaic in Band 6, covering areas of &mu;&gt;2 down to a sensitivity of &sigma;=32.7~&mu;Jy. Through a blind search, we identified 69 dust continuum sources at S/N ≳5.0 with median redshift and intrinsic 1.2-mm flux of z=2.30 and S_1.2mm^int=0.24~mJy. Of these, 27 have been spectroscopically confirmed, leveraged by the latest NIRSpec observations, while photometric redshift estimates are constrained by the comprehensive HST, NIRCam, and ALMA data for the remaining sources. With priors, we further identify a [CII]158 &mu;m line emitter at z=6.3254±0.0004, confirmed by the latest NIRSpec spectroscopy. The NIRCam counterparts of the 1.2-mm continuum exhibit undisturbed morphologies, denoted either by disk or spheroid, implying the triggers for the faint mm emission are less catastrophic than mergers. We have identified 8 HST-dark galaxies (F150W&gt;27mag, F150W-F444W&gt;2.3) and 2 JWST-dark (F444W&gt;30mag) galaxy candidates among the ALMA continuum sources. The former includes face-on disk galaxies, hinting that substantial dust obscuration does not always result from inclination. We also detect a marginal dust emission from an X-ray-detected galaxy at z<sub>spec</sub>=10.07, suggesting an active co-evolution of the central black hole and its host. We assess the infrared luminosity function up to z~10 and find it consistent with predictions from galaxy formation models. To foster diverse scientific outcomes from the community, we publicly release reduced ALMA mosaic maps, cubes, and the source catalog.

### 300) [2307.06336](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06336v3): Ultraviolet Compactness of High-Redshift Galaxies as a Tracer of Early-Stage Gas Infall, Bursty Star Formation, and Offset from the Fundamental Metallicity Relation

<p> Danial Langeroodi, Jens Hjorth </p>
<p>
The empirical anti-correlation between gas-phase metallicity and star formation rate (SFR) at a fixed stellar mass, known as the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR), is commonly interpreted as an equilibrium state in the interplay between gas infall, enrichment, and gas removal. JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy has shown a z&gt;3 deviation from the local-universe FMR calibrations, suggesting that these galaxies are potentially caught out of equilibrium. To investigate this, we inferred the stellar population, nebular, and morphological properties of 427 galaxies at 3&lt;z&lt;10 using uniformly reduced NIRSpec prism spectroscopy and NIRCam photometry. We consider morphology as a possible indicator of chemical enrichment stage. We find a mass-size relation already in place at 4&lt;z&lt;10, with a normalization anti-correlated with redshift. The size-redshift anti-correlation depends on stellar mass: while the size of M_*&lt;10^8M<sub>&odot;</sub> galaxies strongly declines with redshift, M_*&gt;10^9M<sub>&odot;</sub> galaxies exhibit negligible redshift evolution. We also confirm the redshift evolution of the FMR: z&gt;3 galaxies appear metal-deficient compared to expectations for their stellar mass and SFR according to the local-universe FMR. This offset grows with redshift. Metal deficiency is correlated with compactness: galaxies most offset from the average mass-size relation are also the most metal-poor for their stellar mass and SFR. We interpret this as a product of bursty star formation: compact galaxies exhibit elevated SFR surface densities, indicating that they are observed during burst episodes triggered by gas infall. While accretion of metal-poor gas has reduced their gas-phase metallicity by diluting the interstellar medium, they are observed prior to chemical yield release by newly formed massive stars. Simply, they are chemically out of equilibrium compared to the equilibrium state known as the FMR.
