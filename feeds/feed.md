### 1) [2510.11702](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11702v1): The Sunburst Arc with JWST. IV. The importance of interaction, turbulence, and feedback for Lyman-continuum escape

<p>
At present, the best opportunity for detailed Lyman Continuum escape studies is in gravitationally lensed galaxies at z ≥ 2. Only one such galaxy currently exists in the literature with sufficient spatial magnification: The Sunburst Arc at redshift z = 2.37. Here, we present rest-frame optical JWST NIRSpec integral field observations of the Sunburst Arc that cover a large fraction of the source plane. From this dataset, we generate precise maps of ISM kinematics, dust geometry, ionization, and chemical enrichment. We find that the galaxy rotates but also shows strong, possibly dominant, signatures of turbulence, which are indicative of recent or ongoing major interaction. The cluster that leaks ionizing photons shows little variation in kinematics or dust coverage, but dramatically elevated ionization, indicating that photoionization is the predominant mechanism that creates paths for LyC escape. We conjecture that tidal stripping of H I gas due to an interaction could have removed a large portion of the neutral ISM around the LyC emitting cluster, making it easier for the cluster to completely ionize the rest.

### 2) [2510.11626](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11626v1): JADES Dark Horse: demonstrating high-multiplex observations with JWST/NIRSpec dense-shutter spectroscopy in the JADES Origins Field

<p>
We present JWST/NIRSpec dense-shutter spectroscopy (DSS). This novel observing strategy with the NIRSpec micro-shutter assembly (MSA) deliberately permits a high number of controlled spectral overlaps to reach extreme multiplex while retaining the low background of slit spectroscopy. In a single configuration over the JADES Origins Field we opened shutters on all faint (F444W&lt;30 mag) z<sub>phot</sub>&gt;3 candidates in the MSA, prioritising emission-line science and rejecting only bright continuum sources. Using 33.6 and 35.8 ks on-source in G235M and G395M, we observed a single mask with ~850 sources, obtaining secure spectroscopic redshifts for ~540 galaxies over 2.5&lt;z&lt;8.9. The per-configuration target density in DSS mode is 4-5x higher than standard no- and low-overlap MSA strategies (&lt;200 sources), with no loss in redshift precision or accuracy. Line-flux sensitivities are 30 percent lower at fixed exposure time, matching the expected increase in background noise, but the gain in survey speed is 5x in our setup, more than justifying the penalty. The measured line sensitivity exceeds NIRCam WFSS by a minimum factor of ~5 (i.e. ~25 in exposure time) at &lambda;~4 &mu;m, demonstrating that controlled overlap is a compelling method to gain deep, wide-band spectra for large samples. Crucially, we envisage the MSA could deliver even higher target allocation densities than what used here. We derive Balmer-line based SFRs, gas-phase metallicities (including a large sample suitable for strong-line calibrations), and identify rare sources (mini-quenched systems and broad-line AGN). This approach is immediately applicable wherever deep imaging enables robust pre-selection and astrometry, providing an efficient method to obtain large samples of faint emission-line galaxies, a compelling middle ground between the completeness of slitless surveys and the sensitivity and bandwidth of NIRSpec/MSA.

<p>
Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are key diagnostics of the physical conditions in the interstellar medium and are widely used to trace star formation in the mid-infrared (mid-IR). The relative strengths of mid-IR PAH emission features (e.g., 6.2, 7.7, 11.3 um) are sensitive to both the size and ionization state of the molecules and can be strongly influenced by the local radiation field. However, at low metallicities ( Z &lt; 0.2 Zsun), detecting PAHs remains notoriously difficult, likely reflecting a combination of suppressed formation and enhanced destruction mechanisms. We present new JWST/MIRI MRS observations of the metal-poor (Z = 0.1 Zsun) dwarf galaxy CGCG 007-025. We confirm the tentative PAH detection previously reported from Spitzer data and, for the first time, identify a compact (approx. 50 pc) PAH-emitting region nearly co-spatial with the newly detected [NeV](I.P. = 97 eV) emission and the galaxy's most metal-poor, strongly star-forming region. The 11.3 um PAH feature is clearly detected, while no emission is found from the other typically brighter features, suggesting a PAH population dominated by large, neutral molecules resilient to hard ionizing fields. When compared with models, mid-IR line ratios involving [NeIII], [OIV], and [NeV] can only be reproduced by a combination of star formation and AGN ionization, with the latter contributing 4&ndash;8%. The [OIV] and [NeV] luminosities exceed what massive stars or shocks can produce, highlighting a puzzling scenario in line with recent JWST observations of similar galaxies. This work provides a crucial reference for studying the physical conditions of the dust and star formation in low-metallicity starburst regions, environments typical of the early universe.

### 4) [2510.11455](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11455v1): Feeding the dead: neutral gas inflow with suppressed star formation in a long-quenched ancient massive galaxy at z~2.7 observed with JWST/NIRSpec

We report the spectroscopic detection of neutral gas inflow into a massive (M_* ≃ 4× 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) quiescent galaxy observed at z<sub>spec</sub> = 2.6576 with JWST. From the redshifted absorption of the NaI doublet at &lambda; &lambda; 5890, 5896 Ang, we estimate an inflow velocity v=278^+79_-79 km s<sup>-1</sup> and a column density log(N_NaI/cm<sup>2</sup>) = 13.02^+0.03_-0.03. We derive the inflowing mass of the gas M_in = 1.6^+0.1_-0.1 × 10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and rate M&#775;_in = 19^+6_-7   M<sub>&odot;</sub>   yr^-1. The presence of several surrounding galaxies suggests that the galaxy may be accreting gas from nearby companions. However, we cannot confirm it with current data and the intergalactic medium or cosmic filaments are also viable sources of the inflowing gas. Despite the ongoing inflow, the galaxy remains quiescent, with an upper limit to the star formation rate of 0.2   M<sub>&odot;</sub>   yr^-1. Moreover, its star formation history suggests that the galaxy has remained quiescent during the past ~1 Gyr, with half of its stars formed by redshift z_50=11^+18_-3. We discuss that the inflow is not massive, dense, or long-lived enough to ignite significant star formation, or it is fueling low-level AGN activity instead. This is direct evidence that quiescent galaxies can accrete cold gas after their quenching while keeping their star formation subdued. Follow-up observations with JWST and ALMA will be needed to constraint the nature of the inflowing gas.

### 5) [2510.11373](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11373v1): JWST COSMOS-3D: Spectroscopic Census and Luminosity Function of [O III] Emitters at 6.75&lt;z&lt;9.05 in COSMOS

We present a spectroscopically-selected [OIII]+Hb emitters catalogue at 6.75&lt;z&lt;9.05 and the resulting [OIII] 5008 &#8491; Luminosity Function (LF) in the COSMOS field. We leverage the 0.3 deg<sup>2</sup> covered to date by COSMOS-3D using NIRCam/WFSS F444W (90% of the survey) to perform the largest spectroscopic search for [OIII] emitters at 6.75&lt;z&lt;9.05. We present our catalogue of 237 [OIII] emitters and their associated completeness function. The inferred constraints on the [OIII] LF enable us to characterise the knee of the [OIII] LF, resulting in improved [OIII] LF constraints at z~7,8. Notably, we find evidence for an accelerated decline of the [OIII] luminosity density between z~7 and z~8, which could be expected if the metallicity of [OIII] emitters, as well as the cosmic star-formation rate density, is declining at these redshifts. We find that theoretical models that reproduce the z~7,8 [OIII] LF do not reproduce well the [OIII] equivalent width distribution, pointing to potential challenges in the modelling of[OIII] and other nebular lines in the early Universe. Finally, we provide the first constraints on the cosmic variance of [OIII] emitters, estimating at 15% the relative uncertainty for the z~7,8 [OIII] LF in the 0.3 deg<sup>2</sup> field. This estimate is in good agreement with that inferred from clustering, and shows that the [OIII] LF derived from smaller extragalactic legacy fields is strongly affected by cosmic variance. Our results highlight the fundamental role that wide-area JWST slitless surveys play to map the galaxy large-scale structure down into the reionisation era, serving as a springboard for a variety of science cases.

### 6) [2510.11351](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11351v1): REBELS-IFU: Linking damped Lyman-α absorption to [CII] emission and dust content in the EoR

Neutral gas in galaxies during the Epoch of Reionisation regulates star formation, dust growth, and the escape of ionising photons, making it a key ingredient in understanding both galaxy assembly and reionisation. Yet, direct constraints on the HI content of galaxies at z&gt;6 have been scarce. With JWST, Ly&alpha; damping wings in galaxy spectra can now provide a direct probe of this neutral component. We analyse JWST/NIRSpec prism spectra of 12 UV-luminous galaxies from the REBELS-IFU program at z~6.5-7.7, deriving HI column densities by modelling Ly&alpha; damping wings. Significant damped Ly&alpha; absorption is detected in eight galaxies, with N_HI≳10^21 cm<sup>2</sup>. We use the column densities and sizes derived for these sources to estimate their HI mass and compare with L_[CII]-M_HI calibrations. The resulting HI masses show a tentative correlation with those inferred from [CII], although the [CII]-based estimates are systematically larger, suggesting that the HI reservoirs may extend beyond the [CII]-emitting gas. We also combine the DLA-based measurements with FIR-derived dust-to-gas ratios, dust attenuation, and gas-phase metallicities. No correlation is found between DLA-based and FIR-based dust-to-gas ratios, but combining the REBELS-IFU sample with literature samples at lower metallicities reveals a strong correlation between A_V/N_HI and metallicity. These findings suggest that by z~7 massive galaxies can already host substantial, enriched reservoirs of neutral gas and dust, consistent with A_V/N_HI-metallicity trends at lower redshift. At the highest redshifts (z&gt;8), however, we see tentative evidence for systematically lower A_V/N_HI at fixed metallicity, which may point to pristine gas accretion or more efficient dust destruction/expulsion.

### 7) [2510.11326](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11326v1): MSA-3D: Uncovering Weak AGNs and Resolved Outflows in Disguise in z~1 Star-Forming Galaxies

<p>
We present spatially resolved rest-optical spectroscopy of 38 star-forming galaxies at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.7 from the JWST/NIRSpec MSA-3D survey, which uses slit-stepping to build IFU-like datacubes at 0.1'' resolution. We map emission-line morphology, excitation, and kinematics of the warm ionized gas using [N II]/H&alpha;, [S II]/H&alpha;, and [O III]/H&beta;. Relative to z~0 galaxies at fixed stellar mass, our sources show systematically lower [N II]/H&alpha; and [S II]/H&alpha; and elevated [O III]/H&beta;, consistent with harder radiation fields and lower metallicities. Radially, [O III]/H&beta; profiles are typically flat or mildly positive, whereas [N II]/H&alpha; also remains flat or declines outward, mirroring metallicity trends. On kpc scales, we find a strong positive correlation between [N II]/H&alpha; and velocity dispersion (&sigma;), linking local excitation to turbulent or shock-driven kinematics. Six galaxies (~ 16% of the sample) host spatially localized regions with elevated [N II]/H&alpha;, high EW(H&alpha;), and V_RMS = \sqrtV^2 + &sigma;^2 &gt; 200 km/s, indicative of weak AGN activity, shocks, or outflows. For these candidates we infer modest warm-ionized outflow rates of 1-4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr and kinetic powers ~ 0.1-1% of the AGN bolometric luminosity (from central [O III] or H&alpha;). These values place our sample at the low-energy tail of known AGN-driven outflows yet in continuity with M&#775;_out-L_AGN scaling relations across 0 &lt; z &lt; 6. A completeness assessment shows MSA-3D is sensitive to AGN with L_AGN ≥ 10^43 erg/s, underscoring both the promise and current limitations of detecting weak AGN activity in distant galaxies with resolved spectroscopy.

### 8) [2510.11248](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11248v1): PDRs4All XVII: Formation and excitation of HD in photodissociation regions. Application to the Orion Bar

<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope enabled the first detection of several rovibrational emission lines of HD in the Orion Bar, a prototypical photodissociation region. This provides an incentive to examine the physics of HD in dense and strong PDRs. Using the latest data available on HD excitation by collisional, radiative and chemical processes, our goal is to unveil HD formation and excitation processes in PDRs by comparing our state-of-the-art PDR model with observations made in the Orion Bar and discuss if and how HD can be used as a complementary tracer of physical parameters in the emitting region. We compute detailed PDR models, using an upgraded version of the Meudon PDR code, which are compared to NIRSpec data using excitation diagrams and synthetic emission spectra. The models predict that HD is mainly produced in the gas phase via the reaction D + H2 = H + HD at the front edge of the PDR and that the D/HD transition is located slightly closer to the edge than the H/H2 transition. Rovibrational levels are excited by UV pumping. In the observations, HD rovibrational emission is detected close to the H/H2 dissociation fronts of the Orion Bar and peaks where vibrationally excited H2 peaks, rather than at the maximum emission of pure rotational H2 levels. We derive an excitation temperature around Tex ~ 480 - 710 K. Due to high continuum in the Orion Bar, fringes lead to high noise levels beyond 15 &mu;m, no pure rotational lines of HD are detected. The comparison to PDR models shows that a range of thermal pressure P = (3-9)x10^7 K cm^-3 with no strong constraints on the intensity of the UV field are compatible with HD observations. This range of pressure is compatible with previous estimates from H2 observations with JWST. This is the first time that observations of HD emission lines in the near-infrared are used to put constraints on the thermal pressure in the PDR.

### 9) [2510.11010](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11010v1): The Relation Between AGN and Host Galaxy Properties in the JWST Era: II. The merger-driven evolution of Seyferts at Cosmic Noon

<p> Nina Bonaventura, Jianwei Lyu, George H. Rieke, Andrew J. Bunker, Chris J. Willott, Christopher N. A. Willmer </p>
<p>
In Paper I, we exploited the unsurpassed resolution and depth of JWST/NIRCam imagery to investigate the relationship between AGN and host-galaxy properties in the JWST era, finding a correlation between the level of spatial disturbance (as measured by shape asymmetry, A_S) and obscuration (N_H). Here in Paper II, we report an expansion of our X-ray and infrared analysis of Seyfert-luminosity host galaxies with four additional metrics to the single-metric morphology analysis of Paper I, as well as new samples of inactive control galaxies. This expanded study of one of the largest and most complete, multi-wavelength samples of AGN detected at 0.6&lt;z&lt;2.4 in the GOODS-South and North fields, confirms that mergers surprisingly play a significant role in obscured, sub-quasar AGN host galaxies. Additionally, the pattern of morphological disturbances observed amongst the X-ray- and mid-IR-selected AGN suggests that these represent different phases of AGN evolution tied to a major-merger timeline, as opposed to distinct populations of AGN. These results indicate that mergers are important in triggering sub-quasar AGN at these redshifts.

### 10) [2510.10772](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10772v1): Black Holes in the Shadow: The Missing High-Ionization Lines in the Earliest JWST AGNs

<p> Greta Zucchi, Xihan Ji, Piero Madau, Roberto Maiolino, Ignas Joudzbalis, Francesco D'Eugenio, Sophia Geris, Yuki Isobe </p>
<p>
Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered a substantial population of high-redshift, broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs), whose properties challenge standard models of black hole growth and AGN emission. We analyze a spectroscopic sample of 34 Type 1 AGNs from the JWST Advanced Deep Survey (JADES) survey, spanning redshifts 1.7 &lt; z &lt; 9, to constrain the physical nature of the accretion flows powering these sources with broad-line diagnostics statistically for the first time. At z &gt; 5, we find a marked suppression of high-ionization emission lines (HeII, CIV, NV) relative to prominent broad Halpha and narrow [OIII] features. This contrast places strong constraints on the shape of the ionizing spectral energy distribution (SED) and on the physical conditions in the broad-line region (BLR). By comparing the observations to photoionization models based on SEDs of black holes accreting at sub-Eddington ratios, we show that standard AGN continua struggle to reproduce the observed broad line ratios and equivalent widths across a wide ionization parameter range. These results suggest the need for modified SEDs &ndash; either intrinsically softened due to super-Eddington accretion or radiative inefficiencies in the innermost disk, or externally filtered by intervening optically thick gas that absorbs or scatters the highest-energy photons before they reach the BLR.

<p>
Determining the infrared extinction curve towards the Galactic centre is crucial for accurately correcting observed data and deriving the underlying stellar populations. However, extinction curves reported in the literature often show discrepancies. We aim to derive the infrared extinction curve towards the Galactic centre based on JWST-NIRCam data for the first time, using observations of the Sagittarius C region in the 1-5 &mu;m range. We determined extinction ratios using two different methods, both based on measuring the reddening vector using the slope of red clump stars, whose intrinsic properties are well known, in observed colour-magnitude diagrams. The extinction curve derived in this work is in good agreement with previous results in the literature. We obtained the following extinction ratios relative to F162M: A_F115W : A_F162M : A_F182M : A_F212N : A_F360M : A_F405N : A_F470N : A_F480M = 1.84 ± 0.03 : 1.00 : 0.789 ± 0.005 : 0.607 ± 0.014 : 0.306 ± 0.011 : 0.248 ± 0.017 : 0.240 ± 0.019 : 0.21 ± 0.03. Besides, we found different values of the extinction index for the short- (&lambda; ~ 1-2.5 &mu;m, &alpha; ~ 2) and long-wavelength (&lambda; ~ 2.5-5 &mu;m, &alpha; ~ 1.4) regimes, with the extinction curve flattening at longer wavelengths. Comparison with extinction curves derived both inside and outside the Galactic centre suggests that the infrared extinction curve does not significantly vary in the central regions, and shows no significant evidence for variations between different lines of sight beyond the inner Galaxy within the uncertainties.

<p>
JWST has enabled the discovery of a statistical sample of obscured (type II) active galactic nuclei (AGN) at cosmic noon. Studies comparing those type II AGN with type I AGN at that epoch have reinforced the long-standing idea of an evolutionary link between those classes of objects. Mergers, the idea goes, disturb the morphologies and angular momentum of galaxies. The disruption of angular momentum allows material to be funneled toward galactic cores, sparking AGN activity and potentially also a burst of star-formation. That material enshrouds the galactic nucleus, leading to a type II AGN. Later, AGN feedback clears the circumnuclear dust, leading to a transition into a type I AGN, and also quenches star formation. If this is a common outcome, a class of intermediate objects should exist. Such objects would be somewhat disturbed and dusty and sit below the star-forming galaxy main sequence, and their star-formation histories would show an increase in star-formation at around the time of the suspected merger. We present new JWST observations of SDSSJ2222+2745, a strongly lensed AGN at z=2.801. The lensing magnification enables a detailed study of the host galaxy spanning the rest-ultraviolet through near infrared. JWST and HST photometry, morphological models, and models of the host's spectral energy distribution reveal that SDSSJ2222+2745 is actively transitioning from a type II to type I AGN. Catching a lensed AGN at this special evolutionary phase makes SDSSJ2222+2745 a unique laboratory to study the physical processes involved in the transition and their relationships to the AGN and the host galaxy at incredible spatial-resolution down to about 20pc at z=2.801.

### 13) [2510.09972](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09972v1): PAH Spectral Diversity in NGC 7027 and the Evolution of Aromatic Carriers

<p> Charlotte Smith-Perez, Aidan Hembruff, Els Peeters, Alexander G. G. M. Tielens, Alessandra Ricca </p>
<p>
Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) constitute a significant fraction of the Universe's carbon budget, playing a key role in the cosmic carbon cycle and dominating the mid-infrared spectra of astrophysical environments in which they reside. Although PAHs are known to form in the circumstellar envelopes of post-AGB stars, their formation and evolution are still not well-understood. We aim to understand how pristine complex hydrocarbons and PAHs in circumstellar environments transition to the PAHs observed in the ISM. The mid-infrared PAH spectra (5-18 micron) of the planetary nebula, NGC 7027, are investigated using spectral cubes from JWST MIRI-MRS. We report the first detection of spatially-resolved variations of the PAH spectral profiles across class A, AB, and B in all major PAH bands (6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.2 micron) within a single source, NGC 7027. These variations are linked to morphological structures within NGC 7027. Clear correlations are revealed between the 6.2, 7.7, and 8.6 micron features, where the red components (6.26, 7.8, 8.65 micron) exhibit a strong correlation and the same is found for the blue components of the 6.2 and 7.7 (6.205 and 7.6 micron). The blue component of the 8.6 (8.56 micron) appears to be independent of the other components. We link this behaviour to differences in molecular structure of their PAH subpopulations. Decomposition of the 11.2 micron band confirms two previously identified components, with the broader 11.25 micron component attributed to emission from very small grains of PAH clusters rather than PAH emission. We show that PAH profile classes generally vary with proximity to the central star's UV radiation field, suggesting class B PAHs represent more processed species while class A PAHs remain relatively pristine, challenging current notions on the spectral evolution of PAHs.

Galaxy-scale outflows are of critical importance for galaxy formation and evolution. Dust grains are the main sites for the formation of molecules needed for star formation but are also important for the acceleration of outflows that can remove the gas reservoir critical for stellar mass growth. Using the MIRI medium-resolution integral field spectrograph aboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we detect the 3.28 &mu;m aromatic and the 3.4 &mu;m aliphatic hydrocarbon dust features in absorption in a redshift 4.601 hot dust-obscured galaxy, blue-shifted by &Delta;V=-5250^+276_-339 kms<sup>-1</sup> from the systemic redshift of the galaxy. The extremely high velocity of the dust indicates that the wind was accelerated by radiation pressure from the central quasar. These results pave a novel way for probing the physics of dusty outflows in active galaxies at early cosmic time.

<p>
Broadband mid-infrared (MIR) imaging with high spatial resolution is useful to study extended dust structures in the circumnuclear regions of nearby AGN. However, broadband imaging filters cannot distinguish dust continuum emission from emission lines, and so accounting for the emission line contamination becomes crucial in studying extended dust in these environments.This paper uses Cycle 1 MIR imaging from JWST/MIRI and spectroscopy from JWST/MRS for 11 local Seyfert galaxies, as part of the Galactic Activity, Torus and Outflow Survey (GATOS). Three of the objects (NGC 3081, NGC 5728, and NGC 7172) exist in both datasets, allowing direct measurement of the line emission using the spectroscopy for these objects. We find that extended MIR emission persists on scales of 100s of parsecs after the removal of contamination from emission lines. Further, the line contamination levels vary greatly between objects (from 5% to 30% in the F1000W filter), and across filters, so cannot be generalised across a sample and must be carefully treated for each object and band. We also test methods to estimate the line contamination when only MRS spectroscopy or MIRI imaging is available, using pre-JWST ancillary data. We find that these methods estimate the contamination within 10 percentage points. This paper serves as a useful guide for methods to quantify and mitigate for emission line contamination in MIRI broadband imaging

Cosmic noon represents the prime epoch of galaxy assembly, and a sweet spot for observations with the James Webb Telescope (JWST) and ground-based near-IR integral-field unit (IFU) spectrographs. This work analyses JWST NIRSpec Micro Shutter Array (MSA), NIRCam Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS) of K20-ID7, a large spiral, star-forming (SF) galaxy at z=2.2, with evidence for radial gas inflows. By exploiting the synergy with ground-based IFU ERIS observations, we conduct a comprehensive and resolved study of the interstellar medium (ISM) and stellar properties, from rest optical to near-IR, via emission-line diagnostics, resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of high-resolution imaging, and Pa&beta; line detection in NIRCam WFSS data. Our analysis reveals massive (M<sub>&sext;</sub>≃(0.67-3.5)×10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) SF clumps with star formation rates (SFRs) ~3-24 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr, and quite low dust attenuation (A_V≃0.4), electron density (n_e&lt;300 cm^-3), and ionisation (log(U)≃ -3.0). The central bulge turns out to be modestly massive (M<sub>&sext;</sub>=(7±3)×10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), heavily obscured (A_V=6.43±0.55), and likely to have formed most of its stellar mass in the past (SFR=82±42 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr over the last 100 Myr), yet still forming stars at a lower rate (SFR=12±8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr over the last 10 Myr). We infer a metallicity 12+log(O/H)~8.54 and an apparent enhancement of the N/O abundance (log(N/O)≃ -1.0) in all distinct galaxy regions, a likely consequence of dilution effects due to radial inflows of metal-poor gas. We measure a sub-solar sulfur abundance (log(S/O)≃-1.9). Finally, the radial stellar age profile reveals older stellar populations in the inner galaxy regions compared to the outskirts, pointing to an inside-out growth of K20-ID7.

<p>
Measurements of quasar lifetimes at high redshift indicate that the earliest billion-solar-mass supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have only been active as luminous quasars for less than a million years. Recently, extended Ly&alpha; nebulae around z~6 quasars have revealed that these short observed lifetimes are unlikely a sightline-dependent effect. However, the interpretation of Ly&alpha; emission is not straightforward due to its resonant nature. In this work, we use rest-frame optical emission lines, which more directly trace photoionization by the quasar, to unambiguously validate the short line-of-sight quasar lifetimes observed at early cosmic epochs. We use deep James Webb Space Telescope/NIRSpec IFU observations of five z~ 6 quasars with small proximity zones to search for their extended emission line nebulae in H&alpha; and [O III]5007, and detect extended emission in both emission lines around four quasars in our sample. We then use the light-crossing time of these nebulae to measure quasar lifetimes along transverse sightlines. Using their H&alpha; nebulae, we also confirm that recombination is likely the dominant emission mechanism behind their previously detected Ly&alpha; nebulae. Our results confirm the existence of high-redshift quasars with extremely short lifetimes, t_Q ≲ 10^5 yr, hosting billion-solar-mass black holes, indicating that rapid accretion is likely responsible for the assembly of SMBHs in the early Universe.

### 18) [2510.09568](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09568v1): Galaxy Underdensities Host the Clearest IGM Lyα Transmission and Indicate Anisotropic Reionization

<p> Yongda Zhu, George D. Becker, Anson D'Aloisio, Ryan Endsley, Nakul Gangolli, Christopher Cain, Charlotte A. Mason, Seyedazim Hashemi, Hui Hong </p>
<p>
How galaxies drive reionization and what governs its geometry remain fundamental questions. We present JWST/NIRCam wide-field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) observations toward two of the most Ly&alpha;-transmissive QSO sightlines near the end of reionization. We find that regions at z ~ 5.7 along both sightlines previously found to be low-density in Ly&alpha; emitters are also underdense in [O III] emitters, with densities less than half the cosmic mean. Other transmissive regions, however, are found to coincide with average-density environments, indicating that multiple pathways may produce high IGM transmission. For the first time, we measure the two-dimensional cross-correlation between IGM transmission and galaxy positions, revealing evidence for anisotropic ionization geometry. Specifically, we detect enhanced transmission at transverse distances of &Delta; r ~ 0.8 times the mean free path, consistent with ionizing photons escaping preferentially along large-scale structures that are aligned with, but offset from, the line of sight. This anisotropic escape may contribute to the observed patchiness of reionization and challenges the assumption of isotropic ionized bubble growth in current models.

### 19) [2510.08997](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08997v1): Galaxy Metallicity Gradients in the Reionization Epoch from the FIRE-2 Simulations

<p>
We employ the high-redshift suite of FIRE-2 cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations to investigate the evolution of gas-phase metallicity radial gradients in galaxies in the epoch of reionization (EoR). Our sample consists of 22 galaxies spanning the redshift range z ~ 10-5. We find that galaxies at z~10 exhibit a median metallicity gradient of -0.15 dex\cdot kpc^-1 with substantial scatter, which gradually flatten to -0.1 dex\cdot kpc^-1 at z~6, accompanied by a reduction in scatter. In the EoR, metallicity gradients correlate positively with stellar mass: more massive galaxies display flatter gradients with smaller scatter, broadly consistent with recent JWST observations. At fixed stellar mass, galaxies with higher star formation rates (SFRs) exhibit steeper negative gradients, while sSFR shows a strong anti-correlation with gradient slope. Because EoR galaxies in FIRE-2 generally lack significant rotational support, we adopt the ratio of peak-to-peak velocity shear to twice the velocity dispersion (&Delta; v/2&sigma;) as a proxy for the strength of gas flows. We find a strong positive correlation between metallicity gradients and &Delta; v/2&sigma;: galaxies with lower &Delta; v/2&sigma; (i.e., weaker gas flows) tend to exhibit steeper negative gradients. Furthermore, galaxies with steeper gradients display higher central SFR surface densities, suggesting localized star formation with inefficient interstellar medium mixing that drives inside-out chemical enrichment in galaxy evolution in the early Universe.

<p>
El Gordo (ACT-CL J0102-4915) is a massive galaxy cluster with two major mass components at redshift z=0.87. Using SED fitting results from JWST/NIRCam photometry, the fraction of quenched galaxies in this cluster was measured in two bins of stellar mass: 9&lt;log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;10 and 10≤log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;12. While there is no correlation between the quenched fraction and angular separation from the cluster's overall center of mass, there is a correlation between the quenched fraction and angular separation from the center of the nearest of the two mass components for the less-massive galaxies. This suggests that environmental quenching processes are in place at z~1, and that dwarf galaxies are more affected by those processes than massive galaxies.

<p> Guillermo Garcia-Segura, Arturo Manchado, Jesus A. Toala, Martin A. Guerrero, Alberto J. Castro-Tirado </p>
<p>
Two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations are presented from the formation up to the late evolution of planetary nebula, for 6 different stellar models from 1 to 5 Mo. The hydrodynamical models use stellar evolution calculations as inner boundary conditions and updated values for the number of ionizing photons. Special emphasis is placed on the formation of neutral spikes, as recently observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. The results indicate that neutral spikes can be detected either at the formation of planetary nebulae or in their decline. In the first case, the temporal window decreases with the mass of the model, ranging from 3,000 years in the 1 Mo case to 0 for 5 Mo. In the second case, only the 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 Mo cases allow us to detect the neutral spikes for most of the remaining time.

<p>
We present a detailed analysis of the white dwarf cooling sequence (WD CS) in omega Centauri based on combined Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and JWST observations. Our analysis confirms the previously reported split - based on HST observations in ultraviolet filters - in the upper part of the WD CS, consistent with the presence of two distinct WD populations, and extends it to a significantly fainter and cooler limit (down to ~8000 K), corresponding to cooling ages of about 1 Gyr. We used artificial star (AS) tests and cooling models to confirm that the split is evidence of two WD populations with different masses and progenitors: one sequence of canonical WDs produced by the He-normal progenitors, and one sequence of low-mass WDs originated from the cluster He-rich component. We show that the fraction of WDs from the He-rich component in the outer regions is smaller than that found in the innermost regions. We also studied the kinematics of WDs and showed that in the outer regions, the velocity distribution of WDs from He-rich progenitors is slightly radially anisotropic, while that of canonical WDs is slightly tangentially anisotropic. Both the radial variation of the fraction of WDs from the He-rich population and the difference between their velocity distribution and that of canonical WDs are consistent with spatial and kinematic differences previously found for He-rich and He-normal main-sequence (MS) stars and in general agreement with models predicting that He-rich stars form more centrally concentrated than He-normal stars.

<p>
We present JWST observations of the environments surrounding two high-redshift quasars &ndash; J0252-0503 at z = 7.0 and J1007+2115 at z = 7.5 &ndash; which enable the first constraints on quasar-galaxy clustering at z ~ 7.3. Galaxies in the vicinity of the quasars are selected through ground-based and JWST/NIRCam imaging and then spectroscopically confirmed with JWST/NIRSpec using the multi-shutter assembly (MSA). Over both fields, we identify 51 z&gt;5 galaxies, of which eight are found within a &Delta; v_rmLOS=±1500 km s<sup>-1</sup> line-of-sight velocity window from the quasars and another eight in the background. The galaxy J0252\_8713, located just 7 pkpc and &Delta; v_rmLOS ≈ 360 km s<sup>-1</sup> from quasar J0252-0503, emerges as a compelling candidate for one of the most distant quasar-galaxy mergers. Combining the galaxy discoveries over the two fields, we measure the quasar-galaxy cross-correlation and obtain a correlation length of r_0^QG≈7.6_-1.6^+1.7 h^-1 cMpc, based on a power-law model with a fixed slope of &gamma;_QG = 2.0. Under the assumption that quasars and galaxies trace the same underlying dark matter density fluctuations, we infer a minimum dark matter halo mass for z≃7.3 quasars of log_10(M_rmhalo, min/rmM<sub>&odot;</sub>)= 11.6±0.6 in a halo model framework. Compared to measurements from EIGER at &langle; z &rangle; = 6.25 and ASPIRE at &langle; z &rangle; = 6.7 (where log_10(M_rmhalo, min/rmM<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≳ 12.3), our clustering results provide tentative evidence for a non-monotonic redshift evolution of quasar clustering properties. We further estimate a quasar duty cycle of f_duty≈0.1&percnt;, consistent with constraints from quasar proximity zones and IGM damping wings. (abridged)

### 24) [2510.08354](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08354v1): Mephisto: Self-Improving Large Language Model-Based Agents for Automated Interpretation of Multi-band Galaxy Observations

<p> Zechang Sun, Yuan-Sen Ting, Yaobo Liang, Nan Duan, Song Huang, Zheng Cai </p>
<p>
Astronomical research has long relied on human expertise to interpret complex data and formulate scientific hypotheses. In this study, we introduce Mephisto &ndash; a multi-agent collaboration framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that emulates human-like reasoning for analyzing multi-band galaxy observations. Mephisto interfaces with the CIGALE codebase (a library of spectral energy distribution, SED, models) to iteratively refine physical models against observational data. It conducts deliberate reasoning via tree search, accumulates knowledge through self-play, and dynamically updates its knowledge base. Validated across diverse galaxy populations &ndash; including the James Webb Space Telescope's recently discovered "Little Red Dot" galaxies &ndash; we show that Mephisto demonstrates proficiency in inferring the physical properties of galaxies from multi-band photometry, positioning it as a promising research copilot for astronomers. Unlike prior black-box machine learning approaches in astronomy, Mephisto offers a transparent, human-aligned reasoning process that integrates seamlessly with existing research practices. This work underscores the possibility of LLM-driven agent-based research for astronomy, establishes a foundation for fully automated, end-to-end artificial intelligence (AI)-powered scientific workflows, and unlocks new avenues for AI-augmented discoveries in astronomy.

Recent observations have revealed a remarkably rapid buildup of cosmic dust in the interstellar medium (ISM) of high redshift galaxies, with complex dust compositions and large abundances already appearing at redshifts z&gt;6. Here we present a comprehensive, joint analysis of observations taken with the  James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA) of the highly magnified, dusty `normal' galaxy, A1689-zD1 at z=7.13. We perform detailed spectro-photometric modeling of the rest-frame UV to far-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) based on archival photometry of the source and report new rest-frame optical strong-line measurements and metallicity estimates from recent JWST/NIRSpec IFU data. We find that despite its substantial dust mass, M_dust~ 1.5× 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, A1689-zD1 has remarkably low dust-to-gas and dust-to-metal mass ratios, DTG = (5.1^+3.0_-1.9)× 10^-4 and DTM = (6.1^+3.6_-2.3)× 10^-2, respectively, due to its high metallicity 12+log(O/H) = 8.36± 0.10 and substantial gas mass, M_gas = (2.8^+0.2_-1.7)× 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. The DTG and DTM mass ratios are an order of magnitude lower than expected for galaxies in the local universe with similar chemical enrichment. These low relative measurements are also corroborated by the deficit observed in the A_V/N_HI ratio of A1689-zD1 in the line-of-sight. We find that this deviation in the DTG and DTM mass ratios appears to be ubiquitous in other metal-rich galaxies at similar redshifts, z≳ 6. This suggests that the processes that form and destroy dust at later times, or the dust emissivity itself, are drastically different for galaxies in the early Universe.

<p>
JWST's exquisite data have opened the doors to new possibilities in detecting broad classes of astronomical objects, but also to new challenges in classifying those objects. In this work, we introduce SESHAT, the Stellar Evolutionary Stage Heuristic Assessment Tool for the identification of Young Stellar Objects, field stars (main sequence through asymptotic giant branch), brown dwarfs, white dwarfs, and galaxies, from any JWST observation. This identification is done using the machine learning method XGBoost to analyze thousands of rows of synthetic photometry, modified at run-time to match the filters available in the data to be classified. We validate this tool on real data of both star-forming regions and cosmological fields, and find we are able to reproduce the observed classes of objects to a minimum of 80&percnt; recall across every class, without additional information on the ellipticity or spatial distribution of the objects. Furthermore, this tool can be used to test the filter choices for JWST proposals, to verify whether the chosen filters are sufficient to identify the desired class of objects. SESHAT is released as a Python package to the community for general use.

### 27) [2510.07595](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07595v1): Composition of planetary debris around the white dwarf GD 362

<p>
White dwarf stars with high abundances of heavy elements in their atmospheres and infrared excesses are believed to be accreting planetary material. GD 362 is one of the most heavily polluted white dwarfs and has an exceptionally strong mid-infrared excess, reprocessing 2.4% of the star's light into the mid-infrared. We present a high signal-to-noise, medium-resolution spectrum of GD 362 obtained with JWST, covering 0.6 to 17 microns, along with photometry out to 25.5 microns. The mid-infrared spectrum is dominated by an exceptionally strong 9 to 11 micron silicate feature, which can be explained by a combination of olivine and pyroxene silicate minerals. Grains such as carbon, hotter than silicates, are required to explain the near-infrared emission. The silicates and carbon reside in a disk from 140 to 1400 stellar radii, and the disk scale height is greater than half the stellar radius. The elemental abundances of the solid material, relative to Si, are within a factor of 2 of meteoritic (CI chondrites) for C, O, Mg, Al, and Fe, with Al elevated and O slightly depleted. A similar pattern is observed for the abundances of accreted material in the stellar photosphere. Hydrogen is an exception, because no significant H-bearing minerals or water were detected in the disk, despite a large H abundance in the photosphere.

### 28) [2510.07407](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07407v1): The evolution of the bar fraction and bar lengths in the last 12 billion years

<p>
We investigate the evolution of the bar fraction and length using an extended JWST NIRCam imaging dataset of galaxies in the 1 ≤ z ≤ 4 redshift range. We assess the wavelength dependence of the bar fraction in disc galaxies and bar length evolution by selecting a nearly mass-complete CEERS disc sample and performing independent visual classifications on the short (F200W) and long (F356W+F444W) wavelength channels. A similar bar fraction is observed for both samples, and combined we find a declining trend in the bar fraction: 0.16^+0.03_-0.03 at 1 ≤ z &lt; 2; 0.08^+0.02_-0.01 at 2 ≤ z &lt; 3; 0.07^+0.03_-0.01 at 3 ≤ z ≤ 4. This corroborates our previous work and other recent studies, suggesting that dynamically cold and rotationally supported massive discs are present at Cosmic Noon. No evolution in the F356W+F444W bar length is measured from z = 4 to z = 1, which has a mean of 3.6 kpc, but a slight increase of about 1 kpc towards z = 1 is measured in the F200W sample, which has a mean of 2.9 kpc. The bar sample is shorter in the short-wavelength channel due to the better physical spatial resolution; however, we also suggest that dust obscuration plays a role. We find that the correlation between bar length and galaxy mass for massive galaxies observed at z &lt; 1 is not seen at z &gt; 1. By adding samples of barred galaxies at z&lt;1, we show that there is a modest increase in the bar length (≈ 2 kpc) towards z=0, but bars longer than ≈8 kpc are only found at z&lt;1. We show that bars and discs grow in tandem, for the bar length normalised by disc size does not evolve from z = 4 to z = 0. Not only is a significant population of bars forming beyond z = 1, but our results also show that some of these bars are as long and strong as the average bar at z≈0.

### 29) [2510.07369](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07369v1): ttgeko: A tool for modelling galaxy kinematics and morphology in JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopic observations

<p> A. Lola Danhaive, Sandro Tacchella </p>
<p>
Wide-field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) is a powerful tool for studying large samples of galaxies across cosmic times. With the arrival of JWST, and its NIRCAM grism mode, slitless spectroscopy can reach a medium spectral resolution of (R~ 1600), allowing it to spatially resolve the ionised-gas kinematics out to z~ 9. However, the kinematic information is convolved with morphology along the dispersion axis, a degeneracy that must be modelled to recover intrinsic properties. We present the Grism Emission-line Kinematics tOol (ttgeko), a Python package that forward-models NIRCam grism observations and infers emission-line morphologies and kinematics within a Bayesian framework. ttgeko combines S\'ersic surface-brightness models with arctangent rotation curves, includes full point-spread function (PSF) and line-spread function (LSF) convolution, and leverages gradient-based sampling via ttjax/ttnumpyro for efficient inference. It recovers parameters such as effective radius, velocity dispersion, rotational velocity, rotational support, and dynamical mass, with typical run times of ~20 minutes per galaxy on GPUs. We validate performance using extensive mock data spanning position angle, S/N, and morphology, quantifying where degeneracies limit recovery. Finally, we demonstrate applications to real FRESCO H&alpha; emitters at z≈ 4-6, recovering both rotation- and dispersion-dominated systems. ttgeko opens the way to statistical studies of galaxy dynamics in the early Universe and is publicly available at https://github.com/angelicalola-danhaive/geko.

<p>
JWST has identified a large population of faint, broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early universe that are powered by black holes (BHs) that often appear overmassive relative to their host galaxies. In this study, we examine the relationship between BH mass and galaxy stellar mass at 3&lt;z&lt;7 using a sample of 70 broad-line AGN identified using NIRSpec/G395M spectroscopy from the CEERS, JADES, and RUBIES surveys. Roughly half (43&percnt;) of our sample appear heavily reddened and are classified as little red dots (LRDs). We estimate BH masses (M_BH) using single-epoch virial techniques, while host stellar masses (M<sub>&sext;</sub>) are inferred using a combination of two-dimensional surface brightness profile fitting and spectral energy distribution modeling. We find that a majority of our sources (50/70) have M_BH/M<sub>&sext;</sub> ratios that are 1-2 dex higher than that observed in AGN locally. Using a forward-modeling Bayesian framework that accounts for uncertainties, intrinsic scatter, and selection effects, we infer a M_BH-M<sub>&sext;</sub> relationship that is &gt;3&sigma; above the relationship measured for local broad-line AGN. We derive an intrinsic scatter in this relationship of 0.9 dex, which does not vary over the redshift range of our sample. We also find that the M_BH/M<sub>&sext;</sub> ratio increases by 2.3 dex from z = 3.5 and z = 6.5 with a confidence level of &gt; 3&sigma;. We attribute this trend with the increasing fraction of LRDs in our sample at z&gt;4 as their host masses are ~1 dex lower than the non-LRD AGN in our sample. These results support a picture in which the BHs powering JWST's broad-line AGN are genuinely overmassive and become increasingly so with redshift. We discuss the implications of our findings on early BH growth relative to that of their host galaxies and the constraints it places on BH seeding models.

### 31) [2510.07303](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07303v1): Confirming Near- to Mid-IR Photometrically-Identified Obscured AGNs in the JWST era

<p> George H. Rieke, Yang Sun, Jianwei Lyu, Christopher N. A. Willmer, Yongda Zhu, Pierluigi Rinaldi, Meredith A. Stone, Kevin N. Hainline, Pablo G. Perez-Gonzalez </p>
<p>
We evaluate the underlying assumptions for the identification of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) through near- and mid-infrared photometry and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting out to z ~ 3. For massive galaxies, log(M) &gt; 9.5, our high resolution spectra of the rest optical range generally confirm the results of SED fitting, which relies primarily on excesses above the stellar emission between 1 and 6 microns to identify AGN. However, the method is undermined if the redshift used for the SED fitting is incorrect. Low mass galaxies, log(M) &lt; 9:5, can contain relatively warm dust that emits in the 4 - 6 micron range. We show that the potential contamination of AGN samples by purely star forming low-mass galaxies can be avoided by the use of the infrared properties of Haro 11 as a limiting star-forming SED template. However, relatively few star forming galaxies emit as strongly in the 3 - 6 micron range as this template, so this could result in missing some obscured AGNs to avoid a minor contamination. Including the behavior of the galaxies at rest lamda ~ 13.5 microns can mitigate this problem and yield more complete samples of bona fide AGN. JWST/MIRI supports this approach out to z ~ 0.6.

<p>
The diffuse glow of the cosmic web in Lyman-&alpha; emission has long been predicted, yet remained elusive to direct wide field detection. We present theoretical calculations that, when compared with recent observations made using the Condor Array Telescope in New Mexico reported in Lanzetta et al. 2024, point to its discovery at z ≈ 2.5. Synthetic Lyman-&alpha; surface brightness maps are constructed from five state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations (Illustris-TNG, SIMBA, EAGLE, CROCODILE, and Sherwood), incorporating dust attenuation, star formation, collisional excitation, and recombination physics. Our cosmic web Lyman-&alpha; surface brightness predictions are consistent with the UV excess detected at high significance in the recent deep, wide field, narrow-band imaging Condor data. The calculations presented here thus demonstrate that diffuse Lyman-&alpha; emission is observable with current (and next-generation) wide field low surface brightness facilities, opening the path to direct cartographic mapping of the cosmic web. These findings mark a turning point: for the first time, cosmology moves beyond inference from absorption and high-density peaks, into panoramic imaging of the faint intergalactic scaffolding that underpins structure formation in the Universe.

<p>
Strongly lensed supernovae (glSNe) provide a powerful, independent method to measure the Hubble constant, H_0, through time delays between their multiple images. The accuracy of this measurement depends critically on both the precision of time delay estimation and the robustness of lens modeling. In many current cluster-scale modeling algorithms, all multiple images used for modeling are simplified as point sources to reduce computational costs. In the first paper of the CURLING program, we demonstrated that such a point-like approximation can introduce significant uncertainties and biases in both magnification reconstruction and cosmological inference. In this study, we explore how such simplifications affect H_0 measurements from glSNe. We simulate a lensed supernova at z=1.95, lensed by a galaxy cluster at z=0.336, assuming time delays are measured from LSST-like light curves. The lens model is constructed using JWST-like imaging data, utilizing both Lenstool and a pixelated method developed in CURLING. Under a fiducial cosmology with H_0=70 km  s<sup>-1</sup> Mpc^-1, the Lenstool model yields H_0=69.91^+6.27_-5.50 km s<sup>-1</sup> Mpc^-1, whereas the pixelated framework improves the precision by over an order of magnitude, H_0=70.39^+0.82_-0.60 km  s<sup>-1</sup> Mpc^-1. Our results indicate that in the next-generation observations (e.g., JWST), uncertainties from lens modeling dominate the error budget for H_0 inference, emphasizing the importance of incorporating the extended surface brightness of multiple images to fully leverage the potential of glSNe for cosmology.

<p>
We present results of Pop. III formation in the MEGATRON suite of simulations, which self-consistently follows radiation and non-equilibrium chemistry, and resolves gas at near-pc resolution of a Milky Way-mass halo at Cosmic Dawn. While the very first Pop. III stars form in halos with masses well below the atomic cooling limit, whose cooling is dominated by molecular hydrogen, the majority of Pop. III stars form in more massive systems above the 10^4~K atomic cooling threshold. The shift in cooling regime of halos hosting new Pop. III stars occurs within 100 Myr of the first Pop. III star as the Lyman-Werner (LW) background rapidly increases to 10^-21 erg s<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> Hz^-1 sr^-1. We find that the global Pop. III star formation rate stabilizes to a value of 10^-3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1 at z=20. Among the three processes that quench Pop. III star formation in mini-halos, the LW background, gas starvation, and external chemical enrichment, the LW background is most important. A small fraction of haloes undergo multiple episodes of Pop. III star formation when the earlier forming stars all directly collapse to black holes. If the halos become massive enough, they can form up to ~100 Pop. III stars in a single burst, which may be observable by JWST with moderate gravitational lensing. Pop. III stars form at a wide range of distances from UV-bright galaxies, with only 0.06&percnt; of Pop. III stars forming within the virial radius of galaxies with M_UV &lt; -17. Finally, by tracking Pop. III star remnants down to z=0, we find that 75-80 % reside in the stellar halo of our simulated Milky Way analogue, while the remainder are gravitationally bound to lower-mass systems, including satellite halos.

<p>
H2 is the most abundant molecule in the interstellar medium and is a useful tool to study photodissociation regions, where radiative feedback from massive stars on molecular clouds is dominant. The James Webb Space Telescope, with its high spatial resolution, sensitivity, and wavelength coverage provides unique access to the detection of most of H2 lines and the analysis of its spatial morphology. Our goal is to use H2 line emission detected with the JWST in the Horsehead nebula to constrain the physical parameters (e.g., extinction, gas temperature, thermal pressure) throughout the PDR and its geometry. The study of H2 morphology reveals that FUV-pumped lines peak closer to the edge of the PDR than thermalized lines. From H2 lines, we estimate the value of extinction throughout the PDR. We find that AV is increasing from the edge of the PDR to the second and third H2 filaments. Then, we study the H2 excitation in different regions across the PDR. The temperature profile shows that the observed gas temperature is quite constant throughout the PDR, with a slight decline in each of the dissociation fronts. This study also reveals that the OPR is far from equilibrium. We observe a spatial separation of para and ortho rovibrational levels, indicating that efficient ortho-para conversion and preferential ortho self-shielding are driving the spatial variations of the OPR. Finally, we derive a thermal pressure in the first filament around P &gt; 6x10^6 K cm^-3, about ten times higher than that of the ionized gas. We highlight that template stationary 1D PDR models cannot account for the intrinsic 2D structure and the very high temperature observed in the Horsehead nebula. We argue the highly excited, over-pressurized H2 gas at the edge of the PDR interface could originate from the mixing between the cold and hot phase induced by the photo-evaporation of the cloud.

### 36) [2510.06771](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06771v1): Low-noise Fourier Transform Spectroscopy Enabled by Superconducting On-Chip Filterbank Spectrometers

<p> Chris S. Benson, Peter S. Barry, Patrick Ashworth, Harry Gordon-Moys, Kirit S. Karkare, Izaak Morris, Gethin Robson </p>
<p>
Historically employed spectroscopic architectures used for large field of view mapping spectroscopy in millimetere and sub-millimetre astronomy suffer from significant drawbacks. On-chip filterbank spectrometers are a promising technology in this respect; however, they must overcome an orders-of-magnitude increase in detector counts, efficiency loss due to dielectric properties, and stringent fabrication tolerances that currently limit scaling to resolutions of order 1000 over a large array. We propose coupling a medium-resolution Fourier transform spectrometer to a low-resolution filterbank spectrometer focal plane, which serves as a post-dispersion element. In this arrangement, medium resolution imaging spectroscopy is provided by the Fourier transform spectrometer, while the low resolution filterbank spectrometer serves to decrease the photon noise inherent in typical broadband Fourier transform spectrometer measurements by over an order of magnitude. This is achieved while maintaining the excellent imaging advantages of both architectures. We present predicted mapping speeds for a filterbank-dispersed Fourier transform spectrometer from a ground-based site and a balloon-borne platform. We also demonstrate the potential that an instrument of this type has for an R~1000 line intensity mapping experiment using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as an example platform. We demonstrate that a filterbank-dispersed Fourier transform spectrometer would be capable of R~1000 measurements of CO power spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10&ndash;100 with surveys of 10^5&ndash;10^6 spectrometer hours.

### 37) [2510.06681](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06681v1): The Star-forming Main Sequence and Bursty Star-formation Histories at z&gt;1.4 in JADES and AURORA

We analyze JWST spectroscopic and HST+JWST photometric observations of 659 star-forming galaxies at 1.4 &lt; z &lt; 9 from DR3 of the JADES survey and the AURORA Cycle 1 program. We measure the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) for galaxies above 10^8.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> where the sample is largely representative, estimating star-formation rates (SFRs) using the H&alpha; line flux and rest-frame far UV (1600&#8491;) continuum measurements, each independently corrected for dust attenuation. We find that the intrinsic, measurement-error-subtracted scatter in the SFMS (&sigma;_int) increases with decreasing stellar mass for the H&alpha;-based SFMS, and we find no mass dependence of &sigma;_int in the UV-based SFMS. Additionally, we find that &sigma;_int decreases with increasing redshift, from 0.36^+0.02_-0.02 dex to 0.22^+0.08_-0.07 dex (H&alpha; SFMS), and from 0.28^+0.02_-0.02 dex to 0.20^+0.08_-0.07 dex (UV SFMS) between z~2 and z~ 6.5. We also measure the redshift evolution of the specific SFR and find that, assuming sSFR&prop; (1+z)^&gamma;, &gamma;=1.89^+0.16_-0.15 for the H&alpha;-based SFMS, and &gamma;=1.36^+0.13_-0.13 for the UV-based SFMS. Analyzing the observed H&alpha;/UV luminosity ratios and star-formation histories from the \sc prospector fitting code, we find that 41&ndash;60&percnt; of the sample is inconsistent with having a constant star-formation history. Finally, we find tentative evidence for shorter SFR burst timescales with increasing redshift based on the distribution of L_H&alpha;/&nu; L_&nu;,1600 vs. &Delta;log(L_H&alpha;). Taken together, these results are consistent with theoretical predictions of bursty star formation in the early Universe and provide valuable constraints for theoretical models of galaxy evolution.

### 38) [2510.06362](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06362v1): Evidence of violation of Case B recombination in Little Red Dots

<p> G. P. Nikopoulos, D. Watson, A. Sneppen, V. Rusakov, K. E. Heintz, J. Witstok, G. Brammer </p>
<p>
Little Red Dots (LRDs) are a new class of compact extragalactic objects, with a v-shaped optical spectral energy distribution breaking close to the Balmer break wavelength, and broad, typically exponentially-shaped lines. They are believed to be supermassive black holes surrounded by very dense, ionized gas, leading us to explore for any departures from Case B recombination by examining the ratios of multiple hydrogen Balmer lines: H&alpha;, H&beta;, H&gamma;, and H&delta;. We analyze a dozen high-S/N LRDs with JWST/NIRSpec, measuring Balmer ratios in the seven objects with coverage of at least three lines. We decompose the line ratios into their respective broad and narrow components. Broad line ratios are consistent with Case B plus dust extinction in all objects but one, RUBIES EGS-49140, which departs from Case B expectations by more than 5&sigma;. The narrow components are consistent with minimal dust attenuation, while two objects exhibit narrow H&alpha;/H&beta; ≈ 1.8. Such low decrements are observed in highly ionized density bounded nebulae, associated with starburst environments. Nevertheless, both flat decrement cases can be reconciled assuming an unresolved absorption feature. RUBIES EGS-49140, shows a high broad H&alpha;/H&beta;, but H&gamma;/H&alpha; and H&delta;/H&alpha; ratios are lower than expected for extinction-modified Case B, hinting at an unphysically steep dust law. These line ratios may be due to increased optical depth in the Balmer lines, as a direct effect of high density (logn_e &gt; 9) gas surrounding the black hole. If Case B recombination does hold in most LRDs, they must be moderate-to-heavily dust obscured (A_V≃1-8) while the host-galaxy should be dust-free, suggesting that the extinction in the broad lines is local to the LRD and not due to the general ISM of the host galaxy.

Now detected out to redshifts of z~ 14.5, the rest-frame ultraviolet and optical spectra of galaxies encode numerous physical properties of the interstellar medium (ISM). Accurately extracting these properties from spectra remains a key challenge that numerical simulations are uniquely suited to address. We present a study of the observed ISM of galaxies in MEGATRON: a suite of cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations coupled to on-the-fly non-equilibrium thermochemistry, with multiple prescriptions for star formation/feedback and parsec-scale resolution; capable of directly predicting spectroscopic properties of early galaxies. We find that irrespective of feedback physics used, the ISM of high-redshift galaxies is denser, less metal enriched, and subject to higher ionization parameters and radiation fields compared to similar mass galaxies in the local Universe &ndash; in agreement with interpretations of JWST observations. Using common observational techniques to infer bulk galaxy properties, we find that ISM gas density controls the slope of the mass-metallicity relation. Similarly, at the densities reached in some high-redshift galaxies, O32 becomes a density tracer rather than one of ionization parameter. This motivates the use of other line ratios like C43 and N43 to infer the ionization state of the gas. Finally, various feedback models populate different regions of strong-line diagnostic diagrams as the line ratios are sensitive to the feedback-modulated density-temperature structure of the ISM. Therefore, observed strong-line diagnostics can provide a strong constraint on the underlying physics of star formation and feedback in the high-redshift Universe.

### 40) [2510.06325](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06325v1): Preferential Accretion onto the Secondary Black Hole Strengthens Gravitational Wave Signals

<p> Julia M. Comerford, Joseph Simon </p>
<p>
Pulsar timing arrays have recently found evidence for nanohertz gravitational waves that are consistent with being produced by a cosmological population of binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, the amplitude of this gravitational wave background is larger than predicted from theoretical and empirical models of SMBH binary populations. We investigate preferential accretion onto the secondary, less massive SMBH of the binary as a potential solution to this discrepancy. We carry out the first observationally-based analysis of the effect of preferential accretion on the SMBH binary population, and we find that preferential accretion onto the secondary SMBH increases the binary SMBH mass ratio, causing many minor galaxy mergers to lead to major SMBH mergers. The fraction of SMBH mergers that are major mergers increases by a factor of 2-3 when preferential accretion is included. Further, we find that only a small amount of preferential accretion (10% total SMBH mass growth) is needed to bring the predicted gravitational wave background amplitude into agreement with observations. Preferential accretion has an even larger effect on gravitational wave signals detected by LISA, which will probe SMBH binaries at higher redshifts where the environment is more gas-rich, and can also help explain the rapid build up of overmassive black holes at high redshifts observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. It also shortens the time to the first detection of an individual SMBH binary emitting continuous waves. Preferential accretion strengthens the gravitational wave signals produced by any binary embedded in a circumbinary disk, including LIGO sources.

Infrared emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) play a major role in determining the charge balance of their host environments that include photo-dissociation regions (PDRs) in galaxies, planetary nebulae, and rims of molecular clouds. We aim to investigate the distribution and sizes of charged PAHs across the key zones of the Orion Bar PDR. We employ JWST MIRI-MRS observations of the Orion Bar from the Early Release Science program ''PDRs4All'' and synthetic images in the JWST MIRI filters. We investigate the spatial morphology of the AIBs at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.0 &mu;m that commonly trace PAH cations, and the neutral PAH-tracing 11.2 &mu;m AIB, their (relative) correlations, and the relationship with existing empirical prescriptions for AIBs. The 6.2. 7.7, 8.6, 11.0, and 11.2 &mu;m AIBs are similar in spatial morphology, on larger scales. Analyzing three-feature intensity correlations, two distinct groups emerge: the 8.6 and 11.0 &mu;m vs. the 6.2 and 7.7 &mu;m AIBs. We attribute these correlations to PAH size. The 6.2 and 7.7 &mu;m AIBs trace cationic, medium-sized PAHs. Quantum chemical calculations reveal that the 8.6 &mu;m AIB is carried by large, compact, cationic PAHs, and the 11.0 &mu;m AIB's correlation to it implies, so is this band. The 6.2/8.6 and 7.7/8.6 PAH band ratios thus probe PAH size. We conclude that the 6.2/11.2 AIB ratio is the most reliable proxy for charged PAHs, within the cohort. We outline JWST MIRI imaging prescriptions that serve as effective tracers of the PAH ionization fraction as traced. This study showcases the efficacy of the 6-9 &mu;m AIBs to probe the charge state and size distribution of the emitting PAHs, offering insights into the physical conditions of their host environments. JWST MIRI photometry offers a viable alternative to IFU spectroscopy for characterizing this emission in extended objects.

### 42) [2510.05388](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05388v1): The Prevalence of Bursty Star Formation in Low-Mass Galaxies at z=1-7 from Hα-to-UV Diagnostics

<p>
We present an analysis of bursty star-formation histories (SFHs) of 346 star-forming galaxies at 1≲ z&lt;7, selected from JWST/NIRSpec G395M and PRISM spectroscopy provided by the CEERS and RUBIES surveys. We analyze the correlation of star-formation rate vs. stellar mass (the star-forming main sequence, SFMS) for our sample and find no significant difference between the intrinsic scatter in the H&alpha;-based SFMS and the UV-continuum-based SFMS. However, the diagnostic power of the SFMS is limited at high redshift and low stellar mass due to observational biases that exclude faint, quenched galaxies. To more directly probe star-formation variability, we examine the dust-corrected H&alpha;-to-UV ratio, which is assumed to trace deviations a from constant SFH over the past ~100 Myr. In our sample, 73^+4_-4% of galaxies exhibit H&alpha;-to-UV ratios inconsistent with a constant SFH. We do not observe any statistically significant evolution in the H&alpha;-to-UV ratio with redshift. Additionally, lower-mass galaxies (7≤log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;8.5) are 30 ± 1% more likely to lie above this equilibrium range &ndash; indicative of a recent (≲ 100 Myr) burst of star formation &ndash; compared to higher-mass systems (8.5≤log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≤10.9). These results suggest that bursty SFHs are more common in low-mass galaxies at z~ 1-7 and that this remains relatively stable across ~0.8-6 Gyr after the Big Bang.

### 43) [2510.05299](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05299v1): Galaxy sizes and compactness at Cosmic Dawn

<p> P. Cataldi, S. Pedrosa, L. J. Pellizza, D. Ceverino, L. A. Bignone </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope has found an unexpected population of high-mass galaxies (log (M^&sext; / M <sub>&odot;</sub>) ≳ 10) with extremely small effective radii (~ 100 pc) at z ≳ 6. Also, the existence of an unusual size&ndash;mass relation has been claimed. These observations are only partially reproduced by current models, and the physics responsible for the observed relations is still under debate. We expect to unveil the formation channels of the observed compact galaxies. We analyse 7605 snapshots for 169 galaxies of the state-of-the-art cosmological simulation suite FirstLight. We find that galaxies undergo an expansion&ndash;compaction&ndash;re-expansion process. This process operates in a specific mass range; compaction starts at log (M^&sext;_ on / M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ~ 8.5 and ends at log (M^&sext;_off / M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ~ 9.5. In between these masses, the size&ndash;mass relation becomes inverted, with a negative slope. The physical mechanism driving this process in our simulations involves a self-reinforced inflow of gas from the outer regions, that triggers a strong, localised starburst at the centre (within 1  kpc). This contraction continues until conditions favour star formation in a broader area, and the normal inside-out growth pattern resumes. We present evidence for the existence of a universal wet compaction operating at Cosmic Dawn. This mechanism is driven by spherical accretion triggered by the change of the state of the central matter of galaxies, from dark matter- to baryon-dominated. We also propose an analytical expression for the infall process, suitable for use in semi-analytic models. Contrary to low-redshift galaxies, in high-redshift systems compaction ends without gas depletion and star-formation quenching.

<p>
We present the MEGATRON suite of cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations following the formation of Milky Way-mass galaxies from the earliest cosmic epochs when Population III stars form to Cosmic Noon. The suite represents the first set of cosmological simulations that couples a vast non-equilibrium thermochemistry network of primordial species, metals, and molecules to multifrequency, on-the-fly radiation transport, allowing us to directly predict the spectral properties of early galaxies. By initializing the simulations at zero metallicity, resolving haloes well below the atomic cooling threshold, reaching parsec-scale resolution, and modeling a Milky Way-mass environment, we aim to address four key science themes: 1) Star formation at cosmic dawn, 2) Galaxy formation and the interstellar medium in the epoch of reionization, 3) The circumgalactic medium towards cosmic noon, and 4) Reionization in a local volume environment and near-field cosmology. In this introductory work, we present an overview of the physical characteristics of high-redshift MEGATRON galaxies and their environment at z&gt;8. We present a library of &gt;175,000 simulated galaxy spectra and demonstrate how the diversity of galaxy spectra seen by JWST is naturally reproduced in the context of a &Lambda;CDM cosmology. This project represents a step towards making more direct comparisons between simulations and observations and will enable future work to both optimize methods for inferring galaxy properties from observations and to elucidate the physics that governs galaxy formation in the early Universe.

<p>
We use the ultra-deep GLIMPSE JWST/NIRCam survey to constrain the faint-end of the H&beta;+[OIII]&lambda;&lambda;4960,5008 luminosity function (LF) down to 10^39 erg/s at z=7-9 behind the lensed Hubble Frontier Field Abell S1063. We perform SED fitting on a Lyman-Break Galaxy sample, measuring combined H&beta;+[OIII] fluxes to construct the emission-line LF. The resulting LF (&alpha;=-1.55 to -1.78) is flatter than the UV LF (&alpha;&lt;-2), indicating a lower number density of low H&beta;+[OIII] emitters at fixed MUV. We explore three explanations: (i) bursty star formation histories reducing the H&beta;+[OIII]-to-UV ratio, (ii) metallicity effects on [OIII]/H&beta;, or (iii) a faint-end turnover in the UV LF. Assuming an evolving [OIII]/H&beta; ratio, we derive a flatter [OIII]&lambda;5008 LF (&alpha;=-1.45 to -1.66) and a steeper H&beta; LF (&alpha;=-1.68 to -1.95). The combination of decreasing metallicity and bursty star formation can reconcile the UV and H&beta;+[OIII] LF differences. Converting the LF to the ionising photon production rate, we find that galaxies with H&alpha; flux &gt;10^39 erg/s (SFR(H&alpha;)&gt;5×10^-3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr) contribute 21-61% and 24-104% of the ionising photon budget at 7&lt;z&lt;8 and 8&lt;z&lt;9, respectively (for f<sub>esc</sub>=0.1). The LF shape suggests faint galaxies contribute minimally to the ionising photon production rate. Our cosmic star formation rate density (CSFRD) estimates align with previous work, but GLIMPSE's sensitivity to low SFRs confirms that very faint galaxies are minor contributors to both the ionising photon production rate and the CSFRD. Our results suggest that GLIMPSE has detected the bulk of the total H&beta;+[OIII] emission from star-forming galaxies, with fainter sources playing a limited role in cosmic reionisation.

### 46) [2510.04709](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04709v2): Matching JWST UV Luminosity Functions with Refined ΛCDM Halo Models

<p> Saeed Fakhry, Maryam Shiravand, Antonino Del Popolo </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled a population of unexpectedly massive and luminous galaxies at redshifts z ≳ 7, posing a significant challenge to the standard &Lambda;CDM cosmological paradigm. In this work, we address the tension between early JWST observations of luminous high-redshift galaxies and predictions of the standard &Lambda;CDM model by revisiting the physics of dark matter halo formation. Employing refined halo mass functions derived by Del Popolo itet al. (DP1 and DP2) that incorporate angular momentum, dynamical friction, and redshift-dependent collapse barriers, we demonstrate a significant enhancement in the abundance of massive halos at z ≳ 7 compared to the conventional Sheth-Tormen (ST) formalism. Using a semi-empirical framework linking halo mass to UV luminosity, we show that the DP2 model reproduces the observed UV luminosity functions from z = 7 to 14 with moderate star formation efficiencies, whereas the ST model requires implausibly high efficiencies. Our results suggest that the JWST overabundance problem stems not from new physics beyond &Lambda;CDM, but from oversimplified treatments of gravitational collapse, highlighting the critical role of small-scale dissipative dynamics in early structure formation.

<p>
Context. Edge-on disks offer a unique opportunity to directly examine their vertical structure, providing valuable insights into planet formation processes. We investigate the dust properties, as well as the CO and HCO^+ gas properties, in the edge-on disk surrounding the T Tauri star 2MASS J04202144+281349 (SSTTau042021). Aims. We estimate the radial and vertical temperature and density profile for the gas and the dust. Methods. We use ALMA archival data of CO isotopologues and continuum emission at 2, 1.3 and 0.9 mm together with new NOEMA HCO^+ 3-2 observations. We retrieve the gas and dust disk properties using the tomographic method and the scDiskFit model. Results. The vertical CO emission appears very extended, partly tracing the H<sub>2</sub> wind observed by JWST. C^18O, ^13CO and HCO^+ emission characterize the bulk of the molecular layer. The dust and gas have a mid-plane temperatures of ~ 7-11 K. The temperature of the molecular layer (derived from ^13CO and HCO^+) is on the order of 16 K. HCO^+ 3-2 being thermalized, we derive a lower limit for the H<sub>2</sub> volume density of ~ 3 × 10^6 cm^-3 at radius 100-200 au between 1 and 2 scale heights. The atmosphere temperature of the CO gas is of the order ~ 31 K at a radius of 100 au. We directly observe CO and HCO^+ gas onto the mid-plane beyond the dust outer radius (≥ 300 au). The (gas+dust) disk mass estimated up to a radius of 300 au is on the order of 4.6 × 10^-2 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Conclusions. Thanks to the favorable disk inclination, we present the first quantitative evidence for vertical molecular stratification with direct observation of CO and HCO^+ gas along the mid-plane. We estimate the temperature profile with temperature of 7-11 K near the mid-plane, and 15-20 K in the dense part of the molecular layer up to ~ 35 K above.

<p> Marta Volonteri </p>
<p>
These notes review theoretical models of massive black hole formation, growth and observables. They start with a brief summary of basic properties of massive black hole properties. The current view on massive black holes and active galactic nuclei at high redshift is then summarized, highlighting the JWST "revolution'' and the questions raised by the recent observations. The notes then touch on massive black hole formation and growth mechanisms, emphasizing the processes at play at early cosmic times. Then techniques for modeling the cosmic massive black hole evolution, are reviewed with an emphasis on cosmological simulations, before approaching how observables are derived from models. They conclude with a section reflecting on the main questions on the JWST-discovered population in light of the material presented in the earlier sections.

### 49) [2510.04416](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04416v2): Analysis of Galaxies at the Extremes: Failed Galaxy Progenitors in the MAGNETICUM Simulations

<p> Jonah S. Gannon, Lucas C. Kimmig, Duncan A. Forbes, Jean P. Brodie, Lucas M. Valenzuela, Rhea-Silvia Remus, Joel L. Pfeffer, Klaus Dolag </p>
<p>
There is increasing observational evidence for a failed galaxy formation pathway for some ultradiffuse galaxies (UDGs) at low redshift however they currently lack simulated counterparts. We attempt to identify dark matter halos at high redshift within the MAGNETICUM cosmological simulations that could plausibly be their progenitors. We build a toy model of passive galaxy evolution within the stellar mass-halo mass relation to trace z = 0 observations of UDGs back to their z = 2 locations. We identify a population of 443 galaxies that match these parameter space positions within the simulation. We build two comparison samples within the simulation that follow the stellar mass-halo mass relationship at z = 2, one of which is stellar mass matched (with varying smaller halo masses) and the other is halo mass matched (with varying larger stellar masses) to our sample. We identify that our failed galaxy progenitor candidates have 1) flatter, cored dark matter halos; 2) more extended stellar bodies; 3) a larger fraction of their gas in the outskirts of their halos; 4) lower metallicities and 5) higher star formation rates than the control samples. Findings 1) and 2) are similar to low redshift observations of UDGs. Finding 3) will aid the removal of gas and permanent quenching of star formation which is a requirement of the failed galaxy formation scenario. The low metallicities of finding 4) match those observed in low redshift failed galaxy UDGs. Comparing the high star formation rates of finding 5) to recent JWST observations suggests that a starburst would naturally explain the high globular cluster richness of the UDGs. Many of the properties we find for these failed galaxy progenitors can be explained by an assembly bias of their dark matter halo to later formation times. We conclude by proposing that the fraction of failed galaxy UDGs is expected to increase with environmental density.

### 50) [2510.03688](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03688v1): Signatures of Galactic Expansion in Gaia DR3: Implications for the JWST Early-Galaxy Puzzle

<p> G. S. Karapetian, A. P. Mahtessian, L. E. Byzalov, M. A. Hovhannisyan, L. A. Mahtessian </p>
<p>
Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) of massive galaxies at ages below 1 Gyr pose a challenge to standard models of galaxy formation, which predict significantly longer assembly timescales. One possible explanation is that active galactic nuclei (AGN) drive large scale outflows that accelerate galaxy growth. To test this scenario in the local Universe, we analyzed Gaia DR3 data for stars within 5 kpc of the Galactic center, computing galactocentric radial velocities (v_radial_gc) in 27 spatial sectors covering the entire Galaxy, with radial binning of 0.25 kpc. Coordinate transformations and velocity calculations were performed using the Astropy library. We find that 21 of 27 sectors exhibit statistically significant outward motions of 3-50 km/s, while one quadrant shows negative velocities, likely related to the configuration of an activity zone and/or the Galactic bar. Both disk and halo populations also display small but significant mean expansion of 3-9 km/s (p&lt;0.01). These results are consistent with our previous studies, where globular clusters showed outward velocities of 17-31 km/s up to 12 kpc, and axisymmetric analyses of Gaia DR3 stars indicated expansion of ~19 km/s to 5 kpc. Taken together, the evidence suggests that the Milky Way exhibits measurable central expansion, potentially reflecting AGN-driven feedback. This interpretation departs from standard theory and should be regarded as preliminary, requiring further study. However, if confirmed, such expansion could provide a natural explanation for the rapid appearance of massive galaxies observed by JWST.

<p> I. Millán-Irigoyen, M. Mollá, M. Cerviño, M. L. García-Vargas </p>
<p>
Low metallicity stellar populations are very abundant in the Universe, either as the remnants of the past history of the Milky Way or similar spiral galaxies, or the young low metallicity stellar populations that are being observed in the local dwarf galaxies or in the high-z objects with low metal content recently found with JWST. Our goal is to develop new high-spectral-resolution models tailored for low-metallicity environments and apply them to analyse stellar population data, particularly in cases where a significant portion of the stellar content exhibits low metallicity. Methods. We used the state-of-the-art stellar population synthesis code HR-pyPopStar with available stellar libraries to create a new set of models focused on low metallicity stellar populations. We have compared the new spectral energy distributions with the previous models of HR-pyPopStar for solar metallicity. Once we verified that the spectra, except for the oldest ages that show some differences in the molecular bands of the TiO and G band, are similar, we reanalysed the high resolution data from the globular cluster M 15 by finding a better estimate of its age and metallicity. Finally, we analysed a subsample of mostly star-forming dwarf galaxies from the MaNGA survey we found similar stellar mass-mean stellar metallicity weighted by light to other studies that studied star forming dwarf galaxies and slightly higher mean stellar metallicity than the other works that analysed all types of dwarf galaxies at the same time, but are within error bars.

We report the detection of HCN (J=3-2) rotational emission from comet 3I/ATLAS at a heliocentric distance of 2.13 AU with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). Observations were conducted from 07 August 2025 (UT) using the ^&prime; U^&prime; u heterodyne receiver and ACSIS spectroscopic backend. The HCN line was detected at &gt;5&sigma; on 14 Sep 2025 (UT) and a production rate of Q(HCN)=(4.0±1.7)×10^25 s<sup>-1</sup> was derived by non-LTE radiative transfer modelling. Preliminary estimates of the HCN/H<sub>2</sub>O and CN/HCN abundance ratios suggest values similar to Solar System comets.

### 53) [2510.02801](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02801v1): A z≃0.4 Little Red Dot analog: An Extended Starburst with an Overmassive Black hole

<p>
One of the most remarkable discoveries of JWST is a population of compact, red sources at z &gt; 4, commonly referred to as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Spectroscopic identifications reported that most LRDs are active galactic nuclei (AGNs), which are preferentially found around z~6 and could imply a key phase in the formation and growth of black holes (BHs) in the early universe. Photometric surveys at lower redshift have recently been carried out to trace their evolution across cosmic time, and a small number of LRDs have been spectroscopically identified at both Cosmic Noon and in the local universe. Here we report the discovery of one of the lowest-z analogs of LRDs, J204837.26-002437.2 (hereafter J2048) at z = 0.4332, using new Gemini-N/GMOS IFU observations combined with archival multi-band photometric SED data. The GMOS data reveal extended blue emission from starburst with a star formation rate of 400 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr-1, together with an extended, highly fast ionized outflow. This is the first spectroscopic confirmation of extended host emission and outflow in an LRD-like galaxy, providing a unique laboratory for understanding the nature of their high-redshift counterparts. Moreover, J2048 would host an extremely overmassive BH with a BH-to-stellar mass ratio of 0.6, with the BH mass and host stellar mass estimated to be 10^10.2 and 10^10.4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, respectively. We discuss the origin and evolutionary fate of J2048, and the implications that such low-z analogs have for interpreting the properties of high-z LRDs.

<p> Djuna Croon, Tim Linden, Jeremy Sakstein </p>
<p>
Upcoming near-infrared facilities (e.g., JWST/NIRCam, ELT/MICADO) will dramatically increase the detectability of galactic center Cepheids despite extreme extinction at optical wavelengths. In this work, we study the impact of dark matter (DM) annihilation on Cepheid stars in the inner parsec of the Milky Way. We show that at densities &rho; ~ 10^5   GeV   cm^-3, blue-loop evolution can be suppressed, preventing the formation of low-mass (3-6   M<sub>&odot;</sub>) short-period (1-6 days) Cepheids. A dearth of such variables could provide indirect evidence for DM heating. Notably, this effect occurs at lower DM densities than required to impact main-sequence stars. Future surveys will thus offer a novel, complementary probe of DM properties in galactic nuclei.

<p>
We present mid-infrared spectroscopic observations of intermediate- to high-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) in the low-metallicity star-forming region NGC 346 located within the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We conduct these integral-field-unit observations with the Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium Resolution Spectroscopy instrument on board JWST. The brightest and most active star-forming region in the SMC, NGC 346 has a metallicity of ~1/5 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>, analogous to the era when star formation in the early Universe (z≃2) peaked. We discuss the emission and absorption features present in the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of five YSOs with coverage from 4.9-27.9&mu;m and three other sources with partial spectral coverage. Via SED model-fitting, we estimate their parameters, finding masses ranging from 2.9-18.0 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. These targets show dusty silicates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and ices of CO<sub>2</sub>, CO, H<sub>2</sub>O and CH_3OH in their protostellar envelopes. We measure emission from H<sub>2</sub> and atomic fine-structure lines, suggesting the presence of protostellar jets and outflows. We detect H I lines indicating ongoing accretion and estimate accretion rates for each source which range from 2.50x10^-6-2.23x10^-4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>yr^-1 based on H I (7-6) line emission. We present evidence for a ~30,000AU protostellar jet traced by fine-structure, H I and H<sub>2</sub> emission about the YSO Y535, the first detection of a resolved protostellar outflow in the SMC, and the most distant yet detected.

<p>
Active galactic nuclei (AGN), star formation (SF), and galaxy interactions can drive turbulence in the gas of the ISM, which in turn plays a role in the SF within galaxies. The impact on molecular gas is of particular importance, as it serves as the primary fuel for SF. Our goal is to investigate the origin of turbulence and the emission of molecular gas, as well as low- and intermediate-ionization gas, in the inner few kpc of both AGN hosts and SF galaxies. We use JWST MIRI/MRS observations of a sample consisting of 54 galaxies at z&lt;0.1. We present fluxes of the H2 S(5)6.9091, [Ar II]6.9853, [FeII]5.3403, and [Ar III]8.9914 lines, along with velocity dispersion from W80. For galaxies with coronal emission, [Mg V]5.6098 is also included. Line ratios are compared to photoionization and shock models to explore the origin of the gas emission. AGNs exhibit broader emission lines than SFGs, with the largest velocity dispersions observed in radio-strong (RS) AGNs. H2 gas is less turbulent compared to ionized gas, while coronal gas presents higher velocity dispersions. The W80 values for the ionized gas exhibits a decrease from the nucleus out to radii of approximately 0.5&ndash;1 kpc, followed by an outward increase up to 2-3 kpc. In contrast, the H2 line widths generally display increasing profiles with distance from the center. Correlations W80 and line ratios such as H2 S(5)/[ArII] and [FeII]/[ArII] indicate that the most turbulent gas is associated with shocks, enhancing H2 and [FeII] emissions. We speculate that these shocked gas regions are produced by AGN outflows and jet-cloud interactions in AGN-dominated sources, while in SFGs, they may be created by stellar winds and mergers. This shock-induced gas heating may be an important mechanism of AGN (or stellar) feedback, preventing the gas from cooling and forming new stars.

### 57) [2510.02439](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02439v1): Mapping the Stellar Kinematics in the Central 240 Parsecs of M87 with the James Webb Space Telescope

<p> Refa M. Al-Amri, Jonelle L. Walsh, Emily R. Liepold, Chung-Pei Ma, Jenny E. Greene </p>
<p>
The supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the giant elliptical galaxy M87 is one of the most well-studied in the local universe, but the stellar- and gas-dynamical SMBH mass measurements disagree. As this galaxy is a key anchor for the upper end of the SMBH mass-host galaxy relations, we revisit the central 3''× 3'' (~ 240×240 pc) region of M87 with the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) integral field unit (IFU) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We implement several improvements to the reduction pipeline and obtain high signal-to-noise spectra (S/N ~ 150) in single 0.''05 spaxels across much of the NIRSpec field of view. We measure the detailed shape of the stellar line-of-sight velocity distribution, parameterized by Gauss-Hermite moments up to h_8, in ~ 2800 spatial bins, substantially improving upon the prior high angular resolution studies of the M87 stellar kinematics. The NIRSpec data reveal velocities with V ~ ± 45 km s<sup>-1</sup>, velocity dispersions that rise sharply to ~420 km s<sup>-1</sup> at a projected radius of 0.''45 (36 pc), and a slight elevation in h_4 toward the nucleus. We comprehensively test the robustness of the kinematics, including using multiple velocity template libraries and adopting different polynomials to adjust the template spectra. We find that the NIRSpec stellar kinematics seamlessly transition to recently measured large-scale stellar kinematics from optical Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) IFU data. These combined NIRSpec and KCWI kinematics provide continuous coverage from parsec to kiloparsec scales and will critically constrain future stellar-dynamical models of M87.

### 58) [2510.01747](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01747v1): Discovery of an Accretion Burst in a Free-Floating Planetary-Mass Object

<p>
We report the discovery of a long-lasting burst of disk accretion in Cha J11070768-7626326 (Cha 1107-7626), a young, isolated, 5-10 M_Jupiter object. In spectra taken with XSHOOTER at ESO's Very Large Telescope as well as NIRSPEC and MIRI on the James Webb Space Telescope, the object transitions from quiescence in April-May 2025 to a strongly enhanced accretion phase in June-August 2025. The line flux changes correspond to a 6-8-fold increase in the mass accretion rate, reaching 10^-7 M_Jupiteryr^-1, the highest measured in a planetary-mass object. During the burst, the H&alpha; line develops a double-peaked profile with red-shifted absorption, as observed in stars and brown dwarfs undergoing magnetospheric accretion. The optical continuum increases by a factor of 3-6; the object is ~1.5-2 mag brighter in the R-band during the burst. Mid-infrared continuum fluxes rise by 10-20%, with clear changes in the hydrocarbon emission lines from the disk. We detect water vapour emission at 6.5-7 &mu; m, which were absent in quiescence. By the end of our observing campaign, the burst was still ongoing, implying a duration of at least two months. A 2016 spectrum also shows high accretion levels, suggesting that this object may undergo recurring bursts. The observed event is inconsistent with typical variability in accreting young stars and instead matches the duration, amplitude and line spectrum of an EXor-type burst, making Cha1107-7626 the first substellar object with evidence of a potentially recurring EXor burst.

<p>
Eddington ratio is a paramount parameter governing the accretion history and life cycles of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). This short review presents a multi-faceted view of the importance of the Eddington ratio spanning varied AGN studies. We find that the Eddington ratio is crucial for standardizing the Radius-Luminosity (R-L) relation - a necessary step for employing quasars (QSOs) as standardizable cosmological probes to help clarify the standing of the Hubble tension. In this data-driven era, we consolidated disparate aspects by developing novel relations borne out of large datasets, such as the robust, nearly universal anti-correlation between fractional variability and Eddington ratio derived from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data, which is vital for interpreting forthcoming high-cadence surveys like Rubin Observatory's LSST. Addressing the conundrum where JWST results suggest an overabundance of massive high-redshift black holes, we demonstrate that local AGNs offer clarification: Changing-Look AGNs (CLAGNs), driven by rapid Eddington ratio shifts, cluster in the low-accretion regime, a rate independently confirmed by our integral field spectroscopy and photoionization modeling of a well-known Seyfert 2 galaxy, rich in high-ionization, forbidden, coronal lines. Conversely, for the high-redshift, high-luminosity population where traditional reverberation mapping (RM) is highly impractical, photometric reverberation mapping (PRM) offers a rapid alternative to constrain accretion disk sizes, enabling efficient estimates of black hole masses and Eddington ratios. Finally, we developed tailored semi-empirical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for extremely high-accretion quasars, successfully validating their characteristic extreme physical conditions.

Galaxies with a disk morphology have been established at z &gt; 9 with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). However, confirming their disky nature requires studying their gas kinematics, which can be challenging when relying solely on the warm gas observed by JWST. Unlike the cold gas traced by the Atacama Large Millimetre/Submillimetre Array (ALMA), warm gas is sensitive to outflows, complicating the interpretation of the disk dynamics. This elicits the question of how to compare information obtained from varied tracers, as well as how to physically interpret the low angular and spectral resolution observations generally available at high redshift. We address these challenges through comparative kinematic analysis of idealised and realistic NIRSpec/IFU mock observations derived from two galaxies in the SERRA suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations. With these synthetic data, we determine the robustness of dynamical information recovered from typical IFU observations, and test widely-used criteria for identifying disks and gaseous outflows at high redshift. We find that at the typical NIRSpec/IFU spectral and angular resolution (~ 0.05"/pixel), non-circular motions due to inflows or outflows can mimic the smooth velocity gradient indicative of a disk, and bias measured velocity dispersion upwards by a factor of 2-3×. As a result, the level of rotational support may be underestimated in the NIRSpec/IFU observations. However, the recovered dynamical mass appears to be relatively robust despite biases in v_rot and &sigma;.

### 61) [2510.01322](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01322v1): Heavy seeds and the first black holes: Insights from the BRAHMA simulations

From the luminous quasars at z ~ 6 to the recent z ~ 9-11 AGNs revealed by JWST, observations of the earliest black hole (BH) populations can provide unique constraints on BH formation and growth models. We use the BRAHMA simulations with constrained initial conditions to investigate BH assembly in extreme overdense regions. The simulations implement heavy seeds (~ 10^4-10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) forming in dense, metal-poor gas exposed to sufficient Lyman-Werner flux. With gas accretion modeled via Bondi-Hoyle formalism and BH dynamics and mergers using a subgrid dynamical friction scheme, we isolate the impact of seeding, dynamics, accretion, and feedback on early BH growth. With fiducial stellar and AGN feedback inherited from IllustrisTNG, accretion is strongly suppressed at z ≳ 9, leaving mergers as the dominant growth channel. Gas accretion dominates at z ≲ 9, where permissive models (super-Eddington or low radiative efficiency) build ~ 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> BHs powering quasars by z ~ 6, while stricter IllustrisTNG-based prescriptions yield much lower BH masses (~ 10^6-10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>). Our seed models strongly affect merger-driven growth at z ≳ 9: only the most lenient models (with ~ 10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> seeds) produce enough BH mergers to reach ≳ 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> by z ~ 10, consistent with current estimates for GN-z11. Our dynamical friction model gives low merger efficiencies, hindering the buildup of ≳ 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub> BHs by z ~ 9-10, as currently inferred for GHZ9, UHZ1, and CAPERS-LRD-z9. If the BH-to-stellar mass ratios of these sources are indeed as extreme as currently inferred, they would require either very short BH merger timescales or reduced AGN thermal feedback. Weaker stellar feedback boosts both star formation and BH accretion and cannot raise these ratios.

### 62) [2510.01314](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01314v1): JWST Observations of Starbursts: PAHs Closely Trace the Cool Phase of M82's Galactic Wind

<p>
Stellar feedback drives multiphase gas outflows from starburst galaxies, but the interpretation of dust emission in these winds remains uncertain. To investigate this, we analyze new JWST mid-infrared images tracing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission at 7.7 and 11.3~&mu;m from the outflow of the prototypical starburst M82 out to 3.2 kpc. We find that PAH emission shows significant correlations with CO, H&alpha;, and X-ray emission within the outflow, though the strengths and behaviors of these correlations vary with gas phase and distance from the starburst. PAH emission correlates strongly with cold molecular gas, with PAH&ndash;CO scaling relations in the wind nearly identical to those in galaxy disks despite the very different conditions. The H&alpha;&ndash;PAH correlation indicates that H&alpha; traces the surfaces of PAH-bearing clouds, consistent with arising from ionized layers produced by shocks. Meanwhile the PAH&ndash;X-ray correlation disappears once distance effects are controlled for past 2~kpc, suggesting that PAHs are decoupled from the hot gas and the global correlation merely reflects the large-scale structure of the outflow. The PAH-to-neutral gas ratio remains nearly flat to 2~kpc, with variations following changes in the radiation field. This implies that the product of PAH abundance and dust-to-gas ratio does not change significantly over the inner portion of the outflow. Together, these results demonstrate that PAHs robustly trace the cold phase of M82's wind, surviving well beyond the starburst and providing a powerful, high-resolution proxy for mapping the life cycle of entrained cold material in galactic outflows.

### 63) [2510.01315](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01315v1): Neutral hydrogen in and around galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization

<p>
JWST spectra revealing Lyman-&alpha; (Ly&alpha;) absorption in z~ 5-14 galaxies offer a unique probe of reionization's earliest stages. However, disentangling absorption by the increasingly neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) from that in galaxies' interstellar and circumgalactic medium (ISM, CGM) remains challenging due to the poorly constrained nature of neutral hydrogen (HI) in and around galaxies at these redshifts. We use the SERRA high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations to characterize the HI distribution and its evolution along sightlines to star-forming regions during reionization, to interpret the contribution of local HI (ISM+CGM) to Ly&alpha; absorption in z&gt;5 spectra. We analyze ~ 100 z=6-9.5 galaxies, generating mock sightlines from each galaxy's star formation peak. We study the sightline distribution of HI column densities (N_HI) and its variation with radius, halo mass and redshift. We find broad sightline variation in N_HI (0.5-1.5dex) due to complex ISM morphology driven by bursty star formation, with median log(N_HI/cm<sup>2</sup>) ≃ 21-22. Dense ISM gas is the dominant origin of damped Ly&alpha; absorption (DLA) systems along sightlines towards star-forming regions, outweighing gas in the CGM, filaments and proximate absorbers. Median N_HI increases with halo mass, scaling roughly with the virial radius, as expected due to larger potentials and more extended CGM, but shows negligible redshift evolution at fixed halo mass. This suggests post-reionization N_HI distributions may provide useful priors to interpret IGM damping wings at higher redshifts. To interpret strong z&gt;5 DLA candidates found by JWST, we investigate N_HI&gt;10^22 cm<sup>2</sup> sightlines. These trace dense, metal-enriched ISM within &lt;1 kpc of massive halos, a scenario testable with higher-resolution spectroscopy.

### 64) [2510.01079](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01079v1): Revisiting the formation of molecules and dust in core collapse supernovae

<p> Isabelle Cherchneff, Dahbia Talbi, José Cernicharo </p>
<p>
Context. Core-collapse Supernovae of Type II contribute the chemical enrichment of galaxies through explosion. Their role as dust producers in the high-redshift Universe may be of paramount importance. However, the type and amount of dust they synthesise after outburst is still a matter of debate and the formation processes remain unclear. Aims. We aim to identify and understand the chemical processes at play in the dust formation scenario, and derive mass yields for molecules and dust clusters at late post-explosion time. Methods. We revisit existing models by improving on the physics and chemistry of the supernova ejecta. We identify and consider new chemical species and pathways underpinning the formation of dust clusters, and apply a unique exhaustive chemical network to the entire ejecta of a Supernova with a 15 M<sub>&odot;</sub> progenitor. We test this new chemistry for various gas conditions in the ejecta, and derive mass yields for molecules and dust clusters. Results. We obtain the molecular component of the ejecta up to 11 years after explosion. The most abundant species are, in order of decreasing masses, O2, CO, SiS, SiO, CO2, SO2, CaS, N2, and CS. We identify molecules that are tracers of high-density clumps. As for dust clusters, we find the composition is dominated by silicates and silica, along with carbon dust, but with modest amounts of alumina. Pure metal clusters and metal sulphide and oxide clusters have negligible masses. High-density gas favours the formation of carbon clusters in the outer ejecta region whereas low temperatures hamper the formation of silicates in the oxygen core. The results are in good agreement with existing astronomical data and recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. They highlight the importance of chemistry for the derivation of dust budget from Supernovae.

We present the fourth data release of JADES, the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey, providing deep spectroscopic observations in the two GOODS fields. A companion paper presents the target selection, spectroscopic redshifts and success rates, and in this paper, we discuss the data reduction and present emission line flux measurements. The spectroscopy in this work consists of medium-depth, deep and ultradeep NIRSpec/MSA spectra of 5,190 targets, covering the spectral range 0.6&ndash;5.5~&mu;m and observed with both the low-dispersion prism (R=30&ndash;300) and all three medium-resolution gratings (R=500&ndash;1,500). We describe the data reduction, analysis and description of the data products included in this data release. In total, we measured 3,297 robust redshifts out of 5,190 targets, spanning a redshift range from z=0.5 up to z=14.2, including 974 at z&gt;4. This data release includes 1-d and 2-d fully reduced spectra with 3 and 5 pixel extractions, with slit-loss corrections and background subtraction optimized for point sources. Furthermore, we provide redshifts and S/N&gt;5 emission-line flux catalogues for the prism and grating spectra, as well as new guidelines to use these data products. Lastly, we are launching a new JADES Online Database, designed to enable quick selection and browsing of this data release. Altogether, these data provide the largest statistical sample to date to characterise the properties of galaxy populations across Cosmic time.

This paper accompanies Data Release 4 of the JWST Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), which presents the full NIRSpec spectroscopy of the survey. We provide spectra of 5190 targets across GOODS-North and GOODS-South (including the Hubble Ultra Deep Field), observed with the low-dispersion (R ~ 30-300) prism and three medium-resolution (R ~ 1000) gratings spanning 0.8 &lt; &lambda; &lt; 5.5 microns; 2654 were also observed with the higher-resolution (R ~ 2700) G395H grating. The tiered survey design obtained more than 20 hr exposures for ~ 700 galaxies in the Deep and Ultra Deep tiers, and shallower observations (~ 1-3 hr per setting) of &gt; 4400 galaxies in the Medium tiers. Targets were selected from photometric redshifts or colours, with priority given to rest-UV-selected galaxies at z &gt; 5.7 and F444W-selected galaxies at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 5.7. We describe the full target selection and present spectroscopic redshifts and success rates. In total we obtain robust redshifts for 3297 galaxies, including 396 at z &gt; 5.7 and 2545 at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 5.7. To facilitate uniform analyses, we define 'gold' sub-samples based on UV- and F444W-selection. Using the parent samples and redshift success rates, we construct rest-UV luminosity functions at 6 ≲ z ≲ 9 from the Medium- and Deep-JWST tiers. Our number densities agree well with previous determinations from both photometric and spectroscopic samples, with modest interloper fractions confirming the reliability of photometric UV-bright galaxy selections at these redshifts.

We present a search for z≃7 Lyman-break galaxies using the 1.72   deg<sup>2</sup> near-infrared UltraVISTA survey in the COSMOS field, reaching 5 &sigma; depths in Y of 26.2. We incorporate deep optical and Spitzer imaging for a full spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting analysis. We find 289 candidate galaxies at 6.5≤ z ≤ 7.5 covering -22.6 ≤ M_UV ≤ -20.2, faint enough to overlap with Hubble Space Telescope studies. We conduct a separate selection by including complementary Euclid performance verification imaging (reaching 5 &sigma; depths of 26.3), yielding 140 galaxies in 0.65   deg<sup>2</sup>, with 38 sources unique to this sample. We compute the rest-frame UV luminosity function (UV LF) from our samples, extending below the knee (M^*=-21.14^+0.28_-0.25). We find that the shape of the UV LF is consistent with both a Schechter function and double-power law (DPL) at the magnitudes probed by this sample, with a DPL preferred at M_UV&lt;-22.5 when bright-end results are included. The UltraVISTA+Euclid sample provides a clean measurement of the LF due to the overlapping near-infrared filters identifying molecular absorption features in the SEDs of ultra-cool dwarf interlopers, and additional faint galaxies are recovered. A comparison with JWST LFs at z&gt;7 suggests a gentle evolution in the bright-end slope, although this is limited by a lack of robust bright-end measurements at z&gt;9. We forecast that in the Euclid Deep Fields, the removal of contaminant ultra-cool dwarfs as point sources will be possible at J_E &lt; 24.5. Finally, we present a high-equivalent-width Lyman-&alpha; emitter candidate identified by combining HSC, VISTA, and Euclid broadband photometry, highlighting the synergistic power these instruments will have in the Euclid Auxiliary Fields for identifying extreme sources in the Epoch of Reionisation.

More than 60 years have passed since the first formal suggestion to use strongly-lensed supernovae to measure the expansion rate of the Universe through time-delay cosmography. Yet, fewer than 10 such objects have ever been discovered. We consider the merits of a targeted strategy focused on lensed hyperluminous infrared galaxies &ndash; among the most rapidly star-forming galaxies known in the Universe. With star formation rates (SFRs) ~ 200 - 6000~rmM<sub>&odot;</sub>~rmyr^-1, the ~ 30 objects in the Planck All-Sky Survey to Analyze Gravitationally-lensed Extreme Starbursts (PASSAGES) are excellent candidates for a case study, in particular, and have already led to the discovery of the multiply-imaged SN H0pe. Considering their lens model-corrected SFRs, we estimate their intrinsic supernova rates to be an extraordinary 1.8 - 65~rmyr^-1 (core-collapse) and 0.2 - 6.4~rmyr^-1 (Type Ia). Moreover, these massive starbursts typically have star-forming companions which are unaccounted for in this tally. We demonstrate a strong correlation between Einstein radius and typical time delays, with cluster lenses often exceeding several months (and therefore most favorable for high-precision H_0 inferences). A multi-visit monitoring campaign with a sensitive infrared telescope (namely, JWST) is necessary to mitigate dust attenuation. Still, a porous interstellar medium and clumpy star formation in these extreme galaxies might produce favorable conditions for detecting supernovae as transient point sources. Targeted campaigns of known lensed galaxies to discover new lensed supernovae can greatly complement wide-area cadenced surveys. Increasing the sample size helps to realize the potential of supernova time-delay cosmography to elucidate the Hubble tension through a single-step measurement, independent of other H_0 techniques.

### 69) [2510.00400](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00400v1): Uncertainties in high-z galaxy properties inferred from SED fitting using JWST NIRCam photometry

<p> Jiyoung Choe, Taysun Kimm, Harley Katz, Maxime Rey, Daniel Han, J. K. Jang, Joki Rosdahl </p>
<p>
Numerous high-z galaxies have recently been observed with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), providing new insights into early galaxy evolution. Their physical properties are typically derived through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, but the reliability of this approach for such early systems remains uncertain. Applying \sc Bagpipes on simulated SEDs at z=6 from the \sc Sphinx^20 cosmological simulation, we examine uncertainties in the recovery of stellar masses, star formation rates (SFR_10), and stellar metallicities from mock JWST/Near-Infrared Camera photometry. Even without dust or emission lines, fitting the intrinsic stellar continuum overestimates the stellar mass by about 60&percnt; on average (and by up to a factor of five for low-mass galaxies with recent starbursts) and underestimates SFR_10 by a factor of two, owing to inaccurate star formation histories and age-metallicity degeneracies. The addition of dust and nebular emission further amplifies these biases, yielding offsets of approximately +0.3 and -0.4 dex in stellar mass and SFR_10, respectively, while leaving stellar metallicities largely unconstrained. Incorporating bands free of strong emission lines, such as F410M, helps mitigate stellar mass overestimation by disentangling line emission from older stellar populations. We also find that best-fit or likelihood-weighted estimates are generally more accurate than median posterior values. Although stellar mass functions are reproduced reasonably well, the slope of the star formation main sequence depends sensitively on the adopted fitting model. Overall, these results underscore the importance of careful modelling when interpreting high-z photometry, particularly for galaxies with recent star formation burst and/or strong emission lines, to minimise systematic biases in derived physical properties.

Ices imprint strong absorption features in the near- and mid-infrared, but until recently they have been studied almost exclusively with spectroscopy toward small samples of bright sources. We show that JWST photometry alone can reveal and quantify interstellar ices and present a new open-source modeling tool, icemodels, to produce synthetic photometry of ices based on laboratory measurements. We provide reference tables indicating which filters are likely to be observably affected by ice absorption. Applying these models to NIRCam data of background stars behind Galactic Center (GC) clouds, and validating against NIRSpec spectra of Galactic disk sources, we find clear signatures of CO, H<sub>2</sub>O, and CO<sub>2</sub> ices and evidence for excess absorption in the F356W filter likely caused by CH-bearing species such as methanol. The ice ratios differ between the Galactic disk and Center, with GC clouds showing a higher H<sub>2</sub>O fraction. The large ice abundance in CO, H2O, and possibly complex molecules hints that the high complex molecule abundances observed in gas emission in the CMZ are driven by ice-phase chemistry in non-star-forming gas. Accounting for all likely ices, we infer that &gt;25% of the total carbon is frozen into CO ice in the GC, which exceeds the entire solar-neighborhood carbon budget. By assuming the freezeout fraction is the same in GC and disk clouds, we obtain a metallicity measurement indicating that Z_GC≳2.5Z<sub>&odot;</sub>. These results demonstrate that photometric ice measurements are feasible with JWST and capable of probing the metallicity structure of the cold interstellar medium.

We present the star formation and dust attenuation properties for a sample of 602 galaxies at redshifts 3&lt;z&lt;7, as part of the JADES survey. Our analysis is based on measurements of the H&alpha;/H&beta; Balmer Decrement using medium resolution (R~1000) spectroscopic observations with the JWST/NIRSpec Micro-Shutter Assembly. Stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs) are inferred with ttProspector using deep multi-band imaging. We utilize the Balmer decrement to measure dust-corrected H&alpha;-based SFRs, taking into account the subsolar metallicities observed in galaxies at high redshift. We confirm, with our large sample size, that the correlation between the Balmer decrement and stellar mass is already established out to z~7. We find that the relation between the Balmer decrement and stellar mass does not significantly evolve from the local universe to z~7. We investigate the UV slope as a function of the Balmer optical depth and find that the best-fit correlation for our high redshift sample is sSFR dependent and significantly different at high redshift when compared to galaxies at z≈ 0 and z ≈ 2. For the highest sSFR galaxies in our sample, there is no significant correlation between the UV slope and Balmer optical depth. This is evidence that the UV slope should be used with great caution to correct for dust in high redshift galaxies.

### 72) [2510.00187](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00187v1): SHAPE. I. A SOM-SED hybrid approach for efficient galaxy parameter estimation leveraging JWST

<p> Zihao Wang, Tao Wang, Ke Xu, Hanwen Sun, Ruining Tian, Qi Hao </p>
<p>
With the launch and application of next-generation ground- and space-based telescopes, astronomy has entered the era of big data, necessitating more efficient and robust data analysis methods. Most traditional parameter estimation methods are unable to reconcile differences between photometric systems. Ideally, we would like to optimally rely on high-quality observation data provided by, e.g., JWST, for calibrating and improving upcoming wide-field surveys such as the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) and Euclid. To this end, we introduce a new approach (SHAPE, SOM-SED Hybrid Approach for efficient Parameter Estimation) that can bridge different photometric systems and efficiently estimate key galaxy parameters, such as stellar mass (M<sub>&sext;</sub>) and star formation rate (SFR), leveraging data from a large and deep JWST/NIRCam and MIRI survey (PRIMER). As a test of the methodology, we focus on galaxies at z~ 1.5-2.5. To mitigate discrepancies between input colors and the training set, we replace the default SOM weights with stacked SEDs from each cell, extending the applicability of our model to other photometric catalogs (e.g., COSMOS2020). By incorporating a SED library (SED Lib), we apply this JWST-calibrated model to the COSMOS2020 catalog. Despite the limited sample size and potential template-related uncertainties, SOM-derived parameters exhibit a good agreement with results from SED-fitting using extended photometry. Under identical photometric constraints from CSST and Euclid bands, our method outperforms traditional SED-fitting techniques in SFR estimation, exhibiting both a reduced bias (-0.01 vs. 0.18) and a smaller &sigma;_NMAD (0.25 vs. 0.35). With its computational efficiency capable of processing 10^6 sources per CPU per hour during the estimation phase, this JWST-calibrated estimator holds significant promise for next-generation wide-field surveys.

### 73) [2510.00112](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00112v1): JWST-discovered AGN: evidence for heavy obscuration in the type-2 sample from the first stacked X-ray detection

<p>
One of the most puzzling properties of the high-redshift AGN population recently discovered by JWST, including both broad-line and narrow-line sources, is their X-ray weakness. With very few exceptions, and regardless of the optical classification, they are undetected at the limits of the deepest Chandra fields, even when stacking signals from tens of sources in standard observed-frame energy intervals (soft, hard, and full bands). It has been proposed that their elusive nature in the X-ray band is due to heavy absorption by dust-free gas or intrinsic weakness, possibly due to high, super-Eddington accretion. In this work, we perform X-ray stacking in three customized rest-frame energy ranges (1-4, 4-7.25, and 10-30 keV) of a sample of 50 Type 1 and 38 Type 2 AGN identified by JWST in the CDFS and CDFN fields. For the Type 2 sub-sample, we reach a total of about 210 Ms exposure, and we report a significant (~ 3&sigma;) detection in the hardest (10-30 keV rest frame) band, along with relatively tight upper limits in the rest frame softer energy bands. The most straightforward interpretation is in terms of heavy obscuration due to gas column densities well within the Compton thick regime (&gt; 2 × 10^24 cm<sup>2</sup>) with a large covering factor, approaching 4&pi;. The same procedure applied to the Type 1 sub-sample returns no evidence for a significant signal in about 140 Ms stacked data in any of the adopted bands, confirming their surprisingly elusive nature in the X-ray band obtained with previous stacking experiments. A brief comparison with the current observations and the implications for the evolution of AGN are discussed.

### 74) [2510.00111](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00111v1): JADES: An Abundance of Ultra-Distant T- and Y-Dwarfs in Deep Extragalactic Data

<p>
Ultra-cool T- (T_eff ≈ 500 - 1200 K) and Y-dwarfs (T_eff ≤ssapprox 500 K) have historically been found only a few hundred parsecs from the Sun. The sensitivity and wavelength coverage of the NIRCam instrument on board the James Webb Space Telescope offer a unique method for finding low-temperature brown dwarfs in deep extragalactic datasets out to multiple kiloparsecs. Here we report on the selection of a sample of 41 brown dwarf and brown dwarf candidates across the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) in the GOODS-S and GOODS-N regions. We introduce a new open-source Bayesian tool, the Near-Infrared Fitting for T and Y-dwarfs (ttNIFTY), to derive effective temperatures, metallicities, and distances from JWST photometry. We find that 31 candidates have fits consistent with T-dwarf temperatures out to 5 - 6 kpc, and 10 candidates have fits consistent with Y-dwarf temperatures out to 1 - 2 kpc. The majority of the sources are best fit with sub-solar metallicity models, consistent with them being subdwarfs in the Milky Way thick disk and halo. We report proper motions for nine brown dwarf candidates (three are newly presented), and calculate the number density of T- and Y-dwarfs as a function of temperature and distance above the Milky Way midplane. We further discuss how Y-dwarfs can serve as contaminants in the search for ultra-high-redshift galaxies. Together, these results demonstrate the power of deep JWST extragalactic imaging to probe the coldest substellar populations far beyond the solar neighborhood, providing new constraints on the Milky Way's structure and brown dwarf demographics.

<p>
The population of the Little Red Dots (LRDs) may represent a key phase of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. A cocoon of dense excited gas is emerging as key component to explain the most striking properties of LRDs, such as strong Balmer breaks and Balmer absorption, as well as the weak IR emission. To dissect the structure of LRDs, we analyze new deep JWST/NIRSpec PRISM and G395H spectra of FRESCO-GN-9771, one of the most luminous known LRDs at z=5.5. These reveal a strong Balmer break, broad Balmer lines and very narrow [O III] emission. We unveil a forest of optical [Fe II] lines, which we argue is emerging from a dense (n_H=10^9-10 cm^-3) warm layer with electron temperature T_e≈7000 K. The broad wings of H&alpha; and H&beta; have an exponential profile due to electron scattering in this same layer. The high H&alpha;:H&beta;:H&gamma; flux ratio of ≈10.4:1:0.14 is an indicator of collisional excitation and resonant scattering dominating the Balmer line emission. A narrow H&gamma; component, unseen in the other two Balmer lines due to outshining by the broad components, could trace the ISM of a normal host galaxy with a star formation rate ~5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1. The warm layer is mostly opaque to Balmer transitions, producing a characteristic P-Cygni profile in the line centers suggesting outflowing motions. This same layer is responsible for shaping the Balmer break. The broad-band spectrum can be reasonably matched by a simple photoionized slab model that dominates the &lambda;&gt;1500 &#8491; continuum and a low mass (~10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) galaxy that could explain the narrow [O III], with only subdominant contribution to the UV continuum. Our findings indicate that Balmer lines are not directly tracing gas kinematics near the SMBH and that the BH mass scale is likely much lower than virial indicators suggest.

### 76) [2510.00101](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00101v1): Irony at z=6.68: a bright AGN with forbidden Fe emission and multi-component Balmer absorption

<p>
We present the deepest medium-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy to date of a bright Little Red Dot (LRD) AGN, Irony at z=6.68. The data reveal broad Balmer emission from H&alpha;-H&delta; and Balmer absorption in H&alpha;-H&epsilon;. The absorption lines are kinematically split: H&alpha; is blueshifted while higher-order lines are redshifted suggesting complex gas kinematics; their relative ratios are inconsistent with a single, passive absorbing screen. The line depths require absorption of both the BLR and the continuum, ruling out a stellar origin, consistent with the smooth Balmer break. We fit the broad H&gamma;-H&alpha; lines and find the data favor a double-Gaussian effective profile, although exponential wings are evident. Depending on the adopted profile, single-epoch virial estimates give log(M<sub>&bull;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=7.86-8.39 and &lambda;_Edd=1.7-0.4. The dynamical mass implied by the narrow lines is low log(Mdyn/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=9.1, suggesting an overmassive black hole. The narrow lines display little attenuation, A_V&lt;0.5 mag; while broad H&alpha;/H&beta;~9 and the broad Balmer decrements are inconsistent with standard dust attenuation curves, suggesting collisional processes. The forbidden-line spectrum includes auroral [S II] and [N II], and a forest of [Fe II] lines. Line ratios and kinematics indicate a stratified narrow-line region with both low (n_e=420 cm^-3) and high densities (n_e≳ 6.3×10^5 cm^-3). We detect metal absorption lines in both the optical (Ca II and Na I) and UV range (Fe II UV1-UV3). Our results support a picture of a compact AGN embedded in a dense, high covering-factor and stratified cocoon, with complex neutral-gas kinematics. While the choice of broad-line profile affects the virial estimates of M<sub>&bull;</sub>, we find the effect to be of order 0.6 dex between the different approaches.

<p>
High-redshift (z &gt; 2) massive quiescent (MQ) galaxies provide an opportunity to probe the key physical processes driving the fuelling and quenching of star formation in the early Universe. Observational evidence suggests a possible evolutionary link between MQs and dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs; or submillimetre galaxies), another extreme high-redshift population. However, galaxy formation models have historically struggled to reproduce these populations - especially simultaneously - limiting our understanding of their formation and connection, particularly in light of recent JWST findings. In previous work, we presented a re-calibrated version of the L-Galaxies semi-analytic model that provides an improved match to observationally-inferred number densities of both DSFG and MQ populations. In this work, we use this new model to investigate the progenitors of MQs at z &gt; 2 and the physical mechanisms that lead to their quenching. We find that most MQs at z &gt; 2 were sub-millimetre-bright (S_870 &gt; 1 mJy) at some point in their cosmic past. The stellar mass of MQs is strongly correlated with the maximum submillimetre flux density attained over their history, and this relation appears to be independent of redshift. However, only a minority of high-redshift DSFGs evolve into MQs by z = 2. The key distinction between typical DSFGs and MQ progenitors lies in their merger histories: MQ progenitors experience an early major merger that triggers a brief, intense starburst and rapid black hole growth, depleting their cold gas reservoirs. In our model, AGN feedback subsequently prevents further gas cooling, resulting in quenching. In contrast, the broader DSFG population remains sub-millimetre-bright, with star formation proceeding primarily via secular processes, becoming quenched later.

Charting the Epoch of Reionization demands robust assessments of what drives the production of ionizing photons in high-redshift star-forming galaxies (SFGs), and requires better predictive capabilities from current observations. Using a sample of N=159 SFGs at 1&lt;z&lt;8, observed with deep medium-resolution spectroscopy from the JWST/NIRSpec EXCELS survey, we perform a statistical analysis of their ionizing photon production efficiencies ( &xi;<sub>ion</sub> ). We consider  &xi;<sub>ion</sub> , measured with Balmer line measurements, in relation to a number of key galaxy properties including; nebular emission line strengths (W_&lambda;(H&alpha;) and W_&lambda;( [OIII])), UV luminosity (M_UV) and UV slope (&beta;_UV), as well as dust attenuation (E(B-V)_neb) and redshift. Implementing a Bayesian linear regression methodology, we fit  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  against the principal observables while fully marginalising over all measurement uncertainties, mitigating against the impact of outliers and determining the intrinsic scatter. Significant relations between  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  and W_&lambda;(H&alpha;), W_&lambda;([OIII]) and &beta;_UV are recovered. Moreover, the weak trends with M_UV and redshift can be fully explained by the remaining property dependencies. Expanding our analysis to multivariate regression, we determine that W_&lambda;(H&alpha;) or W_&lambda;([OIII]), along with &beta;_UV and E(B-V)_neb, are the most important observables for accurately predicting  &xi;<sub>ion</sub> ,0. The latter identifies the most common outliers as SFGs with relatively high E(B-V)_neb≳0.5, possibly indicative of obscured star-formation or strong differential attenuation. Combining these properties enable  &xi;<sub>ion</sub> ,0 to be inferred with an accuracy of ~0.15 dex, with a population intrinsic scatter of &sigma;_int~0.035 dex.

We present itJWST NIRSpec and MIRI MRS observations of the central kiloparsec of M58 (NGC 4579), a nearby LINER galaxy hosting a low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN; L_bol ~ 10^42 erg s<sup>-1</sup>) with a low-power jet. These data provide an unprecedented view of the warm molecular gas phase and reveal clear signatures of feedback. We detect 44 H<sub>2</sub> lines, including bright pure rotational lines (S(1)-S(18)) and rovibrational lines up to &nu;=2, probing a wide range of excitation conditions. Excitation diagrams show that rotational lines follow a power-law temperature distribution with an exponential cutoff, consistent with heating by low-velocity shocks. H<sub>2</sub> rovibrational lines deviate from thermal models primarily because of sub-thermal excitation at low density. Additionally, there may be a 10% contribution by AGN X-ray heating in the nucleus. The dust lanes associated with the spiral inflow appear dynamically undisturbed but show signs of shock heating, while the inner ~200 pc exhibits turbulent kinematics produced by outflowing molecular gas. These results reveal the subtle yet measurable impact of LLAGN feedback on the interstellar medium, demonstrating that even weak, vertically oriented jets and low radiative accretion rates can perturb molecular gas and regulate nuclear reservoirs. This study highlights JWST's transformative ability to uncover hidden modes of AGN feedback.

<p>
We investigate the resolved properties of star-forming clumps and their host galaxies at 0.5&lt;z&lt;5 in the JWST CANUCS fields. We find that the fraction of clumpy galaxies peaks near z~2 for galaxies with masses of log(M_g,*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≥10, while galaxies with masses of 8.5 ≤ log(M_g,*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &lt; 10 show lower clumpy fractions with little redshift evolution. We identify and measure individual clump masses, finding that the aggregated clump stellar mass function (cSMF) follows a power-law slope of &alpha; = -2 across all redshift bins, broadly consistent with itin-situ clump formation. However, when split by galaxy masses, the cSMF is found to be flatter (&alpha;~-1.6) for massive galaxies and steeper (&alpha;~-2.3) for lower mass galaxies, with little redshift evolution in both cases. We explore how different formation mechanisms and disruptive processes affect the shape of the clump mass function. In particular, we find that the cSMF slope is flatter with increasing gas fractions in younger clump populations (&lt;300 Myr old), suggesting that higher gas availability leads to more massive clumps forming at the time of formation. Alternatively, many high-redshift galaxies in the sample have disturbed morphologies and simulations show that clumps of itex-situ origins can flatten the cSMF slope. We also investigate the evolution of clump populations, where we find the cSMF slope become flatter as clumps evolve and age. We interpret this as an indication of the long-term survivability of massive clumps, with feedback mechanisms preferentially disrupting low-mass clumps. Overall, the galaxy-mass dependent cSMF and age distribution point to a complex history for clumps, involving different and competing mechanisms for their formation and destruction.

### 81) [2509.24881](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24881v1): The first GLIMPSE of the faint galaxy population at Cosmic Dawn with JWST: The evolution of the ultraviolet luminosity function across z~9-15

<p>
Using ultra-deep JWST NIRCam imaging from the GLIMPSE Survey, enhanced by gravitational lensing of the AbellS1063 cluster, we investigate the faintest galaxies ever observed in the redshift range z~9 to z~15. We identify 105 galaxy candidates within this range, spanning absolute ultraviolet (UV) magnitudes from M_UV~-18 to M_UV~-13 mag, about three magnitudes fainter, on average, than prior JWST studies. We place strong constraints on the ultra-faint end of the UV luminosity function (UVLF), finding minimal evolution in the faint-end slope, which varies from &alpha;=-2.01±0.20 at z=9 to &alpha;=-2.10±0.19 at z=13. This behaviour contrasts with the rapid evolution of the faint-end slope observed from z~0 to z~9. By integrating the UVLF down to M_UV=-16, we derive the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD)from z=9 to z=13, revealing a best-fit redshift evolution that follows &prop;(1+z)^-2.94^+0.06_-0.10. This slope is significantly shallower than predictions from most theoretical models. Extending the integration limit to M_UV=-13, we find that galaxies fainter than M_UV=-16 contribute more than 50% of the total cosmic SFR density at z~12. The observed excess in the cosmic SFRD at these high redshifts may suggest an enhancement in the star formation efficiency during the earliest phases of galaxy formation. Alternatively, this could result from other physical mechanisms, such as bursty star formation histories; minimal dust attenuation; or an evolving initial mass function. However, existing models that incorporate these scenarios fail to fully reproduce the observed redshift evolution of SFRD. Finally, we acknowledge the potential impact of low-redshift contamination and cosmic variance, as the small survey volume may not represent the broader galaxy population. Similar observations in different fields and spectroscopic confirmation are required to validate these findings

### 82) [2509.25288](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25288v1): Cosmological tensions in the era of precision cosmology: Insights from Tensions in Cosmology 2025

<p> Eleonora Di Valentino, Jackson Levi Said, Emmanuel N. Saridakis </p>
<p>
The "Tensions in Cosmology'' series of conferences has been established as one of the main venues where the cosmological community collectively assesses the cracks in the concordance model and explores possible theoretical and observational remedies. The 2025 edition, held once again in Corfu, Greece, came at a crucial time: the Hubble constant H_0 discrepancy has now exceeded 6&sigma;, and new high-precision data from DESI, JWST, ACT, and other facilities have made this tension more robust while opening new windows on the early and late Universe. The S_8 tension, though milder and survey-dependent, remains an important probe of late-time structure formation, while emerging anomalies involving dynamical dark energy and neutrino physics are gaining increasing attention as potential signs of physics beyond &Lambda;CDM. Here we provide a report on the meeting and an update on the state of the tensions in 2025, highlighting progress since the pioneering 2022 event.

### 83) [2509.22871](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22871v1): Probing the Star Formation Main Sequence down to 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at 1 &lt; z &lt; 9

<p>
The Main Sequence of Star-Forming Galaxies (SFGMS or MS) is a fundamental scaling relation that provides a global framework for studying galaxy formation and evolution, as well as insight into the complex star formation histories (SFHs) of individual galaxies. In this work, we combine large-area pre-JWST surveys (COSMOS2020, CANDELS), which probe high-M<sub>&sext;</sub> sources (&gt;10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), with SHARDS/CANDELS FAINT and JWST data from CANUCS, CEERS, JADES, and UNCOVER, to obtain a high-z, star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass (M<sub>&sext;</sub>) complete sample spanning both high- and low-M<sub>&sext;</sub> regimes. Completeness in both M<sub>&sext;</sub> and SFR is key to avoiding biases introduced by low-mass, highly star-forming objects. Our combined data set is 80% complete down to 10^7.6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z~1 (10^8.8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z~9). The overall intrinsic MS slope (based on the SFR_100 and M<sub>&sext;</sub> derived with Dense Basis and nonparametric SFHs) shows little evolution up to z~5, with values ~0.7 - 0.8. The slope in the low-M<sub>&sext;</sub> regime becomes steeper than that in the high-M<sub>&sext;</sub> end at least up to z~5, but the strength of this change is highly dependent on the assumptions made on the symmetry of the uncertainties in M<sub>&sext;</sub> and SFR. If real, the steepening suggests reduced star formation efficiency or declining gas content with decreasing M<sub>&sext;</sub>. The transition between the low-M<sub>&sext;</sub> regime and the canonical MS occurs around 10^9.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, independent of z. This critical value may coincide with the assembly of galaxies' disks, which can provide a mechanism for self-regulation that stabilizes them against feedback. The intrinsic scatter is compatible with canonical estimates, also at low-M<sub>&sext;</sub>, ranging from 0.2-0.3 dex. This is indicative of rapid variations in star formation being averaged out over ≲100 Myr.

### 84) [2509.22800](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22800v1): Characterizing the star cluster populations in Stephan's Quintet using HST and JWST observations

<p>
Stephan's Quintet (SQ) is a local compact galaxy group system that exhibits significant star formation activity. A history of tidal interactions between its four member galaxies and a recent collision between an intruder galaxy and the original group are associated with active star formation, particularly in many shocked regions in the intra-group medium. Using an existing star cluster candidate (SCC) catalog constructed from HST UV/optical images, we integrate flux measurements from five near-infrared filters (F090W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W) obtained from JWST NIRCam observations in 2022. Leveraging the extended photometric baseline from HST and JWST, spanning ~300 nm to ~3500 nm, we perform spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using the CIGALE code to derive reliable estimates of age, mass, and extinction for the 1,588 high-confidence SCCs. We confirm earlier results that very young SCCs (~a few Myr) are predominantly located along previously identified shock regions near the merging galaxies, while older (&gt;100 Myr) and globular clusters are more widely distributed. Our analysis shows that NIR photometry helps break the age-extinction degeneracy, reclassifying many SCCs from older to younger, moderately dust-extincted clusters when added to HST-based SED fits. We also observe a strong spatial correlation between young clusters and CO-traced molecular gas, although active star formation is present in several regions with no detectable CO. We find that the two prominent epochs of star formation, around 5 Myr and 200 Myr, correspond to the two major interaction events in SQ that gave rise to the observed extended tidal features.

<p>
We present measurements of the masses associated with ~18,000 HII regions across 19 nearby star-forming galaxies by combining data from JWST, HST, MUSE, ALMA, VLA, and MeerKAT from the multi-wavelength PHANGS survey. We report 10 pc-scale measurements of the mass of young stars, ionized gas, and older disk stars coincident with each HII region, as well as the initial and current mass of molecular gas, atomic gas, and swept-up shell material, estimated from lower resolution data. We find that the mass of older stars dominates over young stars at ≳10 pc scales, and ionized gas exceeds the stellar mass in most optically bright HII regions. Combining our mass measurements for a statistically large sample of HII regions, we derive 10 pc scale star-formation efficiencies ≈6-17&percnt; for individual HII regions. Comparing each region's self-gravity with the ambient ISM pressure and total pressure from pre-supernova stellar feedback, we show that most optically bright HII regions are over-pressured relative to their own self-gravity and the ambient ISM pressure, and that they are hence likely expanding into their surroundings. Larger HII regions in galaxy centers approach dynamical equilibrium. The self-gravity of regions is expected to dominate over pre-supernova stellar feedback pressure at ≳130 pc and 60 pc scales in galaxy disks and centers, respectively, but is always sub-dominant to the ambient ISM pressure on HII region scales. Our measurements have direct implications for the dynamical evolution of star-forming regions and the efficiency of stellar feedback in ionizing and clearing cold gas.

### 86) [2509.22776](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22776v1): Observing compact Pop III star clusters and the presence of cosmic streaming

<p> Claire E. Williams, Smadar Naoz, Naoki Yoshida, William Lake, Blakesley Burkhart, Federico Marinacci, Mark Vogelsberger, Shyam H. Menon, Avi Chen, Kyle Kremer </p>
<p>
The formation of the Universe's first luminous stellar structures depends on the unique conditions at "Cosmic Dawn," which are set by the underlying cosmological model and early baryonic physics. Observations suggest that high-z star clusters reached stellar surface densities above 10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> pc^-2, suggesting scenarios where models predict that the ability of stellar feedback to counter gravitational collapse is severely limited. We investigate the first star clusters in a suite of AREPO simulations, which explore the capacity for &Lambda;CDM halos to maximally form high-density systems without feedback. We include the effects of the supersonic baryon-dark matter streaming velocity, an effect that impacts gas density and distribution in early minihalos. We show that early star clusters can reach high densities even in regions of strong supersonic streaming, provided feedback is weak. We analyze the interplay of the stream velocity and the dynamical processes of structure formation, finding that JWST has the opportunity to detect the brightest, most massive objects in our computational box. The detection of individual z≥12 Pop III star clusters below 10^7M<sub>&odot;</sub> is challenging, although lensing could reveal these objects in rare configurations, especially if a top-heavy IMF is present. We find that accounting for baryonic clusters separately from dark matter halos complicates predictions for the faint-end of the high-z UVLF, with competing effects from the stream velocity and low-mass clusters outside of halos. Finally, we explore clustering of star clusters as a promising probe of the stream velocity in these systems.

### 87) [2509.22083](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22083v1): High-redshift Merger-induced Bar-like Galaxies in IllustrisTNG

<p> Ewa L. Lokas </p>
<p>
Recent discoveries made with JWST observations include a significant number of barred galaxies at high redshift. Their origin remains unclear and their presence seems difficult to reproduce in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and evolution. In this Letter I present four examples of high-redshift bars selected from a sample of bar-like galaxies studied previously using IllustrisTNG simulations. All the galaxies formed their bars at redshifts z &gt; 3 via mergers with smaller satellites, although one had its bar formed even earlier, at z &gt; 5. The bars were born long, with lengths on the order of 3 kpc, and grew in time. Three of the four galaxies were later accreted by clusters and underwent multiple interactions with their respective brightest cluster galaxies. Their bar strength was to some extent affected by these interactions but all the galaxies preserved their bar-like shape until the present time. By the end of the evolution, all the galaxies lost their gas and stopped forming stars, they retained essentially no disk component and were no longer rotationally supported. The examples demonstrate that high-z bars do not evolve into present-day barred disk galaxies similar to the Milky Way but rather into S0s or ellipticals typically found in galaxy clusters.

### 88) [2509.21952](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21952v2): Modified Cosmology or Modified Galaxy Astrophysics is Driving the z&gt;6 JWST Results? CMB Experiments can discover the Origin in Near Future

<p> Harsh Mehta, Suvodip Mukherjee </p>
<p>
The massive and bright galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at high redshifts (z &gt; 6) have challenged our understanding of the Universe. This may require revisiting the physics of galaxy formation and evolution, or modifying the &Lambda;CDM cosmological model to explain these observations, or both. We show that high-resolution CMB experiments such as the Simons Observatory (or CMB-S4) can measure smoking-gun signatures jointly in weak lensing and kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) power spectra, which can shed light on both these scenarios. An increase in the matter power spectrum at small scales will enhance the number density of dark matter halos at high redshifts, thereby increasing the galaxy formation rate. This will cause enhanced weak lensing signal from these redshifts and also lead to enhanced patchy-kSZ signal from the epoch of reionization. However, if only galaxy astrophysics is modified, without any modification in the matter power spectrum, then the patchy-kSZ signal gets altered, while the weak lensing signal remains nearly unaltered. We show that we can measure the modified astrophysical and cosmological scenarios at a statistical significance of 6.2&sigma; (and 17.4&sigma;) from Simons Observatory (and CMB-S4), which will enable a conclusive understanding on what physical process is driving the high-redshift observations of JWST.

<p>
CO gas emission is a fundamental tool for measuring column density, but in cold, dark clouds, much of the CO is locked away in ice. We present JWST results from observations of a star forming filament (G0.342+0.024) that that appears to be associated with the 3 kpc arm. This filament is backlit by the Galactic Center, which has allowed us to construct a high-resolution extinction map (mean separation between stars of ~1" outside the filament, ~2" in the filament). ALMA Band 3 data reveals embedded star formation within the cloud. Using the CO ice feature covered by the F466N band, we map the CO ice column density of the filament. By combining the extinction map, CO ice column density map, and archival CO observations, we examine the efficacy of standard CO X-factor measurements of mass in star forming gas.We find that 50-88% of the CO is locked away in ice at large column densities (N_H<sub>2</sub> ≳ 10^22 ~cm<sup>2</sup>, 200 ~M<sub>&odot;</sub> ~pc^-2) in the filament. The primary sources of uncertainty in this estimate are due to uncertainty in the ice composition and lab measurements of ice opacities. This shows that systematic corrections are needed for mass measurements in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies at high column densities.

### 90) [2509.21686](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21686v1): Adaptive Reconstruction of Cluster Halos (ARCH): Integrating Shear and Flexion for Substructure Detection

<p> Jacob Shpiece, David M. Goldberg </p>
<p>
We present ARCH (Adaptive Reconstruction of Cluster Halos), a new gravitational lensing pipeline for cluster mass reconstruction that applies a joint shear-flexion analysis to JWST imaging. Previous approaches have explored joint shear+flexion reconstructions through forward modeling and Bayesian inference frameworks; in contrast, ARCH adopts a staged optimization strategy that incrementally filters and selects candidate halos rather than requiring a global likelihood model or strong priors. This design makes reconstruction computationally tractable and flexible, enabling systematic tests of multiple signal combinations within a unified framework. ARCH employs staged candidate generation, local optimization, filtering, forward selection, and global strength refinement, with a combined fit metric weighted by per-signal uncertainties. Applies to Abell 2744 and El Gordo, the pipeline recovers convergence maps and subcluster masses consistent with published weak+strong lensing results. In Abell 2744 the central core mass within 300h^-1 kpc is 2.1× 10^14 M<sub>&odot;</sub> h^-1, while in El Gordo the northwestern and southeastern clumps are recovered at 2.6× 10^14 M<sub>&odot;</sub> h^-1 and 2.3× 10^14 M<sub>&odot;</sub> h^-1. Jackknife resampling indicates typical 1&sigma; uncertainties of 10^12-10^13 M<sub>&odot;</sub> h^-1, with the all signal and shear+F reconstructions providing the most stable results. These results demonstrate that flexion, when anchored by shear, enhances sensitivity to cluster substructure while maintaining stable cluster-scale mass recovery.

The first stars formed out of pristine gas, causing them to be so massive that none are expected to have survived until today. If their direct descendants were sufficiently low-mass stars, they could exist today and would be recognizable by having the lowest metallicity (abundance of elements heavier than helium). The lowest metallicity star currently known is a star in the thick disk of the Milky Way with total metallicity Z &lt; 1.4 x 10^-6 (log Z/Zsun &lt; -4.0). While other stars with lower iron abundance have been discovered, they have high carbon abundances and thus higher total metallicities (log Z/Zsun &gt; -3). Here we present the discovery and detailed chemical analysis of the most metal-poor star yet found: the red giant star SDSS J0715-7334 with ultra-low abundances of both iron and carbon ([Fe/H]=-4.3, [C/Fe]&lt;-0.2), resulting in total metallicity Z &lt; 7.8 x 10^-7 (log Z/Zsun &lt; -4.3). This star has the most pristine composition of any object known in the universe. The star's orbit indicates that it originates from the halo of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Its detailed chemical composition implies a supernova progenitor with initial mass of 30 solar masses. Current models of low-mass star formation can explain the existence of SDSS J0715-7334 only if dust cooling was already able to operate at the time of its formation. SDSS J0715-7334 is over ten times more metal-poor than the most metal-poor high-redshift galaxies found by the James Webb Space Telescope, some of which have been claimed to be potentially metal-free. Substantially deeper observations of high-redshift galaxies would be needed to prove that they are truly pristine galaxies made of metal-free stars and not metal-enriched galaxies composed of second-generation stars like SDSS J0715-7334.

We present observational evidence for three massive, accreting black holes in the z=5.0167 galaxy J0148-4214 from JWST/NIRSpec-IFU spectroscopy. The black holes are revealed through broad H&alpha; emission (FWHM = 430-2920 km/s) without a forbidden-line counterpart in the bright [O III] doublet. Channel maps of the asymmetric central H&alpha; profile isolate two spatially distinct broad line regions (BLRs), separated by 190±40 pc, while a third BLR is found in the galaxy outskirts with a projected separation of 1.7 kpc. Using single-epoch virial relations, we estimate black hole masses of log(M<sub>&bull;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=7.9±0.4 (primary central), 5.8±0.5 (secondary central) and 6.3±0.5 (third off-nuclear). We argue that the two central black holes will likely rapidly merge, with a simple dynamical friction time estimate of the order of 700 Myr. Assuming that also the off-nuclear black hole is in the process of sinking towards the centre, it will likely lead to a second merger, and we investigate the detection probability of such mergers with LISA. Alternatively, the third black hole may be the result of previous three-body interaction or a gravitational recoil, where our observations would provide evidence that such black holes may retain their accretion discs and BLRs even in the aftermath of such extreme dynamical interactions. The discovery of a black hole triplet at high redshift, together with other recent results on distant black hole pairs, indicates that multiple massive black hole systems were common in the early Universe. Our results highlight the importance of IFU observations for the detection of massive black hole multiplets in distant galaxies, the progenitors of massive black hole mergers that may be detected with next-generation gravitational wave observatories.

### 93) [2509.21236](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21236v1): Limitations on Morphological Fitting for JWST "Little Red Dots"

<p> Kelly E. Whalen, Kimberly A. Weaver, Ryan C. Hickox, Erini Lambrides </p>
<p>
Early results from JWST uncover a peculiar class of objects referred to as "little red dots'' (LRDs). The extremely compact morphology of LRDs is often invoked to point towards an AGN-dominated picture in the context of their conflicting multiwavelength properties. In this work, we assess the capability of pysersic and GALFIT &ndash; commonly used tools in LRD morphological studies &ndash; to recover input parameters for a simulated suite of LRD-like objects in the F444W band. We find that: 1) these tools have difficulty recovering input parameters for simulated images with SNR ≲ 25; 2) estimated PSF fraction could be a more robust physically-motivated description of LRD compactness; and 3) almost all permutations of modeled LRDs with SNR ≲ 50 cannot be differentiated from a point source, regardless of intrinsic extent. This has serious implications on how we interpret morphological results for increasingly large photometric samples of LRDs, especially at extremely high-z or in relatively shallow fields. We present results of Sersic and two-component fitting to a sample of observed LRDs to compare with our mock sample fitting. We find that ~85&percnt; of observed LRDs are PSF-dominated, consistent with the AGN-dominated interpretation. The remaining ~15&percnt; have low estimated PSF fractions (two-component fit) and sizes ≳ 150 pc (Sersic). This morphological diversity of LRDs suggests that that the population likely is not homogeneous. It possibly has a primary subset of sources consistent with the AGN-dominated hypothesis, and a secondary population of sources more consistent with arising perhaps from extremely compact starbursts.

### 94) [2509.20832](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20832v1): Galactic Contrail in NGC 3627 caused by Dwarf Galaxy Candidate or Massive Black Hole Flyby

<p> Mengke Zhao, Guang-Xing Li </p>
<p>
We report the discovery of a kpc scale molecular contrail in the spiral galaxy NGC 3627, a narrow structure spanning 8 kpc in length with a width of 200 pc and an extreme aspect ratio of 40, observed in both mid-infrared dust emission (PHANGS-JWST) and CO(2-1) gas (PHANGS-ALMA). This contrail size significantly exceeds the size of any known analogs in the Milky Way and exhibits supersonic turbulence (10 km/s). Its morphology and dynamics are consistent with gravitational focusing by a flyby compact object of mass 1e6 M_sun, likely a massive black hole or a dwarf galaxy nucleus, traversing the disk at &gt;300 km/s. The crossing time of such a contrail, estimated from its width and velocity dispersion, is only ~ 20 Myr, implying a recent interaction. This contrail can be caused by a dwarf galaxy, or massive black hole nucleus. This discovery establishes galactic-scale contrails as probes of massive dark objects interacting with medium in and around galactic disks.

<p> Ryota Ikeda, Daisuke Iono, Ken-ichi Tadaki, Andrea Silva, the FOSSILS Team </p>
<p>
High-resolution far-infrared (FIR) observation of submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) is an effective approach to study the formation of sub-structures in the early epoch of massive galaxies. We present the 870&mu;m continuum images resolved down to sub-kpc scales for 12 SMGs taken by Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) as an initial sample of the FOSSILS Survey. We discovered a wide variety of morphological properties, including a two-arm spiral galaxy at z=2.5 possibly induced by a tidal interaction with a minor companion. Nonetheless, about half of the sample exhibit a compact and circular morphology, which is reminiscent of optical morphology of compact quiescent galaxies. Future studies with larger sample and combination of the rest-frame optical images taken by James Webb Space Telescope will shed light on the various evolutionary track of SMGs.

<p> Richard Cloete, Abraham Loeb, Peter Vereš </p>
<p>
We use astrometric data on 3I/ATLAS compiled by the Minor Planet Center from May 15 to September 23, 2025, and derive an upper limit on any statistically significant deviation from the best-fit gravity-based trajectory. The residuals imply that the non-gravitational acceleration is smaller than ~ 3 × 10^-10 au d^-2. Based on the total mass-loss rate and outflow speed inferred from JWST data on August 6, 2025, we derive lower limits on the mass and diameter of 3I/ATLAS of 3.3 × 10^16 g and 5 km, respectively.

### 97) [2509.20519](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20519v1): Measuring the Central Dark Mass in NGC 4258 with JWST/NIRSpec Stellar Kinematics

<p> Dieu D. Nguyen, Hai N. Ngo, Michele Cappellari, Tinh Q. T. Le, Tien H. T. Ho, Tuan N. Le, Elena Gallo, Niranjan Thatte, Fan Zou, Michele Perna, Miguel Pereira-Santaella </p>
<p>
We present a new stellar dynamical measurement of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 4258, a critical benchmark for extragalactic mass measurements. We use archival JWST/NIRSpec IFU data (G235H/F170LP grating) to extract high-resolution two-dimensional stellar kinematics from the CO bandhead absorption features within the central 3'' × 3''. We extract the stellar kinematics after correcting for instrumental artifacts and separating the stellar light from the non-thermal AGN continuum. We employ Jeans Anisotropic Models (JAM) to fit the observed kinematics, exploring a grid of 12 models to systematically test the impact of different assumptions for the point-spread function, stellar mass-to-light ratio (M/L) profile, and orbital anisotropy. All 12 models provide broadly acceptable fits, albeit with minor differences. The ensemble median and 68% (1&sigma;) bootstrap confidence intervals of our 12 models yield a black hole mass of M_BH = (4.08^+0.19_-0.33) × 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. This paper showcases the utility of using the full model ensemble to robustly account for systematic uncertainties, rather than relying on formal errors from a single preferred model, as has been common practice. Our result is just 5% larger than, and consistent with, the benchmark SMBH mass derived from water maser dynamics, validating the use of NIRSpec stellar kinematics for robust SMBH mass determination. Our analysis demonstrates JWST's capability to resolve the SMBH's sphere of influence and deliver precise dynamical masses, even in the presence of significant AGN continuum emission.

Recent photometric surveys with JWST have revealed a significant population of mysterious objects with red colours, compact morphologies, frequent signs of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, and negligible X-ray emission. These 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs) have been explored through spectral and photometric studies, but their nature is still under debate. As part of the BlackTHUNDER survey, we have observed UNCOVER_20466, the second most distant LRD known (z=8.5), with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU. Previous JWST/NIRCam and JWST/NIRSpec MSA observations of this source revealed its LRD nature, as well as the presence of an AGN. Using our NIRSpec IFU data, we confirm that UNCOVER_20466 contains an overmassive black hole. However, our observed Balmer decrements imply negligible dust attenuation, resulting in a much lower Hbeta-based bolometric luminosity and Eddington luminosity (~10%) than previously found. Lyman-alpha emission is strongly detected, implying f<sub>esc</sub>,Lya~30%. The extremely high [OIII]4363/Hgamma ratio is indicative of not only AGN photoionization and heating, but also extremely high densities (ne~10^7cm-3), suggesting that this black hole at such high redshift may be forming in an ultra-dense protogalaxy.

JWST has revealed an abundance of supermassive black holes (BHs) in the early Universe, and yet the lowest mass seed black holes that gave rise to these populations remain elusive. Here we present a systematic search for broad-line Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) in some of the faintest high-z galaxies surveyed yet by combining ultra-deep JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy with the strong lensing aid in Abell S1063. By employing the profile of the [OIII]&lambda; 5007 emission lines as a template for narrow-line components and carefully cross-validating with mock observations, we identify a sample of ten broad-line AGNs at 4.5&lt;z&lt;7.0 (eight secure, two tentative). The inferred BH masses from the broad H&alpha; line explore the intermediate BH mass regime down to ~ 10^5.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. The stellar mass (M_*) is estimated with a galaxy+AGN composite model, and we find the BH to stellar mass ratio spans down to M_BH/M_*≲ 0.1&percnt;, unveiling populations on the empirical M_BH-M<sub>&sext;</sub> relation observed in the local universe. We also derive the black hole mass function and investigate its low-mass end at this epoch. While we confirm the agreement of our results with previous studies at M_BH≳10^6.5M<sub>&odot;</sub>, we find the mass range of ~ 10^5.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> features an enhanced abundance with respect to the extrapolated best-fit Schechter function. Comparison with theoretical models suggests that a possible origin for this enhanced abundance is the direct-collapse BH formation, supporting the scenario that the direct collapse of massive gas clouds is a significant pathway for the earliest supermassive BHs.

We present measurements of stellar population properties of a newly discovered spectroscopically confirmed z=11.10^+0.11_-0.26, gravitationally lensed galaxy, using JWST NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy and NIRCam imaging. The arc is highly magnified by the Bullet Cluster (magnification factor &mu;=14.0^+6.2_-0.3. It contains three star-forming components of which one is barely resolved and two are unresolved, giving intrinsic sizes of ≲ 10pc. The clumps also contain ~50% of the total stellar mass. The galaxy formed the majority of its stars ~150Myr ago (by z~14). The spectrum shows a pronounced damping wing, typical for galaxies deep in the reionisation era and indicating a neutral IGM at this line of sight. The intrinsic luminosity of the galaxy is 0.086^+0.008_-0.030 L^* (with L^* being the characteristic luminosity for this redshift), making it the lowest luminosity spectroscopically confirmed galaxy at z&gt;10 discovered to date.

The multi-cycle JWST Treasury program NEXUS will obtain cadenced imaging and spectroscopic observations around the North Ecliptic Pole during 2024-2028. Here we report a systematic search for nuclear variability among ~ 25 k sources covered by NIRCam (F200W+F444W) imaging using the first two NEXUS epochs separated by 9 months in the observed frame. Difference imaging techniques reach 1&sigma; variability sensitivity of 0.18~mag (F200W) and 0.15~mag (F444W) at 28th magnitude (within 0".2 diameter aperture), improved to 0.01~mag and 0.02~mag at &lt;25th magnitude, demonstrating the superb performance of NIRCam photometry. The difference imaging results represent significant improvement over aperture photometry on individual epochs (by &gt;30&percnt;). We identify 465 high-confidence variable sources among the parent sample, with 2-epoch flux difference at &gt;3&sigma; from the fiducial variability sensitivity. Essentially all these variable sources are of extragalactic origin based on preliminary photometric classifications, and follow a similar photometric redshift distribution as the parent sample up to z<sub>phot</sub>&gt;10. While the majority of these variability candidates are likely normal unobscured AGNs, some of them may be rare nuclear stellar transients and tidal disruption events that await confirmation with spectroscopy and continued photometric monitoring. We also constrain the photometric variability of ten spectroscopically confirmed broad-line Little Red Dots (LRDs) at 3≲ z ≲ 7, and find none of them show detectable variability in either band. We derive stringent 3&sigma; upper limits on the F444W variability of ~ 3-10&percnt; for these LRDs, with a median value of ~ 5&percnt;. These constraints imply weak variability in the rest-frame optical continuum of LRDs.

<p> Xuejian Shen, Oliver Zier, Mark Vogelsberger, Michael Boylan-Kolchin, Lars Hernquist, Sandro Tacchella, Rohan P. Naidu </p>
<p>
Early JWST observations have revealed a high-redshift universe more vibrant than predicted by canonical galaxy-formation models within &Lambda;CDM, showing an excess of ultraviolet(UV)-bright, massive, and morphologically mature galaxies. Departures from &Lambda;CDM prior to recombination can imprint signatures on non-linear structure formation at high redshift. In this paper, we investigate one such scenario - Early Dark Energy, originally proposed to resolve the Hubble tension - and its implications for these high-redshift challenges. We present the first large-scale cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of these models. Modifications to the pre-recombination expansion history accelerate early structure formation and produce UV luminosity and stellar mass functions in excellent agreement with JWST measurements, requiring essentially no additional calibrations. Predictions converge to &Lambda;CDM at lower redshifts (z ≲ 3), thereby preserving all successes of &Lambda;CDM. This model also accelerates the emergence of stellar and gaseous disks, increasing their number densities by ~ 0.5 dex at z≃ 6-7, primarily due to the higher abundance of massive galaxies. Taken together, these results demonstrate how early-universe physics can simultaneously reconcile multiple high-redshift challenges and the Hubble tension while retaining the core achievements of &Lambda;CDM. This opens a pathway to constraining a broad class of beyond-&Lambda;CDM models with forthcoming observations.

We explore the physical origins of the observed deficit of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at sub-solar metallicity using JWST/NIRCam imaging of the nearby galaxy M101, covering regions from solar metallicity (Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) down to 0.4 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>. These maps are used to trace the radial evolution of the shortest-wavelength PAH feature at 3.3 &mu;m, which is emitted preferentially by the smallest PAHs (&lt;100 carbon atoms). The fractional contribution of PAH 3.3 &mu;m to the total PAH luminosity (&Sigma;PAH) increases by 3x as metallicity declines, rising from ~1&percnt; to ~3&percnt; over the observed range, consistent with prior predictions from the inhibited grain growth model based on Spitzer spectroscopy. We explore model refinements including photon effects and alternative size evolution prescriptions, and find that a modest amount of small grain photo-destruction remains possible, provided the grain size cutoff does not exceed ~55 carbon atoms. The best-fit models predict 3.3 &mu;m/&Sigma;PAH will rise to ~5.6-7.7&percnt; at 10&percnt; Z<sub>&odot;</sub>. Surprisingly, even as &Sigma;PAH drops significantly relative to the total infrared luminosity (TIR) as metallicity declines, 3.3 &mu;m/TIR alone rises, potentially indicating the mass fraction of the smallest PAH grains increases as the total dust content in galaxies drops. The current model cannot fully reproduce this trend even if the unusually strong effects of changing radiation field hardness on 3.3 &mu;m/TIR are included. This may be evidence that the smallest PAHs are uniquely robust against destruction and inhibited growth effects. These results highlight the pivotal role that short-wavelength PAH emission can play in studies of low-metallicity and high-redshift galaxies.

With JWST, it is now possible to use Lyman-Alpha (Ly&alpha;) emission from galaxies beyond z&gt;8 to trace neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) as the Universe became reionized. However, observed Ly&alpha; emission is scattered by neutral hydrogen in the IGM and the interstellar and circum-galactic medium, necessitating `baseline' models of Ly&alpha; properties in the ionized IGM to disentangle their impacts. In this work, we characterize Ly&alpha; properties at the end of reionization, z~5-6, providing a baseline that can be applied to z&gt;6 observations. We targeted GOODS-N with MMT/Binospec, obtaining R~4360 rest-frame UV spectra of 236 galaxies at z~5-6, selected from HST/CANDELS, finding 62 Ly&alpha; detections. We use JWST observations from JADES and FRESCO for a subset of our sources to characterize Ly&alpha; properties as a function of UV continuum and H&alpha; emission. We present the first statistical measurements of the Ly&alpha; FWHM distribution at z~5-6, and produce empirical baseline models of Ly&alpha; equivalent width (EWLy&alpha;) and escape fraction (f<sub>esc</sub>^Ly&alpha;) conditional on UV magnitude and slope. We find our EWLy&alpha; and f<sub>esc</sub>^Ly&alpha; models depend on UV magnitude, and infer 45±5&percnt; and &lt;62±8&percnt; of MUV=-19.5 galaxies have EWLy&alpha;&gt;25&#8491; and f<sub>esc</sub>^Ly&alpha;&gt;0.2, respectively. We find a mean Ly&alpha; FWHM of 245km/s and median Ly&alpha; velocity offset of 258km/s, both correlating with higher UV luminosity. Our median observed Ly&alpha; line profile is broader and has higher velocity offset compared to pre-JWST models based on z~2 lines, which may reflect resonant scattering by residual neutral hydrogen in the IGM at z~5-6 and increasing ISM/CGM densities. Our median line profile predicts higher Ly&alpha; transmission in a fully neutral IGM, providing insight into recent z&gt;10 Ly&alpha; detections.

We study 24 massive quiescent galaxies with log rmM_*/rmM<sub>&odot;</sub> &gt; 10 at 1 &lt; z &lt; 3 with JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution observations from the Early eXtragalactic Continuum and Emission Line Survey (EXCELS). We reconstruct their star formation histories and find that they have large bursts (100rm M<sub>&odot;</sub> rmyr^-1 -1000 rm M<sub>&odot;</sub> rmyr^-1), followed by a rapid truncation of star formation. The number densities of the quenched galaxies in our sample that we predict underwent a submillimeter phase are consistent with submillimeter galaxies being the progenitors of our quenched population. The median post-starburst visibility time is ~600 Myr, with more massive galaxies (log rmM_*/rmM<sub>&odot;</sub> &gt; 10.7) exhibiting shorter visibility times than lower mass galaxies. The range of quenching times &ndash; defined as the time from the peak starburst to the time of quiescence &ndash; found in this sample (0.06-1.75 Gyr) suggests multiple quenching pathways, consistent with previous studies. We do not see evidence for quenching mechanisms varying with redshift between 1&lt;z&lt;3. We detect evidence for weak AGN activity in 4 out of the 8 galaxies with robust emission line detections, based on line ratio diagnostics. Our findings suggest that there are a diverse range of quenching mechanisms at cosmic noon, and support a scenario in which the primary quenching mechanisms are rapid (&lt;500 Myr) following a starburst.

<p>
A combination of JWST observations at z~12-14 and ALMA observations of extremely dust-rich systems at z~6 has demonstrated that dust grows extremely fast in the early Universe, with galaxies amassing up to 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub> of dust in just 500 Myr between z=12-&gt;6. In this paper we demonstrate, via a series of numerical experiments conducted in cosmological zoom-in simulations, that a likely pathway for this dust accumulation in the first formed galaxies is through production at early times via supernovae, followed by the rapid growth on ultrasmall dust grains. Our main results follow. The stellar production of dust dominates until z ~ 10-11 at which point galaxies transition to a growth-dominated regime. We employ a Shapley analysis to demonstrate that the local density is the dominant factor driving dust growth, followed by the grain size distribution. A rapid rise in the small-to-large grain ratio with decreasing redshift (owing to grain-grain shattering) drives growth through increased dust surface area per unit mass. Growth models are necessary to match the dust content of ALMA detected sources at z ~ 6. Finally, we demonstrate that "blue monsters'', massive, UV-bright galaxies at z&gt;10 with extremely blue continuum slopes likely have dust-to stellar mass ratios 10^-4-10^-3, but their top-heavy grain size distributions render them optically thin in the UV, providing a natural explanation for their observed properties without requiring exotic dust geometries.

Galaxies at Cosmic Noon (z~2-3) are characterized by rapid star formation that will lead to significant metal enrichment in the interstellar medium (ISM). While much observational evidence suggests that these galaxies are chemically distinct from those in the local Universe, directly measuring the ISM chemistry in large samples of high-z galaxies is only now possible with the observational capabilities of JWST. In this first key paper of the CECILIA program, we present the direct-method physical conditions and multi-element abundances in twenty galaxies at Cosmic Noon. Using a combination of archival Keck/MOSFIRE and new ~30-hr NIRSpec spectroscopy, we measure multiple electron gas densities and the temperature structure from the O^+ and S^2+ ions. We find that n_e[O II] and n_e[S II] are comparable but elevated with respect to n_e in local star-forming galaxies, and the simultaneous T_e[O II] and T_e[S III] generally agree with photoionization model T_e scaling relations. The O abundances in the CECILIA galaxies range from 12+log(O/H)=7.76-8.78 (12-123% solar O/H), representing some of the highest direct-method metallicities and lowest T_e measured with JWST to date. The CECILIA galaxies exhibit significantly sub-solar S/O and Ar/O, in agreement with emerging results from other high-z studies and a signature of predominant enrichment from core collapse supernovae. The N/O-O/H trends in the CECILIA galaxies generally agree with the abundance trends in local nebulae, but the large scatter in N/O could be sensitive to the star-formation history. The CECILIA observations underscore the need for exceptionally deep spectroscopy to unveil the ISM abundance patterns in high-z galaxies.

<p>
We present gas-phase abundances of carbon (C), &alpha;-elements (O, Ne, Si, and Ar) and iron (Fe) obtained from stacked spectra of high-z star-forming galaxies with the deep Near Infrared Spectrograph medium-resolution data from the James Webb Space Telescope Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey. Our 564 sources at z=4&ndash;7 have a median stellar mass of log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=8.46 and a median star-formation rate of log(SFR/M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1)=0.30, placing them close to the star-formation main sequence. We find that the stacked spectrum of all our 564 sources has relatively low [C/O]=-0.70, moderate [Ne/O]=-0.09, and low [Ar/O]=-0.28 values at a low gas-phase metallicity of 12+log(O/H)=7.71 (Z~ 0.1~Z<sub>&odot;</sub>), suggesting dominant yields of core-collapse supernovae evolved from massive stars. The detection of a weak SiIII] emission line in our stacked spectrum provides a silicon-to-oxygen abundance ratio of [Si/O]=-0.63, which is lower than that of stars in the Milky Way disc and lower than expected by chemical evolution models, suggesting silicon depletion onto dust grains. Likewise, this Si/O value is lower than that we newly derive for two individual z&gt;6 galaxies (GN-z11 and RXCJ2248) with negligible dust attenuation. By performing spectral stacking in bins of M_*, SFR, specific SFR (sSFR), and ultra-violet (UV) continuum slope &beta;_UV, we identify [FeIII] line detections in the high-sSFR bin and the blue-&beta;_UV bin, both of which exhibit supersolar Fe/O ratios, while their C/O, Ar/O, and Si/O ratios are comparable to those of the all-sources stack. Our findings support a chemically young gas composition with rapid dust depletion in the general population of high-z star-forming galaxies, while raising the possibility of anomalous, selective Fe/O enhancement at the very early epoch of star formation.

We present a multiwavelength catalog of mid-infrared-selected compact sources in 19 nearby galaxies, combining JWST NIRCam/MIRI, HST UV-optical broadband, H&alpha; narrow-band, and ALMA CO observations. We detect 24,945 compact sources at 21 &mu;m and 55,581 at 10 &mu;m. Artificial star tests show 50% completeness limits of ~5 &mu;Jy for the 10 &mu;m catalog, and ~24 &mu;Jy for the 21 &mu;m catalog. We find that 21 &mu;m compact sources contribute ~20% of the total galaxy emission in that band, but only contribute 5% at 10 &mu;m. We classify sources using stellar evolution and population synthesis models combined with empirical classifications derived from the literature. Our classifications include H&alpha;-bright and dust-embedded optically faint clusters, red supergiants (RSGs), oxygen-rich and carbon-rich AGB stars, and a range of rarer stellar types. In sampling a broad range of star forming environments with a uniform, well-characterized selection, this catalog enables enables analyses of infrared-bright stellar populations. We find that H&alpha;-faint sources account for only 10% of dusty (likely young) clusters, implying that the infrared-bright, optically-faint phase of cluster evolution is short compared to the H&alpha;-bright stage. The luminosity functions of 10 and 21 &mu;m sources follow power-law distributions, with the 21 &mu;m slope (-1.7 ± 0.1) similar to that of giant molecular cloud mass functions and ultraviolet bright star-forming complexes, while the 10 &mu;m slope (-2.0 ± 0.1) is closer to that of young stellar clusters.

### 110) [2509.16154](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16154v1): Lensed stars in galaxy-galaxy strong lensing &ndash; a JWST prediction for the Cosmic Horseshoe

<p>
We explore for the first time the possibility of detecting lensed star transients in galaxy-galaxy strong lensing systems upon repeated, deep imaging using the  James-Webb Space Telescope ( JWST). Our calculation predicts that the extremely high recent star formation rate of ~ 100 M<sub>&odot;</sub>rmyr^-1 over the last 50 Myr (not accounting for image multiplicity) in the "Cosmic Horseshoe'' lensed system (z = 2.381) generates many young, bright stars, of which their large abundance is expected to lead to a detection rate of ~ 60 transients per pointing in  JWST observations with a 5&sigma; limiting magnitude of ~ 29 m_AB. With the high expected detection rate and little room for uncertainty for the lens model compared with cluster lenses, our result suggests that the Cosmic Horseshoe could be an excellent tool to test the nature of Dark Matter based on the spatial distribution of transients, and can be used to constrain axion mass if Dark Matter is constituted of ultra-light axions. We also argue that the large distance modulus of ~46.5 mag at z ≈ 2.4 can act as a filter to screen out less massive stars as transients and allow one to better constrain the high-mass end of the stellar initial mass function based on the transient detection rate. Follow-up  JWST observations of the Cosmic Horseshoe with would allow one to better probe the nature of Dark Matter and the star formation properties, such as the initial mass function at the cosmic noon, via lensed star transients.

### 111) [2509.16138](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16138v2): Two-phase formation of galaxies: the coevolution between galaxies and dark matter halos

<p> Qinglin Ma, Yangyao Chen, Houjun Mo </p>
<p>
We use FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the co-evolution between Milky Way-size galaxies and their host dark matter halos. We find that the formation of these galaxies follows a two-phase pattern, with an early phase featured by hot dynamics, bulge-dominated structure and bursty star formation, and a later phase featured by cold dynamics, disk-dominated structure and steady star formation. The transition times of these galaxy properties are tightly correlated with the time when the host halo transits from fast to slow accretion, suggesting that the two-phase assembly of halos drive the two-phase formation of galaxies. The physical origin of dynamical hotness can be summarized into two modes of star formation: a scattered mode in which stars form at large radii within cold gas streams associated with fast assembly of halos, and a concentrated mode in which stars form at small radii through violent fragmentation from globally self-gravitated gas when halo assembly is about to slow down. Cold gaseous and stellar disks can form only when the conditions of the two modes are removed by the stall of halo assembly and the reduction of gas by feedback processes. The two modes of star formation leave distinct imprints on the structural properties of high-redshift galaxies, providing implications to be tested by JWST and future observations.

<p>
We present new ALMA [OIII]_88 observations of eight previously [CII]_158-detected galaxies at 6.8 ≲ z ≲ 7.7. Six of our targets &ndash; the primary sample &ndash; are massive, UV-luminous galaxies drawn from the REBELS survey, while the remaining two are UV-fainter galaxies that were previously serendipitously detected through their luminous [CII] lines in the REBELS fields. We detect [OIII]_88 emission in all eight galaxies at 6.2 - 17.7&sigma; significance, and find them to be consistent with the local dwarf galaxy relation between L_[OIII] and star formation rate. Our sample spans [OIII]/[CII] ≈ 1.9 - 9.6, which is typical for the high-redshift galaxy population. Five of the primary targets benefit from JWST/NIRSpec observations, enabling a direct comparison of the [OIII]/[CII] ratio against rest-optical ISM diagnostics. We supplement our high-redshift sample with eleven z≈6-14 galaxies in the literature for which similar ALMA and JWST observations are available, and furthermore compare to the [OIII]/[CII] ratios measured for local dwarf galaxies. We find that, at fixed metallicity and ionization parameter, z&gt;6 galaxies show elevated [OIII]/[CII] ratios compared to local dwarfs. Instead, we find that a large [OIII]_4959,5007+H&beta; equivalent width &ndash; a proxy for burstiness &ndash; is the main driver of the high [OIII]/[CII] ratios seen in the early Universe, which is primarily due to [CII] being suppressed in bursty galaxies. Given the apparent validity of the [OIII]_88-SFR relation across most of cosmic time, as well as the abundance of young, bursty galaxies at high redshift, [OIII]_88 is set to remain a powerful ISM tracer at the cosmic dawn.

<p>
Understanding the co-evolution of galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) requires accurate modeling of dust-obscured systems. Recent surveys using the Mid Infrared Instrument (MIRI) onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered a large population of dust obscured AGN, challenging current theoretical frameworks. We present an updated version of the Simulated Infrared Extragalactic Dusty Sky (SIDES) simulation framework. Our updates include modified star-forming and starburst galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) templates as well as quiescent and AGN templates. We also incorporate a probabilistic assignment of the fraction of the IR emission that is due to an AGN. Our simulations successfully reproduce the observed MIRI source number counts, redshift distributions, and AGN population fractions. We find that AGN dominate at bright flux densities (S_&nu; ≳ 20  &mu; Jy while main sequence galaxies dominate at the faint end. We also quantify the effects of cosmic variance, showing that surveys with areas below 25  arcmin<sup>2</sup> suffer from ~ 30 &percnt; uncertainty in bright AGN counts. Finally, we provide diagnostic color-color diagrams and joint Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and MIRI flux distributions to aid interpretation of current and upcoming JWST surveys.

Planetary nebulae are sites where ejected stellar material evolves into complex molecules, but the precise physical conditions and chemical routes that govern these processes are unclear. The presence of abundant carbon-rich molecules in O-rich environments poses particular challenges. Here we report the first detection of methyl cation (CH3+) in any planetary nebula, observed in the O-rich nebula NGC 6302 using JWST MIRI/MRS observations. CH3+ is a key driver of organic chemistry in UV-irradiated environments. Spatially resolved observations reveal that CH3+ is co-located with 12CO, H2, H II, HCO+, and Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). LTE modelling of the CH3+ emission yields excitation temperatures of 500-800K in the inner bubble and torus, rising to 1000-2000K in the outer bubble of NGC 6302, with column densities ranging from ~10^11 to 10^13 cm<sup>2</sup>. This detection demonstrates that hydrocarbon radical chemistry must be incorporated into planetary nebulae chemical models. Further near-IR observations are crucial to map different chemical networks operating in these environments.

### 115) [2509.14473](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14473v1): JWST Photometry of Globular Cluster Populations in MACS0417.5-1154

<p>
Deep JWST imaging of the massive galaxy cluster MACS0417.5-1154, at redshift z=0.443, reveals a huge population of globular clusters (GCs) and Ultra-Compact Dwarfs (UCDs) primarily distributed around its single central giant galaxy (BCG). We present NIRCam/SWC photometry of the GC system in four bands (F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W). The spatial distribution of the system matches well in radial and ellipticity profile with the high elongation (b/a = 0.5) of the BCG halo light. The total GC population within MACS0417 is estimated to be near 1.5 x 10^5, similar to the systems in Abell 2744, Coma, and other galaxy clusters with comparable masses. With similar results for GC photometry in hand from other lensing clusters at a range of redshifts, it is now possible to trace on purely observational grounds the luminosity evolution of GC systems over many Gigayears of lookback time, as seen through their color-magnitude diagrams. We show this sequence for five systems reaching to lookback times of more than 7 Gyr. A systematic change in the GC/UCD sequence with lookback time is clearly visible, near what is expected for age-fading of a simple stellar population with time. Lastly, we evaluate the effectiveness of the various JWST NIRCam filters for broadband photometry of GC systems as a function of redshift, as an aid to planning further studies.

### 116) [2509.14328](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14328v1): Cosmic-ray impact on optical and mid-infrared emission line diagnostics in NGC 5728

<p> E. Koutsoumpou, J. A. Fernández-Ontiveros, K. M. Dasyra, L. Spinoglio </p>
<p>
Cosmic rays (CRs), from active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets and supernovae (SNe), serve as a significant feedback mechanism influencing emission lines in narrow line region (NLR) clouds. These highly energetic particles, propelled by shocks, heat the interstellar medium (ISM) and modify its chemical composition. This study investigates the role of CRs, particularly in their ability to excite gas and align with observed line ratios across UV and optical diagnostics. We employ CLOUDY to explore CR ionization rate, ionization parameter, and initial hydrogen density effects on optical and mid-infrared (MIR) emission. Our analysis includes high-quality optical data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) for NGC 5728, supplemented by infrared observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Our previous results indicate that CRs are instrumental in heating the inner regions of gas clouds, enhancing emission of low-ionization optical lines. Mid-infrared data reveal that emission lines like [Ar II] and [Ne II] within the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) field of view are sensitive to CRs. In contrast, high-ionization lines (for example, [Ne V]) serve as robust tracers of photoionization insensitive to CRs. Moreover, mixed optical and MIR diagnostics offer insight into the relative roles of CRs and shocks, which often produce similar signatures in emission lines. We find that while both mechanisms can elevate certain line ratios, their influence on MIR diagnostics diverges: shocks and CRs affect low-ionization lines differently, allowing for a better understanding when multi-wavelength data are available. Our approach not only helps to resolve the degeneracy between metallicity and CR ionization but also enables the potential differentiation of shocks and CR-driven processes in AGN.

With the rise of the integral field spectroscopy, we are currently dealing with large amounts of spatially resolved data, whose analysis has become challenging, especially when observing complex objects such as nearby galaxies. We aim to develop a method to automatically separate different physical regions within the central parts (1"~160 pc, on average) of galaxies. This can allow us to better understand the systems, and provide an initial characterisation of the main ionisation sources affecting its evolution. We have developed an unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithm to analyse data cubes based on spectral similarity. It clusters together spaxels with similar spectra, which is useful to disentangle between different physical processes. We have applied this method to a sample of 15 nearby (distances &lt;100 Mpc) galaxies, 7 from the Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS) and 8 archival sources, all observed with the medium resolution spectrometer (MRS) of the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on board of the JWST. From the clusters, we computed their median spectrum and measured the line and continuum properties. We used these measurements to train random forest models and create several empirical mid-IR diagnostic diagrams for the MRS channel 3 wavelength range, including among others the bright [Ne II], [Ne III], and [Ne V] lines, several H2 transitions, and PAH features. The clustering technique allows to differentiate emission coming from an AGN, the disc, and star forming regions in galaxies, and other composite regions, potentially ionised by several sources simultaneously. This is supported by the results from the empirical diagnostic diagrams, that are indeed able to separate physically distinct regions. This innovative method serves as a tool to identify regions of interest in any data cube prior to an in-depth analysis of the sources. [abridged]

### 118) [2509.13845](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13845v1): Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons destruction in star-forming regions across 42 nearby galaxies

<p>
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widespread in the interstellar medium (ISM) of Solar metallicity galaxies, where they play a critical role in ISM heating, cooling, and reprocessing stellar radiation. The PAH fraction, the abundance of PAHs relative to total dust mass, is a key parameter in ISM physics. Using JWST and MUSE observations of 42 galaxies from the PHANGS survey, we analyze the PAH fraction in over 17 000 H II regions spanning a gas-phase oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H) = 8.0-8.8 (Z ~ 0.2-1.3 Zsun), and ~400 isolated supernova remnants (SNRs). We find a significantly lower PAH fraction toward H II regions compared to a reference sample of diffuse ISM areas at matched metallicity. At 12+log(O/H) &gt; 8.2, the PAH fraction toward H II regions is strongly anti-correlated with the local ionization parameter, suggesting that PAH destruction is correlated with ionized gas and/or hydrogen-ionizing UV radiation. At lower metallicities, the PAH fraction declines steeply in both H II regions and the diffuse ISM, likely reflecting less efficient PAH formation in metal-poor environments. Carefully isolating dust emission from the vicinity of optically-identified supernova remnants, we see evidence for selective PAH destruction from measurements of lower PAH fractions, which is, however, indistinguishable at ~50 pc scales. Overall, our results point to ionizing radiation as the dominant agent of PAH destruction within H II regions, with metallicity playing a key role in their global abundance in galaxies.

### 119) [2509.13315](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13315v1): First detection of ices in intermediate-mass young stellar objects beyond the Milky Way

Jones, Katja Fahrion, Alec S. Hirschauer, Charles D. Keyes, David R. Soderblom, Laura Lenkic, Omnarayani Nayak, Bernhard Brandl </p>
<p>
Using NIRSpec on JWST, we studied a sample of 15 intermediate-mass (1.8-4.1 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) young stellar objects (YSOs) previously identified with MIRI photometry in the low-metallicity NGC 346 star-forming cluster in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). All objects, observed in the 1.7-5.3 micron range, show strong hydrogen recombination lines in the Paschen, Brackett, Pfund, and Humphreys series, confirming their very young ages. The spectra of 11 YSOs show prominent absorption bands from the three most important ice species (H2O, CO2, CO), marking the first detection of these ices in intermediate-mass YSOs beyond our Galaxy. In three YSOs, water ice appears to be in crystalline form. In some objects, we also detect 13CO2 and OCS ices &ndash; never before observed beyond the Milky Way (MW) &ndash; and methanol ice in at least one star. We compared the column densities of H2O, CO2, and CO ices with those measured in more and less massive protostars in the MW and Large Magellanic Cloud, finding that in NGC 346 ice column densities reach values nearly an order of magnitude lower than in more massive objects (~1x10^17 cm-2 for water and ~1x10^16 cm-2 for CO2 and CO). However, the relative proportions of the ice species abundances do not differ from those in massive MW YSOs. This suggests that metallicity may not significantly affect ice chemistry in protoplanetary discs and that, shielded by the protostellar envelope or deep in the midplane, circumstellar material is likely impervious to the radiation environment.

### 120) [2509.12325](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12325v1): Constraints on the early growth of massive black holes from PTA and JWST with L-GalaxiesBH

<p> Silvia Bonoli, David Izquierdo-Villalba, Daniele Spinoso, Monica Colpi, Alberto Sesana, Markos Polkas, Volker Springel </p>
<p>
Recent Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) results provided strong evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (sGWB), consistent with a population of merging massive black holes (MBHs) at z&lt;1. Meanwhile, JWST observations at z&gt;5 suggest a higher number density of accreting MBHs than previously estimated. Together with constraints from local MBHs and high-z quasars, these findings offer a unique opportunity to test MBH seeding and early growth models. We explore this using \tt L-GalaxiesitBH, a new extension of the galaxy formation model \tt L-Galaxies, developed to explicitly model all stages of MBH evolution, including seeding, accretion, and binary dynamics. To take advantage of both the high resolution of the \tt MillenniumII and the large volume of the \tt Millennium simulations, we run \tt L-GalaxiesitBH on the former and use its outputs as initial conditions for the latter, via our itgrafting method. We find that reproducing the number density of high-z active MBHs observed by JWST requires either a heavy seed formation rate significantly higher than that predicted by current models (≳ 0.01 Mpc^-3 at z ~ 10), or widespread formation of light seeds undergoing multiple phases of super-Eddington accretion. Furthermore, matching the amplitude of the PTA sGWB signal requires nearly all galaxies with stellar masses M_*&gt; 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> to host central MBHs by z~0. Given the extreme heavy seed densities required to satisfy both PTA and JWST constraints, our results favor a scenario in which MBHs originate from light seeds that grow rapidly and efficiently in the early universe. This work demonstrates the power of combining multi-messenger data with physical models to probe the origins and evolution of MBHs across cosmic time.

Wang </p>
<p>
MACS J0138-2155 is the only known cluster to strongly lens two supernovae (SNe), Requiem and Encore, from the same host galaxy at z=1.949. We present seven independent mass models of the galaxy cluster built using six software packages. By conducting a blind analysis (no exchanges of results between modeling teams), we quantified uncertainties due to modeling and software. Through HST, JWST and MUSE observations, we assembled high-quality data products, including eight "gold" lensed image systems consisting of 23 images with secure spectroscopic redshifts, and one "silver" system with a likely redshift value. Restricting to the gold images, we obtain overall consistent model predictions of the positions, magnifications and time delays of SN Encore and SN Requiem images, especially for models with &chi;<sup>2</sup> ≤ 25. We predict the appearance of the next images of SNe Encore and Requiem with a time delay of &gt;~3000 days and of ~3700 to 4000 days, respectively, based on a fiducial cosmological model of H_0 = 70  km s<sup>-1</sup> Mpc^-1 and &Omega;_m = 0.3. We obtain relations between H_0 and the time delays of SNe Encore and Requiem. In particular, for H_0 = 73  km s<sup>-1</sup> Mpc^-1, the four lowest &chi;<sup>2</sup> models predict SN Requiem to reappear in ~Apr-Dec 2026; for H_0 = 67  km s<sup>-1</sup> Mpc^-1, in ~Mar-Nov 2027. Using the newly measured time delay between the two detected images of SN Encore by Pierel et al. (submitted) and our mass models, we jointly infer H_0 = 66.9^+11.2_-8.1 km s<sup>-1</sup> Mpc^-1, where the uncertainty is dominated by that of the time delay. The long delays of the next-appearing SN Requiem and SN Encore images provide excellent opportunities to measure H_0 with an uncertainty of 2-3%. Our mass models form the basis for cosmological inference from this unique lens cluster with two strongly lensed SNe. (Abridged)

<p>
Spatially resolved stellar populations of massive, quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon provide powerful insights into star-formation quenching and stellar mass assembly mechanisms. Previous photometric work has revealed that the cores of these galaxies are redder than their outskirts. However, spectroscopy is needed to break the age-metallicity degeneracy and uncover the driver of these colour gradients. Here, we derive age and elemental abundance gradients for 8 distant (1.2 ≲ z ≲ 2.2), massive (10.3≲log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≲ 11.1), quiescent galaxies, by fitting full-spectrum models to ultra-deep NIRSpec-MSA spectroscopy from the JWST-SUSPENSE survey. We find that these galaxies have negative age, positive [Mg/H] and [Mg/Fe], and flat [Fe/H] gradients, implying that galaxy cores are older and Mg-deficient compared to galaxy outskirts. The age gradients indicate inside-out quenching, while the Mg-deficient cores suggest rapid gas expulsion as the central quenching mechanism. Thus, galaxy cores formed faster and quenched more efficiently than their outskirts. In this scenario, however, our [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] gradients are still puzzling. Our results contrast lower-redshift studies, which find flat age and [Mg/Fe] gradients and negative metallicity gradients. Additionally, we find a positive trend between age gradients and rotational support, and marginal trends between gradients and galaxy velocity dispersions and ages. We discuss our findings in the context of galaxy growth scenarios, including minor mergers and progenitor bias, and the possible occurrence of different quenching mechanisms across redshift. With this work, we present the first stellar population gradients from NIRSpec-MSA spectroscopy, in the largest current sample of distant, quiescent galaxies.

<p>
Multiply-imaged supernovae (SNe) provide a novel means of constraining the Hubble constant (H_0). Such measurements require a combination of precise models of the lensing mass distribution and an accurate estimate of the relative time delays between arrival of the multiple images. Only two multiply-imaged SNe, Refsdal and H0pe, have enabled measurements of H_0 thus far. Here we detail the third such measurement for SN Encore, a z=1.95 SNIa discovered in JWST/NIRCam imaging. We measure the time delay, perform simulations of additional microlensing and millilensing systematics, and combine with the mass models of Suyu et al. in a double-blind analysis to obtain our H_0 constraint. Our final time-delay measurement is &Delta; t_1b,1a=-39.8_-3.3^+3.9 days, which is combined with seven lens models weighted by the likelihood of the observed multiple image positions for a result of H_0=66.9_-8.1^+11.2 km s<sup>-1</sup> Mpc^-1. The uncertainty on this measurement could be improved significantly if template imaging is obtained. Remarkably, a sibling to SN Encore (SN "Requiem") was discovered in the same host galaxy, making the MACS J0138.0-2155 cluster the first system known to produce more than one observed multiply-imaged SN. SN Requiem has a fourth image that is expected to appear within a few years, providing an unprecedented decade-long baseline for time-delay cosmography and an opportunity for a high-precision joint estimate of H_0.

### 124) [2509.12306](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12306v1): Off-center black hole seed formation? Implications for high and low redshift massive black holes

<p> David Izquierdo-Villalba, Daniele Spinoso, Marta Volonteri, Monica Colpi, Alberto Sesana, Silvia Bonoli </p>
<p>
Recent studies show that light seeds of black holes, which grow into massive black holes (MBHs) over time, often struggle to remain at the centers of their birthplaces in high-redshift galaxies, limiting their ability to accrete gas and merge with other black holes. In this work, we investigate how off-center formation of the first seeds affects the evolution of the MBH and massive black hole binary (MBHB) populations over cosmic history. To this end, we use the ttL-Galaxies  BH semi-analytical model, which includes multiple seed formation mechanisms, with light Population III remnants being the most significant contributors. To incorporate off-center formation, we modify the model to track the initial seed location, the sinking timescales toward the galactic center, and any growth during this phase. The results indicate that seed formation occurring away from the galactic center has a negligible impact on the MBH population at z&lt;1, but causes significant differences at higher redshifts. Particularly, the abundance of 10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> MBHs at z&gt;4 can be up to 2-10 times smaller compared to a nuclear seed formation model. Quasar luminosity functions with L_bol&gt;10^44 erg/s are similarly affected, although they still align with observational constraints. The off-centre formation also alters the galaxy-MBH mass relation. At z&gt;5, the amplitude of the relation can be up to 2 dex smaller than in nuclear seed models. These differences fade by z ~ 2 for galaxies &gt;10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, and by z=0 for smaller galaxies. Notably, the overmassive MBH population recently unveiled by JWST is still present in the model, suggesting they can form independently of the seed dynamics. Finally, the merging rate of MBHs within LISA sensitivity band is strongly impacted. Specifically, there is a suppression of events at high-z and an enhancement at low-z.

### 125) [2509.12308](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12308v1): Death by Impact: Evidence for Merger-Driven Quenching in a Collisional Ring Galaxy at Cosmic Noon

<p> Amir H. Khoram, Sirio Belli, Carlo Nipoti, Raffaele Pascale, Andrew B. Newman, Federico Marinacci, Richard S. Ellis, Letizia Bugiani, Matteo Sapori, Eric Giunchi </p>
<p>
The role of interactions and mergers in the rapid quenching of massive galaxies in the early Universe remains uncertain, largely due to the difficulty of directly linking mergers to quenching. Collisional ring galaxies provide a unique opportunity, as their morphology allows precise dating of the interaction, which can then be compared to quenching timescales inferred from star formation histories. We study a gravitationally bound system at z=1.61 in the UDS field, composed of a Host galaxy (M<sub>&sext;</sub> = 10^11.4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) with a collisional ring and an X-ray AGN, and the Bullet galaxy (M<sub>&sext;</sub> = 10^11.2 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), located at a projected distance of ~ 8 kpc. Combining JWST and HST imaging with Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy, we find compelling evidence for an ongoing starburst in the Host concurrent with rapid quenching in the Bullet. The ring, ~ 20 kpc in diameter, is expanding at 127^+72_-29 km s<sup>-1</sup>, implying the galaxies first collided 47&ndash;96 Myr ago. This timeline is consistent with the Host's current starburst and the Bullet's sudden quenching, strongly suggesting both phenomena were triggered by the interaction. Crucially, the Bullet shows no evidence of a preceding starburst, ruling out rapid gas consumption as the primary quenching channel. Instead, we suggest that merger-driven processes &ndash; such as enhanced turbulence and disk instabilities &ndash; may have suppressed star formation. An additional possibility, which we term the "Dragon Effect,'' is that AGN-driven outflows from the Host disrupted the Bullet's low-density molecular gas, thereby preventing efficient star formation and accelerating quenching.

### 126) [2509.12177](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12177v1): A New Population of Point-like, Narrow-line Objects Revealed by the James Webb Space Telescope

<p> Haojing Yan, Bangzheng Sun, Riley Shive </p>
<p>
We report a new population of objects discovered using the data from the James Webb Space Telescope, which are characterized by their point-like morphology and narrow permitted emission lines. Our sample includes nine objects found in three JWST wide survey fields, which have z=3.624 to 5.378 and M_B ~ -18.3 to -21.4 mag. Their light distributions follow gaussian profiles, with the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) values only 3.7%&ndash;34.6% larger than those of the point spread functions. Their sharpest FWHM sizes correspond to only 0.49 to 0.96 kpc. They have very strong [O III] and Halpha lines (median rest-frame equivalent widths of 1610.6 and 1374.0 A, respectively), and the line widths of the latter are only 150&ndash;360 km/s. Due to the limitation of the current data, the exact nature of this new population is still uncertain. The emission line diagnostics shows that at least one object is consistent with being AGN. On the other hand, the spectral energy distributions of most of the nine objects can be fitted reasonably by normal galaxy templates, which suggest that they could also be very young (median age of 120 Myrs), star-forming (median star formation rate of 1.8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr) galaxies in the early formation stage (having acquired a median stellar mass of only 10^8.4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>). If they are indeed star-forming galaxies, their gas-phase metallicities range from 12+log(O/H) = 7.8 to 8.3. It will be critical to understand this population by deeper medium-resolution spectroscopy in the future. If they are AGNs, they constitute a new kind of type 2 AGNs that are low-luminosity and almost "hostless". If they are star-forming galaxies, they also constitute a new kind whose early formation is likely a secular process starting from a very compact core, which is in line with the picture of a monolithic collapse.

<p>
We characterize two candidate cool galactic outflows in two relatively low mass, highly inclined Virgo cluster galaxies: NGC4424 and NGC4694. Previous analyses of observations using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) carbon monoxide (CO) line emission maps did not classify these sources as cool outflow hosts. Using new high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, JWST mid-infrared photometry in the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-tracing F770W band, we identify extended structures present off of the stellar disk. The identified structures are bright in the MIRI F770W and F2100W bands, suggesting they include PAHs as well as other dust grains. As PAHs have been shown to be destroyed in hot, ionized gas, these structures are likely to be outflows of cool (T≤ 10^4K) gas. This work represents an exciting possibility for using mid infrared observations to identify and measure outflows in lower mass, lower star formation galaxies.

### 128) [2509.11771](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11771v1): JWST's first view of the most vigorously star-forming cloud in the Galactic center &ndash; Sagittarius B2

<p>
We report JWST NIRCAM and MIRI observations of Sgr B2, the most active site of star formation in the Galaxy. These observations, using 14 filters spanning 1.5 to 25 microns, have revealed a multilayered and highly structured cloud that contains both a revealed, low-extinction and hidden, high-extinction population of massive stars. JWST has detected new candidate HII regions around massive stars previously missed by radio telescopes. MIRI has detected radiation escaping from the forming massive cluster Sgr B2 N along its outflow cavities, demonstrating that infrared radiation finds geometric escape routes even in the densest, most heavily embedded regions in the universe. JWST further highlights the gas asymmetry in the cloud, showing a sharp, straight cutoff along the eastern cloud edge. Despite the great sensitivity of these observations, no extended population of YSOs has been detected, placing a limit on their minimum extinction; this result hints that star formation has only just begun in the cloud. Together, these results suggest that, despite already holding the crown for most actively star-forming cloud, we have underestimated the total star formation in Sgr B2. JWST unveils previously hidden massive stars and ionized structures, offering a transformative view of how stars form under some of the most extreme Galactic conditions.

<p> Somnath Dutta </p>
<p>
The combination of ALMA submillimeter and JWST/MIRI mid-infrared observations offers a transformative view of protostellar jets and outflows by probing cold and warm gas components across diverse physical conditions. We present a detailed comparison of gas distribution in these regimes for the jet/outflow system associated with G205.46-14.56S3 (HOPS 315), focusing on the inner ~800 AU along the jet. ALMA CO and SiO trace both lobes of the bipolar jet, revealing high-velocity collimated jets and wider outflow components. JWST/MIRI detects mainly the blueshifted lobe; the redshifted side is likely obscured by strong mid-infrared extinction. Shorter-wavelength MIRI H<sub>2</sub> rotational lines (S(7)-S(4)) trace compact jet structures resembling SiO emission, while longer-wavelength lines (S(3)-S(1)) reveal more extended emission akin to low-velocity CO. From H<sub>2</sub> rotational emission, we identify two molecular gas temperature components: warm (~ 773 ± 44 K) and hot (~ 2499±720 K). Using the ortho-to-para ratio, we estimate visual extinction A_V ≈ 23.3 ± 2.5 mag. JWST/MIRI emission imply a jet mass-loss rate of M&#775;_J, blue, jwst ≈ (0.27 ± 0.1) × 10^-6M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1. The combination of ALMA and JWST reveals stratified layers within the outflow and jet, as well as shock structures, providing a comprehensive view of their physical conditions. This multiwavelength study demonstrates that combining submillimeter observations from ALMA with infrared data from JWST is crucial for uncovering the full physical and chemical structure of protostellar jets and outflows.

<p> Joel Kastner, Paula Moraga Baez, Bruce Balick, Rodolfo Montez Jr., Caroline Gieser, Mikako Matsuura, Jason Nordhaus, Miguel Santander-Garcia </p>
<p>
We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) near-infrared (NIRCam) Br&alpha;, H<sub>2</sub>, [Fe II], and PAH imaging of the molecule-rich, high-excitation bipolar planetary nebula (PN) NGC 6537 (the Red Spider), complemented by new ALMA and Chandra observations and archival HST images. The resulting multiwavelength view of the Red Spider establishes the detailed lobe/torus structure of the nebula and the mass-loss history of its progenitor star. The extinction-penetrating JWST/NIRCam Br&alpha; and PAH and ALMA 3 mm continuum imaging exposes the complexity of the ionized inner nebula. JWST/NIRCam H<sub>2</sub> imaging traces the full, ~1.1 pc extent of the bubble-like lobes formed by fast (~300-400 km s<sup>-1</sup>) polar outflows, while ALMA ^13CO(1-0) mapping reveals a point-symmetric, slowly (~10 km s<sup>-1</sup>) expanding equatorial torus of radius ~0.13 pc. In striking contrast, the [Fe II] image displays an extended S-shaped emission morphology that traces collisions between an active, collimated wind and slower-moving material along the lobe rims. No X-rays are detected from the nebula or its central star in deep Chandra/HRC-I imaging. However, the combined HST and JWST imaging reveals a near-IR excess at the central star indicative of emission from hot (~1000 K) circumstellar dust. We propose that interactions between the nebular progenitor star and a close companion are responsible for the ejection of NGC 6537's molecular torus, the formation of a circumbinary dust disk, and the launching of fast, wandering, collimated outflows that have inflated the polar lobe bubbles traced by near-IR H<sub>2</sub> emission and are presently generating the [Fe II]-emitting shocks.

### 131) [2509.10901](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10901v1): Mitigating Random-Phase Sampling Noise in the Cepheid Period-Luminosity Relation: A Cross-Filter Consistency Approach

<p> Mahdi Abdollahi, Atefeh Javadi, Barry F. Madore, Wendy L. Freedman, Hamidreza Mahani </p>
<p>
The Period-Luminosity (PL) relation is usually derived using time-averaged magnitudes, which require multiple-epoch observations to determine periods and adequately sample the light curves. Although single-epoch observations are more practical and require significantly less observational effort, they inherently introduce greater photometric scatter, leading to an increased dispersion in the derived Period-Luminosity relations. In this paper, we explore, in detail, a method that transforms single random-phase data to their mean-light values, using information obtained in other bands for the same Cepheid. This approach enables the accurate re-construction of mean-light PL relations for wavelengths observed with space-based facilities, for instance, where the number of epochs per star makes simple averaging or template fitting less than optimal, with the latter requiring very high-precision periods for predictive phasing. While applying this technique across multiple bands, from optical to mid-IR, we focus particularly on widely separated bands covering the mid-IR to the optical. We showcase this method using the J band (as being observed by JWST) as the random-phase component. Our results show that this correction reduces the scatter of the PL relation in the J band by a factor of approximately 0.7×, equivalent to increasing the number of random-phase observations by a factor of 10, needed to obtain the same increase in precision as delivered here.

### 132) [2509.10856](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10856v1): Evidence of Galactic Center Expansion from Gaia DR3 Stars along the South North Axis: Implications for the JWST Early Galaxy Problem

<p> G. S. Karapetian, L. E. Byzalov, M. A. Hovhannisyan, L. A. Mahtessian, A. P. Mahtessian </p>
<p>
Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed massive, evolved galaxies only a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, challenging standard cosmological models. To test the hypothesis that the Galactic nucleus may act as a source of matter and energy capable of accelerating galaxy formation, we examined whether the Milky Way itself shows signs of central activity. Expansion of the Galactic center would imply such activity in its nuclear region. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed stellar motions along the south north axis of the Galaxy using Gaia DR3 data. Average Galactocentric radial velocities were computed in 50 control points, spaced by 0.1 kpc with a sampling radius of 0.05 kpc, up to 5 kpc from the Galactic center. The results show a strong symmetry: in the northern region, 36 of 50 points have positive velocities, with an average of 19.15 +/- 10.80 km/s (N = 50), while in the southern region, 37 of 50 points have negative velocities, with an average of - 19.24 +/- 8.22 km/s (N = 50). A Students t test confirms that the two distributions differ significantly (0.003). The combination of positive average velocities in the north and negative average velocities in the south indicates a symmetric outflow of stars away from the Galactic center, consistent with expansion in its central region. These Galactocentric radial velocities are consistent with the formation of massive, evolved galaxies within 300 My, as observed by JWST. If extended to other galaxies, the results (together with earlier findings on globular cluster motions) suggest that aspects of standard galaxy formation models may require refinement. This interpretation, however, remains preliminary and requires further study.

### 133) [2509.10836](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10836v1): Measuring neutrino masses with joint JWST and DESI DR2 data

<p> Sheng-Han Zhou, Tian-Nuo Li, Guo-Hong Du, Jun-Qian Jiang, Jing-Fei Zhang, Xin Zhang </p>
<p>
Early JWST observations reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of high-redshift candidate massive galaxies at z ≳ 7, and recent DESI measurements show a preference for dynamical dark energy, which together present a significant challenge to the standard &Lambda;CDM cosmology. In this work, we jointly analyze high-redshift galaxy data from JWST, baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI DR2, and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and ACT, measuring the total neutrino mass \sum m_&nu;. We consider three dark energy models (&Lambda;CDM, wCDM, and w_0w_aCDM) and three mass hierarchies. Our results indicate that in the w_0w_aCDM model, adding JWST data to CMB+DESI tightens the upper limit of \sum m_&nu; by about 5.8&percnt;-10.2&percnt;, and we obtain \sum m_&nu; &lt; 0.167~eV (2&sigma;) in the normal hierarchy (NH) case. Furthermore, JWST also offers indicative lower limits on star formation efficiency parameter of f_*,10 ≳ 0.146-0.161. Bayesian evidence weakly favors the w_0w_aCDM+\sum m_&nu;(NH) model relative to the &Lambda;CDM+\sum m_&nu;(NH) model using CMB+DESI+JWST data. These results suggest that the joint analysis of high-redshift JWST data and low-redshift DESI data provides compelling constraints on neutrino mass and merits further investigation.

<p>
Recent results from the James Webb Space Telescope show that nearby spiral galaxies are dominated by the presence of H I and H II bubbles that strongly shape their surrounding medium. These bubbles result from the feedback of high-mass stars at different stages of their life cycle. However, early (pre-supernova) feedback from high-mass stars is still poorly quantified. Recent results from numerical simulations suggest that the impact of high-mass star early feedback (photoionization, wind) on star formation properties is complex, time-dependent, and strongly depends on physical conditions, including the magnetic field properties. In our Galaxy, ionized (H II) regions observed in different evolution stages show a high diversity of star formation in their associated photo-dissociation regions (PDRs). However, the way in which the low- to high-density interstellar medium evolves to this situation remains elusive. Quantifying the impact of early feedback from high-mass stars on star formation properties and star formation laws (star formation rate, star formation efficiency versus gas surface density, &Sigma;gas) will allow for a better understanding of the evolution of star formation laws in external galaxies, the laws that are key ingredients of galaxy evolution models. PRIMA, with its high sensitivity, large mapping efficiency, and polarimetric capabilities, offers a unique opportunity to address the way radiative feedback and magnetic field control star formation in the Milky Way.

### 135) [2509.10256](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10256v1): UV-irradiated outflows from low-mass protostars in Ophiuchus with JWST/MIRI

<p>
The main accretion phase of protostars is characterized by the ejection of material in the form of jets/outflows. External UV irradiation can potentially have a significant impact on the excitation conditions within these outflows. High-resolution observations in the mid-infrared allow us to investigate the details of those energetic processes through the emission of shock-excited H<sub>2</sub> . Our aim is to spatially resolve H<sub>2</sub> and ionic/atomic emission within the outflows of low-mass protostars, and investigate its origin in connection to shocks influenced by external ultraviolet irradiation. We analyze spectral maps of 5 Class I protostars in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI/MRS). Four out of five protostars show strong H<sub>2</sub>, [\ionNe II], and [\ionFe II] emission associated with outflows/jets. Pure rotational H<sub>2</sub> transitions from S(1) to S(8) are found and show two distinct temperature components on Boltzmann diagrams with rotational temperatures of ~500-600 K and ~1000-3000 K respectively. Both C-type shocks propagating at high pre-shock densities (n_H ≥10^4 cm^-3) and J-type shocks at low pre-shock densities (n_H ≤10^3 cm^-3) reproduce the observed line ratios. However, only C-type shocks produce sufficiently high column densities of H<sub>2</sub>, whereas predictions from a single J-type shock reproduce the observed rotational temperatures of the gas better. A combination of various types of shocks could play a role in protostellar outflows as long as UV irradiation is included in the models. The origin of this radiation is likely internal, since no significant differences in the excitation conditions of outflows are seen at various locations in the cloud.

### 136) [2509.10117](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10117v1): Impact of stochastic star-formation histories and dust on selecting quiescent galaxies with JWST photometry

<p>
While the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) now allows identifying quiescent galaxies (QGs) out to early epochs, the photometric selection of quiescent galaxy candidates (QGCs) and the derivation of key physical quantities are highly sensitive to the assumed star-formation histories (SFHs). We aim to quantify how the inclusion of JWST/MIRI data and different SFH models impacts the selection and characterisation of QGCs. We test the robustness of the physical properties inferred from the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, such as M<sub>&sext;</sub>, age, star formation rate (SFR), and AV, and study how they impact the quiescence criteria of the galaxies across cosmic time. We perform SED fitting for ~13000 galaxies at z&lt;6 from the CEERS/MIRI fields with up to 20 optical-mid infrared (MIR) broadband coverage. We implement three SFH prescriptions: flexible delayed, NonParametric, and extended Regulator. For each model, we compare results obtained with and without MIRI photometry and dust emission models. We evaluate the impact of these configurations on the number of candidate QGCs, selected based on rest UVJ colours, sSFR and main-sequence offset, and on their key physical properties such as M<sub>&sext;</sub>, AV, and stellar ages. The number of QGCs selected varies significantly with the choice of SFH from 171 to 224 out of 13000 galaxies, depending on the model. This number increases to 222-327 when MIRI data are used (up to ~45% more QGCs). This enhancement is driven by improved constraints on dust attenuation and M<sub>&sext;</sub>. We find a strong correlation between AV and M<sub>&sext;</sub>, with massive galaxies (M<sub>&sext;</sub>~10^11 M&odot;) being 1.5-4.2 times more attenuated in magnitude than low-mass systems (M<sub>&sext;</sub>~10^9 M&odot;), depending on SFH. Regardless of the SFH assumption, ~13% of QGCs exhibit significant attenuation (AV &gt; 0.5) in support of recent JWST studies challenging the notion that quiescent galaxies are uniformly dust-free.

<p> Yuting Liu, Masamune Oguri </p>
<p>
Time-delay cosmology offers an alternative approach to measuring the Hubble constant (H_0), which is distinct from the cosmic distance ladder and cosmic microwave background radiation methods. In this study, we present an improved strong lens mass modeling analysis of the cluster-lensed supernova Refsdal, incorporating the latest spectroscopic redshift data from the MUSE on the Very Large Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope CANUCS/Technicolor. The robustness of our lens models is confirmed using the Jackknife method. From our analysis that considers four lens mass models with different assumptions on profiles of dark matter halos and external perturbations, we derive a constraint on the Hubble constant of H_0=66.0±4.3\Mpc after combining best-fitted values of the four lens models.

[Shortened for arXiv] We conduct a systematic search for log(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 9.5 quiescent galaxies at z &gt; 3 in six extragalactic deep fields observed with NIRCam, with the goal of extracting their physical and statistical features in a uniform and self-consistent manner. We exploit the ASTRODEEP-JWST photometric catalogs to single out robust candidates, including sources quenched only a few tens of Myr before the observation. We apply a SED-fitting procedure which explores three functional forms of star formation history and the &chi;<sup>2</sup> probabilities of the solutions, with additional checks to minimise the contamination from interlopers, tuning our selection criteria against available spectroscopic data from the DAWN archive and simulated catalogs. We select 633 candidates, which we rank by a reliability parameter based on the probabilities of the quiescent and alternative star-forming solutions, with 291 candidates tagged as "gold". According to the best-fit models, 79&percnt; of the massive (log(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 10.5) quiescent galaxies at 3 &lt; z &lt; 5 stopped forming stars at least 150 Myr before the time of observation, while 89&percnt; of low-mass sources have been quenched for less than 150 Myr. The abundance of low-mass old quiescent systems does not increase significantly with time from z = 5 to 3: low-mass objects seem to be experiencing a short episode of quenching followed by rejuvenation ("breathing''), consistent with a downsizing scenario of galaxy formation. We also find an abrupt drop in the density of massive quiescent candidates at z &gt; 5. We derive estimates for the number density of early passive galaxies up to z = 10 and compare them against various models: tensions with data remain in the modeling of the observed bimodality of time passed since quenching as a function of mass.

We present the discovery of two low-mass, high-redshift, quiescent galaxies, GS-z5-Q1 and COS-z5-Q1, using JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy alongside NIRCam and MIRI photometry. Observed at a redshift of z=5.39 and z=5.11 respectively, and with stellar masses of 10^9.6M<sub>&odot;</sub> and 10^9.5M<sub>&odot;</sub>, GS-z5-Q1 and COS-z5-Q1 are two of the most distant quiescent galaxies spectroscopically confirmed to-date, and are by far the least massive (~10× lower mass). Full spectrophotometric modelling reveals that COS-z5-Q1 appears to have quenched more than 300Myr prior to observation (z~ 7) and has a formation redshift of around z~11, whilst GS-z5-Q1 formed and quenched in a single burst around 150Myr prior to observation (z~6). GS-z5-Q1 is found to lie near the centre of a known high-z overdensity in GOODS-S, as would be expected by galaxy formation models, while COS-z5-Q1 lies towards the outskirts of an overdense region. This highlights the role that environment could play in accelerating galaxy evolutionary processes and could possibly be linked to the galaxies' quiescent nature. By modelling their stellar populations, we show that these types of low-mass quiescent galaxies could potentially be descendants of the higher-z "mini-quenched" galaxies. The discovery of these two low-mass z&gt;5 quiescent galaxies illuminates a previously undiscovered galaxy population and motivates dedicated follow-up surveys to investigate the overall population.

JWST NIRCam and MIRI photometry of NGC 602, a low-metallicity young star cluster in the Small Magellanic Cloud, reveals an extended mid-infrared bright emission feature designated as MZS-1. This feature is prominent between 10 and 25.5 microns, but is extremely faint at 7.7 microns and entirely undetected at shorter wavelengths. MZS-1 exhibits an elliptical morphology with a major axis of approximately 8 arcseconds and a minor axis of about 4 arcseconds. Its elongated shape and multiple emission peaks in the two-dimensional flux map suggest a group of deeply embedded sources with blackbody-like temperatures ranging from 100 K to 140 K. SED fitting using the Robitaille 2017 model grids identifies these sources as Stage I young stellar objects (YSOs) with masses below approximately 3 solar masses and a total stellar mass of the protocluster of about 300 solar masses (based on a Salpeter IMF). The low YSO masses are consistent with their absence in Spitzer-based catalogs due to sensitivity limits. By revealing a deeply embedded, low-mass protocluster invisible in previous surveys, this work highlights JWST's unparalleled resolution and sensitivity in uncovering the earliest stages of low-mass cluster formation in the metal-poor regime.

Some of the most puzzling discoveries of NASA's JWST in the early Universe surround the surprising abundance of compact red sources, which show peculiar continuum shapes and broad hydrogen spectral lines. These sources, dubbed "Little Red Dots'' or LRDs, have been the subject of intense inquiry in the literature. Any of the proposed explanations, from accreting super-massive black holes ensconced in ultra-dense gas to extremely compact star-systems, has significant implications for the earliest phases of galaxy evolution. Part of the difficulty in concretely identifying the physical mechanisms that drive their rest ultra-violet/optical spectral properties is the lack of bona fide signatures &ndash; either star-formation or accreting super-massive black hole, that uniquely discriminate between competing interpretations. In this work, we report the discovery of several spectral features that strongly favor the existence of an accreting super-massive black hole in an LRD witnessed in the first 800 Myr of cosmic time, including several rare iron transitions and a possible [FeVII]. Additionally, we report on the properties of significant Balmer absorption and find that the small widths and relative depths of the absorption feature suggest the source of the absorber is at or beyond the outer edge of the broad-line region and does it fully cover the accreting SMBH in the center of the system. The detection of these iron features, coupled with the properties of the Balmer absorption, unveils an alternative scenario for LRDs &ndash; one where there are direct sight-lines from the accretion disk to gas on scales at (or beyond) the broad-line gas region.

### 142) [2509.09355](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09355v1): The History of Galaxy Mergers in IllustrisTNG

<p>
The process of galaxy evolution over cosmic time is not yet fully understood, since there is a debate on the impact of galaxy collisions on the star formation and metallicity. The local environment of the galaxy mergers could also have a large impact on the evolution of the galaxies, but it has not yet been possible to examine it in detail. Modern simulations with larger capacity, including the newest physical knowledge and new observations with JWST, help us to answer these questions. Using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation, we processed the catalogue data and the merger tree files of the TNG300-1 simulation. We calculated the galaxies average star formation rate (SFR) and mass at redshifts between 0 &lt; z &lt; 15. We investigated the environment of galaxy mergers, with the focus on the local density, and also examined how the SFR changes in merging galaxies. We compared our findings with JWST results and highlighted differences in the star formation rate density (SFRD) history between the models and observations.

<p>
The existence of abundant post-starburst/quiescent galaxies just ~1-2 Gyrs after the Big Bang challenges our current paradigm of galaxy evolution. Cosmological simulations suggest that quasar feedback is likely the most promising mechanism responsible for such rapid quenching. Here we report a high detection rate (6/27) of exceptionally fast and powerful galaxy-scale outflows traced by [O III] emission in z ~ 5-6 luminous quasars as revealed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with velocity up to ~8400 km s<sup>-1</sup> and order-of-magnitude kinetic energy outflow rates up to ~260% the observed quasar bolometric luminosities. This fraction is ≳6.6 times larger than that in luminosity-matched comparison samples at z ~ 1.5-3.5 (0/58) and z &lt; 1 (5/148). These extreme outflows are comparable to or even faster than the most rapid [O III] outflows reported at z ≲ 3, and could reach the circumgalactic medium (CGM) or even the intergalactic medium (IGM). The average kinetic energy outflow rate of our entire sample is ~230× higher than that at cosmic noon. The substantially higher frequency of outflows with energetics well above the threshold for negative feedback in our sample strongly suggests that quasar feedback plays a significant role in efficiently quenching/regulating early massive galaxies.

### 144) [2509.08687](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08687v1): The Small Magellanic Cloud through the lens of the James Webb Space Telescope : binaries and mass function within the galaxy outskirts

<p>
The stellar initial mass function (IMF) and the fraction of binary systems are fundamental ingredients that govern the formation and evolution of galaxies. Whether the IMF is universal or varies with environment remains one of the central open questions in astrophysics. Dwarf galaxies such as the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), with their low metallicity and diffuse star-forming regions, offer critical laboratories to address this issue. In this work, we exploit ultra-deep photometry from the James Webb Space Telescope to investigate the stellar populations in the field of the SMC. Using the m_F322W2 versus m_F115W-m_F322W2 color-magnitude diagram (CMD), we derive the luminosity function and measure the fraction of unresolved binary systems. We find a binary fraction of f_bin^q&gt;0.6=0.14±0.01, consistent with results from synthetic CMDs incorporating the metallicity distribution of the SMC. Additionally, the measured binary fraction in the SMC field is consistent with those observed in Galactic open clusters and Milky Way field stars of similar ages and masses, suggesting similar binary formation and evolutionary processes across these low-density environments. By combining the luminosity function with the best-fit isochrone, we derive the the mass function (MF) down to 0.22 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, the lowest mass limit reached for the SMC to date. The resulting MF follows a power-law with a slope of &alpha;=-1.99±0.08. This value is shallower than the canonical Salpeter slope of &alpha;=-2.35, providing new evidence for IMF variations in low-metallicity and low-density environments.

### 145) [2509.08448](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08448v1): Black hole mass function shift in proto-stellar-clusters driven by gas accretion

<p> Zacharias Roupas </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has observed compact, massive proto-stellar clusters of low metallicity in the Cosmic Gems arc galaxy at high redshift, which represent likely precursors to globular clusters. We model the mass growth of stellar black holes (BHs) during the first few Myr of the life of a massive, compact, gaseous stellar cluster before stellar feedback expels the primordial gas. At high redshift, in a lower metallicity environment stellar winds get weaker allowing for larger gas-depletion time-scales in the cluster despite of energetic pair-instability supernova (PISN) feedback for sufficiently compact clusters. Mass segregation drives the massive stellar progenitors of BHs in the center of the cluster where gas is most dense. We estimate the conditions for which the initial black hole mass function (BHMF), with a PISN-induced cut-off &lt;55M<sub>&odot;</sub>, gets shifted to values within the upper BH mass gap, ~ 60-130M<sub>&odot;</sub>, or higher, as observed by Gravitational Wave (GW) experiments LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. We find that the BHs are shifted by the end of gas depletion to values within and above the mass gap, well within the range of BH components of the recent GW-signal GW231123, depending on total mass, star formation efficiency, metallicity and compactness. The individual BH mass increase follows approximately a surprisingly steep power law with respect to initial BH mass with an exponent in the range ≈ 4-6. This occurs in gaseous proto-stellar clusters that are sufficiently massive and compact, with typical values of total mass ~ 10^6M<sub>&odot;</sub> and size ~ 1pc. Our analysis suggests that proto-stellar clusters at high redshift such as Cosmic Gems arc clusters have generated through early gas accretion, BHs as heavy as ~ 10^2-10^3M<sub>&odot;</sub>.

<p>
We used observations from the JWST Emission Line Survey (JELS) to measure the half-light radii (r_e) of 23 H&alpha;-emitting star-forming (SF) galaxies at z=6.1 in the PRIMER/COSMOS field. Galaxy sizes were measured in JWST Near-infrared Camera observations in rest-frame H&alpha; (tracing recent star formation) with the F466N and F470N narrowband filters from JELS, and compared against rest-R-band, V-band (tracing established stellar populations) and near-ultraviolet sizes. We find a size-stellar mass (r_e-M_*) relationship with a slope that is consistent with literature values at lower redshifts, though offset to lower sizes. We observe a large scatter in r_e at low stellar mass (M_*&lt;10^8.4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) which we believe is the result of bursty star formation histories (SFHs) of SF galaxies at the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). We find that the stellar and ionised gas components are similar in size at z=6.1. The evidence of already-established stellar components in these H&alpha; emitters (HAEs) indicates previous episodes of star formation have occurred. As such, following other JELS studies finding our HAEs are undergoing a current burst of star formation, we believe our results indicate that SF galaxies at the end of the EoR have already experienced a bursty SFH. From our r_e-M_* relationship, we find r_e, F444W=0.76±0.46 kpc for fixed stellar mass M_*=10^9.25 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, which is in agreement with other observations and simulations of star forming galaxies in the literature. We find a close-pair (major) merger fraction of (f_maj. merger=0.44±0.22) f_merger=0.43±0.11 for galaxy separations d≲25 kpc, which is in agreement with other z≈6 studies.

### 147) [2509.07960](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07960v1): The evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function and star formation rates in the COLIBRE simulations from redshift 17 to 0

<p> Evgenii Chaikin, Joop Schaye, Matthieu Schaller, Sylvia Ploeckinger, Alejandro Benítez-Llambay, Carlos S. Frenk, Filip Huško, Robert McGibbon, Alexander J. Richings, James W. Trayford </p>
<p>
We investigate the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) and star formation rates (SFRs) across cosmic time in the COLIBRE simulations of galaxy formation. COLIBRE includes a multiphase interstellar medium, radiative cooling rates coupled to a model for the evolution of dust grains, and employs prescriptions for stellar and AGN feedback calibrated to reproduce the z=0 observed GSMF and stellar mass - size relation. We present the evolution of the GSMF from simulations at three resolutions: m_gas≈ m_dm~ 10^7, 10^6, and 10^5~M<sub>&odot;</sub>, in cosmological volumes of up to 400^3, 200^3, and 50^3 cMpc^3, respectively. We demonstrate that COLIBRE is consistent with the observed GSMF over the full redshift range for which there are observations to compare with (0&lt;z&lt;12), with maximum systematic deviations of ≈ 0.3 dex reached at 2&lt;z&lt;4. We also examine the evolution of the star-forming main sequence, cosmic SFR density, stellar mass density, and galaxy quenched fraction, making predictions for both the fiducial COLIBRE model with thermally-driven AGN feedback and its variant with hybrid (thermal + kinetic jet) AGN feedback, and finding good agreement with observations. Notably, we show that COLIBRE matches the number density of massive quiescent galaxies at high redshifts reported by JWST, while predicting a stellar-to-halo mass relation that evolves little with redshift. We conclude that neither a redshift-dependent star formation efficiency, nor a variable stellar initial mass function, nor a deviation from &Lambda;CDM is necessary to reproduce the high-redshift JWST stellar masses and SFRs.

### 148) [2509.07913](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07913v2): Disclosing Submillimeter Galaxy Formation: Mergers or Secular Evolution?

<p> Siu-Wang Chan, Yiping Ao, Qinghua Tan </p>
<p>
We analyze the morphology of 125 submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) in the PRIMER-COSMOS field using double Sersic modeling on JWST NIRCam images across six bands (F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M and F444W), with SMGs being classified by bulge Sersic index (n_bulge) and bulge-to-total luminosity ratio (B/T). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test between the bright (SFR &gt; 175 M_sun yr^-1) and the faint group (SFR &lt; 175 M_sun yr^-1) reveals no significant statistical differences in morphology across bands. However, we notice that SMGs skew towards higher B/T ratios and lower n_bulge from shorter to longer wavelengths. In F444W, bright SMGs exhibit higher B/T and lower n_bulge, indicating flatter, disturbed bulges, while faint SMGs show lower B/T and higher n_bulge. Notably, SMGs with higher B/T tend to have low Sersic index, challenging the local universe dichotomy of classical bulges (B/T &gt; 0.5, n &gt; 4) versus pseudo-bulges (B/T &lt; 0.35, n &lt; 2). In the F277W band, non-parametric measurements indicate predominantly disk-dominated patterns, with only 24 percent of SMGs demonstrating merger signatures. After the removal of SMGs with disturbed morphology, the bulge classification scheme in F277W shows pseudo-bulges (21 percent) and clump migration bulges (16 percent) from secular evolution, compared to 4 percent merger-built bulges. Surprisingly, 48 percent of SMGs defy the classification scheme, showing high B/T (approximately 0.7) but low Sersic index (n_bulge ≤ 1). Bars are confirmed in 7 percent of SMGs. This work suggests that secular evolution takes precedence over major mergers, supporting the idea that isolated evolution fueled by filamentary gas inflow plays a non-negligible role in the SMG bulge formation.

### 149) [2509.07695](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07695v1): Beyond No Tension: JWST z &gt; 10 Galaxies Push Simulations to the Limit

<p> Joe McCaffrey, Samantha Hardin, John H. Wise, John A. Regan </p>
<p>
JWST has identified some of the Universe's earliest galaxies, repeatedly pushing the frontier to ever higher redshifts and stellar masses. The presence of such extreme galaxies at such early times, with large stellar populations and high star-formation rates, naturally results in a tension between observation and theory. This tension between numerical models and observations can be either due to our underlying cosmological models or due to a gap in our understanding of early Universe astrophysics. In a prelude to this letter, we showed how the Renaissance simulations, which focused on high redshift galaxy formation were able to reconstruct similar stellar masses to the earliest and highest mass galaxies that had been discovered by JWST at the time of its publication (McCaffrey et al.2023). Since then many more galaxies have been discovered by JWST, in particular the "Mirage-or-Miracle" (MoM) survey broke the record recently with the highest redshift galaxy MoM-z14, which has a spectroscopically confirmed redshift of z ~ 14.44 followed closely by GS-z14 with a spectroscopically confirmed redshift of z ~ 14.3. We investigate in this letter whether these newly discovered galaxies are in conflict with the Renaissance simulations and thus whether they are causing tension with our established models of cosmology and/or high-redshift astrophysics. We discover that MoM-z14's high mass at early redshift can be explained by the Renaissance simulation suite, whereas the extremely high stellar mass of GS-z14 remains an outlier when compared to previous measurements of high-redshift galaxies detected by JWST and our numerical models (even after accounting for cosmic variance).

### 150) [2509.07611](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07611v1): Balmer Absorption in Iron Low-Ionization Broad Absorption Line Quasars

<p> Karen M. Leighly, Sarah C. Gallagher, Hyunseop Choi, Donald M. Terndrup, Julianna R. Voelker, Gordon T. Richards, Leah K. Morabito </p>
<p>
While C IV is the most common absorption line in Broad Absorption Line Quasar spectra, Balmer absorption lines are among the rarest. We present analysis of Balmer absorption in a sample of fourteen iron low-ionization BAL quasars (FeLoBALQs); eight are new identifications. We measured velocity offset, width, and apparent optical depth. The partial covering ubiquitous in BAL quasar spectra alters the measured Balmer optical depth ratios; taking that into account, we estimated the true H(n= 2) column density. We found the anticipated correlation between Eddington ratio and outflow speed, but it is weak in this sample because nearly all of the objects have the low outflow speeds characterizing loitering outflow FeLoBAL quasars (H. Choi et al. 2022b), objects that are also found to have low accretion rates (K. M. Leighly et al. 2022; H. Choi et al. 2022a). Measures of dN/dv, the differential column density with respect to the outflow speed, are anticorrelated with the luminosity and Eddington ratio: the strongest absorption is observed at the lowest speeds in the lowest luminosity objects. The absorption line width is correlated with &alpha;oi, the F&lambda; point-to-point slope between 5100A and 3 microns. This parameter is strongly correlated with the Eddington ratio among low-redshift quasars (K. M. Leighly et al. 2024). Balmer absorption lines have been recently found in the spectra of Little Red Dots (LRDs), a class of high-redshift objects discovered by JWST. We note suggestive similarities between LRDs and FeLoBAL quasars in the emission line shape, the presence of steep reddening and a scattered blue continuum, the lack of hot dust emission, and X-ray weakness.

<p>
Little Red Dots (LRDs) are a puzzling population of extragalactic sources whose origin is highly debated. In this Letter, we stack NIRCam, MIRI and ALMA images of a large and homogeneously-selected sample of LRDs from multiple JWST Legacy fields. We find clear evidence for hot-dust emission, seen as a rising mid-infrared continuum up to rest-frame &lambda;_rest~ 3&mu;m, that is best explained by a standard dusty AGN structure. This scenario holds regardless of whether the Optical/Ultraviolet (UV) continuum is stellar or AGN-dominated. Either ways, we argue that AGN-heated dust must have a geometry that leaves at least part of the Optical/UV continuum and broad-line region emission unobscured, which explains the observed blue UV slopes and prominent Balmer features. Lack of detections in the deep stack of X-ray images suggests that Compton-thick (N_H&gt;3×10^24 cm<sup>2</sup>) gas obscuration is common, and likely confined within the dust sublimation radius (R_sub~0.1 pc). While this gas-dust displacement is in line with recent models (e.g. the "Black Hole Star''), how pre-enriched hot dust can form around a nearly-pristine black hole environment remains to be explained.

<p>
We report the discovery of a faint (M_1700 ~ -12.2), oxygen-deficient strongly-lensed ionizing source &ndash; dubbed LAP2 (Lensed And Pristine 2) &ndash; at a spectroscopic redshift of z=4.19. LAP2 appears to be isolated and lies very close to the caustic produced by the lensing galaxy cluster Abell 2744. It was observed with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec MSA in prism mode as part of the UNCOVER program. The NIRSpec spectrum reveals prominent Lya emission (7.1 sigma), clear Ha emission (6.2 sigma), tentative Hb emission (2.8 sigma), and no detectable [OIII]4959,5007 (~ 7 times fainter than Ha). The inferred [OIII] 2 sigma upper limit corresponds to an R3 index &lt;0.85 (assuming the Ha/Hb ~ 2.86 case~B recombination ratio), which, under high-ionization conditions, implies a metallicity of Z &lt; 6 X 10^(-3) Z_sun. The combination of faint ultraviolet luminosity, large rest-frame Ha equivalent width (~ 650 A), and extremely compact size (&lt; 10 pc) suggests that LAP2 is being caught in an early, pristine formation phase consistent with an instantaneous-burst scenario, with an estimated stellar mass of at most a few 10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Deep VLT/MUSE observations further reveal copious Lya emission forming an arclet that straddles the critical line. LAP2 thus joins the rare class of extremely metal-poor star-forming complexes that JWST has started to unveil at redshifts 3 - 7, and provides a rare glimpse into a still very poorly explored faint-luminosity regime.

<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (itJWST) opened a new observational window on the primordial Universe. Here we present new JWST NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy (IFS) observations of the z=7.54 quasar ULAS J1342+0928 obtained as part of the Galaxy Assembly with NIRSpec IFS (GA-NIFS) GTO programme. The new data-set obtained with both the prism (R~100) and the high-resolution grating (R~2700) allow for a complete description of the quasar emission from the rest-frame UV to optical bands. The low-resolution data reveal the presence of [\ionO iii] emission on ~7 kpc scales, well above the typical galaxy size at this redshift, likely associated with a past outflow event. Additionally, the high-resolution observations show a more energetic ionised outflow on nuclear scales (≲ 0.6 kpc). The total ionised mass outflow rate ranges between 50 and 300 M<sub>&odot;</sub>   yr^-1 where the significant spread is mostly due to the lack of tight constraints on the electron density. This range overlaps in part with the star formation rate range (85&ndash;545 M<sub>&odot;</sub>   yr^-1), implying that the nuclear outflow could ultimately lead to an early star formation quenching. By employing an accretion disc modelling, for the first time on itJWST data, we manage to robustly estimate the black hole mass and the bolometric luminosity, log(M_BH/(M<sub>&odot;</sub>))=9.2± 0.2 and log(L_bol/(erg   s<sup>-1</sup>))=46.8± 0.1, respectively. We derive an Eddington ratio of &lambda;_Edd~ 0.4, challenging the paradigm of widespread super-Eddington accretion in quasars at the epoch of reionisation.

### 154) [2509.06955](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06955v1): Constraints on Dark Matter Models from Supermassive Black Hole Evolution

<p> John Ellis, Malcolm Fairbairn, Juan Urrutia, Ville Vaskonen </p>
<p>
A semi-analytical model for the evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the &Lambda;CDM paradigm has been shown to yield stellar mass-BH mass relations that reproduce both the JWST and pre-JWST observations. Either fuzzy or warm dark matter (FDM or WDM) would suppress the formation of the smaller galactic halos that play important roles in the CDM fit to the high-redshift SMBH data. Our analysis of the stellar mass-BH mass relation disfavours FDM fields with masses &lt; 2.0× 10^-20 eV and WDM particles with masses &lt; 7.2 keV, both at the 95 % confidence level.

Sanders, Dirk Scholte, Alice E. Shapley, Maya Skarbinski, Thomas M. Stanton, Vivienne Wild </p>
<p>
We select a mass-complete sample of 225 quiescent galaxies at z&gt;2 with M_* &gt; 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> from PRIMER and JADES photometry spanning a total area of ≃320 sq. arcmin. We restrict our analysis to only area with optical coverage in three HST ACS filters, and provide evidence that this is important for selecting the most complete and clean samples of z&gt;2 massive quiescent galaxy candidates. We investigate the contamination in our sample via JWST NIRSpec spectroscopic validation, Chandra X-ray imaging, and ALMA interferometry, calculating a modest total contamination fraction of 12.9_-3.1^+4.0 per cent. The removal of HST data increases star-forming galaxy contamination by ≃10 per cent and results in a ≃20 per cent loss of candidates recovered from HST+JWST data combined. We calculate massive quiescent galaxy number densities at 2&lt;z&lt;5, finding values three times larger than pre-JWST estimates, but generally in agreement with more-recent and larger-area JWST studies. In comparison with galaxy evolution simulations, we find that most can now reproduce the observed massive quiescent galaxy number density at 2&lt;z&lt;3, however they still increasingly fall short at z&gt;3, with discrepancies of up to ≃ 1 dex. We place 14 of our z&gt;3 massive quiescent galaxies on the BPT and WHaN diagrams using medium-resolution spectroscopic data from the EXCELS survey. We find a very high incidence of faint AGN in our sample, at a level of ≃50 per cent, consistent with recent results at cosmic noon. This is interesting in the context of maintenance-mode feedback, which is invoked in many simulations to prevent quenched galaxies from re-igniting star formation. To properly characterise the evolution of early massive quiescent galaxies, greater coverage in optical filters and significantly larger spectroscopic samples will be required.

### 156) [2509.06892](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06892v1): Asymmetric Cannibal Dark Matter: Constraints from Neutron Star

<p> Ujjal Kumar Dey, Sourav Gope </p>
<p>
Asymmetric dark matter can be efficiently captured by neutron stars via elastic scattering with nucleons and dark matter self scattering. The accumulated dark matter thermalizes and concentrates in the stellar interior, forming a dark matter core. In this work, we propose a novel framework in which a \mathbbZ_3 symmetry allows for number-changing self-interactions of the form 3 arrow 2 within the dark sector. These cannibalistic reactions become increasingly efficient at high dark matter densities, leading to a significant depletion of the dark matter population in the stellar core. This number depletion heats up the neutron star above the standard cooling expectations, yielding observable thermal signatures in relatively old, isolated neutron stars, potentially detectable via James Webb Space Telescope. We show that even in the presence of other heating mechanisms, e.g. dark matter annihilation and kinetic heating, the cannibal heating dominates for certain parameter space. We demonstrate that the cannibal heating can predict detectable heating signatures in old neutron stars, thereby allowing a broader range of viable dark matter masses and couplings to the Standard Model.

### 157) [2509.06788](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06788v1): An Interpretable AI Framework to Disentangle Self-Interacting and Cold Dark Matter in Galaxy Clusters: The CKAN Approach

<p> Zhenyang Huang, Haihao Shi, Zhiyong Liu, Na Wang </p>
<p>
Convolutional neural networks have shown their ability to differentiate between self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) and cold dark matter (CDM) on galaxy cluster scales. However, their large parameter counts and ''black-box'' nature make it difficult to assess whether their decisions adhere to physical principles. To address this issue, we have built a Convolutional Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CKAN) that reduces parameter count and enhances interpretability, and propose a novel analytical framework to understand the network's decision-making process. With this framework, we leverage our network to qualitatively assess the offset between the dark matter distribution center and the galaxy cluster center, as well as the size of heating regions in different models. These findings are consistent with current theoretical predictions and show the reliability and interpretability of our network. By combining network interpretability with unseen test results, we also estimate that for SIDM in galaxy clusters, the minimum cross-section (&sigma;/m)_th required to reliably identify its collisional nature falls between 0.1 cm<sup>2</sup>/g and 0.3 cm<sup>2</sup>/g. Moreover, CKAN maintains robust performance under simulated JWST and Euclid noise, highlighting its promise for application to forthcoming observational surveys.

### 158) [2509.06622](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06622v1): MARTA: The connection between chemical enrichment, feedback, and dust in a Wolf-Rayet galaxy at z~2

Baker, Annalisa De Cia, Nimisha Kumari, Amirnezam Amiri, Giovanni Cresci, Chiaki Kobayashi, Fergus Cullen, Anna Feltre, Roberto Maiolino </p>
<p>
We present the analysis of the stellar and interstellar medium (ISM) properties of MARTA-4327, a star-forming galaxy at z=2.224 observed by means of deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy in both medium- and high-resolution gratings as part of the "Measuring Abundances at high Redshift with the Te Approach" (MARTA) programme. We report one of the highest-redshift detections of the Wolf-Rayet (WR) blue and red bumps in a non-lensed system. The broad He ii&lambda;4686 feature is consistent with a young (~ 5-6 Myr) burst dominated by WN stars, although both SSP models and empirical templates struggle to reproduce the nitrogen stellar features at ≈ 4640 A. Based on the relative strength of the available optical stellar features, we disfavor the presence of very massive stars (VMS) in this system. Elemental abundance ratios such as Ne/O, N/O, and Ar/O align with observations of local star-forming galaxies (including WR galaxies), suggesting that any impact of the WR population on the chemical enrichment of the ISM is strongly localized. However, the gas-phase Fe/O ratio appears enhanced compared to local galaxies of similar metallicity, which we interpret as evidence for reduced Fe depletion onto dust grains, possibly linked to localized destruction in WR-driven wind environments. In addition, we detect a broad and blueshifted (~70 km/s) H&alpha; component, revealing the presence of an ionized outflow with a mass loading factor &eta; ~ 0.2. Finally, we report the robust detection of O I&lambda;8446 emission (among the first at high redshift), which we interpret as originating from Ly&beta; fluorescence and/or collisional excitation in dense clumps. Overall, MARTA-4327 represents a unique system for studying the role of massive stars in shaping the ISM in galaxies at Cosmic Noon.

### 159) [2509.05551](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05551v1): Uncertainty-Aware Neural Networks for Fuzzy Dark Matter Model Selection from \texorpdfstringx_HI x_HI Measurements

<p> Bahareh Soleimanpour Salmasi, S. Mobina Hosseini </p>
<p>
The nature of dark matter remains a central question in cosmology, with fuzzy dark matter (FDM) models offering a compelling alternative to the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. We explore FDM scenarios by performing 21-cm simulations across a parameter space with \texorpdfstringf_FDM \in [0.02, 0.10] f_FDM in [0.02, 0.10] and \texorpdfstringm_FDM \in [10^-24, 10^-21] eV m_FDM in [10^-24, 10^-21] eV, obtaining global neutral hydrogen fractions (\texorpdfstringx_HI x_HI) for each model. Observational \texorpdfstringx_HI x_HI data and associated uncertainties from JWST are incorporated by estimating full probability density functions (PDFs) for both \texorpdfstringx_HI x_HI and redshift \texorpdfstringz z using Bayesian inference with the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), yielding non-Gaussian multivariate uncertainty distributions. A hybrid machine learning framework is then trained on these observational PDFs to learn both central values and correlated uncertainties in \texorpdfstringx_HI x_HI and \texorpdfstringz z, iteratively refining its parameters in each training epoch through direct incorporation of the multivariate PDFs derived from observational constraints. We then compare the simulation outputs to the machine-learned observational trends to identify the most consistent models. Our results indicate that FDM models with \texorpdfstringm_FDM ≃ 10^-22 eV m_FDM approx 10^-22 eV and \texorpdfstringf_FDM ≃ 0.04 f_FDM approx 0.04 best match current data, while lighter masses are strongly constrained. By integrating simulations and machine learning in an uncertainty-aware framework, this work explores the physics of the early Universe and guides future studies of 21-cm cosmology and reionization.

### 160) [2509.05459](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05459v1): The possible accretion discs of GN-z11 at redshift z = 10.6, MoM-z14 at z = 14.44 and other high redshift objects

<p> A. C. Fabian, J. Jiang, W. M. Baker, R. Maiolino, X. Ji, I. Juodzbalis, J. Scholtz </p>
<p>
The JWST has enabled the discovery of Active Galactic Nuclei at high redshifts. The intrinsic UV spectrum of GN-z11 at redshift z = 10.6 has a spectral slope compatible with a standard accretion disc. By fitting a disc model to its spectrum, we find that the mass of the black hole must be above 1.6e7 M<sub>&odot;</sub> in order that it lies below the Eddington limit. We define this mass as the Eddington mass of the black hole. We note that the spectral shape is consistent with that of accreting stellar mass black holes sources in their soft state, for which no variability is expected. Mom-z14 is a more distant object at z = 14.44 and has a similar UV slope. Disc model-fitting gives a similar result but lower mass accretion rate. We also examine 3 further high redshift objects: GS z14-1, GHZ2 and GS-z11-1 at z = 13.86, 12.34 and 11.28, again obtaining similar results. If sub-Eddington accretion discs are indeed the origin of much of the UV emission from these objects, then the existence of massive black holes less than 440 and 290 Myr after the Big Bang point either to exceptional black hole seeds or to primordial black holes. The observed spread of UV spectral slopes in high redshift objects suggests that our approach may be relevant to about half of that population.

<p>
New populations of red active galactic nuclei (known as "Little Red Dots'') discovered by JWST exhibit remarkable spectral energy distributions. Leveraging X-ray through far-infrared observations of two of the most luminous known Little Red Dots, we directly their bolometric luminosities. We find evidence that more than half of the bolometric luminosity likely emerges in the rest-frame optical, with L_bol/L_5100 = 5, roughly half the value for "standard'' Active Galactic Nuclei. Meanwhile, the X-ray emitting corona, UV-emitting black-body, and reprocessed mid to far-infrared emission are all considerably sub-dominant, assuming that the far-infrared luminosity is well below current measured limits. We present new bolometric corrections that dramatically lower inferred bolometric luminosities by a factor of ten compared to published values in the literature. These bolometric corrections are in accord with expectations from models in which gas absorption and reprocessing are responsible for the red rest-frame optical colors of Little Red Dots. We discuss how this lowered luminosity scale suggests a lower mass scale for the population by at least an order of magnitude \bf (e.g., ~ 10^5-10^7~M<sub>&odot;</sub> black holes, and ~ 10^8~M<sub>&odot;</sub> galaxies), alleviating tensions with clustering, overmassive black holes, and the integrated black hole mass density in the Universe.

### 162) [2509.05423](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05423v1): Another view into JWST-discovered X-ray weak AGNs via radiative dusty feedback

<p> W. Ishibashi, A. C. Fabian, R. Maiolino, Y. Gursahani, C. S. Reynolds </p>
<p>
JWST has revealed a previously unknown population of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early Universe. These JWST-AGN at high redshifts are characterised by a set of peculiar properties, including unusually weak X-ray emission. Here we investigate the apparent lack of X-ray emission in the framework of the "AGN radiative dusty feedback'' scenario based on the effective Eddington limit for dust. We analyse how the boundary in the N_H - &lambda; plane, defined by the column density versus the Eddington ratio, is modified as a function of the dusty gas parameters (metallicity, dust grain size and composition). Low metallicity gas with little dust content tends to survive against radiation pressure, and likely accumulates in the nuclear region. We suggest that such dust-poor gas can provide long-lived absorption and may lead to heavy X-ray obscuration, as observed in early JWST-AGN. The blowout vs. stalling condition of the obscuring clouds indicates that higher metallicities are required to eject heavier column densities, while large columns of gas can stall in low metallicity environments. Therefore the metallicity may play a key role in the AGN radiative dusty feedback scenario. We discuss how other peculiar properties of JWST-AGN &ndash; such as Balmer absorption features and weak radio emission &ndash; may be naturally interpreted within the same physical framework.

<p>
Ultra-violet (UV) radiation from accreting black holes ionizes the intergalactic gas around early quasars, carving out highly ionized bubbles in their surroundings. Any changes in a quasar's luminosity are therefore predicted to produce outward-propagating ionization gradients, affecting the Lyman-&alpha; (Ly&alpha;) absorption opacity near the quasar's systemic redshift. This "proximity effect" is well-documented in rest-UV quasar spectra but only provides a one-dimensional probe along our line-of-sight. Here we present deep spectroscopic observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) of galaxies in the background of a super-luminous quasar at z_QSO≈6.3, which reveal the quasar's "light echo" with Ly&alpha; tomography in the transverse direction. This transverse proximity effect is detected for the first time towards multiple galaxy sightlines, allowing us to map the extent and geometry of the quasar's ionization cone. We obtain constraints on the orientation and inclination of the cone, as well as an upper limit on the obscured solid angle fraction of f_obsc&lt;91&percnt;. Additionally, we find a timescale of the quasar's UV radiation of t_QSO=10^5.6^+0.1_-0.3 years, which is significantly shorter than would be required to build up the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) with conventional growth models, but is consistent with independent measurements of the quasars' duty cycle. Our inferred obscured fraction disfavors a scenario where short quasar lifetimes can be explained exclusively by geometric obscuration, and instead supports the idea that radiatively inefficient accretion or growth in initially heavily enshrouded cocoons plays a pivotal role in early SMBH growth. Our results pave the way for novel studies of quasars' ionizing geometries and radiative histories at early cosmic times.

### 164) [2509.05403](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05403v1): Hydrogen-Alpha as a Tracer of Star Formation in the SPHINX Cosmological Simulations

<p> I. G. Kramarenko, J. Rosdahl, J. Blaizot, J. Matthee, H. Katz, C. Di Cesare </p>
<p>
The Hydrogen-alpha (Ha) emission line in galaxies is a powerful tracer of their recent star formation activity. With the advent of JWST, we are now able to routinely observe Ha in galaxies at high redshifts (z &gt; 3) and thus measure their star-formation rates (SFRs). However, using "classical" SFR(Ha) calibrations to derive the SFRs leads to biased results because high-redshift galaxies are commonly characterized by low metallicities and bursty star-formation histories, affecting the conversion factor between the Ha luminosity and the SFR. In this work, we develop a set of new SFR(Ha) calibrations that allow us to predict the SFRs of Ha-emitters at z &gt; 3 with minimal error. We use the SPHINX cosmological simulations to select a sample of star-forming galaxies representative of the Ha-emitter population observed with JWST. We then derive linear corrections to the classical SFR(Ha) calibrations, taking into account variations in the physical properties (e.g., stellar metallicities) among individual galaxies. We obtain two new SFR(Ha) calibrations that, compared to the classical calibrations, reduce the root mean squared error (RMSE) in the predicted SFRs by &Delta;RMSE ≈ 0.04 dex and &Delta;RMSE ≈ 0.06 dex, respectively. Using the recent JWST NIRCam/grism observations of Ha-emitters at z ~ 6, we show that the new calibrations affect the high-redshift galaxy population statistics: (i) the estimated cosmic star-formation density decreases by &Delta;&rho;(SFR) ≈ 12%, and (ii) the observed slope of the star-formation main sequence increases by &Delta; \partiallog SFR / \partiallog M<sub>&sext;</sub> = 0.08 ± 0.02.

### 165) [2509.04944](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04944v1): Observation of an Accreting Planetary-Mass Companion with Signs of Disk-Disk Interaction in Orion

Young (≲ 10 Myr) planetary-mass companions (PMCs) provide valuable insights into the formation and early evolution of planetary systems. To date, only a dozen such objects have been identified through direct imaging. Using JWST/NIRCam observations towards the Orion Nebula, obtained as part of the itPDRs4All Early Release Science program, we have identified a faint point source near the M-type star V2376 Ori. Follow-up spectroscopic observations with the MUSE instrument on the VLT confirm that the source, V2376 Ori b, is indeed a young planetary-mass companion. It is a member of Orion D, around 80 pc in the foreground of the Trapezium cluster of Orion and with an age of approximately 7 ± 3 Myr. We fit the SED of V2376 Ori b to infer a mass of ~ 20~M_Jup. The MUSE spectrum reveals several accretion tracers. Based on the H&alpha; line intensity, we estimate an accretion rate of ~10^-6.5 ± 0.7~M_Jup yr^-1, which is comparable to that of young PMCs such as PDS~70b. In addition, the MUSE data cube reveals extended emission in the [O scii] doublet at 7320 and 7330~&#8491;, which is interpreted as evidence of a dynamical interaction between the two sources that, potentially, involves mass transfer between their individual accretion disks. These results demonstrate that JWST/NIRCam imaging surveys of young stellar associations can uncover new PMCs, which can then be confirmed and characterized through ground-based spectroscopic follow-up.

<p>
We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) and Mid-infrared Instrument (MIRI) integral-field spectroscopy of the nearby blue compact dwarf II Zw 40, which has a low metallicity of 25% of solar. Leveraging the high spatial/spectral resolution and wavelength coverage of JWST/NIRSpec, we present robust detections of the 3.3 um polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission on 20 pc scales. The strength of the Pf delta emission relative to the 3.3 PAH feature is significantly stronger than typical higher metallicity star-forming galaxies. We find that 3.3 um PAH emission is concentrated near the northern super star cluster and is co-spatial with CO gas. A strong correlation exists between the 3.3/11.3 PAH ratio and radiation hardness probed by NeIII/NeII, providing evidence of photodestruction of PAH molecules in intense radiation environments. Our analysis shows that while the overall PAH fraction is lower in II Zw 40 than in higher metallicity galaxies, the contribution of the 3.3 um PAH feature to the total PAH emission is higher. We propose that the PAH size distribution is fundamentally shaped by two competing mechanisms in low-metallicity environments: photo-destruction and inhibited growth. Additionally, the high radiation field intensity in II Zw 40 suggests that multi-photon heating of PAHs may be an important effect. As one of the first spatially resolved studies of aromatic emission in a low-metallicity environment, our spectroscopic results offer practical guidance for future observations of the 3.3 um PAH feature in low-metallicity galaxies using JWST.

<p>
We report the discovery and characterization of a wide binary population in the ultrafaint dwarf galaxy Bo\"otes I using deep JWST/NIRCam imaging. Our sample consists of 52 candidate binaries with projected separations of 7,000 - 16,000 au and stellar masses from near the hydrogen-burning limit to the main-sequence turnoff (~0.1 - 0.8~M<sub>&odot;</sub>). By forward-modeling selection biases and chance alignments, we find that 1.25±0.25&percnt; of Bo\"otes I stars are members of wide binaries with separations beyond 5,000 au. This fraction, along with the distributions of separations and mass ratios, matches that in the Solar neighborhood, suggesting that wide binary formation is largely insensitive to metallicity, even down to [Fe/H] ≈ -2.5. The observed truncation in the separation distribution near 16,000 au is well explained by stellar flyby disruptions. We also discuss how the binaries can be used to constrain the galaxy's dark matter properties. We show that our detection places new limits on primordial black hole dark matter, finding that compact objects with M ≳ 5~M<sub>&odot;</sub> cannot constitute more than ~1&percnt; of the dark matter content. In contrast to previous work, we find that wide binaries are unlikely to provide robust constraints on the dark matter profile of ultrafaint galaxies given the uncertainties in the initial binary population, flyby disruptions, and contamination from chance alignments. These findings represent the most robust detection of wide binaries in an external galaxy to date, opening a new avenue for studying binary star formation and survival in extreme environments.

### 168) [2509.04331](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04331v2): A fast machine learning tool to predict the composition of astronomical ices from infrared absorption spectra

<p> Andrés Megías, Izaskun Jiménez-Serra, François Dulieu, Julie Vitorino, Belén Maté, David Ciudad, Will R. M. Rocha, Marcos Martínez Jiménez, Jacobo Aguirre </p>
<p>
Current observations taken by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allow us to observe the absorption features of icy mantles that cover interstellar dust grains, which are mainly composed of H<sub>2</sub>O, CO, and CO<sub>2</sub>, along with other minor species. Thanks to its sensitivity and spectral resolution, JWST has the potential to observe ice features towards hundreds of sources at different stages along the process of star formation. However, identifying the spectral features of the different species and quantifying the ice composition is not trivial and requires complex spectroscopic analysis. We present Automatic Ice Composition Estimator (AICE), a new tool based on artificial neural networks. Based on the infrared (IR) ice absorption spectrum between 2.5 and 10 microns, AICE predicts the ice fractional composition in terms of H<sub>2</sub>O, CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, CH_3OH, NH_3, and CH_4. To train the model, we used hundreds of laboratory experiments of ice mixtures from different databases, which were reprocessed with baseline subtraction and normalisation. Once trained, AICE takes less than one second on a conventional computer to predict the ice composition associated with the observed IR absorption spectrum, with typical errors of ~3 &percnt; in the species fraction. We tested its performance on two spectra reported towards the NIR38 and J110621 background stars observed within the JWST Ice Age program, demonstrating a good agreement with previous estimations of the ice composition. The fast and accurate performance of AICE enables the systematic analysis of hundreds of different ice spectra with a modest time investment. In addition, this model can be enhanced and re-trained with more laboratory data, improving the precision of the predictions and expanding the list of predicted species.

<p> M. Berton, E. Järvelä, A. Tortosa, C. Mazzucchelli </p>
<p>
The recent observations of highly accreting supermassive black holes (SMBH) at very high redshift (&gt;4) with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allowed us to shed light for the very first time on the early evolutionary phases of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Perhaps unsurprisingly, several of the physical properties observed in these new objects, including those known as little red dots (LRDs), are closely reminiscent of the low-mass and high-Eddington AGN in the local Universe, and in particular of the class of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies. However, some differences also emerged, likely due to the radically different evolutionary path and the environment where LRDs and NLS1s live. In this work, we review the multiwavelength properties of local NLS1s and compare them with type 1 AGN found at high-z, showing that despite some differences, the study of NLS1s can be extremely useful to better understand the extreme accretion physics of high-z quasars and the early stages of AGN evolution.

### 170) [2509.03571](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03571v1): Do Little Red Dots Vary?

<p> Amy Secunda, Rachel S. Somerville, Yan-Fei Jiang, Jenny E. Greene, Lukas J. Furtak, Adi Zitrin </p>
<p>
Little red dots (LRDs), high-redshift, compact, red objects with V-shaped spectra, are one of the most exciting and perplexing discoveries made by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). While the simplest explanation for LRDs is that they are high redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN), due to their compactness and frequent association with broad line emission, the lack of corresponding X-ray emission and observed variability cast doubt on this picture. Here, we simulate LRD light curves using both traditional models for sub-Eddington AGN variability derived empirically from lower-redshift AGN observations and moderately super-Eddington AGN disk models from radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations to examine the reason for the lack of variability. We find that even though most LRDs have only been observed 2&ndash;4 times in a given waveband, we should still be detecting significantly more variability if traditional sub-Eddington AGN variability models can be applied to LRDs. Instead, our super-Eddington model light curves are consistent with the lack of observed LRD variability. In addition, the ongoing high-cadence \sc nexus campaign will detect changes in magnitude, &Delta; m&gt;1, for traditional sub-Eddington models, but will only observe significant continuum variability for the lowest mass LRDs for our super-Eddington AGN models. Even if LRDs lack continuum variability, we find that the ongoing spectroscopic JWST campaign \sc twinkle should observe broad emission line variability as long as soft X-ray irradiation manages to reach the broad line region from the inner disk. Our models show that super-Eddington accretion can easily explain the lack of continuum variability in LRDs.

### 171) [2509.03291](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03291v1): What Do Radio Emission Constraints Tell Us About Little Red Dots as Tidal Disruption Events?

<p> Krisztina Perger, Judit Fogasy, Sándor Frey </p>
<p>
The real nature of little red dots (LRDs), a class of very compact galaxies in the early Universe recently discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope, is still poorly understood. The most popular theories competing to interpret the phenomena include active galactic nuclei and enhanced star formation in dusty galaxies. To date, however, neither model gives a completely satisfactory explanation to the population as a whole; thus, alternative theories have arisen, including tidal disruption events (TDEs). By considering observational constraints on the radio emission of LRDs, we discuss whether TDEs are adequate alternatives solving these high-redshift enigmas. We utilise radio flux density upper limits from LRD stacking analyses, TDE peak radio luminosities, and volumetric density estimates. We find that the characteristic values of flux densities and luminosities allow radio-quiet TDEs as the underlying process of LRDs in any case, while the less common radio-loud TDEs are compatible with the model under special constraints only. Considering other factors, such as volumetric density estimates, delayed and long-term radio flares of TDEs, and cosmological time dilation, TDEs appear to be a plausible explanation for LRDs from the radio point of view.

### 172) [2509.03283](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03283v2): A two-phase model of galaxy formation: IV. Seeding and growing supermassive black holes in dark matter halos

<p> Yangyao Chen, Houjun Mo, Huiyuan Wang </p>
<p>
We present a theoretical framework for seeding and growing supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in dark matter halos along their assembly histories. Seeds are bred out of Pop-III stars formed during the first collapse of pristine gas in mini-halos that have reached the H<sub>2</sub>-cooling limit, modulated by UV radiation from star formation and dynamical heating from fast halo assembly. Such breeding persists until the enrichment of the intergalactic medium (IGM) enables Pop-II stars to form. Post-seeding growth of black holes (BHs) is driven by distinct channels, starting with episodic super-Eddington accretion associated with nuclear bursts induced by global disturbances of galaxies, followed by sustained sub-Eddington accretion via capturing sub-clouds formed in self-gravitating gas clouds (SGCs) in halos of fast assembly, and ending with merger-dominated, quiescent growth. We implement the model in subhalo merger trees to build a coherent framework to follow the SMBH-galaxy-halo co-evolution over their full lives in the full structure hierarchy. BH seeds are bred with a broad mass spectrum of M_BH = 10&ndash;10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z ≈ 20&ndash;30 in mini-halos with masses of 10^5&ndash;10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Nuclear bursts provide the key condition for seeds to grow into SMBHs. The M_BH-M_* relation is a multi-piece, redshift-dependent function shaped by the interplay among different growth channels. Our model predictions are broadly consistent with existing observations; especially, a population of BHs reminiscent of 'little red dots' (LRDs) discovered by JWST naturally results from the seeding and growing processes. Potential future tests of the model are discussed.

<p> Yi-Yang Li, Hai-Long Huang, Yun-Song Piao </p>
<p>
Recently James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have observed an excess of luminous galaxies at high redshifts (z ≳ 10). In this work, we investigate whether supermassive primordial black holes (SMPBHs) can explain it by their influence on the ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) of high-redshift galaxies. Through Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, we constrain the parameters relevant with SMPBHs against current JWST observational data. The results reveal that SMPBHs with masses M_PBH ~ 10^6.3-8.3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, abundances f_PBH ~ 10^-7 -10^-5, and sub-Eddington ratios &lambda;_E \ll 1 can effectively enhance the bright end of the UV LF, consistent with JWST observations.

<p> Vahid Asadi, Nima Chartab, Akram Hasani Zonoozi, Hosein Haghi, Ghassem Gozaliasl, Aryana Haghjoo, Bahram Mobasher </p>
<p>
Accurately distinguishing between quiescent and star-forming galaxies is essential for understanding galaxy evolution. Traditional methods, such as spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, can be computationally expensive and may struggle to capture complex galaxy properties. This study aims to develop a robust and efficient machine learning (ML) classification method to identify quiescent and star-forming galaxies within the Farmer COSMOS2020 catalog. We utilized JWST wide-field light cones from the Santa Cruz semi-analytical modeling framework to train a supervised ML model, the CatBoostClassifier, using 28 color features derived from 8 mutual photometric bands within the COSMOS catalog. The model was validated against a testing set and compared to the SED-fitting method in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, and execution time. Preprocessing steps included addressing missing data, injecting observational noise, and applying a magnitude cut (ch1 &lt; 26 AB) along with a redshift range of 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5 to align the simulated and observational datasets. The ML method achieved an F1-score of 89&percnt; for quiescent galaxies, significantly outperforming the SED-fitting method, which achieved 54%. The ML model demonstrated superior recall (88% vs. 38%) while maintaining comparable precision. When applied to the COSMOS2020 catalog, the ML model predicted a systematically higher fraction of quiescent galaxies across all redshift bins within 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5 compared to traditional methods like NUVrJ and SED-fitting. This study shows that ML, combined with multi-wavelength data, can effectively identify quiescent and star-forming galaxies, providing valuable insights into galaxy evolution. The trained classifier and full classification catalog are publicly available.

### 175) [2509.02847](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02847v1): Transforming galaxies with EASE: widespread structural changes enabled by short-lived spirals

<p> Arjen van der Wel, Sharon E. Meidt </p>
<p>
We propose that galaxy structural changes - and the rapid rise of a population of galaxies with early-type morphologies at cosmic noon (1&lt;z&lt;3) - can be explained with EASE: Early, Accelerated, Secular Evolution. The mechanism relies on the torques exerted by stellar spirals in late-type galaxies that are present and active at z&gt;1.5 as revealed by JWST/NIRCam. The process is at once secular, because the transformative structural changes (heating, compaction, bulge formation) occur over many (≈10-30) orbital periods, but accelerated, because orbital times were significantly shorter than at the present day. In a first application, we take galaxy effective radius as a proxy for galaxy structure and, using new measurements of the abundance and properties of stellar spirals observed in a collection of JWST deep fields, show that EASE predicts a distribution of early-type sizes that is smaller than late-type galaxies and consistent with what is observed. The success of EASE relies on an updated picture of the influence of spiral arms, in which transience plays a key role. We present a new calculation of the characteristic wave equation in the fluid approximation that applies to steady and non-steady open spirals beyond the more traditional tight-winding limit. This shows open, transient spirals above the Jeans length growing and decaying on the order of a dynamical time in a wider region around and inside corotation than canonical steady spirals. We show that this transient activity spreads out angular momentum gains and losses, and the associated dynamical heating, giving spirals a more extended influence than a single steady spiral. The ubiquity of spirals in star-forming galaxies with M_*&gt;10^10.5M<sub>&odot;</sub> across the redshifts where early-type galaxies appear in large numbers suggests that EASE can play an important role in the morphological transformation of galaxies.

### 176) [2509.02700](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02700v1): Hierarchical assembly impedes the inference of stellar mass growth histories for individual galaxies

<p> R. K. Cochrane </p>
<p>
Some massive, quiescent galaxies at z&gt;3 appear to contain considerable numbers of old stars (forming at z&gt;7). Works inferring the star formation histories of at least one such galaxy observed with JWST have suggested that the assembly of so much stellar mass so early may challenge the well-established Cold Dark Matter (CDM) cosmological framework, or else indicate extraordinarily high past star formation efficiencies. However, these studies implicitly assume that all the stars in place at the epoch of observation assembled in-situ, i.e. in a single galaxy. In hierarchical models like CDM, massive galaxies assemble following successive mergers of smaller galaxies. Thus, inferences of the growth of stellar mass using the ages of stars within a descendant massive galaxy will be biased. In this paper, I use the TNG100 simulation to quantify this bias across a range of descendant galaxy masses and redshifts, for inferences made for different past epochs. I demonstrate that the assumption of in-situ stellar mass assembly can lead to significant biases in inferred stellar mass histories, with historic (i.e. looking back from the epoch of observation) stellar masses overestimated by over an order of magnitude in some cases. The bias increases with increasing halo mass, for inferences made further from the epoch of observation, and with decreasing descendant galaxy redshift. I derive corrections that can be applied to inferred stellar mass histories for more robust comparisons with dark matter halo mass functions at high redshift.

<p>
We present JWST/MIRI spectra from the Medium-Resolution Spectrometer of IZw18, a nearby dwarf galaxy with a metallicity of ~ 3% Solar. Here, we investigate warm molecular hydrogen, H2, observed in spectra extracted in ~ 120 pc apertures centered on eleven regions of interest. We detect 7 H2 rotational lines, some of which are among the weakest ever measured. The H2 population diagrams are fit with local-thermodynamic-equilibrium models and models of photodissociation regions. We also fit the ortho-/para-H2 ratios (OPRs); in three of the six regions for which it was possible to fit the OPR, we find values significantly greater than 3, the maximum value for local thermodynamic equilibrium. To our knowledge, although predicted theoretically, this is the first time that OPR significantly &gt; 3 has been measured in interstellar gas. We find that OPR tends to increase with decreasing H2 column density, consistent with the expected effects of self-shielding in advancing photodissociation fronts. The population diagrams are consistent with H nucleon densities of ~ 10^5 cm^-3, and an interstellar radiation field scaling factor, G0, of ~ 10^3. This warm, dense H2 gas co-exists with the same highly ionized gas that emits [OIV] and [NeV]. Emission from T ≥ 50K dust is detected, including an as-yet unidentified dust emission feature near 14 &mu;m; possible identification as Al_2O_3 is discussed. The continuum emission from several regions requires that a considerable fraction of the refractory elements be incorporated in dust. Despite stacking spectra in the SE where H2 is found, no significant emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is detected.

### 178) [2509.02662](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02662v1): No Luminous Little Red Dots: A Sharp Cutoff in Their Luminosity Function

<p>
One of the most surprising results of early James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations is the discovery of an abundance of red, compact, broad-line objects dubbed "little red dots" (LRDs) at z&gt;4. Their spatial density (~10^-4-10^-5 cMpc^-3) is 100 times more abundant than UV-selected quasars at those redshift if one extrapolates the quasar luminosity function (QLF) down to the LRD regime. However, whether LRDs dominate black hole accretion at quasar-like luminosities (L_bol≳ 10^45-46 erg s<sup>-1</sup>) remains unanswered, as probing the bright end of the LRD luminosity function requires a much larger area than those able to be surveyed by JWST. In this work, we present our search for the brightest LRDs (K&lt;23.7) at 4.5&lt;z&lt;4.9 using wide-area multiwavelength imaging surveys from the near-UV to the infrared bands. With over 15 square degrees of sky coverage, we only identify one single LRD candidate at z<sub>phot</sub>≈4.6, which translates into a spatial density of n(M_5100&lt;-23.5)≈10^-8 cMpc^-3 &ndash; this is nearly 10 times less abundant than the UV-selected quasars at similar optical luminosity. When combined with the LRD sample identified by JWST at the same redshift range, we find a sharp cutoff in the optical luminosity function at &lambda; L_5100≈2.5×10^44 erg s<sup>-1</sup>, while the QLF turnover occurs at ≳20 times higher luminosity. We therefore confirm the exclusively low-luminosity nature of LRDs, ruling out that LRDs are the counter parts of quasars. Furthermore, we speculate that, if the shape of the luminosity function holds up, it points to LRDs being powered by low-mass black holes with a narrow range of Eddington-level accretion rates.

### 179) [2509.02664](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02664v1): Little Red Dots Are Nurseries of Massive Black Holes

<p> Fabio Pacucci, Lars Hernquist, Michiko Fujii </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a previously unknown population of compact, red galaxies at z ~ 5, known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). With effective radii of ~ 100 pc and stellar masses of 10^9-10^11   M<sub>&odot;</sub>, a purely stellar interpretation implies extreme central densities, &rho;<sub>&sext;</sub>~10^4-10^5   M<sub>&odot;</sub>   pc^-3 and in some cases up to ~ 10^9   M<sub>&odot;</sub>   pc^-3, far exceeding those of globular clusters. At such densities, the dynamical friction time for 10   M<sub>&odot;</sub> stars in the central 0.1 pc is &lt; 0.1 Myr, driving rapid mass segregation. We investigate the dynamical consequences of such an environment using: (i) a Fokker-Planck analysis of long-term core evolution, (ii) an analytical model for the collisional growth of a very massive star (VMS), and (iii) direct N-body simulations. All approaches show that runaway collisions produce a VMS with mass 9×10^3 &lt; M_VMS   [M<sub>&odot;</sub>] &lt; 5×10^4 within &lt;1 Myr. Once the supply of massive stars is depleted, the VMS contracts on a ~ 8000 yr Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale and undergoes a general relativistic collapse, leaving a massive black hole of mass M<sub>&bull;</sub> ~ 10^4   M<sub>&odot;</sub>. We conclude that LRDs are natural nurseries for the formation of heavy black hole seeds via stellar-dynamical processes. This pathway produces seed number densities that far exceed those expected from direct collapse models, and, owing to the dense residual stellar core, can sustain high rates of tidal disruption events.

### 180) [2509.02667](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02667v1): Probing Thin Winds in Massive OB Stars of the SMC with JWST/NIRSPEC Br-alpha Spectroscopy

<p>
Mass loss is a key physical process in the evolution of massive stars, the impact of which propagates into galactic evolution, population synthesis models, the interpretation of high-redshift galaxies, and explosive events such as supernovae. However, there are currently substantial uncertainties in the low-metallicity, low-luminosity thin wind regime where classical diagnostics (H-alpha and ultraviolet, UV, P Cygni profiles) yield wind momenta that are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude below prescriptions implemented by default in most evolutionary models. Here, we present spectra of the mass-loss diagnostic line Br-alpha in 15 OB-type stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud obtained using the Near Infrared Spectrograph on the James Webb Space Telescope. The line profile morphology, recovered by virtue of the outstanding signal-to-noise ratio of the data and the avoidance of regions with nebular emission, is consistent with predictions based on previous mass-loss rate estimates from optical and UV spectroscopy. Moreover, an initial spectroscopic analysis of sources covering the thin wind regime confirms the low mass-loss rates, indicates a change of slope in the wind-momentum-luminosity relation in this regime with respect to high-luminosity objects, and strengthens the abovementioned discrepancies with commonly used wind-momentum prescriptions.

### 181) [2509.02431](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02431v1): Can an Anti-de Sitter Vacuum in the Dark Energy Sector Explain JWST High-Redshift Galaxy and Reionization Observations?

<p> Anirban Chakraborty, Tirthankar Roy Choudhury, Anjan Ananda Sen, Purba Mukherjee </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope's (JWST) discovery of an unexpectedly high abundance of UV-bright galaxies at redshifts z &gt; 10 poses a significant challenge to the standard &Lambda;CDM cosmology. This work tests whether this tension can be resolved solely by modifying the cosmological background, without invoking significant evolution in the astrophysical properties of early galaxies. We investigate an alternative framework featuring the presence of an anti-de Sitter vacuum in the dark energy sector, a model that naturally arises in quantum gravity models like string theory and can enhance early structure formation. Using a self-consistent semi-analytical model that couples galaxy evolution with reionization, we confront this scenario with a wide range of observations. We first show that while a model tailored to fit the high-z UV luminosity functions (UVLFs) shows promise, it is in strong tension with well-established cosmological constraints from the CMB and other low-redshift probes. Conversely, models within this framework that are consistent with these constraints provide only a modest boost to structure formation and fail to reproduce the observed JWST galaxy abundances at z &gt; 10. While these models remain consistent with the cosmic reionization history, our primary result is that this class of cosmological modifications is insufficient on its own to explain the galaxy excess. Our study underscores the critical importance of holistic testing for any beyond-&Lambda;CDM proposal; apparent success in one observational regime does not guarantee overall viability. By demonstrating the limitations of a purely cosmological solution, our results strengthen the case that evolving astrophysical properties are a necessary ingredient for solving the challenge of early galaxy formation.

<p>
We present a systematic search for broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST sample of 18 star-forming galaxies (M<sub>&sext;</sub>&gt;10^9.5~M<sub>&odot;</sub>) at redshifts z=4.4-5.7. Using JWST/NIRSpec IFU, we identify 7 AGN candidates through the detection of broad \Ha emission lines from 33 aperture spectra centred on photometric peaks. These candidates include one highly robust AGN detection with FWHM ~ 2800 \kms and six showing broad components with FWHM ~ 600-1600 \kms, with two in a merger system. We highlight that only broad-line detection is effective since these candidates uniformly lie within narrow emission-line ratio diagnostic diagrams where star-forming galaxies and AGNs overlap. The broad-line AGN fraction ranges from 5.9&percnt; to 33&percnt;, depending on the robustness of the candidates. Assuming that the majority are AGNs, the relatively high AGN fraction is likely due to targeting high-mass galaxies, where simulations demonstrate that broad-line detection is more feasible. Their black hole masses range from 10^6 to 10^7.5~M<sub>&odot;</sub> with 0.1 ≲ L_bol/L_Edd≲ 1. Counter to previous JWST studies at high redshift that found overmassive black holes relative to their host galaxies, our candidates lie close to or below the local M_BH-M<sub>&sext;</sub> scaling relations, thus demonstrating the effect of selection biases. This study provides new insights into AGN-host galaxy co-evolution at high redshift by identifying faint broad-line AGNs in galaxy samples, highlighting the importance of considering mass-dependent selection biases and the likelihood of a large population of AGNs being undermassive and just now being tapped by JWST.

<p>
One of the main open issues in galaxy formation and evolution is the early assembly of the most massive galaxies and their contribution to the stellar mass and star formation rate densities at early epochs. Massive red sources already in place at z &gt; 2 to 3 have been found in deep Spitzer-IRAC and ALMA surveys. They are often called optically and near-IR dark, or HST-dark, being undetected even in the deepest HST frames. The submillimeter (i.e., ALMA) detection of these sources confirms their high-z dusty nature: they are massive (e.g., log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &gt; 10) and dusty star-forming galaxies with estimated redshifts in the 2.5 to 7 range. They seem to lie mostly below the main sequence (MS) of star-forming galaxies and show gas depletion times &lt;1 Gyr. Imaging with the PRIMA/PRIMAger instrument over the full 25 to 265 micron range will allow us to characterize their still uncovered spectral energy distributions between JWST and ALMA spectral windows, probing their dust content and properties (e.g., temperature, mass), whereas spectroscopic observations with FIRESS will be the key to investigate the nature of their powering source (e.g., AGN or star formation) and to study the physics of their ISM, by detecting and measuring fine structure lines in the mid- and far-IR domain.

The UV-optical dust attenuation curve is key to interpreting the intrinsic properties of galaxies and provides insights into the nature of dust grains and their geometry relative to stars. In this work, we constrain the UV-optical slope of the stellar attenuation curve using a spectroscopic-redshift sample of ~3300 galaxies at z~1-9, to characterize the diversity and redshift evolution of stellar attenuation curves and to gain insight into dust production and evolution at high redshifts. The sample is constructed from three JWST/NIRCam grism surveys in GOODS and A2744 fields, with a wealth of JWST/NIRCam and HST photometry. With constraints from spectroscopic redshifts and emission line fluxes, we use the Prospector SED fitting code with a flexible dust model. We find that the attenuation curve slope varies strongly with Av at all redshifts, becoming flatter at higher attenuation. We find no strong correlation between attenuation curve slope and size or axis ratio, and the trends with stellar mass and star-formation rate are largely driven by their correlation with Av. We find strong evidence that at fixed Av, the curve becomes flatter with increasing redshift. On average, the attenuation curves derived here are shallower than those at z~0 and than the SMC curve. The highest redshift galaxies at z=7-9 (124 galaxies, a significantly larger sample than in previous studies) show slopes even flatter than the Calzetti curve, implying reduced UV obscuration and lower IR luminosities than expected from an SMC dust curve, by as large as an order of magnitude. Hydrodynamical simulations that couple dust growth to gas chemical enrichment successfully reproduce the different loci of high- and low-redshift galaxies in the slope-Av diagram, suggesting that dust in high-redshift galaxies is increasingly dominated by large grains produced in supernova ejecta with limited ISM processing at early times.

<p>
We present new JWST/NIRCam observations of the interacting dwarf galaxy system NGC 4485/NGC 4490 (a.k.a. Arp 269), obtained as part of the Cycle 1 Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic Star clusTers (FEAST) program. NGC 4485 and NGC 4490 form the closest known pair of interacting late-type dwarf galaxies (at ~ 7.4 Mpc), excluding the Magellanic Clouds. Near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) reveal a wide range of stellar populations in both galaxies, including young (≲ 200 Myr) upper main sequence stars, core helium-burning stars, and oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We also identify intermediate-age (~ 200 Myr &ndash; 1 Gyr) carbon-rich AGB stars and a well-populated old (≳ 1 Gyr) red giant branch (RGB). The CMDs show two distinct bursts of star formation beginning ~ 30 Myr and ~ 200 Myr ago, the latter consistent with the most recent pericenter passage predicted by N-body simulations. The spatial distribution of stars reveals a tidal bridge extending from NGC 4485 and connecting to the disk of NGC 4490. Compact star-forming regions are seen along NGC 4490's spiral arms, possibly originating from its infrared nucleus. A significant metallicity gradient is observed in the young stellar populations forming the bridge. These findings suggest that during the last pericenter passage, gas was stripped from NGC 4485 via tidal forces or ram pressure, accreted by NGC 4490, and mixed with in-situ material, fueling ongoing star formation. This system provides a unique nearby laboratory for studying how tidal interactions shape the star formation and chemical enrichment history of dwarf galaxies.

<p> Andreas L. Faisst, Chian-Chou Chen, Laure Ciesla, Carlotta Gruppioni </p>
<p>
The cosmic evolution of obscured star formation, dust properties and production mechanisms, and the prevalence of dust-obscured AGN out to high redshifts are currently some of the hot topics in astrophysics. While much progress has been made in the early days with Spitzer and Herschel, these facilities have not reached the necessary depths to observe the mid-IR light of high-redshift (z &gt; 3) galaxies. Recently, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has filled in the blue side of the rest-frame mid-IR. The Atacama Large (Sub)Millimeter Array (ALMA), on the other hand, provides excellent sensitivity in the far-IR regime, allowing the study of dust and gas properties at high redshifts. Filling the wavelength gap between JWST and ALMA is crucial to progress our understanding of early galaxy evolution - and this will be an important goal in the next decades. The Probe far-IR Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA), with sensitive imaging and spectroscopic capabilities at 24-240&mu;m and currently in Phase A study, will achieve this and provide insights into early galaxy evolution, Black Hole growth, and dust production mechanisms. Here we present PRIDES, a possible deep and wide-area survey over 1.6 square-degrees of the COSMOS field with PRIMA to study these science cases.

<p>
We present a combined HST and JWST 0.2 - to - 5 &mu;m analysis of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of emerging young star clusters (eYSCs) in four nearby galaxies from the Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic Star clusTers (FEAST) survey: M51, M83, NGC 628, and NGC 4449. These clusters, selected for their bright Pa&alpha; and 3.3 &mu;m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission, are still associated to their natal gas cloud and have been largely missed in previous HST optical campaigns. We modeled their SEDs using the CIGALE fitting code and identified: i) a systematic flux excess at 1.5 - 2.5 &mu;m that is not accounted for by current stellar population models; ii) the preference for a set of dust model parameters that is not aligned with expectations from self-consistent analyses of star-forming regions, suggesting model shortcomings also in the 3 - 5 &mu;m. The near-infrared (NIR) excess is most prominent in low-mass (≤ 3000 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) and young (≤ 6 Myr) clusters. Additionally, we see that the SED fitting analysis wrongly assigns ages ≥ 6 Myr to a fraction of strong Pa&alpha; emitters with equivalent widths suggestive of significantly younger ages. A parallel analysis with the slug code suggests that stochastic initial mass function (IMF) sampling of pre-main-sequence stars combined with extinction might partially reduce the gap. We conclude that the inclusion of young stellar object SEDs, along with more realistic sampling of the cluster IMF, might be needed to fully account for the stellar population and dust properties of eYSCs.

### 188) [2509.01667](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01667v1): The Perfect Host: JWST Cepheid Observations in a Background-Free SN Ia Host Confirm No Bias in Hubble-Constant Measurements

Cycle 1 JWST observations of Cepheids in SN Ia hosts resolved their red-giant-dominated NIR backgrounds, sharply reducing crowding and showing that photometric bias in lower-resolution HST data does not account for the Hubble tension. We present Cycle 2 JWST observations of &gt;100 Cepheids in NGC 3447, a unique system that pushes this test to the limit by transitioning from low to no background contamination. NGC 3447, an SN Ia host at D~25 Mpc, is an interacting pair comprising (i) a spiral with mixed stellar populations, typical of H0 calibrators, and (ii) a young, star-forming companion (NGC 3447A) devoid of old stars and hence stellar crowdinga rare "perfect host" for testing photometric bias. We detect ~60 long-period Cepheids in each, enabling a "three-way comparison" across HST, JWST, and background-free conditions. We find no component-to-component offset (sigma&lt;0.03 mag; a calibration independent test), and a 50% reduction in scatter to ~0.12 mag in the background-free case, the tightest seen for any SN Ia host. Across Cycles 1-2 we also measure Cepheids in all SH0ES hosts observed by JWST (19 hosts of 24 SNe Ia; &gt;50% of the sample) and find no evidence of bias relative to HST photometry, including for the most crowded, distant hosts. These observations constitute the most rigorous test yet of Cepheid distances and provide strong evidence for their reliability. Combining JWST Cepheid measurements in 19 hosts (24 SNe Ia) with HST data (37 hosts, 42 SNe Ia) yields H0 = 73.49 +/- 0.93 km/s/Mpc. Including 35 TRGB-based calibrations (from HST and JWST) totals 55 SNe Ia and gives H0 = 73.18 +/- 0.88 km/s/Mpc, ~6 sigma above the LambdaCDM+CMB expectation.

JWST has uncovered a diverse population of extreme near-infrared dropouts, including ultra high-redshift (z&gt;15) galaxy candidates, dust-obscured galaxies challenging dust production theories, sources with strong Balmer breaks - possibly compact AGN in dense environments - and cold, sub-stellar Galactic objects. This work presents Capotauro, a F356W-dropout in the CEERS survey with F444W AB magnitude of ~27.68 and a sharp &gt;3 mag flux drop between 3.5-4.5 &mu;m, undetected below 3.5 &mu;m. We combine JWST/NIRCam, MIRI, and NIRSpec/MSA data with HST/ACS and WFC3 observations to perform a spectro-photometric analysis of Capotauro using multiple SED-fitting codes. Our setup tests z≥15 as well as z&lt;10 dusty, Balmer-break or strong-line galaxy solutions, and the possibility of Capotauro being a Milky Way sub-stellar object. Among extragalactic options, our analysis favors interpreting the sharp drop as a Lyman break at z~32, consistent with the epoch of formation of the first stars and black holes, with only ~0.5&percnt; of the posterior volume at z&lt;25. Lower-redshift solutions struggle to reproduce the extreme break, suggesting that if Capotauro lies at z&lt;10, it must show a non-standard combination of strong dust attenuation and/or Balmer breaks, making it a peculiar interloper. Alternatively, its properties match a very cold (Y2-Y3 type) brown dwarf or a free-floating exoplanet with a record-breaking combination of low temperature and large distance (T_eff&lt;300 K, d≳130 pc, up to ~2 kpc). While current data cannot determine its nature, Capotauro emerges as a remarkably unique object in all plausible scenarios, and a compelling target for follow-up.

### 190) [2509.01483](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01483v1): The JCMT Gould Belt Survey Complete Core Catalogue: Core mass function variations between nearby molecular clouds

We present a catalogue of dense cores identified in James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) Gould Belt Survey SCUBA-2 observations of nearby star-forming clouds. We identified 2257 dense cores using the getsources algorithm, of which 59% are starless, and 41% are potentially protostellar. 71% of the starless cores are prestellar core candidates, suggesting a prestellar core lifetime similar to that of Class 0/I YSOs. Higher-mass clouds have a higher fraction of prestellar cores compared to protostars, suggesting a longer average prestellar core lifetime. We assessed completeness by inserting critically-stable Bonnor&ndash;Ebert spheres into a blank SCUBA-2 field: completeness scales as distance squared, with an average mass recovery fraction of 73±6% for recovered sources. We calculated core masses and radii, and assessed their gravitational stability using the Bonnor-Ebert criterion. Maximum starless core mass scales with cloud complex mass with an index 0.58± 0.13, consistent with the behaviour of maximum stellar masses in embedded clusters. We performed least-squares and Monte Carlo modelling of the core mass functions (CMFs) of our starless and prestellar core samples. The CMFs can be characterised using log-normal distributions: we do not sample the full range of core masses needed to create the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF). The CMFs of the clouds are not consistent with being drawn from a single underlying distribution. The peak mass of the starless core CMF increases with cloud mass; the prestellar CMF of the more distant clouds has a peak mass ~ 3× the log-normal peak for the system IMF, implying a ~ 33% prestellar core-to-star efficiency.

### 191) [2509.01305](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01305v1): Sieging HELM's deep: PRIMA unveils the far-infrared properties of highly extincted low-mass galaxies

<p> Laura Bisigello, Carlotta Gruppioni, Giulia Rodighiero, Giovanni Gandolfi, James M. S. Donnellan, Seb Oliver, Stephen M. Wilkins, L. Y. Aaron Yung </p>
<p>
Although the majority of star-forming galaxies show a tight correlation between stellar mass and dust extinction, recent James Webb Space Telescope observations have revealed a peculiar population of Highly Extincted Low-Mass (HELM) galaxies, which could revolutionise our understanding of dust production mechanisms. To fully understand the dust content of these galaxies, which are a minority of the overall galaxy population, far-infrared observations over large areas are pivotal. In this paper, we derive the expected PRIMAger, the far-IR (24-235&mu; m) imaging camera proposed for the Probe far-IR Mission for Astrophysics, fluxes for a set of photometric candidates HELM galaxies. Taking into account a deep survey of 1000h over 1  deg<sup>2</sup>, we expect to detect around 3.1 × 10^4 HELM sources in at least one PRIMAger filter, 100 of which are at z=1-1.5. For 32% of this sample, there will be observations in at least four PRIMAger filters, covering at least the 90 to 240&mu; m wavelength range, which will allow us to obtain a detailed fit of the dust emission and estimate the dust mass.

### 192) [2509.01302](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01302v1): An AGB star as the source of the abundance pattern of hyper-metal-poor star HE 1327-2326

<p> P. Gil-Pons, S. W. Campbell, C. L. Doherty, M. Lugaro </p>
<p>
Abridged. HE 1327-2326 (HE 1327), with [Fe/H]=-5.2, is one of the most metal-poor stars detected and a candidate to be the offspring of the first stars. Numerous efforts have been made to match its abundance pattern. However, no model satisfactorily explains its entire surface chemical composition. The high CNO pattern with [N/Fe]&gt;[C/Fe]&gt;[O/Fe], the light element 'slide' (between Na and Si), and the presence of Sr and Ba in HE 1327 is reminiscent of those asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars that undergo third dredge-up, hot bottom burning, and s-processing, suggesting that AGBs may have been progenitors of the star. We assume that, where HE 1327 formed, the interstellar medium was well-mixed, and adopt an initial stellar composition based on the observed chemical evolution of the early universe. We calculated models of hyper-metal-poor AGB stars and compared their yields to the observed abundances of HE 1327. Our 3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> models match 13 of the 14 measured elements in HE1327. They are also consistent with the seven elements with upper limits. The only discrepancy is O, underproduced by 0.5-1.0 dex. Unlike the SN models, the AGB models also match Sr and Ba. Our model predicts high abundances of P and Pb, which would be useful in testing the AGB scenario. We propose that HE 1327 is the oldest known object that shows nucleosynthetic evidence of the first AGB stars. With lifetimes as short as 200 Myr, these stars may have formed and polluted the universe very early. Recent Pop III star formation simulations support their formation, and their strong N production is qualitatively consistent with recent JWST observations showing high N/O ratios just 440 Myr after the Big Bang. Importantly, our results also suggest that the interstellar medium may have shown some degree of homogeneity and mixing even at these early epochs.

### 193) [2509.01122](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01122v1): Unveiling Stellar Feedback and Cloud Structure in the ρ Ophiuchi A Region with ALMA and JWST: Discovery of Substellar Cores, C^18O Striations, and Protostellar Outflows

<p>
In clustered star-forming regions, stellar feedback-such as HII regions/photon-dominated regions (PDRs), and protostellar jets/outflows-shapes cloud structures and influences star formation. Using high-resolution ALMA millimeter and JWST infrared data, we analyze the cloud structure and the impact of stellar feedback in the nearest dense cluster-forming region Oph A. All 6 known Class 0/I and 2 of 6 Flat Spectrum/Class II objects are detected in the 1.3 mm dust continuum. Additionally, we newly detected 7 substellar cores, three of which show compact near-infrared emission, suggesting they are young substellar objects. The remaining cores, with masses of 0.01 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and high densities, are likely gravitationally bound. They appear connected by faint CO finger-like structures extending from the triple Class 0 system VLA1623-2417 Aa+Ab+B, suggesting they may have been ejected from the close binary VLA1623 Aa+Ab. 12CO and near-infrared data reveal multiple protostellar outflows. From the comparison, we identified several new outflows/jets, and shocked structures associated to the GSS30 large bipolar bubble. Strong 12CO emission traces the eastern edge of the Oph A ridge, forming part of the expanding HII/PDR bubble driven by the nearby Herbig Be star S1. The northern ridge appears blown out, with warm gas flowing toward GSS 30, injecting additional turbulent momentum. Several C18O striations in the S1 bubble align with magnetic fields, and position-velocity diagrams show wave-like patterns, possibly reflecting magnetohydrodynamic waves. Stellar feedback significantly influences Oph A's cloud structure.

### 194) [2509.01026](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01026v1): The Aromatic Infrared Bands around the Wolf-Rayet Binary WR140 Revealed by JWST

<p>
We have analyzed the aromatic infrared bands (AIBs) in the 6-11.2 &mu;m range around the Wolf-Rayet binary WR140 (d=1.64 kpc) obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MRS). In WR140's circumstellar environment, we have detected AIBs at 6 &mu;m and 7.7 &mu;m which are attributed to C-C stretching modes. These features have been detected in the innermost dust shell (Shell1; ~2100 au from WR140), the subsequent dust shell (Shell2; ~5200 au), and "off-shell'' regions in the MRS coverage. The 11.2 &mu;m AIB, which is associated with the C-H out-of-plane bending mode, has been tentatively detected in Shell2 and the surrounding off-shell positions around Shell2. We compared the AIB features from WR140 to spectra of established AIB feature classes A, B, C, and D. The detected features around WR140 do not agree with these established classes. The peak wavelengths and full width half maxima (FWHMs) of the 6 &mu;m and 7.7 &mu;m features are, however, consistent with those of R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars with hydrogen-poor conditions. We discuss a possible structure of carbonaceous compounds and environments where they form around WR140. It is proposed that hydrogen-poor carbonaceous compounds initially originate from the carbon-rich WR wind, and the hydrogen-rich stellar wind from the companion O star may provide hydrogen to these carbonaceous compounds.

Watson, Xin Wang, Zhuyun Zhuang </p>
<p>
During the second half of Cycle 1 of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we conducted the Parallel Application of Slitless Spectroscopy to Analyze Galaxy Evolution (PASSAGE) program. PASSAGE received the largest allocation of JWST observing time in Cycle 1, 591 hours of NIRISS observations to obtain direct near-IR imaging and slitless spectroscopy. About two thirds of these were ultimately executed, to observe 63 high-latitude fields in Pure Parallel mode. These have provided more than ten thousand near-infrared grism spectrograms of faint galaxies. PASSAGE brings unique advantages in studying galaxy evolution: A) Unbiased spectroscopic search, without prior photometric pre-selection. By including the most numerous galaxies, with low masses and strong emission lines, slitless spectroscopy is the indispensable complement to any pre-targeted spectroscopy; B) The combination of several dozen independent fields to overcome cosmic variance; C) Near-infrared spectral coverage, often spanning the full range from 1.0&ndash;2.3 &mu;m, with minimal wavelength gaps, to measure multiple diagnostic rest-frame optical lines, minimizing sensitivity to dust reddening; D) JWST's unprecedented spatial resolution, in some cases using two orthogonal grism orientations, to overcome contamination due to blending of overlapping spectra; E) Discovery of rare bright objects especially for detailed JWST followup. PASSAGE data are public immediately, and our team plans to deliver fully-processed high-level data products. In this PASSAGE overview, we describe the survey and data quality, and present examples of these accomplishments in several areas of current interest in the evolution of emission-line galaxy properties, particularly at low masses.

### 196) [2509.00153](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00153v1): Quasar Radiative Feedback May Suppress Galaxy Growth on Intergalactic Scales at z = 6.3

<p>
We present observational evidence that intense ionizing radiation from a luminous quasar suppresses nebular emission in nearby galaxies on intergalactic scales at z=6.3. Using JWST/NIRCam grism spectroscopy from the SAPPHIRES and EIGER programs, we identify a pronounced decline in [O III] &lambda;5008 luminosity relative to the UV continuum (L_5008/L_1500) among galaxies within ~10 comoving Mpc (cMpc) of the quasar J0100+2802, the most UV-luminous quasar known at this epoch (M_1450=-29.26). While L_1500 remains roughly constant with transverse distance, L_5008 increases significantly, suggesting suppression of very recent star formation toward the quasar. The effect persists after controlling for completeness, local density, and UV luminosity, and correlates with the projected photoionization-rate profile \Gamma_qso. A weaker but directionally consistent suppression in L_5008/L_1500 is also observed along the line of sight. The transverse suppression radius (~8-10 cMpc) implies a recent radiative episode with a cumulative duration ~4.5 Myr, shorter than required for thermal photoheating to dominate and thus more naturally explained by rapid H<sub>2</sub> photodissociation and related radiative processes. Environmental effects alone appear insufficient to explain the signal. Our results provide direct, geometry-based constraints on large-scale quasar radiative feedback and recent quasar lifetimes.

<p>
Thus far, Lyman-&alpha; damping wings towards quasars have been used to probe the itglobal ionization state of the foreground intergalactic medium (IGM). A new parameterization has demonstrated that the damping wing signature also carries itlocal information about the distribution of neutral hydrogen (HI) in front of the quasar before it started shining. Leveraging a recently introduced Bayesian ttJAX-based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) inference framework, we derive constraints on the Lorentzian-weighted HI column density N_HI^DW, the quasar's distance r_patch to the first neutral patch and its lifetime t_Q based on JWST/NIRSpec spectra of the two z ~ 7.5 quasars J1007+2115 and J1342+0928. After folding in model-dependent topology information, we find that J1007+2115 (and J1342+0928) is most likely to reside in a &langle; x_HI &rangle; = 0.32_-0.20^+0.22 (0.58_-0.23^+0.23) neutral IGM while shining for a remarkably short lifetime of log_10 t_Q /yr = 4.14_-0.18^+0.74 (an intermediate lifetime of 5.64_-0.43^+0.25) along a sightline with log_10 N_HI^DW /cm<sup>2</sup> = 19.70_-0.86^+0.35 (20.24_-0.22^+0.25) and r_patch = 28.9_-14.4^+54.0  cMpc (10.9_-5.9^+5.6  cMpc). In light of the potential presence of local absorbers in the foreground of J1342+0928 as has been recently suggested, we also demonstrate how the Lorentzian-weighted column density N_HI^DW provides a natural means for quantifying their contribution to the observed damping wing signal.

<p>
We investigate the nature and spectroscopic diversity of early galaxies from a sample of 40 sources at z&gt;10 with JWST/NIRSpec prism observations, the largest of its kind thus far. We compare the properties of strong UV line emitters, as traced by intense CIV emission, with those of more "typical" sources with weak or undetected CIV. The more typical (or "CIV-weak") sources reveal significant scatter in their CIII] line strengths, UV continuum slopes, and physical sizes, spanning CIII] equivalent widths of ~1-51 &#8491;, UV slopes of &beta;~-1.6 to -2.6, and half-light radii of ~50-1000 pc. In contrast, CIV-strong sources generally occupy the tail of these distributions, with CIII] EWs of 16-51 &#8491;, UV slopes &beta;&lt;-2.5, compact morphologies (r_50&lt;100 pc), and elevated star formation surface densities (&Sigma;_SFR&gt;100 M<sub>&odot;</sub>yr^-1kpc^-2). Collectively these properties are consistent with concentrated starbursts that temporarily outshine the extended structure of the galaxy. Comparing average properties from composite spectra, we find the diversity of the sample is primarily driven by bursts and lulls of star formation on very short timescales (&lt;3 Myr), where strong CIV emitters are observed at the apex of these phases and sources devoid of emission lines represent periods of relative inactivity. An apparent association between strong CIV and enhanced nitrogen abundance suggests both features may be modulated by the same duty cycle and reflect a generic mode of star formation. We show that AGN are unlikely to be a significant contributor to this duty cycle based on a comparison of UV line diagnostics to photoionisation models, although some non-thermal activity cannot be fully ruled out. Our results support a unified evolutionary picture whereby transient bursts and lulls can explain the spectral diversity and early growth of bright galaxies in the first 500 Myr.

<p>
Little Red Dots (LRDs), newly identified compact and dusty galaxies with an unexpectedly high number density observed by JWST, have an unusual "V-shaped" rest-frame UV to near-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED). A group of hyper-luminous, obscured quasars with excess blue emission, called Blue-excess Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxies (BHDs), also exhibit qualitatively similar SEDs to those of LRDs. They represent a rare population of galaxies hosting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) accreting near the Eddington limit at redshifts z ~ 1&ndash;4. In this study, we compare their multi-wavelength SEDs to investigate whether LRDs, or a subset of them, could be high-redshift analogs of BHDs. Our analysis reveals that despite their similar "V-shape" SEDs, LRDs appear to be a different population than BHDs. The "V-shape" of BHDs appear at longer wavelengths compared to LRDs due to different selection strategies, suggesting LRDs have much less dust attenuation than typical BHDs. The bluer colors in the rest-frame infrared (continuum) emission of LRDs suggest the absence of hot dust heated by AGN accretion activities. We also argue that the blue excess in LRDs is unlikely from AGN scattered light. The compact morphologies and lower X-ray detection frequencies of LRDs suggest a distinct formation pathway from BHDs &ndash; which are thought to be powered by super-Eddington accretion onto central SMBHs following major galaxy mergers.

Protoclusters, galaxy clusters' high redshift progenitors, hold the keys to understanding the formation and evolution of clusters and their member galaxies. However, their cosmological distances and spatial extensions (tens of Mpc) have inhibited complete mapping of their structure and constituent galaxies, which is key to robustly linking protoclusters to their descendants. Here we report the discovery of the Bigfoot, a tridimensional structure at z = 3.98 including 11 subgroups traced by 55 (700) spectroscopic (photometric) redshifts with JWST, extending over 15× 37 × 49cMpc^3 in the PRIMER-UDS field. Bigfoot's large-scale and mass function of member galaxies closely match constrained simulations' predictions for the progenitors of today's most massive clusters (M_0 &gt; 10^15 M__ &odot; ). All subgroups with M_h &gt; 10^12.5 M__ &odot;  exhibit enhanced fractions of massive galaxies (&gt;10^10.0 M__ &odot; ) compared to lower-mass halos and the field, demonstrating the accelerated formation of massive galaxies in massive halos. The presence of this massive protocluster with a large central halo (10^13.0 M__ &odot; ) in a JWST deep field bears important cosmological implication that favors high &sigma; _8 of PLANCK cosmology over low-redshift probes.

### 201) [2508.21114](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21114v1): Super-Eddington accretion in protogalactic cores

<p>
The presence of massive black holes (BHs) exceeding 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> already at redshift z &gt; 6 challenges standard models of BH growth. Super-Eddington (SE) accretion has emerged as a promising mechanism to solve this issue, yet its impact on early BH evolution in tailored numerical experiments remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the growth of BH seeds embedded in a gas-rich, metal-poor protogalaxy at z ~ 15, using a suite of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations that implement a slim-disc-based SE accretion model. We explore a broad parameter space varying the initial BH mass, feedback efficiency, and spin. We find that SE accretion enables rapid growth in all cases, allowing BHs to accrete up to 10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> within a few 10^3-10^4 years, independent of seed properties. Feedback regulates this process, both by depleting central gas and altering BH dynamics via star formation-driven potential fluctuations, yet even the strongest feedback regimes permit significantly greater growth than the Eddington-limited case. Growth stalls after less than ~1 Myr due to local gas exhaustion, as no large-scale inflows are present in the adopted numerical setup. Our results show that SE accretion naturally leads to BHs that are over-massive relative to their host galaxy stellar content, consistent with JWST observations. We conclude that short, low-duty-cycle SE episodes represent a viable pathway for assembling the most massive BHs observed at early cosmic times, even starting from light seeds.

### 202) [2508.21069](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21069v1): Rapid late-time reionization: constraints and cosmological implications

<p> Willem Elbers </p>
<p>
We present constraints on the reionization optical depth, &tau;, obtained using several independent methods. First, we perform a non-parametric reconstruction of the reionization history, using Lyman-&alpha; constraints on the evolution of the volume-averaged neutral hydrogen fraction, x_HI(z), including recent results from the James Webb Space Telescope. When combined with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI and Big Bang nucleosynthesis constraints, these data imply a rapid reionization history (z_mid=7.00^+0.12_-0.18 and &Delta; z_50=1.12^+0.12_-0.29) and a value of &tau;=0.0492^+0.0014_-0.0030, which is largely insensitive to the assumed cosmological model and independent of cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. The optical depth can also be measured from large-scale (&ell;&lt;30) CMB polarization data, yielding constraints that are similarly model-insensitive and consistent with the Ly&alpha; bound. Third, &tau; may be constrained from the attenuation of small-scale (&ell;&gt;30) CMB anisotropies, but the results are sensitive to the choice of cosmological model. Assuming &Lambda;CDM and combining small-scale CMB data with CMB lensing and type 1a supernovae (SNe) yields tight constraints that are compatible with the Ly&alpha; bound. Adding galaxy clustering and lensing measurements brings the constraints further into agreement with the Ly&alpha; bound. These independent results reinforce a consensus picture in which reionization is rapid and late. However, the combination of small-scale CMB, CMB lensing, and BAO data yields &tau;=0.094±0.011, which is in 4&sigma; tension with our Ly&alpha; bound. Non-standard reionization scenarios can reconcile some but not all constraints. Concordance is restored in alternative cosmological models, such as models with dynamical dark energy favoured by BAO, CMB, and SNe data.

We present HST2EUCLID, a novel Python code to generate Euclid realistic mock images in the H_E, J_E, Y_E, and I_E photometric bands based on panchromatic Hubble Space Telescope observations. The software was used to create a simulated database of Euclid images for the 27 galaxy clusters observed during the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH) and the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) program. Since the mock images were generated from real observations, they incorporate, by construction, all the complexity of the observed galaxy clusters. The simulated Euclid data of the galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1-2403 were then used to explore the possibility of developing strong lensing models based on the Euclid data. In this context, complementary photometric or spectroscopic follow-up campaigns are required to measure the redshifts of multiple images and cluster member galaxies. By Euclidising six parallel blank fields obtained during the HFF program, we provide an estimate of the number of galaxies detectable in Euclid images per deg<sup>2</sup> per magnitude bin (number counts) and the distribution of the galaxy sizes. Finally, we present a preview of the Chandra Deep Field South that will be observed during the Euclid Deep Survey and two examples of galaxy-scale strong lensing systems residing in regions of the sky covered by the Euclid Wide Survey. The methodology developed in this work lends itself to several additional applications, as simulated Euclid fields based on HST (or JWST) imaging with extensive spectroscopic information can be used to validate the feasibility of legacy science cases or to train deep learning techniques in advance, thus preparing for a timely exploitation of the Euclid Survey data.

### 204) [2508.20177](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20177v2): MEGA: Spectrophotometric SED Fitting of Little Red Dots Detected in JWST MIRI

We analyze eight spectroscopically confirmed Little Red Dots (LRDs) at redshifts z = 5.1-8.7 with JWST/NIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI data. The LRDs have red NIRCam colors, F150W-F444W &gt; 1, but flat NIRCam-MIRI colors, -0.5 &lt; F444W - F770W &lt; 0.5, suggesting weak warm/hot dust components. The LRDs have -1.0 &lt; F1000W - F1500W &lt; 1.1, suggestive of non-uniform rest near-IR properties within the sample. We model the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the LRDs using the CIGALE and Prospector codes to assess how the differing templates impact the interpretation for LRDs for cases of: (1) models with star-forming stellar populations only; (2) active galactic nuclei (AGN) dominated models; and (3) composite AGN and star-forming models. Using the Bayesian information criterion, we find that six of the eight LRDs favor AGN models compared to star-forming models, though no model reproduces all of the observed properties. Two LRDs with pronounced Balmer-breaks and broad H&alpha; have SEDs that are reproduced with hot, dense-gas (log T/K=5-5.7, log n/cm^-3 = 9-11) models with low dust attenuation (A(V)≃ 0.5 mag). However, these models require an additional thermal component (800-1400 K) to account for the MIRI data, and fail to reproduce the rest-UV and narrow [OIII] emission. The total bolometric emission from the dense-gas models, and possibly CIGALE AGN models, appear consistent with literature constraints in the far-IR and radio, and require log L_bol/L<sub>&odot;</sub>&lt;12. These results suggest that our LRDs cannot be modeled entirely with standard templates, but instead require a novel treatment of gas conditions, AGN and star-formation.

<p>
Stars and planets form within cold, dark molecular clouds. In these dense regions, where starlight cannot penetrate, cosmic rays (CRs) are the dominant source of ionization &ndash; driving interstellar chemistry(Dalgarno (2006, PNAS, 103, 12269)), setting the gas temperature(Goldsmith et al. (1969, ApJ, 158, 173)), and enabling coupling to magnetic fields(McKee & Ostriker (2007, ARA&A, 45, 565; arXiv:0707.3514)). Together, these effects regulate the collapse of clouds and the onset of star formation. Despite this importance, the cosmic-ray ionization rate, \zeta, has never been measured directly. Instead, this fundamental parameter has been loosely inferred from indirect chemical tracers and uncertain assumptions, leading to published values that span nearly two orders of magnitude and limiting our understanding of star formation physics. Here, we report the first direct detection of CR-excited vibrational H<sub>2</sub> emission, using itJames Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of the starless core Barnard 68 (B68). The observed emission pattern matches theoretical predictions for CR excitation precisely, confirming a decades-old theoretical proposal long considered observationally inaccessible. This result enables direct measurement of \zeta, effectively turning molecular clouds into natural, light-year-sized, cosmic-ray detectors. It opens a transformative observational window into the origin, propagation, and role of cosmic rays in star formation and galaxy evolution.

<p>
Though type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are found in all types of galaxies, recent local Hubble constant measurements have disfavored using SNe Ia in early-type or quiescent galaxies, aiming instead for better consistency with SNe Ia in star-forming, late-type host galaxies calibrated by Cepheid distances. Here we investigate the feasibility of a parallel distance ladder using SNe Ia exclusively in quiescent, massive (log M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub> ≥ 10) host galaxies, calibrated by tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distances. We present TRGB measurements to four galaxies: three measured from the Hubble Space Telescope with the ACS F814W filter, and one measured from the JWST NIRCam F090W filter. Combined with literature measurements, we define a TRGB calibrator sample of five high-mass, early-type galaxies that hosted well-measured SNe Ia: NGC 1316 (SN 2006dd), NGC 1380 (SN 1992A), NGC 1404 (SN 2007on, SN 2011iv), NGC 4457 (SN 2020nvb), and NGC 4636 (SN 2020ue). We jointly standardize these calibrators with a fiducial sample of 124 Hubble-flow SNe Ia from the Zwicky Transient Facility that are matched in host-galaxy and light-curve properties. Our results with this homogenized subsample show a Hubble residual scatter of under 0.11 mag, lower than usually observed in cosmological samples of the full SN~Ia distribution. We obtain a measurement of the Hubble constant, H_0 = 75.3 ± 2.9 km s<sup>-1</sup> Mpc^-1, including statistical and estimated systematic uncertainties, and discuss the potential to further improve the precision of this approach. As calibrator and supernova samples grow, we advocate that future cosmological applications of SNe Ia use subsamples matched in host-galaxy and supernova properties across redshift.

<p> Seongjae Kim, Woong-Seob Jeong, Minjin Kim, Hyunsung D. Jun, Yujin Yang, Takao Nakagawa </p>
<p>
We discovered a hyperluminous dust-obscured galaxy with mysterious blue-excess emission (BlueDOG) in rest-frame UV of its spectral energy distribution (SED) from a multi-wavelength survey in the AKARI Deep Field - South (ADF-S). We present the results of SED analysis with multiwavelength photometric data and spectroscopic analysis, observed with Gemini-S/GMOS, FLAMINGOS-2, to explore the origin of blue-excess emission of a hyperluminous BlueDOG, ADFS-KMTDOG-102, at z=2.6. The SED analysis shows that this BlueDOG is a highly massive system (log M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>=12.3) with substantial extinction. Additionally, the proportion of the old stellar population exceeds that of the young stellar population, which suggests stellar evolution cumulated from the early universe. The mass of supermassive black hole (SMBH) estimated using the extinction-corrected broad H&alpha; emission line yields log M_BH/M<sub>&odot;</sub>=10.2. We discuss the similarity between the BlueDOG and 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs), recently discovered with the James Webb Space Telescope, showing SED shapes remarkably similar to those of LRDs. The UV emission line ratios indicate that the emission lines are primarily powered by the central active galactic nuclei (AGN). In contrast, the origin of the blue-excess UV continuum remains ambiguous, since both recent star formation and AGN-induced scattered light are viable explanations, based on the results from the SED fitting and scattered light modeling.

NGC 6302 is a spectacular bipolar planetary nebula (PN) whose spectrum exhibits fast outflows and highly ionized emission lines, indicating the presence of a very hot central star (~220,000 K). Its infrared spectrum reveals a mixed oxygen and carbon dust chemistry, displaying both silicate and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features. Using the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) and Medium Resolution Spectrometer, a mosaic map was obtained over the core of NGC 6302, covering the wavelength range of 5&ndash;28 micron and spanning an area of ~18.5 arcsec x15 arcsec. The spatially resolved spectrum reveals ~200 molecular and ionized lines from species requiring ionisation potentials of up to 205 eV. The spatial distributions highlight a complex structure at the nebula's centre. Highly ionized species such as Mg VII and Si VII show compact structures, while lower-ionization species such as H^+ extend much farther outwards, forming filament-defined rims that delineate a bubble. Within the bubble, the H^+ and H<sub>2</sub> emission coincide, while the PAH emission appears farther out, indicating an ionization structure distinct from typical photodissociation regions, such as the Orion Bar. This may be the first identification of a PAH formation site in a PN. This PN appears to be shaped not by a steady, continuous outflow, but by a series of dynamic, impulsive bubble ejections, creating local conditions conducive to PAH formation. A dusty torus surrounds the core, primarily composed of large (micron-sized) silicate grains with crystalline components. The long-lived torus contains a substantial mass of material, which could support an equilibrium chemistry and a slow dust-formation process.

### 209) [2508.19170](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19170v2): Stellar Mass Assembly History of Massive Quiescent Galaxies since z~4: Insights from Spatially Resolved SED Fitting with JWST Data

Massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift show significantly more compact morphology than their local counterparts. To examine their internal structure across a wide redshift range and investigate potential redshift dependence, we performed spatially resolved SED fitting using pixedfit software on massive (log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)~11) quiescent galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;4 with public James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope imaging data from the Public Release Imaging for Extragalactic Research and the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey. We find that at z ~ 3.5, the half-mass radius is about 5.4 times smaller than at z ~ 0.5. This growth is driven by stellar mass buildup in the outskirts (r &gt; 4 kpc), while the central regions (r ~ 1 kpc) remain largely unchanged, with stellar mass surface density similar to local quiescent galaxies. The estimated star formation rates are too low to explain the stellar mass growth, indicating an additional stellar mass accumulation process, such as mergers, is necessary. We parameterize the size-mass relation of the most massive galaxies in our sample as log(R_e,mass) &prop; &alpha; log(M_*), and find &alpha; = 2.67^+1.14_-1.17 for z≤ssapprox2, consistent with growth dominated by minor mergers, and &alpha; = 0.91^+0.20_-0.16 for z≳2, consistent with growth dominated by major mergers. These results indicate that massive quiescent galaxies originate from compact quenched systems and grow through combinations of minor and major mergers.

### 210) [2508.18374](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18374v1): How Dust Models Shape High-z Galaxy Morphology: Insights from the NewCluster Simulation

<p>
Dust plays a pivotal role in shaping the observed morphology of galaxies. While traditional cosmological simulations often assume a fixed dust-to-gas (DTG) or dust-to-metal (DTM) mass ratio to model dust effects, recent advancements have enabled on-the-fly (OTF) dust modeling that captures the spatial and temporal evolution of dust. In this work, we investigate the impact of dust modeling on galaxy morphology using the NewCluster simulation, which implements a detailed OTF dust model. We generate mock images of NewCluster galaxies under both OTF and fixed DTM models using the radiative transfer code SKIRT, and compare their morphology to JWST observations. We measure morphology indices and use the G-M_20 test to classify galaxies. We find that the OTF galaxy models exhibit brighter centers and more pronounced bulges than those of the fixed DTM models, resulting in a lower late-type galaxy (LTG) fraction, particularly at high redshifts. This central brightening is linked to a phenomenon we refer to as the DTM cavity, a localized depression in the DTM ratio driven by intense bulge starbursts. Our results highlight the importance of modeling dust evolution in a physically motivated manner, as fixed DTM models fail to capture key morphological features.

### 211) [2508.18369](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18369v1): A Uniform Analysis of Gas-phase Metallicity Evolution with 1-3 Gyr Time Sampling over the Past 12 Billion Years

<p> Shweta Jain, Ryan L. Sanders, Ali Ahmad Khostovan, Tucker Jones, Alice E. Shapley, Naveen A. Reddy, Alex M. Garcia, Paul Torrey, Alison Coil </p>
<p>
We present a systematic investigation of the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) using uniform metallicity diagnostics across redshifts z~0 to z~3.3. We present new Keck/DEIMOS measurements of the [OII]&lambda;&lambda;3726,3729 emission line doublet for star-forming galaxies at z~1.5 with existing measurements of redder rest-optical lines from the MOSDEF survey. These new observations enable uniform estimation of the gas-phase oxygen abundance using ratios of the [OII], H&beta;, and [OIII] lines for mass-binned samples of star-forming galaxies in 6 redshift bins, employing strong-line calibrations that account for the distinct interstellar medium ionization conditions at z&lt;1 and z&gt;1. We find that the low-mass power law slope of the MZR remains constant over this redshift range with a value of &gamma;=0.28±0.01, implying the outflow metal loading factor (\zeta_out=\fracZ_out Z_ISM\fracM&#775;_out SFR) scales approximately as \zeta_out&prop; M_*^-0.3 out to at least z~3.3. The normalization of the MZR at 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> decreases with increasing redshift at a rate of dlog(O/H)/dz =-0.11±0.01 across the full redshift range. We find that any evolution of the FMR is smaller than 0.1 dex out to z~3.3. We compare to cosmological galaxy formation simulations, and find that IllustrisTNG matches our measured combination of a nearly-invariant MZR slope, rate of MZR normalization decrease, and constant or very weakly evolving FMR. This work provides the most detailed view of MZR and FMR evolution from the present day through Cosmic Noon with a fine time sampling of 1-3 Gyr, setting a robust baseline for metallicity evolution studies at z&gt;4 with JWST.

<p>
3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our Solar System, and only the second to display a clear coma. Infrared spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) provides the opportunity to measure its coma composition and determine the primary activity drivers. We report the first results from our JWST NIRSpec campaign for 3I/ATLAS, at an inbound heliocentric distance of r_H=3.32 au. The spectral images (spanning 0.6-5.3 &mu;m) reveal a CO2 dominated coma, with enhanced outgassing in the sunward direction, and the presence of H2O, CO, OCS, water ice and dust. The coma CO2/H2O mixing ratio of 7.6±0.3 is among the highest ever observed in a comet, and is 4.5-sigma above the trend as a function of heliocentric distance for long-period and Jupiter-family comets (excluding the outlier C/2016 R2). Our observations are compatible with an intrinsically CO2-rich nucleus, which may indicate that 3I/ATLAS contains ices exposed to higher levels of radiation than Solar System comets, or that it formed close to the CO2 ice line in its parent protoplanetary disk. A low coma H2O gas abundance may also be implied, for example, due to inhibited heat penetration into the nucleus, which could suppress the H2O sublimation rate relative to CO2 and CO.

<p>
We investigate the star formation histories (SFHs) of a sample of massive galaxies (M<sub>&sext;</sub> ≥ 10^10   M<sub>&odot;</sub>) in the redshift range 1 &lt; z &lt; 4.5. We analyze spectro-photometric data combining broadband photometry from HST and JWST with low-resolution grism spectroscopy from JWST/NIRISS, obtained as part of the MIDIS (MIRI Deep Imaging Survey) program. SFHs are derived through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using two independent codes, BAGPIPES and Synthesizer, under various SFH assumptions. This approach enables a comprehensive assessment of the biases introduced by different modeling choices. The inclusion of NIRISS spectroscopy, even with its low resolution, significantly improves constraints on key physical parameters, such as the mass-weighted stellar age (t_M) and formation redshift (z_form), by narrowing their posterior distributions. The massive galaxies in our sample exhibit rapid stellar mass assembly, forming 50&percnt; of their mass between 3 ≤ z ≤ 9. The highest inferred formation redshifts are compatible with elevated star formation efficiencies (&epsilon;) at early epochs. Non-parametric SFHs generally imply an earlier and slower mass assembly compared to parametric forms, highlighting the sensitivity of inferred formation timescales to the chosen SFH model, particularly for galaxies at z &lt; 2. Quiescent galaxies are, on average, older (t_M ~ 1.1 Gyr) and assembled more rapidly at earlier times than their star-forming counterparts. These findings support the "downsizing'' scenario, in which more massive and passive systems form earlier and more efficiently.

<p> Richard S Ellis </p>
<p>
I present written notes from three lectures given at the 54th Saas-Fee Advanced Course of the Swiss Society of Astrophysics and Astronomy in January 2025 entitled "Galaxies and Black Holes in the First Billion Years as seen by the JWST". I focused my lectures on progress in studies of cosmic reionisation, the properties of galaxies in the reionisation era, topics related to the redshift frontier and the search for Population III stars. The lectures were given to graduate students in astrophysics and cover both pedagogical material as well as observational results from the first two and half years of JWST science operations. The pace of discovery with JWST is, of course, rapid and so my lectures discuss long-term goals, analysis methods and their assumptions and limitations in the hope that the underlying material will retain value in the near future. In this written version, the visual material is that presented at Saas-Fee in January 2025 but I have provided updates on progress from the literature up to August 2025. The material is aimed at early career researchers and should not be considered as a scholarly review of the entire JWST literature on high redshift galaxies

### 215) [2508.16795](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16795v1): On the Variability Features of Active Galactic Nuclei in Little Red Dots

<p> Shuying Zhou, Mouyuan Sun, Zijian Zhang, Jie Chen, Luis C. Ho </p>
<p>
The high-redshift (z&gt;4) compact sources with "V-shaped" spectral energy distributions (SEDs), known as Little Red Dots (LRDs), are discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope and provide valuable clues to the physics of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the early universe. The nature of LRDs is controversial. Recently, several studies have investigated LRDs through variability, a characteristic feature of AGNs. These studies explore LRD variability by extrapolating empirical relationships from local quasars. Here, we adopt the Corona-heated Accretion-disk Reprocessing (CHAR) model, which is motivated by accretion physics and applicable to reproduce AGN conventional variability, to study the variability of 22 LRDs in \citetTee2025. Our results indicate that the observed variability in LRDs is dominated by measurement uncertainties. Within the CHAR model, the lack of variability in LRDs can be explained by two scenarios: either AGNs contribute ≲30&percnt; of the observed luminosities, or they are intrinsically luminous AGNs. We use simulations to demonstrate the observational requirements to effectively investigate LRDs via variability: first, a sample of about 200 LRDs; second, each LRD has two observations separated by at least two years in the observed frame; third, the photometric uncertainty is ≤ 0.07 mag. If the LRDs still lack variability under these conditions, the time-domain study would provide independent evidence that the accretion mode of LRDs differs significantly from low-redshift quasars.

<p>
We present the results from performing spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting on 121 variable active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) using photometry from both the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) covering 0.2 - 4.8 microns. We designed a bespoke SED fitting code which decomposes the total SED into its stellar and AGN contributions. Our SED fitting retrieves a significant contribution to the total SED from an AGN template for 26 of our variable sources with 0 &lt; z &lt; 7. We leverage the model AGN spectrum to estimate black hole masses (M_BH) using the measured luminosity at 5100 &#8491; and local empirical calibrations. Common with recently discovered JWST broad line AGN (BL-AGN), we observe a trend in the M_BH - M<sub>&ast;</sub> plane where low redshift sources have M_BH which agree with local relations while high redshift sources have increasingly overmassive black holes with respect to the stellar mass (M<sub>&ast;</sub>) of their host galaxies. Within our sample, we identify two IMBH candidates hosted by dwarf galaxies at z&lt;1 featuring overmassive BHs in the M_BH-M<sub>&ast;</sub> plane, similarly to our high redshift sources. Finally, our SED fitter successfully retrieves the AGN nature of one source at z &gt;6. This object has z<sub>phot</sub> = 6.74 and we estimate a lower limit on its black hole mass of log_10(M_BH/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &gt; 7.36.

<p> P. Nazari </p>
<p>
Complex organic molecules (COMs) have been detected abundantly at various stages of star formation, particularly in the warm protostellar phase. The progress in gas-phase measurements has been accelerated by the advent of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and in ice measurements by the James Webb Space Telescope. Particularly, the community has moved from single-source studies of COMs to statistical analyses because of these powerful instruments. In this article, I review surveys that consider COMs in the gas and ice. The two takeaways from this review include; 1. Gas-phase abundance ratios for some COMs show a small difference across many objects and the ice abundance ratios show similar or higher values to the gas, both pointing to the importance of ice chemistry in COM formation, 2. Some COM ratios show larger differences across many objects which could be due to either chemical or physical effects, thus both factors need to be considered when interpreting the data.

<p> Puja Porel </p>
<p>
SCUPOL, the polarimeter for SCUBA on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), was used for polarization observations of 104 regions at 850 micron wavelength and 15 arcsec resolution in the mapping mode by Matthews et al. (2009). They presented the polarization values and magnetic field morphologies in these regions. In this work, we took the opportunity to use this big legacy survey data to investigate further the collective statistical properties of the measured polarization in different star-forming regions containing cores and filaments. We did not reproduce the polarization maps but used the polarization value catalogs to investigate the statistics of distributions. In some of these regions, the data from the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) polarization observation at 1.3 mm wavelength and 2.5 arcsec resolution were also available from the TADPOL survey (Hull et al., 2014). We used that data and compared it with JCMT/SCUPOL values. We also study how the direction of outflows appears to relate to the mean B-field direction from large scale (JCMT observation at 15 arcsec) to small scale (CARMA observation at 2.5 arcsec) for the nine core regions common in both.

### 219) [2508.14972](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14972v1): The Fraction of Clumpy Galaxies in JWST Surveys over 2&lt;z&lt;12

<p> Alexander de la Vega, Bahram Mobasher, Faezeh Manesh, Niloofar Sharei, Nima Chartab, Zahra Sattari </p>
<p>
High-redshift galaxies exhibit compact regions of intense star formation, known as "clumps,'' which are conspicuous in the rest-frame ultraviolet. Studying them can shed light on how they form and evolve and inform theoretical models of galaxy evolution. We examine the evolution of clumpy galaxies with redshift and stellar mass over 2&lt;z&lt;12 with James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging from the JWST Advanced Extragalactic Survey (JADES). Off-center clumps are detected in the rest-frame near-ultraviolet (NUV) using similar techniques to those in earlier studies based on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. This is done for a sample of 9,121 star-forming galaxies with stellar masses log≤ft(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 8. The fraction of clumpy galaxies, f_clumpy, increases from ~20&percnt; at z&gt;6.5 to ~80&percnt; at z~2.75 at log≤ft(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 9. Our f_clumpy values are generally higher at fixed redshift and increase faster with decreasing redshift than what studies based on HST data found, which we attribute largely to the higher sensitivity of JWST. Clumps make up 15-20&percnt; of the NUV luminosity of clumpy galaxies, with little dependence on redshift or stellar mass. f_clumpy correlates with stellar mass and there is little correlation with specific star-formation rate. Our f_clumpy measurements are compared with those from simulations as well as other observations. At low redshifts (z≲5.75) and intermediate-to-high stellar masses (log≤ft(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 9), our results suggest gas fragmentation due to violent disk instabilities to be the dominant mechanism for forming clumps. At high redshifts and low stellar masses, compression of gas during mergers appears to dominate.

### 220) [2508.14897](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14897v1): Little Red Dots as Direct-collapse Black Hole Nurseries

<p> Elia Cenci, Melanie Habouzit </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope recently uncovered a population of massive black holes (BHs) in the first billion years after the Big Bang. Among these high-redshift BH candidates, observations have identified a class of active galactic nuclei candidates, dubbed Little Red Dots (LRDs), with extraordinarily compact gas reservoirs and peculiar spectral features. LRDs clearly emerge at redshift z&lt;8 and their abundance declines by z&lt;5. Recent theoretical studies have explored the link between LRDs and the formation of heavy BH seeds in the early Universe, such as direct-collapse BHs (DCBHs). Here we present results from preliminary runs for the MELIORA cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, where we implement an accurate model for DCBH formation, accounting for the Lyman-Werner radiation field and mass-inflow rates in the target host haloes. We aim to test whether or not DCBH formation could lead to systems resembling those hypothesized for LRDs. We find that the population of newly formed DCBHs in the simulations exhibits a steep decline at z&lt;6, akin to the emergence of LRDs, primarily driven by reduced inflows. The birth of DCBHs is associated with a significant gas compaction event, followed by a phase of intense luminosity in the 200 Myr after their birth, and subsequently by the formation of the first PopIII stars in these very haloes. If these DCBHs nurseries are associated with LRDs, then it could explain their weak emission from X-rays and hot dust.

### 221) [2508.14555](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14555v1): The oldest tidally induced bar-like galaxy in the IllustrisTNG cluster

<p> Ewa L. Lokas </p>
<p>
New JWST observations have revealed the presence of a significant number of high-redshift barred galaxies. The origin of these bars remains unclear, and their properties appear difficult to reconcile with the results of cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. I present an example of a tidally induced bar-like galaxy formed at z = 2.9 in the TNG100 suite of the IllustrisTNG simulations. The galaxy was identified among the sample of bar-like galaxies studied before and has the earliest bar formation time among the tidally induced subsample of those objects. Its disk transformed into a bar as a result of a close interaction with a massive progenitor of a brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). It remained on a tight orbit around the host and survived until the present, losing most of its initial mass and becoming red but preserving its prolate shape. Even before the interaction, at z = 3.5, the galaxy experienced a few mergers, which elongated its shape. This temporary distortion also made it look like a bar with spiral extensions of up to 6 kpc. The long-lived bar formed later was about 3 kpc long and grew over the next few gigayears. This example demonstrates that high-z bars should not be sought among the progenitors of present-day simulated barred galaxies but rather among the tidally interacting early population of galaxies in forming groups and clusters. Some of these galaxies may have survived as ellipticals, and some may have merged with their BCGs.

### 222) [2508.14350](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14350v1): New Insight from the James Webb Space Telescope on Variable Active Galactic Nuclei

<p> Bangzheng Sun, Haojing Yan, Wei Leong Tee, Feige Wang </p>
<p>
Variability detected in galaxies is usually attributed to their active galactic nuclei (AGNs). While all AGNs are intrinsically variable, the classic AGN unification model predicts that type~2 AGNs rarely vary because their engines are obstructed by dust tori. Previous UV-to-near-IR variability studies largely support this expectation. Here, we present a variability study by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) that reveals a more subtle picture. Using NIRCam imaging data from three surveys over ~140~arcmin<sup>2</sup> in the COSMOS field, we found 117 galaxies with ≥ 4&sigma; variability in the F356W band across a ~2-year baseline. Cross-matching with existing JWST spectroscopic data in this area, we identified five of them at z=0.19&ndash;3.69, which were all coincidentally observed by a NIRSpec program almost contemporaneously with the last imaging epoch. One additional variable was identified at z=0.90 using the archival Keck telescope data. These six objects form our spectroscopic subsample. Interestingly, two reside in close-pair environments, while two others form a close pair themselves. Most of their light curves can hardly be explained by nuclear transients, and AGN variability is a more plausible cause. However, among these six objects, (1) only one shows broad permitted lines (&Delta; v &gt; 1000~km~s<sup>-1</sup>) indicative of a type~1 AGN; (2) two show narrow permitted lines consistent with type~2 AGNs, with another one likely type~2 based on the host galaxy properties; and (3) two others, which form a pair, show no emission lines. Our results add more challenges to the unification model.

### 223) [2508.14260](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14260v1): Efficient black hole seed formation in low metallicity and dense stellar clusters with implications for JWST sources

<p>
Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal young massive clusters (YMCs) as key building blocks of early galaxies. They are not only important constituents of galaxies, but also potential birthplaces of very massive stars (VMSs) and black hole (BH) seeds. We explore stellar dynamics in extremely dense clusters with initial half-mass densities of &rho;_h ≳ 10^8M<sub>&odot;</sub>pc^-3 at very low metallicity, comparable to some of the densest clusters seen by JWST. Using direct N-body and Monte Carlo simulations with stellar evolution, we show that VMS formation through collisions is unavoidable, with final masses reaching 5×10^3 to 4×10^4M<sub>&odot;</sub>. These results support the existence of a critical mass scale above which collisions become highly efficient, enabling the formation of VMSs and intermediate-mass BHs (IMBHs). Our models, using nbody6++gpu and MOCCA with updated SSE/BSE routines, show that dense clusters rapidly form VMSs via stellar bombardment. The VMSs then collapse into BH seeds of a few 10^3 to 10^4M<sub>&odot;</sub> in less than 4 Myr. We identify a critical mass-density threshold beyond which clusters undergo runaway collisions that yield massive BH seeds. For typical YMCs detected by JWST, efficiencies up to 10% are expected, implying BH masses up to 10^5M<sub>&odot;</sub> if formed via collisions. We predict a scaling relation for BH mass, log(M_BH/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=-0.76+0.76log(M/M<sub>&odot;</sub>). Frequent VMS formation may also explain the high nitrogen abundance observed in galaxies at high redshift.

The resonant scattering nature of Ly&alpha; photons interacting with neutral hydrogen makes Ly&alpha;-emitting galaxies (LAEs) robust tracers of the intergalactic neutral hydrogen fraction, and thus sensitive probes of cosmic reionization. We present an extensive study of the Ly&alpha; evolution from galaxies at 4.5 ≤ z ≤ 11 in the UDS field, observed as part of the CAPERS survey, and complemented with spectra from the DAWN JWST Archive. The combined sample includes 651 spectroscopically confirmed Ly&alpha;-break galaxies, among which we find 73 S/N&gt;3 LAEs in JWST-NIRSpec PRISM spectra. We trace the redshift evolution of the Ly&alpha; emitter fraction with EW_0 &gt;25 A (X_Ly&alpha;) between z = 5 and z = 9, presenting the first such analysis in the UDS field. At z = 5 and 6, the UDS results agree with the average JWST X_Ly&alpha; values from multiple fields. However, JWST measurements are consistently lower than ground-based results. To investigate this, we compare JWST observations to a population of star-forming galaxies at z~6 observed with VLT-FORS2. We find that a Ly&alpha; slit-loss of 35 ± 10% in JWST spectra accounts for the offset, as the resonant Ly&alpha; emission is more spatially extended than the stellar continuum. From z = 6 to 7, the UDS field shows a significant drop in Ly&alpha; visibility, from which we infer a neutral hydrogen fraction of X_HI = 0.7&ndash;0.9. Finally, we identify two robust ionized bubbles at z = 7.29 and 7.77, with radii of R<sub>ion</sub> = 0.6 and 0.5 physical Mpc and photometric overdensities of N/&langle;N&rangle; = 3 and 4, based on candidate counts down to the photometric completeness limit. Compared to the large ionized region at z~7 in the EGS field, these results indicate significant field-to-field variation, supporting a patchy, inhomogeneous reionization process.

### 225) [2508.14164](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14164v1): The implications of overmassive black holes at z &gt; 5 for quasar and black hole growth

<p> Judah Luberto, Steven R. Furlanetto </p>
<p>
Recent JWST surveys of high-redshift galaxies have found surprisingly large black holes, with many being measured to be ~100 times more massive than local galaxies with the same stellar mass. Here, we find that a population of these black holes would have dramatic implications for our understanding of their growth across cosmic time. We first show that the global black hole mass density at z ~ 5 would be comparable to local values. This would not occur if these black holes occupy a small fraction of galaxies, though it would be expected if these black holes radiate at high efficiencies (requiring that the central engines of AGN spin rapidly). We then show that the individual detected z ~ 5 black holes would remain overmassive compared to the local relation if they grow according to the average rates of state-of-the-art models. These systems must instead grow at least an order of magnitude more slowly than expected if they are to fall within the observed scatter of the local black hole mass-stellar mass relation. Such slow growth is surprising in comparison to other estimates of the radiative efficiency of AGN, especially because growth must be rapid at z &gt; 5 in order to build up such massive black holes quickly. Finally, we highlight the challenges that overmassive black holes have on our understanding of the impact of quasar feedback on galaxies.

### 226) [2508.14155](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14155v1): Little Red Dots and their Progenitors from Direct Collapse Black Holes

<p> Junehyoung Jeon, Boyuan Liu, Volker Bromm, Seiji Fujimoto, Anthony J. Taylor, Vasily Kokorev, Rebecca L. Larson, John Chisholm, Steven L. Finkelstein, Dale D. Kocevski </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered a new population of objects, the Little Red Dots (LRDs), characterized by V-shaped spectra indicative of strong breaks around the Balmer limit and compact morphology that gave them their name. A popular explanation is that they are a sub-population of active galactic nuclei/supermassive black holes (AGN/SMBHs) predominantly found in the high-redshift Universe (z≳3). Similarly, direct collapse black holes (DCBHs), theorized to form from collapsing massive, extremely metal-poor gas clouds, have been invoked to explain high-redshift quasars, the most massive AGN sub-population. Here, we employ the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH to produce a population of DCBHs and compare them against observed LRD demographics and properties. Specifically, we compare the DCBH-seeded SMBH population against the standard stellar-remnant seeds and find that DCBH models agree better with observed LRD population statistics and host halo properties. Furthermore, for the most extreme and earliest LRD detections, interpreted to be systems with an AGN but little stellar component, DCBHs are able to reproduce the observed spectral shape and properties under multiple scenarios - high dust attenuation or AGN surrounded by dense gas - that have been proposed to explain the unique shape of LRD spectra. Even when super-Eddington accretion, invoked previously to explain the nature of LRDs, is enforced on stellar remnant seeds, the spectral characteristics of extreme LRDs cannot be reproduced. We emphasize the importance of gas-metallicity observations as an additional dimension besides the widely used SMBH-stellar mass ratios to further constrain the progenitors of LRDs.

### 227) [2508.13761](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13761v1): Narrowing the discovery space of the cosmological 21-cm signal using multi-wavelength constraints

<p>
The cosmic 21-cm signal is a promising probe of the early Universe, owing to its sensitivity to the thermal state of the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) and properties of the first luminous sources. In this work, we constrain the 21-cm signal and infer IGM properties by leveraging multi-wavelength synergies. This builds on our earlier study, where we developed the synergy between high-redshift UV luminosity functions (UVLFs), cosmic X-ray and radio backgrounds (CXB and CRB), 21-cm global signal non-detection from SARAS~3, and 21-cm power spectrum upper limits from HERA, to constrain the astrophysical properties of Population II galaxies. Through a combination of CXB and HERA data, we find the IGM kinetic temperature to be T_K(z=15)≲ 7.7~K, 2.5~K ≲ T_K(z=10) ≲ 66~K, and 20~K≲ T_K(z=6) ≲ 2078~K at 95&percnt; credible interval (C.I.). Similarly, CRB and HERA data place an upper limit on the radio emission efficiency of galaxies, giving T_rad(z=15) ≲ 47~K, T_rad(z=10)≲ 51~K, and T_rad(z=6)≲ 101~K. These constraints, strengthened by the inclusion of UVLFs from HST and JWST, allow us to place the first itlower bound on the cosmic 21-cm signal. We infer an absorption trough of depth -201~mK≲ T_21,min ≲ -68~mK at z_min≈10-16, and a power spectrum of 8.7~mK^2 &lt; &Delta;_21^2(z=15) &lt; 197~mK^2 at k=0.35~hMpc^-1. Our results provide promising predictions for upcoming 21-cm experiments, and highlight the power of multi-wavelength synergies in constraining the early Universe.

<p>
Star formation governs galaxy evolution, shaping stellar mass assembly and gas consumption across cosmic time. The Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, linking star formation rate (SFR) and gas surface densities, is fundamental to understand star formation regulation, yet remains poorly constrained at z &gt; 2 due to observational limitations and uncertainties in locally calibrated gas tracers. The [CII] 158 &mu; m line has recently emerged as a key probe of the cold ISM and star formation in the early Universe. We investigate whether the resolved [CII]-SFR and KS relations established at low redshift remain valid at 4 &lt; z &lt; 6 by analysing 13 main-sequence galaxies from the ALPINE and CRISTAL surveys, using multi-wavelength data (HST, JWST, ALMA) at ~2 kpc resolution. We perform pixel-by-pixel spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling with CIGALE on resolution-homogenised images. We develop a statistical framework to fit the [CII]-SFR relation that accounts for pixel covariance and compare our results to classical fitting methods. We test two [CII]-to-gas conversion prescriptions to assess their impact on inferred gas surface densities and depletion times. We find a resolved [CII]-SFR relation with a slope of 0.87 ± 0.15 and intrinsic scatter of 0.19 ± 0.03 dex, which is shallower and tighter than previous studies at z~5. The resolved KS relation is highly sensitive to the [CII]-to-gas conversion factor: using a fixed global &alpha;_[CII] yields depletion times of 0.5-1 Gyr, while a surface brightness-dependent W_[CII], places some galaxies with high gas density in the starburst regime (&lt;0.1 Gyr). Future inputs from both simulations and observations are required to better understand how the [CII]-to-gas conversion factor depends on local ISM properties. We need to break this fundamental limit to properly study the KS relation at z≳4.

We present the second data release of the Systematic Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES), focusing on JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution spectroscopy of galaxies across cosmic time. This release includes spectroscopic observations of 166 galaxies spanning 0 &lt; z &lt; 7.5, sampling star-forming galaxies, quiescent systems, and active galactic nuclei (AGN), with an emphasis on galaxies at cosmic noon (z ~ 1-3). We describe the target selection strategy, the observational setup with the G140M/F100LP and G235M/F170LP gratings, and the data calibration process. The final data products include the reduced spectra, redshift catalog, emission-line catalogs produced with ttGELATO for emission-line galaxies and ttpPXF fits for quiescent systems, and ancillary spectral energy distribution (SED) fit results derived from multi-band photometry. The SMILES NIRSpec dataset enables investigations of obscured AGN, multi-phase outflows, ionizing properties, and the role of environment in galaxy evolution.

### 230) [2508.09749](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09749v2): A dual AGN at z = 5.4 associated with a Lyman-alpha Nebula in the Center of a Cosmic Filament

<p> Qiong Li, Christopher J. Conselice, Qiao Duan, Duncan Austin, Tom Harvey, Nathan Adams, George Bendo, Lewi Westcott, Vadim Rusakov, Zheng Cai, Yuanhang Ning, Shiwu Zhang </p>
<p>
Predictions from current theories and simulations suggest that dual AGN systems are exceedingly rare at high redshifts. The intense radiation and powerful outflows from AGNs regulate star formation, heat the interstellar medium, and drive massive gas outflows that shape the host galaxy and its surroundings. One manifestation of AGN feedback is the creation of extended Ly&alpha; nebulae. However, identifying these systems at high-z is challenging. Here, we report a remarkable dual AGN candidate at z ~ 5.4 using JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec, with a separation of ~1.7 arcseconds (~10.4 pkpc). This is one of the highest spectroscopically confirmed redshift dual AGNs discovered. Photometric SED fitting shows excellent agreement with AGN templates, strongly suggesting a rare dual AGN system. BPT diagrams and high ionisation lines further support the presence of AGNs. VLT/MUSE observations reveal strong extended Ly&alpha; emission, extending to &gt;22 kpc, making it one of the most extended Ly&alpha; nebulae at z ~ 6. This provides observational evidence of anisotropic AGN-driven photoionization or shocks. The high Ly&alpha; escape fraction also indicates an AGN outflow. This dual AGN candidate is also associated with a well-defined overdensity, potentially at the center of a z ~ 5.4 protocluster or filamentary structure node. Further analysis indicates the fraction of dual AGNs is significantly higher than theoretically expected at high redshifts. This discovery provides a new opportunity to study dual AGN interactions and their impact on the circumgalactic medium and cosmic structure evolution.

### 231) [2508.03954](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03954v2): Consistent gas-phase C/O abundances from UV and optical emission lines: a robust scale for chemical evolution across cosmic time

<p> Paige M. Kelly, Tucker Jones, Yuguang Chen, Ryan L. Sanders, Danielle A. Berg, Peter Senchyna, Fabio Bresolin, Daniel P. Stark </p>
<p>
The carbon to oxygen (C/O) abundance ratio is a valuable tracer of star formation history, as C and O enrichment occurs on different timescales. However, measurements based on ultraviolet (UV) collisionally excited lines and those based on optical recombination lines may be subject to biases from the abundance discrepancy factor (ADF), which is well established for oxygen but uncertain for carbon. We present precise UV-based measurements of gas-phase C^2+/O^2+ ionic abundance in four H II regions which have prior optical-based measurements, combined with archival UV data for two additional H II regions, in order to establish a reliable abundance scale and to investigate biases between the two methods. We find a clear ADF for the C^2+ ion which is consistent with that of O^2+, assuming a similar temperature structure in the zones of the nebula which these ions occupy. The C/O abundance derived from UV collisional lines and optical recombination lines is therefore also consistent to within &lt;0.1 dex, with an offset of 0.05±0.03 dex in C^2+/O^2+ for the standard T_e method. While the absolute C/H and O/H abundances are subject to large uncertainty from the ADF, our results establish that C/O abundances measured from these different methods can be reliably compared. Thus we confirm the robustness of gas-phase C/O measurements for studying galaxy evolution and star formation timescales, including from rest-UV observations of high redshift galaxies with JWST.

### 232) [2508.00774](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00774v2): A Novel Formation Channel for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries in the Early Universe via Primordial Black Holes

<p> Saiyang Zhang, Boyuan Liu, Volker Bromm </p>
<p>
We present a novel formation channel for supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries in the early Universe, driven by primordial black holes (PBHs). Using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the role of massive PBHs (m_BH ~ 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) in catalyzing the formation of direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs), providing a natural in situ pathway for binary SMBH formation. PBHs enhance local overdensities, accelerate structure formation, and exert thermal feedback on the surrounding medium via accretion. Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation from accreting PBHs suppresses H2 cooling, shifting the dominant gas coolant to atomic hydrogen. When combined with significant baryon-dark matter streaming velocities (v_b&chi; ≳ 0.8 &sigma;_b&chi;, where &sigma;_b&chi; is the root-mean-square streaming velocity), these effects facilitate the formation of dense, gravitationally unstable, atomically cooling gas clouds in the PBH's wake. These clouds exhibit sustained high inflow rates (M&#775;_infall ≳ 0.01 - 0.1 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1), providing ideal conditions for DCBH formation from rapidly growing supermassive stars of ~ 10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at redshifts z ~ 20 - 10. The resulting systems form SMBH binaries with initial mass ratios q ~ O(0.1) and separations of ~ 10 pc. Such PBH-DCBH binaries provide testable predictions for JWST and ALMA, potentially explaining select high-z sources such as the Little Red Dots (LRDs), and represent gravitational-wave sources for future missions like LISA and TianQin-bridging early-Universe black hole physics, multi-messenger astronomy, and dark matter theory.

### 233) [2507.23774](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23774v3): Lord of LRDs: Insights into a "Little Red Dot" with a low-ionization spectrum at z = 0.1

<p>
Recent JWST observations have revealed a puzzling population of optically red and compact galaxies with peculiar "V"-shaped spectra at high redshift, known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). Until now, most spectroscopically confirmed LRDs are found at z &gt; 4 and it has been speculated that LRDs are tracing the early stages of black hole evolution. We report an independent rediscovery of a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN), SDSS J102530.29+140207.3, at z = 0.1, which shows spectral features matching those of LRDs seen in the early Universe, including the V-shaped spectrum, broad Balmer lines (with widths of 1000-2000 km/s), and deep Balmer absorption. We present a new GTC observation of this LRD, which reveals an optical continuum similar to those of G-to-K giant stars including an unambiguous G-band absorption originating from the CH molecule. In addition, this local LRD shows a series of absorption lines potentially related to low-ionization ions or atoms but are deeper than what is observed in empirical stellar templates. We further identify a series of [FeII] emission lines indicative of low-ionization gas, which we find also present in an JWST-selected LRD at z = 2.26. We find small but statistically significant variability in H&alpha; consistent with previous findings. Finally, with the new X-ray observation from NuSTAR, we confirm the extreme X-ray weakness of this LRD, which might imply Compton-thick gas obscuration with N_H&gt;10^24~cm<sup>2</sup>. All evidence suggests SDSS J102530.29+140207.3 has a complex gaseous environment and the strong ionic, atomic, and molecular absorptions are hard to explain with typical stellar and AGN models.

### 234) [2507.22863](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22863v2): Formation of over-massive black holes in high-redshift disk galaxies via globular cluster accretion

<p> Hidenobu Yajima </p>
<p>
Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have suggested the existence of over-massive black holes (OMBHs) in high-redshift galaxies. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism for the formation of OMBHs, based on the accretion of globular clusters (GCs) in compact disk galaxies. We derive the conditions under which OMBHs can form, focusing on key parameters such as halo mass, redshift, and halo spin parameter. Our results show that at redshift z = 10, a halo with mass 10^11~M<sub>&odot;</sub> and a spin parameter of ~ 0.02 can form a black hole of 2.3 × 10^8~M<sub>&odot;</sub> through GC migration and accretion via tidal disruption events (TDEs). The resulting black hole-to-stellar mass ratio can reach ~ 0.1, corresponding to the fraction of GC mass accreted onto the black hole. This mechanism thus provides a plausible explanation for the OMBHs observed by JWST. Furthermore, by combining our model with the halo mass function and the spin-parameter distribution, we construct black hole mass functions that reproduce the number densities of the massive BH candidates UHZ1 and GHZ9 at z ≈ 10, as well as the abundances of BHs with masses ≳ 10^8~M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z ≈ 5 inferred from JWST observations. However, our model overpredicts the abundance of BHs with masses &lt; 10^8~M<sub>&odot;</sub>, suggesting that moderately massive, inactive BHs are more frequent.

JWST has shed light on galaxy formation and metal enrichment within 300 Myr of the Big Bang. While luminous galaxies at z &gt; 10 often show significant [O III]&lambda;&lambda;4959, 5007 emission lines, it remains unclear whether such features are prevalent among fainter, more typical galaxies due to observational limits. We present deep imaging and spectroscopy of JADES-GS-z14-1 at z<sub>spec</sub>=13.86^+0.04_-0.05, currently the faintest spectroscopically confirmed galaxy at z≈ 14. It serendipitously received 70.7 hours of MIRI/F770W imaging in the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), the deepest MIRI exposure for any high-redshift galaxy to date. Nonetheless, we detect only tentative F770W emission of 7.9±2.8 nJy at 2.8&sigma; significance, constraining the total equivalent width of [O III]&lambda;&lambda;4959, 5007 + H&beta; to 520^+400_-380 A, weaker than most z &gt; 10 galaxies with MIRI detections. This source is unresolved across 16 NIRCam bands, implying a physical radius ≲50 pc. NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy totaling 56 hours reveals no rest-frame ultraviolet emission lines above 3 &sigma;. Stellar population synthesis suggests a stellar mass ~4× 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and a star formation rate ~ 2 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1. The absence of strong metal emission lines despite intense star formation suggests a gas-phase metallicity below 10% solar and potentially a high escape fraction of ionizing photons. These deep observations provide rare constraints on faint, early galaxies, tracing the onset of chemical enrichment and ionization in the early Universe.

<p> Jan Röder, Maciek Wielgus, Joseph B. Jensen, Gagandeep S. Anand, R. Brent Tully </p>
<p>
We present the first JWST+NIRCam images of the giant elliptical active galaxy M87 and its jet at 0.90, 1.50, 2.77 and 3.56 &mu;m. We analysed the large-scale jet structure, identifying prominent components, and determined the near-infrared spectral index. The data were calibrated using the standard JWST pipeline. We subtracted a constant background level and a smooth model of the galaxy surface brightness to isolate the jet. The total image fluxes measured in the NIRCam filters follow the infrared bump pattern seen near 1.6 &mu;m in the spectral energy distribution of M87, caused by the surrounding stellar population in the galaxy. The residual jet images broadly agree with the radio to optical synchrotron power law S_&lambda;&prop;&lambda;^&alpha; with &alpha;=0.7-1.0. We identified the most upstream knot L at a distance of (320±50) mas from the core. The component HST-1, at (950±50) mas from the core, is transversely resolved, and both the individual images and the spectral index map clearly indicate its double-component substructure with two elements of similar size and flux density, with centroids separated by (150±20) mas and with a significantly larger spectral index &alpha; observed in the downstream component (&alpha;_do=0.3) than in the upstream one (&alpha;_up= -0.15). We also observe the counter-jet component located about 24 arcsec away from the nucleus.

This paper examines the reliability of the Tremaine-Weinberg (TW) method in measuring the pattern speed of barred galaxies at high redshifts. Measuring pattern speeds at high redshift may help to shed light on the time evolution of interactions between galactic bars and dark matter halos. The TW method has been extensively employed for nearby galaxies, and its accuracy in determining bar pattern speeds has been validated through numerical simulations. For nearby galaxies, the method yields acceptable results when the inclination angle of the galaxy and the position angle of the bar fall within appropriate ranges. However, the application of the TW method to high-redshift galaxies remains unexplored in both observations and simulations. For this study we generated mock observations of barred galaxies from the TNG50 cosmological simulation. These simulated observations were tailored to mimic the integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy data that the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) would capture at a redshift of z≃ 1.2. By applying the TW method to these mock observations and comparing the results with the known pattern speeds, we demonstrate that the TW method performs adequately for barred galaxies whose bars are sufficiently long to be detected by JWST at high redshifts. This work opens a new avenue for applying the TW method to investigate the properties of high-redshift barred galaxies.

We investigate the chemical evolution of N/O using a sample of 45 local star-forming galaxies (SFGs) from the CLASSY survey. This sample spans a wide range of galaxy properties, with robust determinations of nitrogen and oxygen abundances via the direct-T_e method. We explore how N/O relates to density structure, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), stellar age, compactness, and gas kinematics. In addition, we compare our results with those of galaxies at z =2-10 where N/O ratios were derived from optical or UV nitrogen lines, aiming to identify chemical enrichment pathways across cosmic time. Our analysis shows that the N/O-O/H relation in CLASSY galaxies aligns with the trends seen in local galaxies and extragalactic HII regions, and that galaxies at z = 2-6 exhibit similar N/O values, indicating no significant redshift evolution in N/O for a fixed metallicity. We identify a significant correlation between electron density n_e([S II]) and N/O, suggesting that density structure contributes to the scatter in the N/O-O/H relation. The CLASSY galaxies with high SFRs or compact star formation show elevated N/O, though no strong correlation with stellar mass is found. We also find that high-velocity outflows (v_out &gt; 350 km/s) and low mass-loading factors are linked to elevated N/O, indicating that feedback plays a significant role. These results highlight the importance of density, star formation, and feedback from young stellar populations in shaping N/O enrichment and provide key insights for interpreting high-z galaxies observed with JWST.

### 239) [2507.10681](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10681v2): Insights for Early Massive Black Hole Growth from JWST Detection of the [Ne v] λ3427 Emission Line

<p> Benny Trakhtenbrot, Claudio Ricci, Ezequiel Treister, Michael J. Koss, Richard Mushotzky, Kyuseok Oh, Alessandro Peca, Franz E. Bauer, Kriti Kamal Gupta, Tomer Reiss </p>
<p>
We use the narrow [Ne v] &lambda;3427 emission line detected in the recently published JWST spectra of two galaxies, at z = 6.9 and 5.6, to study the key properties of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in their centers. Using a new empirical scaling linking the [Ne v] line emission with AGN accretion-driven (continuum) emission, derived from a highly complete low-redshift AGN sample, we show that the [Ne v] emission in the two z &gt; 5 galaxies implies total (bolometric) AGN luminosities of order L_bol~(4-8)x10^45 erg/s. Assuming that the radiation emitted from these systems is Eddington limited, the (minimal) black hole masses are of order M_BH&gt;10^7 M_sun. Combined with the published stellar masses of the galaxies, estimated from dedicated fitting of their spectral energy distributions, the implied BH-to-stellar mass ratios are of order M_BH/M_host~0.1-1. This is considerably higher than what is found in the local Universe, but is consistent with the general trend seen in some other z &gt; 5 AGN. Given the intrinsic weakness of the [Ne v] line and the nature of the [Ne v]-to-L_bol scaling, any (rare) detection of the [Ne v] &lambda;3427 line at z &gt; 5 would translate to similarly high AGN luminosities and SMBH masses, thus providing a unique observational path for studying luminous AGN well into the epoch of reionization, including obscured sources.

We present JWST/NIRSpec PRISM observations of three luminous (M_UV&lt;-20) galaxies at z~10 observed with the CAPERS Cycle 3 program. These galaxies exhibit extreme UV slopes compared to typical galaxies at z=10. Of the three sources, two of them are a close pair (0.22 - arcsec) of blue galaxies at z=9.800±0.003 and z=9.808±0.002 with UV slopes of &beta;=-2.87±0.15 and &beta;=-2.46±0.10 respectively, selected from PRIMER COSMOS NIRCam imaging. We perform spectrophotometric modeling of the galaxies which suggests extremely young stellar ages and a lack of dust attenuation. For the bluest galaxy, its UV slope also suggests significant Lyman continuum escape. In contrast, the third source (selected from CEERS NIRCam imaging) at z=9.942±0.002 exhibits a red UV slope with &beta;=-1.51±0.08. We rule out the possibility of a strong nebular continuum due to the lack of a Balmer jump and find no evidence to support the presence of active galactic nucleus continuum due to a lack of strong UV emission lines and no broad component to H&gamma; or H&beta;. Instead, it is most likely that the red UV slope is due to dust-reddening (A_V≃0.9) implying a significant level of dust-obscured star-formation only ≃480  Myr after the Big Bang. Under standard assumptions for dust attenuation, EGS-25297 would be the most intrinsically UV-luminous galaxy (M_UV,corr≃ -22.4^+0.7_-1.1) yet spectroscopically confirmed at z ~ 10. This work highlights that luminous galaxies at z≳10 have a diversity of dust properties and that spectroscopy of these galaxies is essential to fully understand star-formation at z≳10.

Massive galaxy clusters act as prominent strong-lenses. Due to a combination of observational biases, cluster evolution and lensing efficiency, most of the known cluster lenses lie typically at z_l~0.2-0.7, with only a few prominent examples at higher redshifts. Here we report a first strong-lensing analysis of the massive galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0546-5345 at a redshift z_l=1.07. This cluster was first detected through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, with a high estimated mass for its redshift of M_200,c = (7.95 ± 0.92) × 10^14 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Using recent JWST/NIRCam and archival HST imaging, we identify at least 10 secure and 6 candidate sets of multiply imaged background galaxies, which we use to constrain the mass distribution in the cluster. We derive effective Einstein radii of &theta;_E= 18.1 ± 1.8 '' for a source at z_s=3, and &theta;_E= 27.9 ± 2.8 '' for a source at z_s=9. The total projected mass within a 200 kpc radius around the strong-lensing region is M(&lt;200 kpc) = (1.9 ± 0.3) × 10^14 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. While our results rely on photometric redshifts warranting spectroscopic follow-up, this central mass resembles that of the Hubble Frontier Fields clusters - although SPT-CL J0546-5345 is observed when the Universe was ~ 3-4 Gyr younger. Amongst the multiply-imaged sources, we identify a hyperbolic-umbilic-like configuration, and, thanks to its point-like morphology, a possible Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). If confirmed spectroscopically, it will add to just a handful of other quasars and AGN known to be multiply lensed by galaxy clusters.

<p>
We present a multi-phase study of the gas in the circumnuclear region (~1.1x1.0 kpc<sup>2</sup>) of the nearby Seyfert 1.8 galaxy NGC 1365, observed in the context of the Mid-IR Activity of Circumnuclear Line Emission (MIRACLE) program. We combined spatially resolved spectroscopic observations from JWST/MIRI, VLT/MUSE, and ALMA to investigate the ionized atomic gas and the warm and cold molecular phases. MIRI data revealed over 40 mid-IR emission lines from ionized and warm molecular gas. Moment maps show that both cold and warm molecular gas follow the rotation of the stellar disk along the circumnuclear ring. The ionized gas displays flux and kinematic patterns that depend on ionization potential (IP): low-IP species (&lt;25 eV) trace the disk, while higher-IP lines (up to ~120 eV) trace outflowing material. The [O III]5700 and [Ne V]14 lines both trace the southeast nuclear outflow cone. Additionally, [Ne V]14 detects the northwest counter-cone, obscured in the optical and thus invisible in [O III]5700. Mid-IR diagnostics, unlike optical ones, clearly reveal the AGN as the primary ionization source in the nucleus. Emission from high-IP species is spatially coincident with the ionization cones and not with star-forming regions. Using the [Ne V]24/[Ne V]14 ratio, we derive an electron density of (750+-440) cm^(-3), in agreement with values from the [S II] optical doublet. For the first time, we apply a fully self-consistent approach combining advanced photoionization and kinematic models (HOMERUN+MOKA3D) to constrain intrinsic outflow properties, overcoming the limitations of simplified classical methods. Exploiting the synergy of JWST/MIRI and VLT/MUSE, HOMERUN reproduces fluxes of over 60 emission lines from optical to mid-IR, disentangling AGN and star formation contributions and yielding robust estimates of outflow mass, geometry, and energetics.

We report the detection of a gravitationally lensed galaxy by the nearby spiral galaxy CGCG 012-070 (z = 0.048) using Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations with the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) instrument on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The lensed galaxy is identified through the flux distributions of emission lines in the rest-frame optical, consistent with a source located at a redshift of z~2.89. The system is detected in [O III]&lambda;&lambda;4959,5007, H&beta;, and H&alpha; emission lines, exhibiting line ratios typical of a star-forming galaxy. The emission-line flux distributions reveal three distinct components, which are modeled using an elliptical power-law (EPL) mass profile for the lens galaxy. This model provides a good characterization of the source and reveals a disturbed star-forming morphology consistent with those of galaxies at cosmic noon. This serendipitous discovery of a rare low-redshift strong lens highlights the critical role of IFU observations in expanding the lens census and advancing our understanding of galaxy mass profiles and evolution.

Ionized proximity zones around luminous quasars provide a unique laboratory to characterize the Ly&alpha; emission lines from z&gt;6 galaxies without significant attenuation from the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, Ly&alpha; line measurements for galaxies within high-redshift quasars' proximity zones have been rare so far. Here we present deep spectroscopic observations obtained with the NIRSpec/MSA instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) of galaxies in two z&gt;6 quasar fields. We measure the Ly&alpha; line fluxes for 50 galaxies at 6&lt;z&lt;7 with UV absolute magnitude M_UV&lt;-19 (median M_UV=-19.97), among which 15 are located near the luminous quasars, i.e. within &Delta; v&lt;2500 km s<sup>-1</sup>. We find that galaxies near the quasars show significant flux bluewards of the systemic Ly&alpha; wavelength, and have higher Ly&alpha; equivalent width compared to galaxies at similar redshifts that are not located within the quasars' environment. Our result indicates little or no redshift evolution for the Ly&alpha;-emitter fraction from z~6.4 to z~5. Leveraging the low IGM opacity in the quasars' vicinity, we evaluate the Ly&alpha; escape fraction (f<sub>esc</sub>^Ly&alpha;) of high-redshift galaxies. Our analysis suggests that galaxies at &langle; z&rangle;≈6.4 have an average f<sub>esc</sub>^Ly&alpha;=0.14±0.04. This value is consistent with reionization models where the Lyman continuum escape fraction is low (f<sub>esc</sub>^LyC≲0.1) for luminous galaxies, and where the most luminous galaxies have only a minor contribution to the total ionizing photon budget.

We report the discovery of a complex, density-stratified interstellar medium (ISM) in the star-forming galaxy COS-2987 at z = 6.81, revealed by the unprecedented synergy between JWST/NIRSpec IFS and ALMA observations. These observations detect key emission lines, including \oii~&lambda;&lambda;~3727, 3730, [OIII]~4364, [OIII]~&lambda;&lambda;~4960, 5008, [OIII] 88 \micron, as well as H&alpha; and H&beta;. JWST spectroscopy alone indicates ISM properties that are typical for galaxies at z~7. These include low dust extinction (A_V ≈ 0.14 mag), moderate electron density (n_e ≈ 500~cm^-3), and low gas-phase metallicity (~10&percnt;). However, the strong far-infrared [OIII] 88 \micron emission detected by ALMA cannot be explained by a single-component ionized medium with uniform electron density and temperature. Instead, a two-component ISM model, comprising compact, high-temperature, high-density gas components (T_e ≈ 26,000 K; n_e ≈ 600~cm^-3) and an extended, cooler, lower-density component (T_e ≈ 8,000 K; n_e ≈ 50~cm^-3), successfully reproduces the observed line ratios of [OIII]~88~\micron/[OIII]~5008~&#8491; and [OIII]~4364/[OIII]~5008~&#8491;, with a volume ratio of 1 : 300 between the two components. Our results demonstrate that JWST alone probes only a fraction of the ISM and highlight the critical importance of combining JWST and ALMA to reveal the density-stratified ISM of early galaxies.

### 246) [2506.21658](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21658v2): Euclid and Roman with JWST Could Reveal Quasars at up to z ~ 15

<p> Muhammad A. Latif, Daniel J. Whalen </p>
<p>
Although supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are found at the centers of most galaxies today, over 300 have now been discovered at z &gt; 6, including UHZ1 at z = 10.1 and GHZ9 at z = 10.4. They are thought to form when 10^4 - 10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> primordial stars die as direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) at z ~ 20 - 25. While studies have shown that DCBHs should be visible at birth at z ≳ 20 in the near infrared (NIR) to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), none have considered SMBH detections at later stages growth down to z ~ 6 - 7. Here, we present continuum NIR luminosities for a BH like ULAS J1120+0641, a 1.35 × 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> quasar at z = 7.1, from a cosmological simulation for Euclid, the Roman Space Telescope (RST) and JWST bands from z = 6 - 15. We find that Euclid and RST could detect such BHs, including others like UHZ1 and GHZ9, at much earlier stages of evolution, out to z ~ 14 - 15, and that their redshifts could be confirmed spectroscopically with JWST. Synergies between these three telescopes could thus reveal the numbers of SMBHs at much higher redshifts and discriminate between their evolution pathways because Euclid and RST can capture large numbers of them in wide-field surveys for further study by JWST.

We analyse the ro-vibrational absorption bands of various molecular cations (HCO^+, HCNH^+, and N<sub>2</sub>H^+) and neutral species (HCN, HNC, and HC_3N) detected in the itJames Webb Space Telescope/Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium Resolution Spectrometer spectrum (4.9&ndash;27.9 \upmum) of the local ultra luminous infrared galaxy IRAS~07251-0248. We find that the molecular absorptions are blueshifted by 160 km s<sup>-1</sup> relative to the systemic velocity of the target. Using local thermal equilibrium (LTE) excitation models, we derive rotational temperatures (T_rot) from 42 to 185 K for these absorption bands. This range of measured T_rot can be explained by infrared (IR) radiative pumping as a by&ndash;product of the strength, effective critical density, and opacity of each molecular band. Thus, these results suggest that these absorptions originate in a warm expanding gas shell (M&#775;~90&ndash;330 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1), which might be the base of the larger scale cold molecular outflow detected in this source. Finally, the elevated abundance of molecular cations can be explained by a high cosmic ray ionization rate, with log(\zeta_H<sub>2</sub>/n_H  [cm^3  s<sup>-1</sup>]) in the range of -18.2 (from H_3^+) to -19.1 (inferred from HCO^+ and N<sub>2</sub>H^+, which are likely tracing denser gas), consistent with a cosmic ray dominated chemistry as predicted by chemical models.

### 248) [2506.15358](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15358v2): Expanding the Ice Inventory of NGC 1333 IRAS 2A with INDRA using JWST Observations: Tracing Organic Refractories and Beyond

<p>
In the era of JWST, with its unprecedented sensitivity and spectral resolution, infrared spectral surveys have revealed a rich inventory of ices, including complex organic molecules (COMs), in young stellar objects (YSOs). However, robust methods to decompose and quantify these absorption features particularly across broad spectral ranges, are still under investigation. We present INDRA (Ice-fitting with NNLS-based Decomposition and Retrieval Algorithm), a fully Python-based tool that performs continuum and silicate removal, global ice fitting using Weighted Non-Negative Least Squares (NNLS), and estimates column densities and statistical significance. We apply INDRA to NGC 1333 IRAS 2A, a target from the JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS+) program previously studied using local fitting. We derive optical depths via polynomial continuum subtraction and remove silicate absorption using a synthetic model, isolating ice features for global MIRI fitting. Our results are consistent with previous local fits, confirming simple species and COMs, and expand the inventory by identifying additional absorption features from CO2 and NH4+. We also propose the presence of organic refractories contributing up to 9.6% in the spectral region of 5-8 microns among the various ice components, whose inclusion significantly improves the global spectral fitting. These broad absorption features, extending across 5.5-11 microns, are likely produced by large, complex molecules containing carbonyl (C=O), hydroxyl (O-H), amine (N-H), and C-H bending modes. Our expanded inventory, now incorporating these organic residues, offers new insights into the chemical evolution of ices in star-forming regions and highlights the importance of global spectral fitting in constraining ice compositions.

<p>
We report the discovery of a little red dot (LRD), dubbed BiRD ('big red dot'), at z=2.33 in the field around the z=6.3 quasar SDSSJ1030+0524. Using NIRCam images, we identified it as a bright outlier in the F200W-F356W color vs F356W magnitude diagram of point sources in the field. The NIRCam/WFSS spectrum reveals the emission from HeI&lambda; 10830 and PaG line, both showing a narrow and a broad (FWHM≳ 2000 kms<sup>-1</sup>) component. The HeI line is affected by an absorption feature, tracing dense gas with HeI column density in the 2^3S level N~ 0.5-1.2× 10^14cm<sup>2</sup>, depending on the location of the absorber, which is outflowing at the speed of &Delta; v ~ -830 kms<sup>-1</sup>. As observed in the majority of LRDs, BiRD does not show X-ray or radio emission. The BH mass and the bolometric luminosity, both inferred from the PaG broad component, amount to M_BH~ 10^8M<sub>&odot;</sub> and L_bol~ 2.9× 10^45ergs<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Intriguingly, BiRD presents strict analogies with other two LRDs spectroscopically confirmed at cosmic noon, GN-28074 ("Rosetta Stone") at z=2.26 and RUBIES-BLAGN-1 at z=3.1. The blueshifted HeI absorption detected in all three sources suggests that gas outflows may be common in LRDs. We derive a first estimate of the space density of LRDs at z&lt;3 based on JWST data, as a function of L_bol and BH mass. The space density is only a factor of ~ 2-3 lower than that of UV-selected quasars with comparable L_bol and z, meaning that the contribution of LRDs to the broader AGN population is also relevant at cosmic noon. A similar trend is also observed in terms of BH masses. If, as suggested by recent theories, LRDs probe the very first and rapid growth of black hole seeds, our finding may suggest that the formation of black hole seeds remains efficient at least up to cosmic noon.

<p> Lewis R. Prole, John A. Regan, Daxal Mehta, Peter Coles, Pratika Dayal </p>
<p>
It has long been suggested that a fraction of the dark matter in the Universe could exist in the form of primordial black holes (PBHs) that have existed since the radiation dominated era. Recent studies have suggested that these PBHs may be the progenitors to the population of high-redshift, supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed since the launch of JWST. For the first time, we have included PBHs in cosmological simulations, to test whether PBHs can sink to the center of collapsing halos, locate dense gaseous regions and experience significant growth. We tested PBH-to-DM mass ratios of f_PBH = 10^-4 and 10^-3, with an initial PBH mass of 1000 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, as inspired by recent observational constraints. We find that at f_PBH = 10^-3, a number of PBHs were able to embed themselves in dense gas and grow to 10^4-10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> by z=20. These intermediate black holes (IMBHs) are possible progenitors to the highest redshift SMBH observations such as GNZ-11 (10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> by z=10), outperforming light seed black hole (BH) growth seen in recent simulations without the need to invoke heavy seeding prescriptions. On the other hand, f_PBH = 10^-4 resulted in no significant BH growth, emphasizing that the ability of PBHs to act as SMBH seeds is sensitive to the true value of f_PBH in the Universe, and showing that the f_PBH =10^-4-10^-3 boundary marks the threshold above which SMBH seeding via 1000 M<sub>&odot;</sub> PBHs becomes effective. This is the first step towards building a realistic PBH framework in cosmological simulations.

<p>
We present a new lens model for the z=0.375 galaxy cluster Abell 370 based on previously spectroscopically confirmed lensed galaxies and new lensed systems identified in JWST data, including recent data from the MAGNIF program. Based on the best models able to reproduce two radial arcs near the BCGs, we compare the stellar mass to the total mass from the lens model and find that the fraction of dark matter in the south BCG is consistent with &Lambda;CDM while in the north BCG we find a very small amount of dark matter, more consistent with alternative models to &Lambda;CDM. We discuss possible causes for this and conclude that additional data is needed to clarify the situation. We study the lensing properties, magnification, time delay and strength of the critical curve, along the Dragon arc, where previous studies have reported tens of alleged microlensing events from supergiant stars at z=0.7251. The new lens model is able to reproduce the distribution of microlensing events with great accuracy. Some of the microlensing events may be reinterpreted as long-period Cepheid in future observations. We consider this possibility and study in more detail the challenges for such detection from intervening microlenses.

### 252) [2506.05189](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05189v2): H3+ in irradiated protoplanetary disks: Linking far-ultraviolet radiation and water vapor

<p> Javier R. Goicoechea, Octavio Roncero, Evelyne Roueff, John H. Black, Ilane Schroetter, Olivier Berné </p>
<p>
The likely JWST detection of vibrationally excited H3+ emission in Orion's irradiated disk system d203-506, reported by Schroetter et al., raises an important question: is cosmic-ray ionization enhanced in disks within clustered star-forming regions, or do alternative mechanisms contribute to H3+ formation and excitation? We present a detailed model of the photodissociation region (PDR) component of a protoplanetary disk-comprising the outer disk surface and the photoevaporative wind-exposed to strong external far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation. We investigate key gas-phase reactions involving excited H2 that lead to the formation of H3+ in the PDR, including detailed state-to-state dynamical calculations of reactions H2(v&gt;0) + HOC+ -&gt; H3+ + CO and H2(v&gt;0) + H+ -&gt; H2+ + H. We also consider the effects of photoionization of vibrationally excited H2(v≥4), a process not previously included in PDR or disk models. We find that these FUV-driven reactions dominate the formation of H3+ in the PDR of strongly irradiated disks, largely independently of cosmic-ray ionization. The predicted H3+ abundance in the disk PDR peaks at x(H3+) ~ 1E-8, coinciding with regions of enhanced HOC+ and water vapor abundances, and is linked to the strength of the external FUV field (G_0). The predicted H3+ column density (~1E13 cm<sup>2</sup>) agrees with the presence of H3+ in the PDR of d203-506. We also find that formation pumping, resulting from exoergic reactions between excited H2 and HOC+, drive the vibrational excitation of H3+ in these regions. We expect this photochemistry to be highly active in disks where G_0 &gt; 1E3. The H3+ formation pathways studied here may also be relevant in the inner disk region (near the host star), in exoplanetary ionospheres, and in the early Universe.

<p> Antti Rantala, Natalia Lahén, Thorsten Naab, Gastón J. Escobar, Giuliano Iorio </p>
<p>
Observations and high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations indicate that massive star clusters form through a complex hierarchical assembly. We use simulations including post-Newtonian dynamics (the BIFROST code) and stellar evolution (the SEVN module) to investigate this collisional assembly. With a full initial stellar mass function, we study the effect of initial binary, triple and massive single stars (450 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) on the assembly, structure, and kinematics of massive (M_cl~10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, N=1.8 × 10^6) star clusters. Simultaneously, intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs), potential seeds for supermassive black holes, can form and grow in our models by stellar collisions, tidal disruption events (TDEs) and black hole (BH) mergers. At a fixed cluster mass, stellar multiplicity or a high mass limit increase the numbers (up to ~ 10) and masses (up to 10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) of the formed IMBHs within the first 10 Myr of cluster evolution. The TDE rates peak at \Gamma_tde~ 5 × 10^-5 yr^-1 after IMBH formation at ~ 2 Myr. In all simulations, we find gravitational wave driven mergers involving stellar BHs and IMBHs. Initial multiplicity or a high mass limit also result in IMBH-IMBH mergers. The IMBH masses correlate with the initial cluster masses, surface densities and velocity dispersions approximately as M<sub>&bull;</sub> &prop; M_cl, M<sub>&bull;</sub>&prop;&Sigma;_h^3/2 and M<sub>&bull;</sub>&prop;&sigma;^3. Our results suggest the dense z~10 star clusters recently observed by the James Webb Space Telescope host IMBHs with masses above M<sub>&bull;</sub> ≳ 10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>.

### 254) [2506.04310](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04310v2): Fast Rotators at Cosmic Noon: Stellar Kinematics for 15 Quiescent Galaxies from JWST-SUSPENSE

<p>
We present spatially-resolved stellar kinematics of 15 massive (M_*=10^10.5-11.5M<sub>&odot;</sub>) quiescent galaxies at z~1.2-2.3 from the JWST-SUSPENSE program. This is the largest sample of spatially-resolved kinematic measurements of quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon to date. Our measurements are derived from ultra-deep NIRSpec/MSA stellar absorption line spectra, using a forward modelling approach that accounts for optics, source morphology, positioning, and data reduction effects. 10 out of 15 galaxies are orientated such that we can measure rotational support. Remarkably, all 10 galaxies show significant rotation (V_r_e=117-345km/s, &sigma;_0 = 180-387km/s), and are classified as "fast rotators" from their spin parameter. The remaining galaxies are too misaligned with respect to the slit to constrain their rotational velocities. The widespread rotational support in our sample indicates that the process responsible for quenching star formation in early massive galaxies did not destroy rotating disc structures. When combined with other quiescent galaxy samples at z~0.5-2.5, we find a trend between rotational support and age, with younger quiescent galaxies being more rotationally supported. This age trend has also been found at z~0, and likely explains why our high-redshift galaxies show more rotational support compared to massive ETGs at z~0, which are, on average, older. Our kinematic modelling also enables us to calculate dynamical masses. These dynamical masses greatly exceed the stellar masses for our sample (median M_dyn/M_*=2.7); they even allow for the bottom-heavy IMF found in the cores of low-z massive ellipticals. Altogether, our results support a scenario in which distant quiescent galaxies evolve into nearby massive ETGs, gradually building up their outskirts and simultaneously losing rotation, due to a series of (mostly minor) mergers.

### 255) [2506.04119](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04119v3): Exploring over 700 massive quiescent galaxies at z = 2-7: Demographics and stellar mass functions

<p> William M. Baker, Francesco Valentino, Claudia del P. Lagos, Kei Ito, Christian Kragh Jespersen, Rashmi Gottumukkala, Jens Hjorth, Danial Langeroodi, Aidan Sedgewick </p>
<p>
High-redshift (z&gt;2) massive quiescent galaxies are crucial tests of early galaxy formation and evolutionary mechanisms through their cosmic number densities and stellar mass functions (SMFs). We explore a sample of 743 massive (M_*&gt; 10^9.5M<sub>&odot;</sub>) quiescent galaxies from z=2-7 in over 800 arcmin<sup>2</sup> of NIRCam imaging from a compilation of public JWST fields (with a total area &gt; 5 × previous JWST studies). We compute and report their cosmic number densities, stellar mass functions, and cosmic stellar mass density. We confirm a significant overabundance of massive quiescent galaxies relative to a range of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and semi-analytic models (SAMs). We find that no simulations or SAMs accurately reproduce the SMF for massive quiescent galaxies at any redshift within the interval z=2-5. This shows that none of these models' feedback prescriptions are fully capturing high-z galaxy quenching, challenging the standard formation scenarios. We find a greater abundance of lower-mass (M_*&lt;10^10M<sub>&odot;</sub>) quiescent galaxies than previously found, highlighting the importance of sSFR cuts rather than simple colour selection. We show the importance of this selection bias, alongside individual field-to-field variations caused by cosmic variance, in varying the observed quiescent galaxy SMF, especially at higher-z. We also find a steeper increase in the cosmic stellar mass density for massive quiescent galaxies than has been seen previously, with &rho;_*&prop; (1+z)^-7.2±0.3, indicating the dramatic increase in the importance of galaxy quenching within these epochs.

Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal a previously unseen population of compact red objects, known as "little red dots" (LRDs). We study a new photometrically selected sample of 124 LRDs in the redshift range z ~ 3 - 10 selected from NIRCam coverage of the CEERS, NEP-TDF, JADES and JEMS surveys. For JADES, the NEP-TDF and CEERS, we compare SED models with and without AGN components and analyse the impact of an AGN component on the goodness of fit using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). We find that whilst the &chi;<sup>2</sup> of the majority of models containing AGN components is improved compared to models without AGN components, we show that the BIC suggests models without AGN are a more appropriate fit to LRD SEDs, especially when MIRI data is available. We also measure LRD clustering in the CEERS field, JADES field, and NEP-TDF, where we compare the spatial distribution of LRDs and galaxies with Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of equality of distribution. We find that the neighbourhood of LRDs tends to be less dense compared to galaxies at all selections and masses and at similar redshifts. We further measure upper limit estimates for the halo masses of LRDs using abundance matching. Whilst the population of LRDs could be a mixture of several different inherent populations, as a whole it does appear that these systems are mostly hosting compact galaxies or star clusters in formation.

### 257) [2506.03242](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03242v2): Age dependence of Lyα escape fraction of Lyα emitters and their significant role in cosmic reionization

<p> Shunta Shimizu, Nobunari Kashikawa, Satoshi Kikuta, Yoshihiro Takeda, Junya Arita, Ryo Emori, Kentaro Koretomo </p>
<p>
We study the Ly&alpha; escape fraction, f<sub>esc</sub>^Ly&alpha; of Ly&alpha; emitters (LAEs) identified by Subaru/HSC narrowband imaging at z = 2.2-6.6, using publicly available deep imaging data from HST and JWST. We perform SED fitting for 127 LAEs at 0.4 - 5.0  &mu; m to estimate their physical properties robustly, and confirm that two distinct LAE populations exist: young LAEs (&lt; 100 Myr) and old LAEs (&gt; 100 Myr). Young LAEs are characterized by burst-like star formation activity and low dust content, significantly differing from Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at the same stellar mass, while old LAEs show similar star formation activity to LBGs, yet with lower dust content and more compact morphology in rest-UV/optical than LBGs. The f<sub>esc</sub>^Ly&alpha; of LAEs is anticorrelated with stellar mass, and this correlation is found to depend on the age of LAEs, such that old LAEs show a weaker anticorrelation than young LAEs, and tend to exhibit higher f<sub>esc</sub>^Ly&alpha; than young LAEs at a given stellar mass. This implies that Ly&alpha; photons escape more efficiently from old LAEs, possibly through the low-density channels of HI and dust created by outflows. The average f<sub>esc</sub>^Ly&alpha; of young LAEs remains nearly constant at ~40% at z = 2.2-6.6, suggesting that the previously observed evolution of global f<sub>esc</sub>^Ly&alpha; of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is due to the changes in the LAE fraction among the SFGs. Converting f<sub>esc</sub>^Ly&alpha; to Lyman continuum escape fraction using empirical relations, we demonstrate that LAEs alone can supply the ionizing photons necessary for reionization at z~6, causing rapid and late reionization.

### 258) [2505.20263](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20263v2): Bursty or heavy? The surprise of bright Population III systems in the Reionization era

<p> Alessandra Venditti, Julian B. Munoz, Volker Bromm, Seiji Fujimoto, Steven L. Finkelstein, John Chisholm </p>
<p>
The nature of the first, so-called Population III (Pop III) stars has for long remained largely unconstrained. However, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) finally opened new concrete prospects for their detection during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), notably providing promising observational constraints on the Pop III ultra-violet luminosity function (UVLF) at z ≈ 5.6 - 6.6. These preliminary data hint towards an unexpected population of UV-bright Pop III sources, which challenges the prevailing view that Pop III star formation is confined to molecular-cooling mini-halos. Here we show that there are two families of models that can explain these surprising observations, either by allowing for late-time Pop III formation within massive, atomic-cooling halos (with halo masses up to M^III_up ≳ 10^10   M<sub>&odot;</sub>) or by invoking a highly bursty Pop III star-formation activity (with a stochasticity parameter &sigma;^III_UV ≳ 1.5). In these scenarios, Pop III systems would have to be either heavier or burstier than usually assumed, underscoring the need to reconsider common assumptions about Pop III star-formation sites, and the potential implications of JWST candidates for current and future observations.

### 259) [2505.17188](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17188v2): The Lyman-α emitter bispectrum as a probe of reionization morphology

<p> Soumak Maitra, Girish Kulkarni, Shikhar Asthana, James S. Bolton, Martin G. Haehnelt, Laura Keating </p>
<p>
Ly&alpha; emitters (LAEs) have now been discovered out to redshift z=13, and are valuable probes of the reionization history at redshifts beyond the reach of other currently available tracers. Most inferences of the neutral hydrogen fraction from LAE observations rely on one-point and two-point statistics like the luminosity function and the power spectrum. We present here an analysis of the bispectrum of high-redshift LAEs and demonstrate its sensitivity to the Epoch of Reionization. We use the Sherwood-Relics suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with the GPU-based radiative transfer code ATON-HE to generate realistic LAE mock catalogues for a wide range of reionization models, varying the ionization history and the source populations, including contributions of AGN to hydrogen reionization. We demonstrate that the bispectrum provides greater sensitivity than the power spectrum to both the timing and spatial morphology of reionization. Using reduced-&chi;<sup>2</sup> analysis we further show that the bispectrum also responds more strongly to variations in source population and AGN contribution, apparently more efficiently capturing morphological features missed by two-point statistics. The redshift evolution of the bispectrum reflects the increased clustering of ionizing sources at earlier epochs. The sensitivity of the bispectrum to peculiar velocities underscores the importance of velocity corrections in comparisons to observations. Our findings demonstrate that the LAE bispectrum is a powerful higher-order statistic for probing reionization through current and future LAE surveys using telescopes such as Subaru and JWST.

<p>
The relative fraction of obscured galaxies at z&gt;4 compared to lower redshifts remains highly uncertain as accurate bookkeeping of the dust-obscured component proves difficult. We address this shortcoming with SCUBADive, a compilation of the JWST counterparts of (sub-)millimeter galaxies in COSMOS-Web, in order to further analyze the distribution and properties of massive dust-obscured galaxies at early times. In this paper, we present a subset of SCUBADive, focusing on 60 "dark'' galaxies that dropout at 1.5\micron. Motivated by JWST observations of AzTECC71, a far-infrared bright F150W-dropout with z<sub>phot</sub>=5.7^+0.8_-0.7, we complete a systematic search of F150W-dropouts with SCUBA-2 and ALMA detections to find more candidate high redshift dusty galaxies. Within our subsample, 16 are most similar to AzTECC71 due to fainter F444W magnitudes (&gt;24 mag) and lack of counterparts in COSMOS2020. Despite high star formation rates (&langle;SFR&rangle;=450^+920_-320 \mdot yr^-1) and large stellar masses (&langle;log_10(\mstar)&rangle;=11.2^+0.5_-0.6 \mdot) on average, these galaxies may not be particularly extreme for their presumed epochs according to offsets from the main sequence. We find that heavily obscured galaxies, which would be missed by pre-JWST optical imaging campaigns, comprise ≳20&percnt; of galaxies across mass bins and potentially contribute up to 60&percnt; at the very high mass end (log_10(\mstar/\mdot)&gt;11.5) of the z&gt;4 stellar mass function.

<p> Mahsa Kohandel, Andrea Pallottini, Andrea Ferrara </p>
<p>
Synergies between JWST and ALMA are unveiling a population of bright, super-early (z&gt;10) galaxies, including systems like GS-z14-0 (z=14.2) and GHZ2 (z=12.3) with extreme FIR line ratios ([OIII] 88 um / [CII] 158 um &gt;3) that challenge galaxy formation models. To address this, we identify a synthetic analog of these sources, "Amaryllis", within the SERRA zoom-in simulations, and track its evolution from z=16 to z=7. During this period, Amaryllis grows from log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ~ 7.4 to 10.3, linking super-early progenitors to the massive galaxy population at the end of reionization. At z ~ 11.5, Amaryllis closely matches the observed properties of GS-z14-0, including M<sub>&sext;</sub>, SFR, and the luminosity of FIR ([OIII] 88 um) and UV (e.g. CIII] 1908) lines. We find that high [OIII]/[CII] ratios appear during short, merger-driven starburst episodes, when low metallicity (Z ~ 0.02 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) and high ionization conditions (U<sub>ion</sub> ~ 0.1) push the ISM far from equilibrium. These extreme FIR line ratios are thus transient and linked to major mergers that ignite strong ionized gas outflows. Strikingly, despite this dynamical activity, Amaryllis develops a rotation-supported gaseous disk (V/&sigma; ~ 4-6) by z ~ 11, while stars remain dispersion-dominated. This coexistence of ordered gas rotation and merger-driven disturbances occurs within a massive yet typical &Lambda;CDM halo, enabling disk formation even at cosmic dawn.

<p>
We present the morphological properties of 17 spectroscopically confirmed massive quiescent galaxies (10.2 &lt; log(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &lt; 11.2) at 3.0 &lt; z &lt; 4.3, observed with JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam. Using S\'ersic profile fits to F277W and F444W imaging, we derive the size-mass relation and find typical sizes of ~0.6&ndash;0.8 kpc at M<sub>&ast;</sub> = 5 × 10^10~M<sub>&odot;</sub>, consistent with ~7× growth from z ~ 4 to the present, including ~2× by z ~ 2. We find tentative evidence that formation history and morphology jointly influence galaxy sizes: late-forming bulge-dominated galaxies appear more compact by ~0.2-0.3 dex relative to the expected relation, while late-forming disk-dominated galaxies are larger. Using a random forest regressor, we identify local environmental density, quantified by log(1+&delta;^&prime;_3) from the three nearest neighbors, as the strongest predictor of bulge-to-total ratio (B/T), which spans 0.25-1. In the \sc IllustrisTNG simulation, the ex-situ stellar mass fraction (f<sub>&ast;</sub>,ex-situ) &ndash; a proxy for mergers &ndash; is instead the dominant predictor of B/T. Galaxies with high B/T in dense environments show bursty star formation and short quenching timescales (≲0.4 Gyr), consistent with bulge growth through merger-driven starbursts; in simulations, such systems exhibit elevated ex-situ fractions (~20-30%). In contrast, some high-B/T galaxies in intermediate-density environments have low ex-situ fractions, suggesting that additional processes &ndash; such as violent disk instabilities &ndash; also contribute. These results point to multiple bulge growth pathways at high redshift, unified by rapid gas accretion, central starbursts, and AGN feedback, as predicted by cosmological simulations.

<p> John Ellis, Malcolm Fairbairn, Juan Urrutia, Ville Vaskonen </p>
<p>
We confront the star formation rate in different dark matter (DM) models with UV luminosity data from JWST up to z≃25 and legacy data from HST. We find that a transition from a Salpeter population to top-heavy Pop-III stars is likely at z≃10 and that beyond z=10-15 the feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei is progressively reduced, so that at z≃25 the production of stars is almost free from any feedback. We compare fuzzy and warm DM models that suppress small-scale structures with the CDM paradigm, finding that the fuzzy DM mass &gt; 4.5 × 10^-22 eV and the warm DM mass &gt; 1.5  keV at the 95&percnt; CL. The fits of the star formation rate parametrization do not depend strongly on the DM properties within the allowed range. We find no preference over CDM for enhanced matter perturbations associated with axion miniclusters or primordial black holes. The scale of the enhancement of the power spectrum should be &gt; 27 Mpc^-1 at the 95&percnt; CL, excluding axion miniclusters produced for m_a &lt; 7.5 × 10^-17 eV or heavy primordial black holes that constitute a fraction f_PBH &gt; Max[88 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/m_PBH, 10^-4 (m_PBH/10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>)^-0.09] of DM.

<p> L. Y. Aaron Yung, Rachel S. Somerville, Kartheik G. Iyer </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope continues to push back the redshift frontier to ever earlier cosmic epochs, with recent announcements of galaxy candidates at redshifts of 15 ≲ z ≲ 30. We leverage the recent GUREFT suite of dissipationless N-body simulations, which were designed for interpreting observations in the high redshift Universe, and provide predictions of dark matter halo mass functions and halo growth rates for a state-of-the-art cosmology over a wide range of halo masses from 6 &lt; z&lt; 30. We combine these results with an empirical framework that maps halo growth rate to galaxy star formation rate and then to rest-frame UV luminosity. We find that even if all of the photometrically selected 15 ≲ z ≲ 30 galaxy candidates are real and actually at these extreme redshifts, there is no fundamental tension with &Lambda;CDM, nor are exotic explanations required. With stellar light-to-mass ratios similar to those in well-studied lower redshift galaxies, our simple model can account for the observed extreme ultra-high redshift populations with star formation efficiencies that peak at values of 20-65 percent. Bursty star formation, or higher light-to-mass ratios such as are expected for lower metallicity stellar populations or a top-heavy Initial Mass Function, would result in even lower required star formation efficiencies, comparable to values predicted by high resolution numerical simulations of high-surface density star forming clouds.

We present the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) for a parent sample of 604 galaxies at z=5.34-6.94 with \OIII doublets detected, using the deep JWST/NIRCam wide field slitless spectroscopic (WFSS) observations in 26 quasar fields. The sample incorporates the full observations of 25 quasar fields from the JWST Cycle 1 GO program ASPIRE and the quasar SDSS J0100+2802 from the JWST EIGER program. We identify 204 galaxies residing in overdense structures using the friends-of-friends (FoF) algorithm. We estimate the electron temperature of 2.0^+0.3_-0.4×10^4 K from the Hg and OIII4363 lines in the stacked spectrum, indicating a metal-poor sample with median gas phase metallicity 12+log(O/H)=7.65^+0.26_-0.15. With the most up-to-date strong line calibration based on NIRSpec observations, we find that the MZR shows a metal enhancement of ~0.2 dex at the high mass end in overdense environments. However, compared to the local Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR), our galaxy sample at z&gt;5 shows a metal deficiency of ~0.2 dex relative to FMR predictions. We explain the observed trend of FMR with a simple analytical model, favoring dilution from intense gas accretion over outflow to explain the metallicity properties at z &gt; 5. Those high-redshift galaxies are likely in a rapid gas accretion phase, during which their metal and gas contents are in a non-equilibrium state. According to model predictions, the protocluster members are closer to the gas equilibrium state than field galaxies and thus have higher metallicity and are closer to the local FMR. Our results suggest that the accelerated star formation during protocluster assembly likely plays a key role in shaping the observed MZR and FMR, indicating a potentially earlier onset of metal enrichment in overdense environments at z≈5-7.

We have discovered a substantial sodium doublet (Na D &lambda;&lambda;5890, 5896&#8491;)-traced neutral outflow in a quiescent galaxy JADES-GS-206183 at z=1.317 in GOODS-S field. Its JWST NIRSpec/MSA spectrum shows a significantly blueshifted and deep Na D absorption, revealing a neutral outflow with a velocity of v_out=828^+79_-49 km s<sup>-1</sup> and a mass outflow rate of log(M&#775;_out/M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1)=2.40^+0.11_-0.16. This outflow rate exceeds that of any neutral outflows identified beyond z~1 by the same line diagnostic and is comparable with those in local galaxies with intensive star formation or luminous AGN. Nonetheless, the Paschen &alpha; (Pa&alpha;) emission in the FRESCO NIRCam grism confirms that its star formation rate is low (SFR_Pa&alpha;=10.78± 0.55 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1), corresponding to a low specific SFR of -10.2 yr^-1, 0.5 dex below the main sequence. The best-fit SED modeling based on its multi-band photometry from HST/ACS to JWST/NIRCam and the VLT/MUSE spectrum, suggests this galaxy has experienced a quiescent period lasting about one Gyr or more while seems to rejuvenate within the recent 10 Myr. Surprisingly, rest-frame optical lines indicate that the current AGN activity of JADES-GS-206183, if present, is also weak. Even though we tentatively detect a broad component of the H&alpha; line, it is more likely tracing the ionized outflow than an AGN. The results demonstrate that the Na D outflow in JADES-GS-206183 is highly unlikely to be driven by current star formation or nuclear activity. Instead, we propose that this outflow may be a long-lasting fossil one driven by past AGN activity, potentially co-triggered with the early phase of rejuvenation.

<p>
The rates and properties of tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide valuable insights into their host galaxy central stellar densities and the demographics of their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). TDEs have been observed only at low redshifts (z ≲ 1), due to the difficulty in conducting deep time-domain surveys. In this work, we present the discovery of a high-redshift TDE candidate, HZTDE-1, in the COSMOS-Web survey with JWST's NIRCam, using a novel selection technique based on color and morphology. We first outline a methodology for identifying high-z TDEs in deep infrared imaging surveys, leveraging their unique spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and morphologies of these transients. We apply this technique to COSMOS-Web in filters F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W, and identify HZTDE-1, a transient point source relative to archival UltraVISTA infrared observations. If we assume it is a TDE, we estimate its photometric redshift to be z=5.02^+1.32_-1.11. HZTDE-1 cannot be explained by reasonable supernova or AGN models. However, we cannot rule out a superluminous supernova at z≳3. If confirmed with follow-up observations, HZTDE-1 would represent the highest-redshift TDE discovery to date, and would suggest an enhancement of the TDE rate in the high-redshift universe. Our method, which can be applied to future deep surveys with JWST and Roman, offers a pathway to identify TDEs at z&gt;4 and probe black hole demographics at early cosmic times.

### 268) [2504.06334](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06334v3): UNCOVER/MegaScience: No Evidence of Environmental Quenching in a z~2.6 Proto-cluster

<p>
Environmental quenching &ndash; where interactions with other galaxies and/or the intra-cluster medium (ICM) suppress star formation in low-mass galaxies &ndash; has been well-established as the primary driver behind the formation of the red sequence for low-mass galaxies within clusters at low redshift (z&lt;1). However, it remains unclear whether these mechanisms are active at higher-redshifts in proto-cluster environments that are not yet fully virialized. In large part, this regime has remained unexplored due to observational limitations; however, JWST has recently opened a new window into the role of environmental quenching on low-mass (log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>&lt;9.0) galaxies at cosmic noon (2 &lt; z &lt; 3). Here, we leverage the deep imaging and R~15 spectrophotometry enabled by the 20 band JWST/NIRCam data from the UNCOVER and MegaScience programs to examine environmental quenching in a newly discovered z≈2.58 proto-cluster. We compare the star formation histories (SFHs) of 19 low-mass quiescent galaxies in the proto-cluster to a matched sample of 18 in the field, and find no significant differences. This similarity extends to galaxy sizes and quenched fractions, which also show no significant differences between the two environments across the full stellar mass range (8.5&lt;log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>≤11.0). This indicates that the proto-cluster has not yet accelerated quenching relative to the field and is consistent with expectations that z&gt;2 proto-clusters have yet to virialize and develop a dense enough environment required to efficiently quench low-mass galaxies.

### 269) [2504.03839](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03839v2): MARTA: Temperature-temperature relationships and strong-line metallicity calibrations from multiple auroral-line detections at cosmic noon

<p>
We present the first results from MARTA (Measuring Abundances at high Redshift with the T_e Approach), a programme leveraging ultra-deep, medium-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy to probe the interstellar medium (ISM) of star-forming galaxies at z ~ 2 - 3. We report detections of one or more auroral lines, including [O III]&lambda;4363, [O II]&lambda;&lambda;7320,7330, [S II] &lambda;4068, and [S III] &lambda;6312 for 16 galaxies in the sample, providing measurements of multiple ionic temperatures. We tested the validity of the T[O II]-T[O III] relation at high redshift considering a total sample of 21 objects including literature data, and obtained a shallower slope than in the low-z literature. However, such a slope is consistent with low-redshift data when ultra-low metallicity objects are considered. We assessed the correlation of the T[O II]-T[O III] relationship and its scatter on different physical parameters, finding a mild correlation with the ionisation parameter and radiation field hardness, while no significant correlation with gas density. The location of high-redshift data is also consistent with the low-z literature in the T[O II]-T[S II], and T[S III]-T[O III] relations, although this conclusion is limited with low-number statistics. Finally, we leveraged our sample together with a comprehensive compilation of galaxies with [O III]&lambda;4363 detections from the literature to recalibrate classical strong-line diagnostics at high redshift. MARTA represents a key addition in this space because it provides direct metallicities at moderately high oxygen abundances (12+log(O/H) ~8.0-8.4).

### 270) [2504.02683](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02683v2): Probing patchy reionisation with JWST: IGM opacity constraints from the Lyman-α forest of galaxies in legacy extragalactic fields

<p> Romain A. Meyer, Guido Roberts-Borsani, Pascal Oesch, Richard S. Ellis </p>
<p>
We present the first characterization of the Gunn-Peterson trough in high-redshift galaxies using public JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy. This enables us to derive the first galaxy-based IGM opacity measurements at the end of reionisation. Using galaxy spectra has several advantages over quasar spectra: it enables measurements of the IGM opacity in any extragalactic field over a continuous redshift range 4≲ z≲ 7, as well as measurements of the intrinsic Lyman-&beta; opacity. Our novel constraints are in good agreement with state-of-the-art ground-based quasar Lyman-&alpha; forest observations, and will become competitive as the number of JWST z&gt;5 galaxy spectra rapidly increases. We also provide the first constraints on the uncontaminated Lyman-&beta; opacity at 5&lt;z&lt;6. Finally, we demonstrate the power of JWST to connect the ionisation state of the IGM to the sources of reionisation in a single extragalactic field. We show that a previously reported galaxy overdensity and an excess of Lyman-&alpha; emitters detected with JWST in GOODS-South at z=5.8-5.9 coincides with an anomalously low IGM opacity to Lyman-&alpha; at this redshift. The local photo-ionisation rate excess can be fully accounted for by the cumulative ionising output of M_UV≲ -10 galaxies in the overdensity, provided they have log_10&langle;  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  f<sub>esc</sub> /  [erg^-1 Hz]&rangle; ≃ 25 (e.g. log_10 &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  /  [erg^-1 Hz]=25.4 and f<sub>esc</sub>=40&percnt;). Overall, this breakthrough offers a new way to connect the galaxy large-scale structure to the state of the IGM, potentially enabling us to precisely identify the sources of reionisation.

### 271) [2503.21879](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21879v2): A rapid channel for the collisional formation and gravitational wave driven mergers of supermassive black hole seeds at high redshift

<p> Antti Rantala, Thorsten Naab </p>
<p>
Motivated by JWST observations of dense, clumpy and clustered high redshift star formation, we simulate the hierarchical assembly of nine M_cl=10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> star clusters using the BIFROST N-body code. Our low metallicity models (0.01Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) with post-Newtonian equations of motion for black holes include evolving populations of single, binary and triple stars. Massive stars grow by stellar collisions and collapse into intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) up to M<sub>&bull;</sub>~6200 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, stellar multiplicity boosting the IMBH masses by a factor of 2&ndash;3. The IMBHs tidally disrupt (TDE) ~50 stars in 10 Myr with peak TDE rates up to \Gamma~5×10^-5 yr^-1 per cluster. These IMBHs are natural seeds for supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and the hierarchical assembly frequently leads to &gt;2 SMBH seeds per cluster and their rapid mergers (t&lt;10 Myr). We propose that a gravitational wave (GW) driven merger of IMBHs with 1000 M<sub>&odot;</sub> ≲ M<sub>&bull;</sub> ≲ 10000 M<sub>&odot;</sub> with comparable masses is a characteristic GW fingerprint of SMBH seed formation at redshifts z&gt;10, and IMBH formation in similar environments at lower redshifts. Massive star clusters provide a unique environment for the early Universe GW studies for the next-generation GW observatories including the Einstein Telescope and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.

### 272) [2503.21687](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21687v2): Exploiting synergies between JWST and cosmic 21-cm observations to uncover star formation in the early Universe

<p> Jiten Dhandha, Anastasia Fialkov, Thomas Gessey-Jones, Harry T. J. Bevins, Sandro Tacchella, Simon Pochinda, Eloy de Lera Acedo, Saurabh Singh, Rennan Barkana </p>
<p>
In the current era of JWST, we continue to uncover a wealth of information about the Universe deep into the Epoch of Reionization. In this work, we use a suite of simulations with 21cmSPACE, to explore the astrophysical properties of early galaxies and their imprint on high-redshift observables. Our analysis incorporates a range of multi-wavelength datasets including UV luminosity functions (UVLFs) from HST and JWST spanning z=6-14.5, the 21-cm global signal and power spectrum limits from SARAS 3 and HERA respectively, as well as present-day diffuse X-ray and radio backgrounds. We constrain a flexible halo-mass and redshift dependent model of star-formation efficiency (SFE), defined as the fraction of gas converted into stars, and find that it is best described by minimal redshift evolution at z≈ 6-10, followed by rapid evolution at z≈10-15. Using Bayesian inference, we derive functional posteriors of the SFE, inferring that halos of mass M_h=10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> have efficiencies of ≈ 1 - 2&percnt; at z≲10, ≈8&percnt; at z=12 and ≈21&percnt; at z=15. We also highlight the synergy between UVLFs and global 21-cm signal from SARAS 3 in constraining the minimum virial conditions required for star-formation in halos. In parallel, we find the X-ray and radio efficiencies of early galaxies to be f_X = 0.8^+9.7_-0.4 and f_r ≲ 16.9 respectively, improving upon previous works that exclude UVLF data. Our results underscore the critical role of UVLFs in constraining early galaxy properties, and their synergy with 21-cm and other multi-wavelength observations.

<p>
We present the survey design and initial results from the Parallel Ionizing Emissivity (PIE) survey. PIE is a large HST survey designed to detect Lyman continuum (LyC) emitting galaxies at 3.1&lt; z &lt;3.5 and stack their images in order to measure average LyC escape fractions as a function of galaxy properties. PIE has imaged 37 independent fields in three filters (F336W, F625W and F814W), of which 18 are observed with a fourth band (F475W) from the accompanying PIE+ program. We use photometric colors to select candidate Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) at 3.1&lt; z &lt;3.5, which can be followed up using ground-based spectrographs to confirm their redshifts. Unlike previous surveys, we use many independent fields to remove biases caused by correlated absorption in the IGM. In this paper, we describe the survey design, photometric measurements, and the use of mock galaxy samples to optimize our color selection. With 3 filters, we can select a galaxy sample of which ≈90&percnt; are LBGs and over 30&percnt; lie in the 3.1&lt; z &lt;3.5 range for which we can detect uncontaminated LyC emission in F336W. We also use mock IGM sightlines to measure the expected transmission of the IGM, which will allow us to determine escape fractions from our stacked galaxies. We color-select ≈1400 galaxies, and predict that this includes ≈80 LyC-emitting galaxies and ≈500 that we can use in stacking. Finally, we present the Keck/LRIS spectrum of a galaxy at z ≈ 2.99, demonstrating that we can confirm the redshifts of z ~ 3 galaxies from the ground.

### 274) [2503.18850](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18850v2): Beyond the first galaxies primordial black holes shine

<p> Antonio Matteri, Andrea Ferrara, Andrea Pallottini </p>
<p>
The presence of nine candidate galaxies at z=17 and z=25 discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope in relatively small sky areas, if confirmed, is virtually impossible to reconcile with the predictions of the current galaxy formation model. We show here that the implied UV luminosity density can be produced by a population of primordial black holes (PBHs) of mass M_PBH = 10^4-5   M<sub>&odot;</sub> residing in low-mass halos (M_h ≈ 10^7   M<sub>&odot;</sub>), and accreting at a moderate fraction of the Eddington luminosity, &lambda;_E ≃ 0.36. These sources precede the first significant episodes of cosmic star formation. At later times, as star formation is ignited, PBH emission becomes comparable to, or subdominant with respect to, the galactic emission. This PBH+galaxy scenario reconciles the evolution of the UV luminosity function (LF) from z=25 to z=11. If ultra-early sources are powered purely by accretion, this strongly disfavours seed production mechanisms requiring the presence of stars (massive stars, Pop III stars, or clusters), or their UV radiation (direct collapse BHs), leaving PBHs as the only alternative solution available so far. Alternative explanations, such as isolated, large clusters (≈ 10^7  M<sub>&odot;</sub>) of massive (m<sub>&sext;</sub> =10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) Pop III stars are marginally viable, but require extreme and unlikely conditions that can be probed via UV and far-infrared (FIR) emission lines or gravitational waves.

We present a sample of six F200W and three F277W dropout sources identified as 16&lt;z&lt;25 galaxy candidates using the deepest JWST/NIRCam data to date (5&sigma; depths ~31.5 mag at ≥2 &mu;m), provided by the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) and the Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public survey (NGDEEP). We estimate ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions and densities at z~17 and z~25. The number density of galaxies with absolute magnitudes -19&lt;M_UV&lt;-18 at z~17 (z~25) is a factor of 4 (25) smaller than at z~12; the luminosity density presents a similar evolution. Compared to state-of-the-art galaxy simulations, we find the need for an enhanced UV-photon production at z=17-25 in M_DM=10^8.5-9.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> dark matter halos, provided by an increase in the star formation efficiency at early times and/or by intense compact starbursts with enhanced emissivity linked to strong burstiness, low or primordial gas metallicities, and/or a top-heavy initial mass function. There are few robust theoretical predictions for the evolution of galaxies above z~20 in the literature, however, the continuing rapid drop in the halo mass function would predict a more rapid evolution than we observe if photon production efficiencies remained constant. Our z&gt;16 candidates present mass-weighted ages around 30 Myr, and attenuations A(V)&lt;0.1 mag. Their average stellar mass is M_\bigstar~10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, implying a stellar-to-baryon mass fraction around 10% if the emissivity increases with redshift, or significantly higher otherwise. Three candidates present very blue UV spectral slopes (&beta;~-3) compatible with Pop III young (≲10 Myr) stars and/or high escape fractions of ionizing photons; the rest have &beta;~-2.5 similar to z=10-12 samples.

<p>
We derive Fe-abundance ratios of 7 galaxies at z=9-12 with -22&lt;M_UV&lt;-19 whose JWST/NIRSpec spectra achieve very high signal-to-noise ratios, SNR=60-320, at the rest-frame UV wavelength. We fit stellar population synthesis model spectra to these JWST spectra, masking out nebular emission lines, and obtain Fe-abundance ratios of [Fe/H]=-1-0 dex for 5 galaxies and upper limits of [Fe/H]~-2-0 dex for 2 galaxies. We compare these [Fe/H] values with the oxygen abundances of these galaxies (7.4&lt;12+log(O/H)&lt;8.4) in the same manner as previous studies of z~2-6 galaxies, and derive oxygen-to-iron abundance ratios [O/Fe]. We find that 2 out of 7 galaxies, GS-z11-0 and GN-z11, show Fe enhancements relative to O ([O/Fe]&lt;0 dex), especially GS-z11-0 (z=11.12) with a Fe enhancement ([O/Fe]=-0.68_-0.55^+0.37 dex) beyond the solar-abundance ratio at ~2&sigma;. Because, unlike GS-z11-0, GN-z11 (z=10.60) may be an AGN, we constrain [O/Fe] via FeII emission under the assumption of AGN and confirm that the Fe enhancement is consistent even in the case of AGN. While [O/Fe] values of most galaxies are comparable to those of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) yields, the Fe enhancements of GS-z11-0 and GN-z11 are puzzling. We develop chemical evolution models, and find that the Fe enhancements in GS-z11-0 and GN-z11 can be explained by 1) pair-instability supernovae/bright hypernovae with little contribution of CCSNe or 2) Type-Ia supernovae with short delay time (~30-50 Myr) with a top-light initial mass function.

<p>
We compare forecasts for the abundance and properties of strong gravitational lenses in the COSMOS-Web survey, a 0.54 deg<sup>2</sup> survey of the COSMOS field using the NIRCam and MIRI instruments aboard JWST, with the first catalogue of strong lens candidates identified in the observed NIRCam data, COWLS. We modify the lenspop package to produce a forecast for strong lensing in COSMOS-Web. We add a new mock galaxy catalogue to use as the source population, as well as the COSMOS-Web survey specifications, including the transmission data for the four NIRCam filters used. We forecast 107 strong lenses can be detected in COSMOS-Web across all bands, assuming complete subtraction of the lens galaxy light. The majority of the lenses are forecast to have small Einstein radii (&theta;_E &lt; 1 arcsecond) and lie at redshifts between 0 &lt; z &lt;2, whilst the source redshift distribution peaks at z~ 3 and has a long tail extending up to z ~ 11, unambiguously showing that strong lensing in JWST can probe the entirety of the epoch of reionisation. We compare our forecast with the distributions of Einstein radii, lens photometric redshifts, and lens and source magnitudes in the observed lenses, finding that whilst the forecast and observed Einstein radii distributions match, the redshifts and magnitudes do not. The observed lens redshift distribution peaks at a slightly lower redshift than the forecast one, whilst the lens magnitudes are systematically brighter in the observed data than in the forecast.

### 278) [2503.08779](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08779v2): Seeding Cores: A Pathway for Nuclear Star Clusters from Bound Star Clusters in the First Billion Years

<p> Fred Angelo Batan Garcia, Massimo Ricotti, Kazuyuki Sugimura </p>
<p>
We model the formation of star clusters in a dwarf galaxy progenitor during the first 700 ~Myr of cosmic history using a cosmological radiation-hydrodynamic simulation with a sub-grid star formation efficiency (SFE) model calibrated from AU-scale radiation-MHD simulations of molecular clouds with varying mass, density, and metallicity. In comparison to a constant SFE model, our model yields more bursty star formation, a more abundant massive star cluster population, and overall a higher stellar mass. Clouds reach SFEs up to 80&percnt;, forming bound star clusters (densities ~10^2-4 ~M<sub>&odot;</sub>\:pc^-2, radii ≲ 3~pc) resembling those observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in strongly lensed galaxies. Star clusters follow a flat power-law mass function dN/dlog M &prop; M^\Gamma with slope \Gamma ~ -0.4. The most massive star clusters (10^4-5 ~M<sub>&odot;</sub>) grow through mergers and have metallicity spreads of 0.05 - 0.1 dex that roughly scale with mass. The second burst of star formation produce loosely bound star clusters with higher metallicities: -1.95 &lt; log(Z/Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) &lt; -1.50 at lower SFEs (2 - 20&percnt;). At z ~ 8.7, a nuclear star cluster (NSC) is seeded, growing 83&percnt; of its mass ( 2.4 × 10^5 ~M<sub>&odot;</sub>, 20&percnt; of the galaxy's stellar mass) through mergers with pre-existing clusters and the rest through in-situ star formation. The early formation of NSCs has interesting implications for seeding supermassive black holes and the population of itlittle red dots recently discovered by JWST at z ≳ 5

<p>
We present the COSMOS-Web Lens Survey (COWLS), a sample of over 100 strong lens candidates from the 0.54 deg<sup>2</sup> COSMOS-Web survey, discovered using exquisite James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging across four wavebands. Following two rounds of visual inspection, over 100 candidates were ranked as `high confidence' or `likely' by at least 50&percnt; of inspectors. The COWLS sample has several notable properties: (i) magnified source galaxies spanning redshifts z ~ 0.1 to z ~ 9, which therefore extend into the epoch of reionisation; (ii) the highest-redshift lens galaxies known, pushing galaxy density profile evolution studies beyond z ~ 2; (iii) all lenses are distributed within a contiguous 0.54 deg<sup>2</sup> region, allowing for joint strong and weak lensing analyses; and (iv) a subset exhibits lensed source emission ray-traced near the lens galaxy centers, enabling studies of supermassive black holes and dust absorption. A key innovation of our approach is the use of lens modelling to aid in identifying lenses that may otherwise be missed. This paper is accompanied by the first COWLS public release, providing JWST NIRCam imaging in four bands, lens models, pixelized source reconstructions and lens redshift estimates : https://github.com/Jammy2211/COWLS_COSMOS_Web_Lens_Survey

### 280) [2503.01272](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01272v2): Investigating dusty Red Supergiant outflows in Westerlund 1 with 3D Hydrodynamic simulations

<p> C. J. K. Larkin, J. Mackey, T. J. Haworth, A. A. C. Sander </p>
<p>
Recent JWST observations towards Westerlund 1 revealed extensive nebular emission associated with the cluster. Given the age of the region and proximity of that material to massive stars it cannot be primordial star forming gas and the origin is uncertain. We aim to determine whether the nebular emission in Westerlund 1 could be due to ablation flows from Red Supergiant (RSG) stars embedded in the cluster wind driven by the Wolf-Rayet stars in the cluster core. We also aim to explore the efficiency of mass-loading for the RSG wind in this scenario. We use 3D hydrodynamic simulations with the scpion code to study the interaction between the cluster and RSG winds. We compare with the JWST observations by generating synthetic dust-emission maps. We find that the ablation flow morphology is consistent with the observations towards Westerlund 1, with clumps and instabilities. Synthetic observations at 11 &mu;m predict fluxes in the ablation flow of ~1000-6000 MJy ster^-1 which is consistent with the unsaturated components of the JWST F1130W observations in the vicinity of the red supergiants in the region. This good agreement is achieved without any consideration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which have a known 11.3 &mu;m feature that appears in the F1130W band. This suggests that the ablation flow is PAH depleted. Ablation of RSG winds can explain the observed nebulosity in Westerlund 1, at least in the vicinity of the RSGs. Further observations are encouraged to enable detailed studies of these interactions.

### 281) [2503.00113](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00113v2): A Supermassive Black Hole in a Diminutive Ultra-compact Dwarf Galaxy Discovered with JWST/NIRSpec+IFU

<p>
The integral-field unit mode of the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec+IFU) mounted on the James Webb Space Telescope has now enabled kinematic studies of smaller and less massive compact stellar systems in which to search for central massive black holes (BHs) than ever before. We present here the first such detection using NIRSpec+IFU in its highest resolution (R~2700) mode. We report a 3&sigma; detection of a central black hole with mass  M_BH=2.2±1.1×10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> in UCD736 orbiting within the Virgo galaxy cluster based on Schwarzschild's modeling of the 1D kinematic profile. The presence of such a massive BH strongly argues against a globular cluster origin of this UCD, and rather suggests a tidally stripped formation route from a former ≳10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> dwarf galaxy host. Two other methods produce results consistent with Schwarzschild's modelling, but can only provide upper-limits on  M_BH. This represents the detection of a BH in the most compact (r_h≈15 pc) stellar system to date, with a  M_BH corresponding to ~9 percent of the system's stellar mass, roughly in line with previously reported UCD BH detections and comparable to the BH detected in the compact elliptical galaxy NGC4486B.

<p>
We present JWST NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy observations of the z=5.89 quasar NDWFS J1425+3254 from 0.6-5.3 microns, covering the rest-frame ultraviolet and optical at a spectral resolution of R~100. The quasar has a black hole mass of M_BH=(1.4\substack+3.1\\-1.0)×10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and an Eddington ratio of L_Bol/L_Edd=0.3\substack+0.6\\-0.2, as implied from the broad Balmer H&alpha; and H&beta; lines. The quasar host has significant ongoing obscured star formation, as well as a quasar-driven outflow with velocity 6050\substack+460\\-630 km/s and ionised outflow rate of 1650\substack+130\\-1230M<sub>&odot;</sub>yr^-1. This is possibly one of the most extreme outflows in the early Universe. The data also reveal that two companion galaxies are merging with the quasar host. The north-eastern companion galaxy is relatively old and very massive, with a luminosity-weighted stellar age of 65\substack+9\\-4 Myr, stellar mass of (3.6\substack+0.6\\-0.3)×10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, and star-formation rate (SFR) of ~15-30 M<sub>&odot;</sub>yr^-1. A bridge of gas connects this companion galaxy and the host, confirming their ongoing interaction. A second merger is occurring between the quasar host and a much younger companion galaxy to the south, with a stellar age of 6.7±1.8 Myr, stellar mass of (1.9±0.4)×10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, and SFR of ~40-65 M<sub>&odot;</sub>yr^-1. There is also another galaxy in the field, likely in the foreground at z=1.135, which could be gravitationally lensing the quasar with magnification 1&lt;&mu;&lt;2, and, thus, &lt;0.75 mag. Overall, the system is a 'train-wreck' merger of three galaxies, with star formation and extreme quasar activity that were likely triggered by these ongoing interactions.

### 283) [2502.20437](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20437v3): Introducing the THESAN-ZOOM project: radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of high-redshift galaxies with a multi-phase interstellar medium

<p>
We introduce the THESAN-ZOOM project, a comprehensive suite of high-resolution zoom-in simulations of 14 high-redshift (z&gt;3) galaxies selected from the THESAN simulation volume. This sample encompasses a diverse range of halo masses, with M_halo ≈ 10^8 - 10^13~M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z=3. At the highest-resolution, the simulations achieve a baryonic mass of 142~M<sub>&odot;</sub> and a gravitational softening length of 17~cpc. We employ a state-of-the-art multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) model that self-consistently includes stellar feedback, radiation fields, dust physics, and low-temperature cooling through a non-equilibrium thermochemical network. Our unique framework incorporates the impact of patchy reionization by adopting the large-scale radiation field topology from the parent THESAN simulation box rather than assuming a spatially uniform UV background. In total, THESAN-ZOOM comprises 60 simulations, including both fiducial runs and complementary variations designed to investigate the impact of numerical and physical parameters on galaxy properties. The fiducial simulation set reproduces a wealth of high-redshift observational data such as the stellar-to-halo-mass relation, the star-forming main sequence, the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, and the mass-metallicity relation. While our simulations slightly overestimate the abundance of low-mass and low-luminosity galaxies they agree well with observed stellar and UV luminosity functions at the higher mass end. Moreover, the star-formation rate density closely matches the observational estimates from z=3-14. These results indicate that the simulations effectively reproduce many of the essential characteristics of high-redshift galaxies, providing a realistic framework to interpret the exciting new observations from JWST.

### 284) [2502.08885](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08885v2): Morphological Demographics of Galaxies at z~ 10-16: Log-Normal Size Distribution and Exponential Profiles Consistent with the Disk Formation Scenario

<p> Yoshiaki Ono, Masami Ouchi, Yuichi Harikane, Hidenobu Yajima, Kimihiko Nakajima, Seiji Fujimoto, Minami Nakane, Yi Xu </p>
<p>
We homogeneously investigate the morphological properties of 169 galaxies at z~10-16 with deep JWST NIRCam images employing our established techniques of GALFIT modeling and uncertainty evaluation (systematics+statistics). We obtain effective radii r_e ranging 20-500 pc, with a distribution significantly broader than the scatter made by the uncertainties. We find that the r_e distribution is well described by a log-normal distribution with a mean of r_e=133^+13_-12 pc and a standard deviation of &sigma;_lnr_e = 0.52 ± 0.08. The standard deviation is comparable to that of local galaxies, indicating no significant evolution over z~ 0-10. We also find that the axis ratio distribution is nearly uniform, statistically similar to that of local spirals. We estimate the virial radius r_vir from the stellar masses via the star-formation main sequence and stellar-to-halo mass relation, obtaining a stellar-to-halo size ratio r_e/r_vir = 0.015^+0.015_-0.005, which is comparable to those of star-forming galaxies in the local and low-z Universe. Our results of 1) the log-normal r_e distribution, 2) the uniform axis ratio distribution, and 3) a mean radial profile consistent with an exponential profile (n=1.3±0.6) suggest that galaxies at z~10-16 generally follow the classical galaxy disk formation scenario with a specific disk angular momentum fraction of j_d / m_d ~ 0.5-1. Interestingly, we identify two remarkable outliers GN-z11 (z<sub>spec</sub>=10.60) and GHZ2 (z<sub>spec</sub>=12.34) with r_e=55^+5_-6 pc and 39±11 pc, respectively, that may not be explained by disk structures but by AGN or compact star-forming galaxies merging underway in short periods of time, as reproduced in numerical simulations.

### 285) [2502.04435](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04435v3): 1000-10,000 M<sub>&odot;</sub> Primordial Stars Created the Nitrogen Excess in GS 3073 at z = 5.55

<p> Devesh Nandal, Daniel J. Whalen, Muhammad A. Latif, Alexander Heger </p>
<p>
The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope has revealed a wealth of new galaxies just a few hundred Myr after the Big Bang. Some of these galaxies exhibit unusual N/O ratios that are difficult to explain with stellar populations today. While Wolf-Rayet stars in multiple-burst populations, very massive or rapidly-rotating primordial stars, general relativistic explosions of metal-enriched supermassive stars, or the precursors of globular clusters can in principle account for the nitrogen excess in the galaxies GN-z11 and CEERS 1019, no known stars or supernovae can explain the far higher N/O ratio of 0.46 in GS 3073 at redshift z = 5.55. Here we show that the extreme nitrogen abundances in GS 3073 can be produced by 1000 - 10,000 M<sub>&odot;</sub> primordial (Pop III) stars. We find that these are the only candidates that can account for its large N/O ratios and its C/O and Ne/O ratios. GS 3073 is thus the first conclusive evidence in the fossil abundance record of the existence of supermassive Pop III stars at cosmic Dawn.

### 286) [2502.03683](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03683v2): AGN ruled out as the dominant source of cosmic reionization

<p> Danyang Jiang, Linhua Jiang, Shengxiu Sun, Weiyang Liu, Shuqi Fu </p>
<p>
Cosmic reionization represents the latest phase transition in the Universe, when the Lyman continuum (LyC) photons turned the intergalactic medium (IGM) from neutral to highly ionized. It has long been debated whether galaxies or active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are the major source of LyC photons responsible for reionization. Previous observations slightly favored galaxies as the major ionizing source. However, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) recently discovered an unexpectedly high density of AGN candidates at high redshift, which has largely enhanced the influence of AGNs. Here we derive a definitive upper bound on the AGN contribution to reionization using the latest JWST data, and conclusively rule out AGNs as the dominant ionizing source during the peak epoch of reionization (EoR). We build a sample of galaxies and AGNs in a specific redshift range 7.15 ≤ z ≤ 7.75 with a high completeness. Each object is then decomposed into a point-source component and an extended component in their rest-frame far-UV JWST images. We assume all point-source components are AGNs. Our fiducial AGN sample reaches an unprecedentedly low luminosity of M_UV ≈ -15 mag. Based on this sample, AGNs can contribute at most one third of the LyC photons budget required at z~7.5. Our result implies that galaxies dominate the ionizing source during the EoR.

### 287) [2502.03328](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03328v3): Bounds on decaying sterile neutrinos via magnetic dipole moment from COB intensity

<p> Hriditi Howlader, Vivekanand Mohapatra, Alekha C. Nayak, Tripurari Srivastava </p>
<p>
A recent observation by Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) mounted on NASA's New Horizons yielded the most accurate measurement of the cosmic optical background (COB). The reported COB intensity is 11.16± 1.35 nW/m^2/sr at a pivot wavelength &lambda;_piv = 0.608   &mu;m observed in the range  0.4   &mu;m ≲ &lambda; ≲ 0.9   &mu;m . After subtracting the measured intensity from the deep Hubble Space Telescope count, diffused galactic light, and scattered light from bright star foregrounds, an anomalous intensity of 2.99 ± 2.03~nW/m^2/sr has been found. We considered radiatively decaying sterile neutrinos of keV mass scale, as dark matter candidate, that could contribute to this anomalous reported intensity. Using this, we derive upper bounds on the sterile-to-sterile transition magnetic moment. We find that sterile neutrinos with mass of O(keV) scale take values of the transition magnetic moment in the range 3× 10^-13 eV^-1 - 10^-9 eV^-1 to explain the anomalous intensity of 2.99± 2.03 nW/m^2/sr. % Future experiments such as, Cosmological Advanced Survey Telescope for Optical-UV Research (CASTOR), James Web Space Telescope (JWST), and Spectro-Photometer for the history of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) might help us derive a better bound on the sterile neutrinos.

### 288) [2502.01895](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01895v2): Turbulent gas-rich discs at high redshift: origin of thick stellar discs through 3D 'baryon sloshing'

<p> Joss Bland-Hawthorn, Thor Tepper-Garcia, Oscar Agertz, Christoph Federrath, Misha Haywood, Paola di Matteo, Timothy R Bedding, Takafumi Tsukui, Emily Wisnioski, Melissa Ness, Ken Freeman </p>
<p>
In response to recent observations from JWST and ALMA, we explore a new class of dynamically self-consistent models using our AGAMA/Ramses hydrodynamic N-body framework (Nexus) that mimics a plausible progenitor of the Milky Way over a wide range of disc gas fractions (f_gas = 0-100&percnt;). The high gas surface densities encourage vigorous star formation, which in turn couples with the gas to drive turbulence. We show that this coupling through momentum recoil drives 'baryon sloshing,' i.e. a random walk of the baryonic potential minimum with respect to the centre of the total gravitational potential, &Phi;_tot. The amplitude of the bulk motion depends on the strength of the feedback, which in turn is directly associated with f_gas. At its most extreme, when gas is the sole contributor to the disc potential (f_gas=100%), the amplitude of the walk can reach up to R≈ 5 kpc and  &vert;  z &vert;  ≈ 1 kpc within &Phi;_tot(R,&phi;,z). Consistent with observations, the disc dominates over dark matter (f_disc≳ 50%) within R_s=2.2 R_disc, where R_disc is the exponential disc scale length. For a lower f_disc and/or f_gas, the 3D sloshing amplitude and velocity are reduced. The combination of strong feedback (which unbinds the disc) and sloshing leads to the newly formed stars being dynamically heated and settling to a more spatially extended disc population. The 3D heating process is isotropic but its effects are more noticeable in  &vert;  z &vert;  due to the initial dynamical coldness of the star-forming disc. Such a disc has enhanced [&alpha;/Fe] stellar abundances and a vertical (but no radial) gradient in stellar age and metallicity, both consistent with the Milky Way's thick stellar disc. Contrary to earlier claims, star formation in a stationary turbulent disc does not produce thick stellar discs.

### 289) [2412.07598](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07598v2): Radiation-driven dusty outflows from early galaxies

<p> Yurina Nakazato, Andrea Ferrara </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered an overabundance of UV-bright (M_UV ≲ -20), massive galaxies at z ≳ 10 in comparison to pre-JWST theoretical predictions. Among the proposed interpretations, such excess has been explained by negligible dust attenuation conditions following radiation-driven outflows launched by young stars when a galaxy goes through a super-Eddington phase. Dust opacity decreases the classical Eddington luminosity by a (boost) factor A, thus favoring the driving of outflows by stellar radiation in compact, initially dusty galaxies. Here, we compute A as a function of the galaxy stellar mass, gas fraction, galaxy size, and metallicity (a total of 8 parameters). We find that the main dependence is on metallicity and, for the fiducial model, A ~ 1800(Z/Z<sub>&odot;</sub>)/(1+N_H/10^23.5  cm<sup>2</sup>). We apply such results to 20 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at z ≳ 10 and evaluate their modified Eddington ratio. We predict that three galaxies are in the outflow phase. Their outflows have relatively low velocities (60 -100  km s<sup>-1</sup>), implying that they are unlikely to escape from the system. For the remaining 17 galaxies that are not currently in the outflow phase, we calculate the past evolution of the modified Eddington ratio from their star formation history. We find that 15 of them experienced an outflow phase prior to observation during which they effectively displaced their dust to larger radii. Thus, dusty outflows driven by stellar radiation appear to contribute to the observed bright UV galaxies at z &gt; 10.

### 290) [2412.04834](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04834v4): A grand-design spiral galaxy 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang with JWST

<p> Rashi Jain, Yogesh Wadadekar </p>
<p>
We report the discovery of Alaknanda, a large (~10 kpc diameter), massive (log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)~10.2), candidate grand-design spiral galaxy with photometric redshift z<sub>phot</sub>~4.05 in the UNCOVER and Medium band, Mega Science surveys with JWST. This is among the highest redshift spiral galaxies discovered with JWST. Our morphological analysis using GALFIT reveals that this galaxy is a well-formed disk, with two symmetric spiral arms that are clearly visible in the GALFIT residual. In the rest-frame near-UV and far-UV, we clearly see the beads-on-a-string pattern of star formation; in the rest-frame visible bands, each string appears as an arm. Spectral energy distribution modeling using the BAGPIPES and Prospector codes is strongly constrained by detections and flux measurements in 21 JWST and HST filters. From the BAGPIPES modeling, the stellar mass-weighted age is ~ 199 Myr, implying 50&percnt; of the stars in the galaxy formed after z~4.6. This is a highly star-forming galaxy with a star formation rate (SFR) of ~ 63   M<sub>&odot;</sub>   yr^-1. We detect flux excesses in the F250M and F335M filters due to the presence of H-&alpha;+[NII] and [OIII]+H-&beta; emission line complexes respectively. Detection of a spiral galaxy at z ~ 4 indicates that massive and large spiral galaxies and disks were already in place merely 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang. Future observations with NIRSpec IFU and ALMA will be able to probe the kinematics of the galactic disk, throwing light on the possible origin of the spiral arms in this galaxy.

### 291) [2412.03455](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03455v2): A High Incidence of Central Star Formation Inferred from the Color Gradients of Galaxies at z&gt;4

<p> Bingcheng Jin, Luis C. Ho, Wen Sun </p>
<p>
We study the rest-frame ultraviolet-optical color gradients of 441 galaxies at 4&lt;z&lt;8 by characterizing the wavelength dependence of their structural parameters derived from simultaneously fitting the seven-band NIRCam images acquired with the James Webb Space Telescope. Distinct from trends observed at lower redshifts, where most galaxies exhibit negative color gradients whereby galaxy centers are redder than their outskirts, in high-redshift galaxies positive color gradients are just as common as or even outnumber negative color gradients. Varying stellar population, dust, and active galactic nuclei can contribute to the observed color gradient. We show that for the majority of our sample, the observed color gradients principally reflect radial variations in stellar population, without strong contribution from dust reddening or contamination from active galactic nuclei. The sign and magnitude of the color profile depend systematically on the global properties of the galaxy: positive color gradients, characteristic of centrally concentrated star formation or outside-in growth, are found preferentially in galaxies of lower stellar mass, smaller size, and bluer spectral energy distribution.

### 292) [2410.18471](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18471v3): A theoretical investigation of far-infrared fine structure lines at z&gt;6 and of the origin of the [OIII]88/[CII]158 enhancement

<p>
[Abridged] The [OIII]_88&mu; m/[CII]_158&mu; m and [OIII]_88&mu; m/[NII]_122&mu; m luminosity ratios have shown to be promising tracers of the ionisation state and gas-phase metallicity of the ISM. Observations of galaxies at redshift z &gt; 6 show peculiarly higher [OIII]_88&mu; m/[CII]_158&mu; m luminosity ratios compared to local sources. No model has so far successfully managed to match the observed emission from both [OIII]_88&mu; m and [CII]_158&mu; m as well as their ratio. We use Cloudy to model the [CII]_158&mu; m, [OIII]_88&mu; m, [NII]_122&mu; m and [NIII]_57&mu; m emission lines of Ponos: a high-resolution (m_gas = 883.4  M<sub>&odot;</sub>) cosmological zoom-in simulation of a galaxy at redshift z = 6.5, which is post-processed using kramses-rt. We modify Carbon, Nitrogen and Oxygen abundances in our Cloudy models to obtain C/O and N/O abundance ratios respectively lower and higher than Solar, more in line with recent high-z observational constraints. We find [OIII]_88&mu; m/[CII]_158&mu; m luminosity ratios that are a factor of ~ 5 higher compared to models assuming solar abundances. Additionally, we find an overall better agreement of the simulation with high-z observational constraints of the [CII]_158&mu; m-SFR and [OIII]_88&mu; m-SFR relations. This shows that a lower C/O abundance ratio is essential to reproduce the enhanced [OIII]_88&mu; m/[CII]_158&mu; m luminosity ratios observed at z &gt; 6. By assuming a super-solar N/O ratio, motivated by recent z &gt; 6 JWST observations, our models yield an [OIII]_88&mu; m/[NII]_122&mu; m ratio of 1.3, which, according to current theoretical models, would be more appropriate for a galaxy with a lower ionisation parameter than the one we estimated for Ponos.

### 293) [2410.13254](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13254v2): Lyman Continuum leakage from massive leaky starbursts: A different class of emitters?

<p>
The origin of Lyman Continuum (LyC) photons responsible for reionizing the universe remains a mystery, with the fraction of escaping LyC photons from galaxies at z~ 6 to 12 being highly uncertain. While direct detection of LyC photons from this epoch is hindered by absorption from the intergalactic medium, lower redshift analogs offer a promising avenue to study LyC leakage. We present Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (HST COS) observations of five low redshift (z~ 0.3) massive starburst galaxies, selected for their high stellar mass and weak [SII] nebular emission - an indirect tracer of LyC escape. Three of the five galaxies show LyC leakage, highlighting the reliability of weak [SII] as a tracer, especially in light of recent JWST discoveries of z &gt; 5 galaxies with similarly weak [SII] emission. The dust corrected LyC escape fractions, which represent the LyC photons that would escape in the absence of dust, range from 33% to 84%. However, the absolute escape fractions, which show the LyC photons escaping after passing through both neutral hydrogen absorption and dust attenuation, are significantly lower, ranging between 1% and 3%. This suggests that while the galaxies are nearly optically thin to HI, their high dust content significantly suppresses LyC photon escape. These [SII] weak, massive leakers are distinct from typical low-redshift LyC emitters, showing higher metallicity, lower ionization states, more dust extinction and higher star formation surface densities. This suggests that these galaxies constitute a distinct population, likely governed by a different mechanism facilitating LyC photon escape. We propose that the feedback-driven winds in these compact starbursts create ionized channels through which LyC photons escape, aligning with a picket-fence model.

### 294) [2410.11821](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11821v2): A First-look at Spatially-resolved Infrared Supernova Remnants in M33 with JWST

<p>
We present the first spatially-resolved infrared images of supernova remnants (SNRs) in M33 with the unprecedented sensitivity and resolution of JWST. We analyze 40 SNRs in four JWST fields: two covering central and southern M33 with separate NIRCam (F335M, F444W) and MIRI (F560W, F2100W) observations, one ~5 kpc-long radial strip observed with MIRI F770W, and one covering the giant HII region NGC 604 with multiple NIRCam and MIRI broad/narrowband filters. Of the 21 SNRs in the MIRI (F560W+F2100W) field, we found three clear detections (i.e., identical infrared and H&alpha; morphologies), and six partial-detections, implying a detection fraction of 43&percnt; in these bands. One of the SNRs in this field, L10-080, is a potential candidate for having freshly-formed ejecta dust, based on its size and centrally-concentrated 21 &mu;m emission. In contrast, only one SNR (out of 16) is detectable in the NIRCam F335M+F444W field. Two SNRs near NGC 604 have strong evidence of molecular (H<sub>2</sub>) emission at 4.7 &mu;m, making them the farthest known SNRs with visible molecular shocks. Five SNRs have F770W observations, with the smaller younger objects showing tentative signs of emission, while the older, larger ones have voids. Multi-wavelength data indicate that the clearly-detected SNRs are also among the smallest, brightest at other wavelengths (H&alpha;, radio and X-ray), have the broadest line widths (H&alpha; FWHM~250-350 km/s), and the densest environments. No correlation between the JWST-detectability and local star-formation history of the SNRs is apparent.

### 295) [2410.11620](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11620v2): Exploring the effect of different cosmologies on the Epoch of Reionization 21-cm signal with POLAR

<p>
A detection of the 21-cm signal power spectrum from the Epoch of Reionization is imminent, thanks to consistent advancements from telescopes such as LOFAR, MWA, and HERA, along with the development of SKA. In light of this progress, it is crucial to expand the parameter space of simulations used to infer astrophysical properties from this signal. In this work, we explore the role of cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant H_0 and the matter clustering amplitude &sigma;_8, whose values as provided by measurements at different redshifts are in tension. We run N-body simulations using GADGET-4, and post-process them with the reionization simulation code POLAR, that uses L-GALAXIES to include galaxy formation and evolution properties and GRIZZLY to execute 1-D radiative transfer of ionizing photons in the intergalactic medium (IGM). We compare our results with the latest JWST observations and explore which astrophysical properties for different cosmologies are necessary to match the observed UV luminosity functions at redshifts z = 10 and 9. Additionally, we explore the impact of these parameters on the observed 21-cm signal power spectrum, focusing on the redshifts within the range of LOFAR 21-cm signal observations (z ≈ 8.5-10). Despite differences in cosmological and astrophysical parameters, our models cannot be ruled out by the current upper limits. This suggests the need for broader physical parameter spaces for inference modeling to account for all models that agree with observations. However, we also propose stronger constraining power by using a combination of galactic and IGM observables.

### 296) [2409.15453](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15453v2): The impact of faint AGN discovered by JWST on reionization

<p> Shikhar Asthana, Martin G. Haehnelt, Girish Kulkarni, James S. Bolton, Prakash Gaikwad, Laura C. Keating, Ewald Puchwein </p>
<p>
The relative contribution of emission from stellar sources and accretion onto supermassive black holes to reionization has been brought into focus again by the apparent high abundance of faint Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) at 4≲ z≲11 uncovered by JWST. We investigate here the contribution of these faint AGN to hydrogen and the early stages of helium reionization using the GPU-based radiative transfer code ATON-HE by post-processing a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation from the sherwood-relics suite of simulations. We study four models: two galaxy-only late-end reionization models, a QSO-assisted and a QSO-only model. In the QSO-assisted model, 1% of the haloes host AGN, with AGN luminosities scaled to contribute 17% of the total hydrogen-ionizing emissivity. In the QSO-only model, quasars account for all the hydrogen-ionizing emissivity, with 10% of the haloes hosting AGN. The SED of AGN is assumed to be a power-law with &alpha;=-1.7 each with a 10 Myr lifetime. All models are calibrated to the observed mean Lyman-&alpha; forest transmission at 5≲ z≲6.2. The QSO-assisted model requires an emissivity similar to the galaxy-only models and fits the observed distribution of the Lyman-&alpha; optical depths well. The QSO-only model is inconsistent with the observed Lyman-&alpha; optical depths distribution, and produces excessively high IGM temperatures at z≲ 5 due to an early onset of HeII reionization, unless the escape fraction of HeII-ionizing photons is assumed to be low. Our results suggest that a modest AGN contribution to reionization aligns with the Lyman-&alpha; forest data, whereas an AGN dominated scenario is difficult to reconcile.

### 297) [2409.04625](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04625v2): First direct carbon abundance measured at z&gt;10 in the lensed galaxy MACS0647-JD

<p> Tiger Yu-Yang Hsiao, Michael W. Topping, Dan Coe, John Chisholm, Danielle A. Berg, Abdurro'uf, Javier Álvarez-Márquez, Roberto Maiolino, Pratika Dayal, Lukas J. Furtak </p>
<p>
Investigating the metal enrichment in the early universe helps us constrain theories about the first stars and study the ages of galaxies. The lensed galaxy MACS0647-JD at z=10.17 is the brightest galaxy known at z &gt; 10. Previous work analyzing JWST NIRSpec and MIRI data yielded a direct metallicity 12+log(O/H)=7.79±0.09 (~ 0.13 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) and electron density log(n_e / cm^-3) = 2.9 ± 0.5, the most distant such measurements to date. Here we estimate the direct C/O abundance for the first time at z &gt; 10, finding a sub-solar log(C/O)=-0.44^+0.06_-0.07. This is higher than other z&gt;6 galaxies with direct C/O measurements, likely due to higher metallicity. It is also slightly higher than galaxies in the local universe with similar metallicity. This may suggest a very efficient and rapid burst of star formation, a low effective oxygen abundance yield, or the presence of unusual stellar populations including supermassive stars. Alternatively, the strong CIII]&lambda; &lambda;1907,1909 emission (14± 3 &#8491; rest-frame EW) may originate from just one of the two component star clusters JDB (r ~ 20 pc). Future NIRSpec IFU spectroscopic observations of MACS0647-JD will be promising for disentangling C/O in the two components to constrain the chemistry of individual star clusters just 460 Myr after the Big Bang.

### 298) [2407.04777](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04777v2): Challenging the AGN scenario for JWST/NIRSpec LRD and non-LRD broad Hα emitters in light of non-detection of NIRCam photometric variability and X-ray

<p> Mitsuru Kokubo, Yuichi Harikane </p>
<p>
JWST has uncovered a substantial population of high-z (z ≳ 4) galaxies exhibiting broad H&alpha; emission line with a Full Width at Half Maximum exceeding 1,000 km/s. This population consists of a well-known subset called Little Red Dots (LRDs) and the remaining non-LRDs. If all of these broad H&alpha; emitters were attributed to type 1-1.9 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), it would imply a significantly higher number density of low-luminosity AGNs than extrapolated from that of more luminous AGNs. Here, we have examined the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV)-optical flux variability of three LRD and two non-LRD broad H&alpha; emitters using multi-epoch, multi-band JWST/NIRCam imaging data. The rest-frame temporal sampling interval of the NIRCam data (~ 400-500~days/(1+z)) is comparable to typical variability timescales of AGNs with black hole (BH) masses of M_BH ~ 10^7~M<sub>&odot;</sub>; thus, the flux variations should be detectable if AGNs were present. However, no measurable flux variation over the rest-frame wavelength range of &lambda;_rest ~ 1,500-9,000&#8491; has been detected, placing stringent upper limits on the variability amplitudes. This result, combined with the X-ray faintness confirmed by the ultra-deep Chandra data, indicates that, under the AGN scenario, we need to postulate peculiar Compton-thick broad-line AGNs with either (a) an intrinsically non-variable AGN disk continuum, (b) a host galaxy-dominated continuum, or (c) scattering-dominated AGN emission. Alternatively, (d) they could be non-AGNs where the broad-line emission originates from unusually fast and dense/low-metallicity star-formation-driven outflows or inelastic Raman scattering of stellar UV continua by neutral hydrogen atoms.

<p>
We present recent JWST NIRCam imaging observations of SPT0615-JD (also known as the Cosmic Gems Arc), lensed by the galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0615-5746. The 5 arcsec long arc is the most highly magnified z&gt;10 galaxy known. It straddles the lensing critical curve and reveals five star clusters with radii of ~ 1 pc or less. We measure the full arc to have F200W 24.5 AB mag, consisting of two mirror images, each 25.3 AB mag with a median magnification of &mu; ~ 60^+17_-8 (delensed 29.7 AB mag, M_UV = -17.8). The galaxy has an extremely strong Lyman break F115W-F200W &gt;3.2 mag (2&sigma; lower limit), is undetected in all bluer filters (&lt; 2&sigma;), and has a very blue continuum slope redward of the break (&beta; = -2.7 ± 0.1). This results in a photometric redshift z<sub>phot</sub> = 10.2 ± 0.2 (95% confidence) with no significant likelihood below z&lt;9.8. Based on spectral energy distribution fitting to the total photometry, we estimate an intrinsic stellar mass of M_* ~ 2.4 - 5.6 × 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, young mass-weighted age of ~ 21 - 79 Myr, low dust content (A_V &lt; 0.15), and a low metallicity of ≲ 1&percnt;~Z<sub>&odot;</sub>. We identify a fainter third counterimage candidate within 2.2 arcsec of the predicted position, lensed to AB mag 28.4 and magnified by &mu; ~ 2, suggesting the fold arc may only show ~ 60% of the galaxy. SPT0615-JD is a unique laboratory to study star clusters observed within a galaxy just 460 Myr after the Big Bang.

The inner hundred parsecs of the Milky Way hosts the nearest supermassive black hole, largest reservoir of dense gas, greatest stellar density, hundreds of massive main and post main sequence stars, and the highest volume density of supernovae in the Galaxy. As the nearest environment in which it is possible to simultaneously observe many of the extreme processes shaping the Universe, it is one of the most well-studied regions in astrophysics. Due to its proximity, we can study the center of our Galaxy on scales down to a few hundred AU, a hundred times better than in similar Local Group galaxies and thousands of times better than in the nearest active galaxies. The Galactic Center (GC) is therefore of outstanding astrophysical interest. However, in spite of intense observational work over the past decades, there are still fundamental things unknown about the GC. JWST has the unique capability to provide us with the necessary, game-changing data. In this White Paper, we advocate for a JWST NIRCam survey that aims at solving central questions, that we have identified as a community: i) the 3D structure and kinematics of gas and stars; ii) ancient star formation and its relation with the overall history of the Milky Way, as well as recent star formation and its implications for the overall energetics of our galaxy's nucleus; and iii) the (non-)universality of star formation and the stellar initial mass function. We advocate for a large-area, multi-epoch, multi-wavelength NIRCam survey of the inner 100 pc of the Galaxy in the form of a Treasury GO JWST Large Program that is open to the community. We describe how this survey will derive the physical and kinematic properties of ~10,000,000 stars, how this will solve the key unknowns and provide a valuable resource for the community with long-lasting legacy value.
