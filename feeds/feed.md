Milgromian Dynamics (MOND) has been particularly successful in predicting scaling relations for galactic systems, namely the baryonic Tully-Fisher for spirals, the Faber-Jackson for ellipticals and the Radial Acceleration Relation for late-type galaxies. Its essential tenet is the modification of the gravity law at low accelerations. Nevertheless, despite MOND's passed tests, the puzzle of the missing mass on galaxy clusters' scales still persists. One proposed scenario to complete this deficit and apply it further to cosmology is the so-called νHDM model. It is composed of a sterile neutrino and the MOND gravity. In this Ph.D. thesis, I have put forward this cosmological idea, conducting hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the νHDM structure formation. In the debut attempt, the νHDM model was proven capable of reproducing the ΛCDM cosmology, imitating the same expansion history (Ω_m ≈ 0.3 and H_0 ≈ 67.6 km/s/Mpc), reproducing the CMB phenomenology, while the cosmic web is nicely formed. In the next step, I have optimized the νHDM model using Bayesian statistics, re-branding it to opt-νHDM. I managed to optimally fit the angular power spectrum of the CMB calculated by itPlanck, except its fourth peak, but the opt-νHDM cosmological parameters changed significantly with respect to its precursor, resulting in a much heavier cosmos, with Ω_m ≈ 0.5 and H_0 ≈ 55.6 km/s/Mpc. Next, I explore the opt-νHDM expansion history, its structure formation and the resulting mass function. The appearance of the early-time structures, firstly in the νHDM model, as well as in the opt-νHDM model occurs quiet late, at z≈4 and at z≈ 5.5, respectively. Although the resolution has improved from previous studies, the νHDM variants cannot explain easily the high-redshift galaxies, observed by JWST.

### 2) [2511.14856](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14856v1): Photometric Constraints on Intermediate-mass Black Holes in the Galactic Centre

JWST/MIRI observations can place photometric limits on the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) near the Galactic Centre. The stellar complex IRS 13E, a co-moving conglomerate of young and massive stars, is a prime location to study because it has been speculated to be bound by an IMBH. Assuming a standard radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) and a minimum fractional variability of 10% of intrinsic luminosity, the wavelength of peak emission in the spectral energy distribution for an IMBH would lie in the mid-infrared (~ 5-25 μm), and variability would be detectable in MIRI time-series observations. Monitoring fails to detect such variable emission (other than from Sgr A*) in and around the IRS 13E complex, and upper limits on a putative IMBH's intrinsic variability on timescales of minutes to about 1 hour are ≲1 mJy at 12 μm and ≲2 mJy at 19 μm. These translate to luminosities ≲ 25 × 10^32 erg/s. The resulting limits on the IMBH mass and accretion rate rule out any IMBH with mass ≳ 10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> accreting at ≳ 10^-6 times Eddington rate at the location of IRS 13E. Further, the observations rule out an IMBH anywhere in the central 6" × 6" region that is more massive than ≈ 2 × 10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and accreting at ≳ 10^-6 of the Eddington rate. Assuming Bondi accretion scaled to typical RIAF-accretion efficiencies, albeit somewhat uncertain, also allows us to rule out IMBHs moving with typical velocities of about 200 km/s and masses ≳ 2 × 10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. These methods showcase the effectiveness of photometric variability measurements in constraining the presence of accreting black holes in Galactic centre-like environments.

### 3) [2511.14836](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14836v1): First Mid-infrared Detection and Modeling of a Flare from Sgr A*. II. Mid-IR Spectral Energy Distribution and Millimeter Polarimetry

Ford, Daryl Haggard, Sera Markoff, Alexander Philippov, Bart Ripperda, Sophia Sánchez-Maes, Zach Sumners, Gunther Witzel, Mayura Balakrishnan, Sunil Chandra, Kazuhiro Hada, Macarena Garcia Marin, Mark A.

<p>
S. D. von Fellenberg et al. (2025a, Paper I) reported the first mid-infrared detection of a flare from Sgr A*. The JWST/MIRI/MRS observations were consistent with an orbiting hotspot undergoing electron injection with a spectrum that subsequently breaks from synchrotron cooling. However, mid-infrared extinction measurements appropriate for these data were not yet determined, and therefore the temporal evolution of the absolute spectral index remained unknown. This work applies new Galactic Center extinction measurements to the flare observations. The evolution of the spectral index after the peak is fully consistent with that reported in Paper I with a maximum absolute mid-infrared spectral index α_MIR=0.45±0.01_stat±0.08_sys during the second mid-infrared flare peak, matching the known near-infrared spectral index during bright states (α_NIR≈0.5). There was a near-instantaneous change in the mid-infrared spectral index of Δα_MIR=0.33±0.06_stat±0.11_sys at the flare onset. We propose this as a quantitative definition for this infrared flare's beginning, physically interpreted as the underlying electron distribution's transition into a hard power-law distribution. This paper also reports the SMA millimeter polarization during the flare, which shows a small, distorted, but overall clockwise-oriented Stokes Q&ndash;U loop during the third mid-infrared peak. Extrapolating the mid-infrared flux power law to the millimeter yields a variable flux consistent with the observed 220 GHz emission. These results, together with the Paper I modeling, plausibly suggest a single hotspot produced both the mid-infrared and millimeter variability during this event. However, additional flares are required to make a general statement about the millimeter and mid-infrared connection.

<p>
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission is widely used to trace the distribution of molecular gas in the interstellar medium (ISM), exhibiting a tight correlation with CO(2-1) emission across nearby galaxies. Using PHANGS-JWST and PHANGS-ALMA data, we identify localized regions where this correlation fails, with CO flux exceeding that predicted from 7.7μm PAH emission by more than an order of magnitude. These outlier regions are found in 20 out of 70 galaxies and are mostly located in galaxy centers and bars, without signs of massive star formation. We explore two scenarios to explain the elevated CO-to-PAH ratios, which can either be due to suppressed PAH emission or enhanced CO emissivity. We examine PAH emission in other bands (3.3μm and 11.3μm) and the dust continuum dominated bands (10μm and 21μm), finding consistently high CO-to-PAH (or CO-to-dust continuum) emission ratios, suggesting that 7.7μm PAH emission is not particularly suppressed. In some outlier regions, PAH size distributions and spectral energy distribution of the illuminating radiation differ slightly compared to nearby control regions with normal CO-to-PAH ratios, though without a consistent trend. We find that the outlier regions generally show higher CO velocity dispersions (Δv_CO). This increase in Δv_CO may lower CO optical depth and raise its emissivity for a given gas mass. Our results favor a scenario where shear along the bar lanes and shocks at the tips of the bar elevate CO emissivity, leading to the breakdown of the CO-PAH correlation.

<p>
We present an analysis on the kinematics and physical properties of the ionized gas in the lensed galaxy RXCJ2248-ID at z=6.1 based on high-resolution JWST NIRSpec/IFU data in combination with ALMA observations. Our analysis reveals a high electron temperature (T_e~30000K) in the ionized gas, independent of the ionization level. We measure a wide range in the electron densities derived from [OIII]λ5008/[OIII]88μm and [ArIV]λ4713/[ArIV]λ4742 ratios (log(n_e[cm^-3])~2.7-3.8), and previous values (log(n_e[cm^-3])&gt;4.8) based on high-ionization rest-UV emission lines. The ionized gas appears to be clumpy with a low filling factor ranging from about 10% to 0.2% for the low- and high-density clouds. In addition, we observe a very complex ISM kinematic structure, with the presence of two distinct broad and a very-broad components (FWHM~210 and ~1000 kms<sup>-1</sup>) in addition to the systemic one (FWHM~60 kms<sup>-1</sup>) in [OIII]λ5008 and Hα. These broad components are heavily extinct (A_V~1.5 and 2.5, respectively), based on their Balmer decrements, while the gas associated to the narrow component is consistent with no extinction. The maximal velocities of these outflows (~115-500kms<sup>-1</sup>) are such that a fraction of the total outflowing gas (0.16-2.1×10^7M<sub>&odot;</sub>) could escape into the IGM. The rest of the gas will fall back to the central regions, being available for additional star formation episodes. The presence of dusty outflows and clumpy (i.e., low filling factor) ISM give support to the Attenuation-Free scenario proposed to explain the high-z UV-bright compact galaxies such as RXCJ2248-ID. On the other hand, the high densities in the ISM, together with the high SFR surface brightness, and the amount of returning outflowing mass give support to the Feedback-Free Starburst scenario.

We present the discovery of a strongly lensed galaxy at z~11-12, dubbed the "Misty Moons'', identified in the JWST Treasury Survey, Vast Exploration for Nascent, Unexplored Sources (VENUS). The Misty Moons is gravitationally lensed by the galaxy cluster MACS J0257.1-2325 at z=0.505, and has five multiple images suggested by two independent lensing models. Two of the five images, ID1 and ID2 (μ~ 20-30), are very bright (F200W~26 AB mag) and exhibit blue SEDs with prominent Lyα breaks. In the source plane, the Misty Moons is a sub-L^* galaxy (M_UV~-18.0 mag) resolved into multiple stellar clumps, each of which has effective radius of r_eff~ 10-70 pc and stellar mass of ~10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. These clumps dominate the stellar mass budget of the Misty Moons (≳80&percnt;), similar to other high-z clumps, which suggests a highly clustered mode of star formation in the early Universe, unlike seen in local dwarf galaxies. We convolve the source-plane image with the JWST/NIRCam point-spread function to produce a mock NIRCam image of the Misty Moons without lensing magnification, and find that the intrinsic galaxy has a radial surface-brightness profile comparable to those of z≳10 faint galaxies, such as JADES-GS-z13-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1, indicating that the Misty Moons represents a typical z≳10 faint galaxy. The Misty Moons, a lensed galaxy with resolved internal structures, provides an ideal laboratory for exploring the early stages of galaxy formation at z≳10.

### 7) [2511.14418](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14418v1): MINDS: The molecule-rich disc of the Herbig star HD 35929 revealed with JWST/MIRI

<p>
Our knowledge of the chemical composition of the gas in the inner disc of intermediate-mass young stars is limited, due to the lack of suitable instrumentation. The launch of JWST has provided a significant improvement in our ability to probe gas in these inner discs. We analyse the gas composition and emitting conditions of the disc around HD 35929, a young intermediate-mass Herbig star, using MIRI/MRS data. Our goal is to constrain the chemistry and kinematics of the gas phase molecules detected in the inner disc. We use iSLAT to examine the observed molecular lines and DuCKLiNG to detect, fit, and analyse the molecular emission. We find gas phase H2O, CO, CO2, and OH in the disc, as well as HI recombination lines. Surprisingly, we also detect gas phase SiO in the fundamental v=1-0 vibrational band. We derive column densities and temperature ranges of the detected species, arising from the inner ~0.2 au, hinting towards a compact and very warm disc. The molecular column densities are much higher than found in lower mass T Tauri discs. In general, the molecular composition is consistent with an O-rich gas from which silicate-rich solids condense and the strong gas phase molecular line emission suggests a low dust opacity. The unexpected detection of gas phase SiO at the source velocity points to an incomplete condensation of rock forming elements in the disc, suggesting chemical disequilibrium and/or an underestimate of the gas kinetic temperature.

### 8) [2511.13849](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13849v1): How accurately can obscured galaxy luminosities be measured using spectral energy distribution fitting of near- through far-infrared observations?

<p>
Infrared-luminous galaxies are important sites of stellar and black hole mass assembly at most redshifts. Their luminosities are often estimated by fitting spectral energy distribution (SED) models to near- to far-infrared data, but the dependence of these estimates on the data used is not well-understood. Here, using observations simulated from a well-studied local sample, we compare the effects of wavelength coverage, signal-to-noise (S/N), flux calibration, angular resolution, and redshift on the recovery of starburst, AGN, and host luminosities. We show that the most important factors are wavelength coverage that spans the peak in a SED, with dense wavelength sampling. Such observations recover starburst and AGN infrared luminosities with systematic bias below 20&percnt;. Starburst luminosities are best recovered with far-infrared observations while AGN luminosities are best recovered with near- and mid-infrared observations, though the recovery of both are enhanced with near/mid-infrared, and far-infrared observations, respectively. Host luminosities are best recovered with near/far-infrared observations, but are usually biased low, by ≳20&percnt;. The recovery of starburst and AGN luminosity is enhanced by observing at high angular resolution. Starburst-dominated systems show more biased recovery of luminosities than do AGN-dominated systems. As redshift increases, far-infrared observations become more capable, and mid-infrared observations less capable, at recovering luminosities. Our results highlight the transformative power of a far-infrared instrument with dense wavelength coverage from tens to hundreds of microns for studying infrared-luminous galaxies. We tabulate estimates of systematic bias and random error for use with JWST and other observatories.

### 9) [2511.13823](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13823v1): Robust galaxy image decompositions with Differential Evolution optimisation and the problem of classical bulges in and beyond the nearby Universe

<p> Dimitri A. Gadotti </p>
<p>
Deconstructing galaxies through two-dimensional decompositions has been shown to be a powerful technique to derive the physical properties of stellar structures in galaxies. However, most studies employ fitting algorithms that are prone to be trapped in local minima, or involve subjective choices. Furthermore, when applied on samples beyond the nearby Universe, results on the fraction of classical bulges in disc galaxies do not agree with studies on nearby galaxies. The latter studies point to a small fraction of classical bulges, possibly challenging our merger-driven picture of galaxy formation. Therefore, understanding the discrepancy between observations in and beyond the nearby Universe is of paramount importance. In this paper, I use a sample of 16 nearby galaxies drawn from the TIMER project, which previously have been shown to not host classical bulges, and perform decompositions applying different methodologies and employing the original images as well as artificially redshifted images. I show that the Differential Evolution algorithm is able to provide accurate measurements of structural properties with little subjective intervention, correctly indicating the presence of nuclear discs (not classical bulges). However, I also show that when the physical spatial resolution is not adequate, a systematic overestimation of the photometric bulge Sérsic index leads to the false conclusion of the presence of classical bulges. I discuss how this may be the root cause of the discrepancy mentioned above, and point out how this issue may be a problem even with data from facilities such as Euclid, HST and JWST.

### 10) [2511.13708](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13708v1): The Scatter of the Many Outweighs the Scatter of the Few: Systematic Error Asymmetry in Steeply-Falling Mass Functions for High-Redshift JWST Galaxies

<p> Jay R. Krishnan, Kevork N. Abazajian </p>
<p>
The discovery of massive, high redshift galaxies with JWST has been argued to challenge ΛCDM: such systems would require extremely rare halos and baryon-to-stellar-mass conversion efficiencies unphysically approaching&ndash;or exceeding&ndash;100%. If confirmed at galaxy formation forbidden efficiencies, these galaxies could signal new physics beyond standard cosmological structure formation. We develop a galaxy model framework that ties the linear power spectrum to the inferred efficiencies of galaxy growth in order to test the structure formation models. In addition, we incorporate multiple sources of error, including (i) observational sample variance, (ii) asymmetric scatter induced by the steepness of the high-mass halo tail, and (iii) systematic uncertainties in stellar mass estimates. We find that the inferred efficiency of star formation is dominated by systematic uncertainties on the spectral energy distribution inferred stellar mass of the JWST detected galaxies. The systematic uncertainty augments the asymmetry in scatter that largely brings the inferred efficiencies to be in line with that expected from early galaxy formation models. Our framework can be used to test ΛCDM as errors are reduced and further detections are made.

### 11) [2511.13651](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13651v1): High-resolution radio imaging of TGSSJ1530+1049, a radio galaxy in a dense environment at z=4

<p>
High-redshift radio galaxies can provide insights into the structure formation and galaxy evolution at earlier cosmological epochs. TGSSJ1530+1049 was selected as a candidate high-redshift radio galaxy. Subsequent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) presented in a companion paper (Saxena et al., submitted) have shown that it is located at a redshift z=4.0. The JWST data furthermore showed that the radio source is part of one of the densest structures of galaxies and ionized gas known at these redshifts. The complex system qualitatively resembles a massive (cluster) galaxy forming early through a rapid succession of mergers. TGSSJ1530+1049 is an unresolved source down to ~0.6" scale in multiple radio surveys. To reveal its high-resolution radio structure and allow for a detailed comparison with JWST observations, we studied its morphology at various angular scales with different radio interferometric instruments. We observed TGSSJ1530+1049 at milliarcsecond (mas) scale angular resolution with the European VLBI Network (EVN), and at ~100-mas scale resolution with the enhanced Multi-Element Remotely Linked Interferometer Network (e-MERLIN). We recovered a complex north&ndash;south oriented structure with steep-spectrum radio-emitting features, which are associated with lobes and hot spots of a jetted active galactic nucleus. The centre of the radio galaxy proved to be too faint at cm wavelengths to be unambiguously detected in our observations. Nevertheless, the linear size (~5.5 kpc) and the radio power place it among the so-called medium-sized symmetric objects, a smaller and/or confined version of larger radio galaxies. Comparison between the radio morphology and that of the ionized gas observed by JWST shows that the two are closely aligned. However, the optical emission line gas extends out to ~25 kpc, which is well beyond the detected radio structures. (Abridged)

We present JWST observations of the radio galaxy TGSSJ1530+1049, spectroscopically confirmed at z=4.0. NIRCam images and NIRSpec/IFU spectroscopy (R=2700) show that TGSSJ1530+1049 is part of one of the densest-known structures of continuum and line-emitting objects found at these redshifts. NIRCam images show a number of distinct continuum objects and evidence of interactions traced by diffuse emission, and the NIRSpec IFU cube reveals further strong line emitting regions. We identify six continuum and four additional strong Halpha emitting sources with weaker or no underlying continuum within the 3''x3'' IFU field. From spatial alignment with high-resolution radio data and emission line profiles, the radio AGN host galaxy is clearly identified. The bright Halpha emission (but not the optical components) is distributed remarkably linearly along the radio axis, suggestive of a biconical illumination zone by a central obscured AGN. The emission line kinematics indicate jet-gas interactions on scales of a few kpc. However, due to large relative velocities and presence of underlying continuum, the alignment with the radio structure appears to be, at least partly, caused by a particular configuration of interacting galaxies. At least four objects within a 10x10 (projected) kpc<sup>2</sup> area which includes the radio source have high stellar masses (log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&gt;10.3) and star formation rates in the range 70-163 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1. Using a stellar mass-based analysis, we predict a total dark matter halo mass of ≈10^13 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Based on the physical separations and velocity differences between the galaxies, it is expected that these galaxies will merge to form a massive galaxy within a few Gyr. The system qualitatively resembles the forming brightest cluster galaxies in cosmological simulations that form early through a rapid succession of mergers.

We present the discovery of extreme nitrogen enrichment by Wolf Rayet nitrogen stars (WN) in the metal-poor (~10&percnt;Z<sub>&odot;</sub>), lensed, compact (R_eff~20 pc) galaxy RXCJ2248 at z=6.1, revealed by unprecedentedly deep JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution spectroscopy from the GLIMPSE-D Survey. The exquisite S/N reveals multiple high-ionization nebular lines and broad Balmer and [OIII] components (FWHM~700-3000 km s<sup>-1</sup>). We detect broadened HeII λ1640 and λ4687 (FWHM~530 km s<sup>-1</sup>) and strong NIII] λ4642 emission consistent with a population of WN stars, making RXCJ2248 the most distant galaxy with confirmed WR features to date. We measure the multi-phase nebular density across five ions, the direct-method metallicity (12+log(O/H)= 7.749±0.023), and a non-uniform elemental enrichment pattern of extreme N/O enhancement (log(N/O)=-0.390±0.035 from N^+, N^+2, and N^+3) and suppressed C/O relative to empirical C/N trends. We show that this abundance pattern can be explained by enrichment from a dual-burst with a low WC/WN ratio, as expected at low metallicities. Crucially, these signatures can only arise during a brief, rare evolutionary window shortly after a burst (~3-6 Myr), when WN stars dominate chemical feedback but before dilution by later yields (e.g., supernovae). The observed frequency of strong N emitters at high-z implies a ~50 Myr burst duty cycle, suggesting that N/O outliers may represent a brief but ubiquitous phase in the evolution of highly star-forming early galaxies. The detection in RXCJ2248, therefore, provides the first direct evidence of WN-driven chemical enrichment in the early Universe and a novel timing argument for the bursty star formation cycles that shaped galaxies at cosmic dawn.

### 14) [2511.13395](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13395v1): The PAH 3.4 micron feature as a tracer of shielding in the Orion Bar and NGC 6240

<p>
We have carried out a detailed analysis of the 3.4 micron spectral feature arising from Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH), using JWST archival data. For the first time in an external galaxy (NGC 6240), we have identified two distinct spectral components of the PAH 3.4 micron feature: a shorter wavelength component at 3.395 micron, which we attribute to short aliphatic chains tightly attached to the aromatic rings of the PAH molecules; and a longer wavelength feature at 3.405 microns that arises from longer, more fragile, aliphatic chains that are weakly attached to the parent PAH molecule. These longer chains are more easily destroyed by far-ultraviolet photons (&gt;5eV) and PAH thermal emission only occurs where PAH molecules are shielded from more energetic photons by dense molecular gas. We see a very strong correlation in the morphology of the PAH 3.395 micron feature with the PAH 3.3 micron emission, the latter arising from robust aromatic PAH molecules. We also see an equally strong correlation between the PAH 3.405 micron morphology and the warm molecular gas, as traced by H2 vibrational lines. We show that the flux ratio PAH_3.395/PAH_3.405 &lt; 0.3 corresponds strongly to regions where the PAH molecules are shielded by dense molecular gas, so that only modestly energetic UV photons penetrate to excite the PAHs. Our work shows that PAH 3.405 micron and PAH 3.395 micron emission features can provide robust diagnostics of the physical conditions of the interstellar medium in external galaxies, and can be used to quantify the energies of the photon field penetrating molecular clouds.

### 15) [2511.13024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13024v1): AGN feedback in merging galaxies with a SMUGGLE multiphase ISM

<p>
We study fast nuclear winds driven by Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) feedback in merging galaxies using high-resolution hydrodynamics simulations. We use Stars and MUltiphase Gas in GaLaxiEs (SMUGGLE) to explicitly model the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) and employ sub-grid dynamical friction for massive black holes (BHs). Furthermore, we use a super-Lagrangian refinement scheme to resolve AGN feedback coupling to the ISM at ~10-100 pc scales. By comparison between merging and isolated galaxies, with and without AGN feedback, we identify trends in the complex interplay between dynamics, BH fueling and feedback, and star formation and feedback. We consider three galaxy types: Milky Way analogs, Sbc-type galaxies, and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) analogs. The synergy between AGN feedback and merger dynamics is strongest in the Milky Way-like mergers, where the AGN winds are energetically dominant and entrain more gas when the initially thin disks become thick and amorphous during the merger. In contrast, the merger of thicker, vigorously star-forming Sbc galaxies is not strongly impacted by AGN feedback until star formation declines in the post-merger phase. Finally, while the sub-grid dynamical friction prescription effectively retains BHs in galactic nuclei during more massive mergers, the clumpy multiphase ISM induces significant wandering of low-mass BHs (&lt;10^5M<sub>&odot;</sub>) in the shallow potentials of the SMC-like galaxies. These low-mass BHs wander at distances ≳ 2 kpc from the galactic center, yielding negligible BH accretion and feedback. This has implications for LISA event rates and present a further challenge to understanding the rapid growth of z~7-10 quasars discovered by JWST.

<p>
The joint capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and JWST allow for an unparalleled look at the early lives of star clusters at near- and mid-infrared wavelengths. We present here a multiband analysis of embedded young stellar clusters in 11 nearby, star-forming galaxies, using the PHANGS-JWST and PHANGS-HST datasets. We use the Zooniverse citizen science platform to conduct an initial by-eye search for embedded clusters in near-UV/optical/near-infrared images that trace stellar continuum emission, the Paschenα and Hα recombination lines, and the 3.3 μm polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon feature and its underlying continuum. With this approach, we identify 292 embedded cluster candidates for which we characterize their ages, masses, and levels of line-of-sight extinction by comparing the photometric data to predictions from stellar population models. The embedded cluster candidates have a median age of 4.5 Myr and an average line-of-sight extinction ≤ft&lt; A_V &gt; = 6.0 mag. We determine lower limits on source stellar masses, resulting in a median stellar mass of 10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. We use this sample of embedded cluster candidates to train multiple convolutional neural network models to carry out deep transfer learning-based searches for embedded clusters. With the aim of optimizing models for future catalog production, we compare results for four variations of training data using two neural networks. Confusion matrices for all eight model configurations, as well as inter-model identification trends, are presented. With refinement of the training sample, we determine that optimized models could serve as a pathway for future embedded cluster identification beyond our 11 galaxy sample.

<p>
We examine the spatial distribution of star clusters in NGC 628 using the statistical tool INDICATE to quantify clustering tendencies. Our sample, based on HST and JWST observations, is the most complete to date, spanning ages from 1 Myr to &gt;100 Myr. We find cluster spatial behaviour varies with galactic position, age, and mass. Most emerging young clusters are tightly spatially associated with each other, while fully emerged clusters are in ~1.5 times looser spatial associations, irrespective of age. Young Massive Clusters (YMCs ≥ 10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) tend to associate with lower-mass clusters but not strongly with other YMCs, implying that intense star formation regions produce a few YMCs alongside many lower-mass clusters rather than multiple YMCs together. Young concentrated clusters show a wide radial distribution in the galactic disk, which narrows with age; with concentrated clusters &gt;100 Myr mostly residing between 2-6 kpc. This pattern may reflect either faster dispersal of isolated tight cluster spatial "structure" in a lower gas density outer disk or gradual inside-out growth, with the formation of this structure shifting outward over time. We also detect distinct spatial behaviours for clusters within 2 kpc, linked to the inner Lindblad resonance (≤1 kpc), nuclear ring (~0.5-1 kpc), and the start of spiral arms (~1.25-2 kpc), suggesting these regions exhibit strong radial motions that could hinder clusters from forming and remaining in tight concentrations. Our results highlight how spatially-resolved studies of clusters can reveal the influence of galactic dynamics on star formation and cluster evolution.

<p>
Measuring the ionizing photon production efficiency ξ<sub>ion</sub>,0 &ndash; the ratio of ionizing photon output rate Q_H^0 to UV continuum luminosity L_UV &ndash; in galaxies at z &gt; 6 is crucial for constraining their contribution to cosmic reionization. We present integrated and spatially resolved measurements of ξ<sub>ion</sub>,0 for 12 exceptionally bright (M_UV ~ -22 mag) star-forming galaxies at z ~ 7 from the REBELS survey. These measurements are based on JWST NIRSpec/IFU PRISM spectroscopy, probing the rest-frame UV and optical regime. Notably, in 8 of the 12 galaxies, the spectral coverage includes Hα, enabling self-consistent dust attenuation estimates in both the ionized gas and stellar continuum via the Balmer decrement and rest-UV slope, respectively. We find global logξ<sub>ion</sub>,0 values ranging from 25.19±0.11 to 25.61±0.11, with a weighted mean of 25.44±0.15, consistent with the canonical value of ~25.3. Using a sample of 25 star-forming clumps within these galaxies, we explore local variations in LyC production efficiency, finding a broader range, from 24.52±0.21 to 26.18±0.61. We identify strong correlations between ξ<sub>ion</sub>,0 and specific star formation rate, star formation surface density, Hβ equivalent width, and stellar mass. Clumps with the highest ξ<sub>ion</sub>,0 exhibit EW_0(Hβ) ≥ 150 Angstrom, consistent with young stellar ages. From previous Lyα measurements in three galaxies, we estimate a typical Lyα escape fraction of f<sub>esc</sub>, Lyα ~ 2&percnt;, suggesting similar or lower escape fractions for LyC photons. Combining this with our Hα measurements, we infer ionized bubble sizes ~ 1 pMpc, aligned with expectations from Lyα-detected systems and reionization models.

Reliable star formation rate (SFR) measurements are essential for understanding early galaxy evolution, yet derived values rely on several assumptions. To address this problem, we investigate the SFRs of 12 massive (9≲~log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≲~10) Lyman-break galaxies at z=6.5-7.7, drawn from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Reionization Era Bright Emission Line Survey (REBELS) program. The multi-wavelength data, including JWST NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy and ALMA observations, make this a unique sample for investigating SFR tracers at this epoch. We compare SFRs derived from the rest-UV, Hα, and far-infrared emission, and from spectral energy distribution (SED) fits. We apply robust dust attenuation corrections, which are crucial since between 50-80 per cent of the star formation is obscured, and find a stellar-to-nebular attenuation ratio of f=0.50±0.08, consistent with local star-forming galaxies. The majority of the derived total SFRs (medians 25-120 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1) place the REBELS galaxies systematically above z=7 literature star-forming main-sequence relations, and our best-fit star formation histories (SFHs) rise more steeply than lower-mass galaxies at the same redshift. We show that these rising SFHs mean commonly used luminosity-to-SFR conversion factors, derived assuming a constant SFH over given timescales, overestimate the SFRs averaged over these timescales for our galaxies. We provide updated luminosity-to-SFR calibrations for z≃7 galaxies with rising SFHs, showing that commonly assumed rest-UV conversion factors overestimate the 100 Myr average SFR by a factor of ≃3. Finally, we investigate burstiness indicators in the REBELS-IFU galaxies, finding that the rising SFHs imply that the Hα-to-UV luminosity ratio is an unreliable probe of bursty star formation.

We present a reconstruction of the large-scale structure using the James Webb Space Telescope's (JWST) COSMOS-Web program to trace environmentally driven galaxy evolution up to z~7. We applied a weighted kernel density estimation method to 160,000 galaxies with robust photometric redshifts. We find that stellar mass has a positive correlation with density at all redshifts, stronger for quiescent galaxies (QGs) at z≲2.5, while at higher redshifts (2.5≲ z≲5.5) this trend is confined to extreme overdense environments, consistent with early mass assembly in proto-clusters. The star-formation rate (SFR) shows a negative trend with density for QGs at z≲1.2, reversing at z≳1.8, while star-forming galaxies (SFGs) show a mild positive correlation up to z~5.5. The specific SFR remains nearly flat for SFGs and declines with density for QGs at z≲1.2. Moreover, mass and environmental quenching efficiencies show that mass-driven processes dominate at z≳2.5, the two processes act with comparable strength between 0.8≲ z≲2.5, and environmental quenching becomes stronger for low-mass galaxies (M<sub>&sext;</sub>≲10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) at z≲0.8. These findings reveal that large-scale structure drives galaxy evolution by enhancing early mass assembly in dense regions and increasingly suppressing star formation in low-mass systems at later times, establishing the environmental role of the cosmic web across cosmic history. COSMOS-Web, the largest JWST survey, provides accurate and deep photometric redshifts, reaching 80% mass completeness at log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)~8.7 at z~7, enabling the first view of how environments shaped galaxy evolution from the epoch of reionization to the present day.

<p>
The enigmatic Little Red Dots (LRDs) discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) exhibit properties challenging their interpretation as common galaxies or Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Understanding their nature is key to placing them within our picture of early galaxy and massive black hole (MBH) evolution. To this aim, we build a realistic comparison between LRD observations with photometric properties of galaxies and AGN simulated by the L-GalaxiesBH model in a NIRCam mock sky. We model stellar continua and emission lines, the MBH emission from accretion disk, infrared radiation from dusty torus, and lines from narrow and broad line regions, accounting for dust attenuation and obscuration. Using realistic photometric cuts, we select a population of LRDs including both AGN and galaxies. The LRD fraction peaks at 40% (~10^-4Mpc^-3) at z~4. Our LRDs are central galaxies spanning M_*=10^8-10^10.5M<sub>&odot;</sub>. A population of galaxies with M_*&lt;10^9M<sub>&odot;</sub> appear as LRDs due to older stellar populations. At higher masses, LRDs dominate the halo and stellar mass functions (M_vir &gt; 10^11.5M<sub>&odot;</sub>, M_* &gt; 10^9.5M<sub>&odot;</sub>), and the interplay between AGN and galaxy emission drives the LRD selection. AGN dominate rest-frame UV-optical emission, while dust obscuration is secondary. LRDs host lighter MBHs (~ 10^6.5M<sub>&odot;</sub>) than non-LRDs (~ 10^7.5M<sub>&odot;</sub>), with fainter emission unable to balance their hosts Balmer breaks. We find no evidence for dominant heavy-seed origin of MBHs. LRD Galaxies (97% hosting MBHs) and LRD AGNs are disk-dominated, with LRD AGNs showing larger bulges formed mainly via disk instabilities.

<p>
We introduce Synference, a new, flexible Python framework for galaxy SED fitting using simulation-based inference (SBI). Synference leverages the Synthesizer package for flexible forward-modelling of galaxy SEDs and integrates the LtU-ILI package to ensure best practices in model training and validation. In this work we demonstrate Synference by training a neural posterior estimator on 10^6 simulated galaxies, based on a flexible 8-parameter physical model, to infer galaxy properties from 14-band HST and JWST photometry. We validate this model, demonstrating excellent parameter recovery (e.g. R^2&gt;0.99 for M<sub>&sext;</sub>) and accurate posterior calibration against nested sampling results. We apply our trained model to 3,088 spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies in the JADES GOODS-South field. The amortized inference is exceptionally fast, having nearly fixed cost per posterior evaluation and processing the entire sample in ~3 minutes on a single CPU (18 galaxies/CPU/sec), a ~1700× speedup over traditional nested sampling or MCMC techniques. We demonstrate Synference's ability to simultaneously infer photometric redshifts and physical parameters, and highlight its utility for rapid Bayesian model comparison by demonstrating systematic stellar mass differences between two commonly used stellar population synthesis models. Synference is a powerful, scalable tool poised to maximise the scientific return of next-generation galaxy surveys.

<p> Gijs Vermariën, Tommaso Grassi, Marie Van de Sande, Serena Viti, Stefano Bovino, Alessandro Lupi, Alexander Ruf, Lorenzo Branca, Catherine Walsh </p>
<p>
Since the first observations of interstellar molecules, astrochemical simulations have been employed to model and understand its formation and destruction path- ways. With the advent of high-resolution telescopes such as JWST and ALMA, the number of detected molecules has increased significantly, thereby creating a need for increasingly complex chemical reaction networks. To model such complex systems, we have developed Carbox, a new astrochemical simulation code that leverages the modern high-performance transformation framework Jax. With Jax enabling computational efficiency and differentiability, Carbox can easily utilize GPU acceleration, be used to study sensitivity and uncertainty, and interface with advances in Scientific Machine Learning. All of these features are crucial for modeling the molecules observed by current and next-generation telescopes.

### 24) [2511.10486](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10486v1): Revealing the Connection Between the Filamentary Hierarchy and Star Cluster Formation in a Simulated NGC 628 Galaxy

<p> Tamara Koletic, Rachel Pillsworth, Ralph E. Pudritz </p>
<p>
There is abundant observational evidence for the hierarchical, interconnected nature of filaments in the interstellar medium (ISM) extending from galactic down to sub-parsec scales. New JWST images of NGC 628 in particular, show clusters forming along the two spiral arms of this galaxy. In this paper we investigate filament and cluster properties in an NGC 628-like multi-scale high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulation. We use a filament finding tool to identify filaments and derive the probability density functions (PDFs) for the filament lengths and masses. Using a clustering algorithm we identify star clusters formed between 268 to 278 Myr and follow this population as the galaxy evolves for 60 Myr, calculating their mass PDFs, average radius growth rate, and average mass loss rate. We find a power-law index of alpha_m = -1.35 for the filament masses. Calculating the power-law index from our cluster mass PDF, we find a value of alpha_c,m = -1.35 when the clusters first form, exactly our filament mass power-law index. This shows that properties of young clusters arise from the gravitational fragmentation of their host filaments. We track the post-formation evolution of the clusters as they become unbound, increase in radius and decrease in mass yielding an ever steeper mass power-law index. After 60 Myr, the mass power-law index is alpha_c,m = -1.55, matching other simulations and observations.

<p>
The nearby dwarf starburst NGC 5253 is dominated by a compact radio-infrared supernebula powered by a very young and bright embedded Super Star Cluster (SSC) of ~ 10^9 L<sub>&odot;</sub>. We observed this source and its surroundings over the 5-25μm range with MIRI/MRS on JWST and in Paper I presented the JWST view of the region and its continuum features. We now present the more than 70 emission lines of HI, H<sub>2</sub> and metal ions detected by MIRI/MRS. We derive the extinction by comparing HI recombination to the free-free radio continuum and find that it is very flat, i.e., almost independent of wavelength, over this spectral range. Nebular conditions are consistent with young (≲5×10^6 years) and very massive stars. All regions show high excitation, but the spatial distribution of the high excitation lines suggests that photons with energies close to 50eV are escaping the supernebula core in spite of 35 magnitudes of visual extinction.

### 26) [2511.09910](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09910v1): JWST View of the Supernebula in NGC 5253. I. Overview and Continuum Features

<p> Jean L. Turner, Sara C. Beck, Elm A. Zweig, L. Barcos-Muñoz, John H. Black, Daniel P. Cohen, S. Michelle Consiglio, Nicholas G. Ferraro, Paul T. P. Ho, David S. Meier </p>
<p>
We present imaging spectroscopy of the "supernebula" in the nearby dwarf galaxy NGC 5253 with the MIRI-MRS integral field spectrometer of the JWST. NGC 5253 is host to an luminous (L~ 10^9~L<sub>&odot;</sub>) HII region, powered by a giant young star cluster, a possible local analogue to super star cluster formation at Cosmic Dawn and Noon. In this paper, the first in a series about the mid-infrared line and continuum emission in the center of NGC 5253, we present an overview and continuum spectra. The mid-infrared images reveal four sources of continuum emission from hot dust that we identify as luminous HII regions, which are used to define spectral apertures. The dominant continuum source is the pc-scale supernebula core seen at radio wavelengths. We find that the MIR to radio continuum flux ratio for all regions is identical to that of Galactic HII regions. The 9.7 silicate feature is present and strongest in absorption toward the supernebula. Silicate emission is seen in another HII region. PAH features are present, although weak, particularly in the supernebula; the strongest emission is in an HII region only 15 pc from the supernebula core. PAH features at 6.2μm and 11.3μm are detected in all sources. Comparison of the luminosity implied by the ionization to the observed infrared luminosity suggest that at least 25% ofthe photons are escaping the embedded supernebula core, in spite of its high, A_V≳ 15, extinction.

<p>
Quantitative morphology provides a key probe of galaxy evolution across cosmic time and environments. However, these metrics can be biased by changes in imaging quality - resolution and depth - either across the survey area or the sample. To prepare for the upcoming Rubin LSST data, we investigate this bias for all metrics measured by statmorph and single-component Sérsic fitting with Galfit. We find that geometrical measurements (ellipticity, axis ratio, Petrosian radius, and effective radius) are fairly robust at most depths and resolutions. Light concentration measurements (C, Gini, M_20) systematically decrease with resolution, leading low-mass or high-redshift bulge-dominated sources to appear indistinguishable from disks. Sérsic index n, while unbiased, suffers from a 20-40% uncertainty due to degeneracies in the Sérsic fit. Disturbance measurements (A, A_S, D) depend on signal-to-noise and are thus affected by noise and surface-brightness dimming. We quantify this dependence for each parameter, offer empirical correction functions, and show that the evolution in C observed in JWST galaxies can be explained purely by observational biases. We propose two new measurements - isophotal asymmetry A_X and substructure St - that aim to resolve some of these biases. Finally, we provide a Python package statmorph-lsst implementing these changes and a full dataset that enables tests of custom functions (see text for links).

<p>
Here we introduce the SEEDZ simulations, a suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations exploring the formation and growth of the first massive black holes in the Universe. SEEDZ includes models for Population III star formation, supernovae explosions and the resulting formation of light seed black holes, metal enrichment and subsequent Population II star formation, heavy seed black hole formation, Eddington and super-Eddington accretion schemes as well as black hole feedback. In this paper, we cover the overall methodologies employed and present our current results at z=15. Our main result so far is that black holes initially grow faster than their host galaxy, and hence over-massive black holes are a feature of the high-redshift Universe. The fundamental black hole-galaxy relationships we observe at z = 0 (especially the M_BH - M_* relationship) likely only emerge in more mature galaxies. At high-redshift, that relationship has not yet been established. We find that even at these high redshifts, MBHs can grow from their initial heavy seed mass of ~10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub> up to 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. At the high end of our MBH masses, our simulated galaxy M_BH - M_* relations match the observed high redshift trends i.e. over-massive BHs with M_BH/M_star ~ 10^-2. This initial set of simulations will continue to run down to z=10, where we will perform a comprehensive comparison of simulated MBH number densities and M_BH - M_* relations with JWST observations. Further simulations with higher resolution will then follow.

### 29) [2511.09618](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09618v1): Think inside the box: cosmic variance and large-scale conformity of high-redshift massive galaxies in the FLAMINGO simulations

<p> Seunghwan Lim, Sandro Tacchella, Roberto Maiolino, Christopher C. Lovell, Joop Schaye </p>
<p>
We use the highest-resolution FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulation to quantify cosmic variance and large-scale coherence in the evolution of massive galaxies at high redshift. FLAMINGO combines a (1 cGpc)^3 volume with baryonic resolution sufficient to identify ≳ 10^3 independent JWST-like survey volumes of (100 cMpc)^3, providing unprecedented statistics to characterize the extremes of cosmic variance. At z ≃ 6, the total variance in the number of haloes with M_200 ≃ 10^11.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> (or M<sub>&ast;</sub> ≃ 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) is 2&ndash;3 times the Poisson expectation, while this ratio decreases with redshift. Similarly, at z ≳ 4, the variance in the most massive halo per JWST-like field is twice the Poisson prediction. We find a pronounced large-scale phconformity: in volumes ranked by the stellar mass of their most massive galaxy (M<sub>&ast;</sub>,max), the stellar-to-halo mass relation and star-formation efficiency are coherently elevated or suppressed throughout the full (100 cMpc)^3 volume. When accounting for galaxies outside the volume, this signal persists only to radii ≲ 50 cMpc, demonstrating that the detectable conformity is enhanced by the survey footprint. Moreover, M<sub>&ast;</sub>,max is a better predictor of the volume-wide efficiency of massive galaxies than the total number counts, which mainly trace clustering. Finally, the stellar fraction of the most massive galaxies peaks at f<sub>&ast;</sub> = M<sub>&ast;</sub> / (M_200f_b,cosmic) ≃ 0.2 at z ≃ 5, with a narrower dispersion in f<sub>&ast;</sub> at fixed redshift and stronger redshift evolution than commonly assumed. These results show that both cosmic variance and footprint-confined conformity must be modelled when interpreting early massive galaxy populations in JWST fields.

### 30) [2511.09278](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09278v1): Little red dots as embryos of active galactic nuclei

<p> Jian-Min Wang, Yi-Lin Wang, Yong-Jie Chen, Jun-Rong Liu, Yu-Yang Songsheng, Cheng Cheng, Yan-Rong Li, Pu Du, Hao Zhang, Yu Zhao </p>
<p>
As an unprecedented large population in the early universe, the JWST-discovered little red dots (LRDs) have garnered much attention for formation of massive black holes and galaxies, but their nature remains a mystery. The LRDs appearing as "Chimeras" like both active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and galaxies have stimulated renewed interest in the roadmap of central massive black hole (cMBH) formation in AGNs. In this paper, we suggest that the LRDs contain M<sub>&bull;</sub>≲ 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> cMBHs as demonstrated by the Sołtan argument and there is a large population of stellar-mass black holes (sMBHs with total mass of \mathscrM_m<sub>&bull;</sub>) embedded inside cMBH accretion disks (cMBH-disk) as motivated by anomalous reverberations of broad Hβ line in local AGNs. This embryo structure of LRDs (M<sub>&bull;</sub>&lt;\mathscrM_m<sub>&bull;</sub>) is formed as a consequence of gravitational collapse of primordial clouds. In this Chimera, accretion onto sMBHs powers the rest-frame optical continuum of the LRDs but the UV continuum is jointly contributed by slim parts of the cMBH-disks and nuclear starbursts in the core of collapsing clouds governing the appearance of the observed V-shaped spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Outflowing clumped-envelopes are unavoidably formed by radiation pressure leading to absorption features of the Balmer lines. The present model works very well for LRDs' SEDs and avoids the issues of overly massive cMBHs. Evolution of LRDs is briefly discussed including gravitational waves.

<p>
We used newly obtained observations from the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) equipped with the Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) aboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to extract spectra covering the entire spectral range from 5 to 27~μm in the CND and in the CC. We used the photoionization code CLOUDY to generate synthetic spectra with the same spectral range and resolution, simulating a wide range of gas phases and abundances. We then determined the contribution of each phase to the spectra. Once the abundances and contribution from each phase of the gas were determined, we identified four dominant phases and performed a spatial analysis to determine their contribution to each spaxel of the datacubes. We find that in both the CND and the CC, the bulk of the emission originates from warm ionized gas with temperatures of between 10^4 and 10^4.8~K. In the CND, molecular gas contributes significantly to the flux and is spatially structured, while the CC shows minimal molecular gas content, as is expected from these regions. Coronal gas is detected in both regions at the interface between molecular and warm ionized gas. The observed abundance pattern (enhanced CNO and α elements with suppressed Fe) indicates a chemically young environment, recently enriched by core-collapse supernovae and stellar winds, with a limited contribution from older Type Ia supernovae. This favors a scenario of massive, recent star formation rather than cumulative long-term enrichment.

### 32) [2511.08685](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08685v2): Kinematic scaling relations of disc galaxies from ionised gas at z~~1 and their connection with dark matter halos

<p> Pavel E. Mancera Piña, Enrico M. Di Teodoro, S. Michael Fall, Antonino Marasco, Mariska Kriek, Marco Martorano </p>
<p>
We derive the Tully-Fisher (TFR, M<sub>&ast;</sub>-V_circ, f) and Fall (FR, j<sub>&ast;</sub>-M<sub>&ast;</sub>) relations at redshift z = 0.9 using a sample of 43 main-sequence disc galaxies with Hα IFU data and JWST/HST imaging. The strength of our analysis lies in the use of state-of-the-art 3D kinematic models to infer galaxy rotation curves, the inclusion and morphological modelling of NIR bands, and the use of SED modelling applied to our photometry measurements to estimate stellar masses. After correcting the inferred Hα velocities for asymmetric drift, we find a TFR of the form log(M<sub>&ast;</sub> / M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = a log(V_circ,f / 150~km s<sup>-1</sup>) + b, with a=3.82^+0.55_-0.40 and b=10.27^+0.06_-0.07, as well as a FR of the form log(j<sub>&ast;</sub> / kpc km s<sup>-1</sup>) = a log(M<sub>&ast;</sub> / 10^10.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) + b, with a=0.44^+0.06_-0.06 and b=2.86^+0.02_-0.02. When compared to their z=0 counterparts, we find moderate evolution in the TFR and strong evolution in the FR over the past 8 Gyr. We interpret our findings in the context of the galaxy-to-halo scaling parameters f_M=M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M_vir and f_j=j<sub>&ast;</sub>/j_vir. We infer that at z=0.9 both f_M and f_j are higher and less mass-dependent than at z=0. We speculate that the evolution of f_j can be driven by more efficient and centrally concentrated stellar feedback at z=0.9, or by an appreciable dry merger history. We also show that assuming the galaxies populating our z=0.9 relations evolve into those populating the z=0 relations leads to an apparent discrepancy with the hierarchical growth of dark matter halos. To solve this issue, one needs to evoke a progenitor bias scenario, unknown systematics affecting our and previous measurements, or consider the possibility that Hα kinematics is not a reliable dynamical tracer.

### 33) [2511.08683](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08683v1): Bridging scales: Modeling suppressed Bondi accretion on black holes and its impact on galaxy growth

<p> Antonio J. Porras-Valverde, Priyamvada Natarajan, Angelo Ricarte, Kung-Yi Su, Hyerin Cho, Ramesh Narayan, Ben S. Prather </p>
<p>
The accretion and feedback processes governing supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth span an enormous range of spatial scales, from the Event Horizon to the circumgalactic medium. Recent general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations demonstrate that strong magnetic fields can substantially suppress Bondi accretion by creating magnetically arrested disk (MAD) states, reducing inflow rates by up to two orders of magnitude relative to classical Bondi predictions. We incorporate this magnetic suppression prescription from Cho et al. (2023, 2024) into the Dark Sage semi-analytic model (SAM), which tracks SMBH and galaxy co-evolution within hierarchical merger trees derived from the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation. Implementing the suppression across different Eddington-ratio regimes, we explore its impact on black hole mass functions (BHMFs), stellar mass functions (SMFs), and AGN luminosity functions. Restricting suppression to sub-Eddington accretors (f_Edd &lt; 3 × 10^-3) and rescaling AGN feedback efficiencies gives simultaneous agreement with observed z = 0 SMFs and BHMFs, as illustrated by Case D in this work. At z &gt; 6, super-Eddington growth episodes dominate in the SAM, reproducing JWST-inferred luminous AGN number densities. Our results highlight the critical sensitivity of galaxy assembly to the coupling between small-scale accretion physics and large-scale feedback regulation. Magnetic suppression of hot gas accretion can reconcile low-redshift constraints while preserving the rapid black hole growth required at early cosmic epochs, thereby providing a physically motivated bridge between horizon-scale GRMHD simulations and cosmological galaxy-formation models.

### 34) [2511.08671](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08671v1): JWST/NIRSpec Reveals a Small Population of Dominant Dust-Obscured Ionizing Sources in Galaxies at 1 &lt; z &lt; 3

<p> Si-Rui Ge, Nikko J. Cleri, Joel Leja, Antonello Calabro, Vital Fernandez </p>
<p>
Rest-frame optical emission line diagnostics are often used to help classify ionizing sources within galaxies. However, rest-frame optical tracers can miss sources with high dust attenuation, leading to misclassification of the dominant ionizing source. Longer wavelength tracers, such as those in the near-infrared, carry the power to diagnose ionizing sources while being more robust than optical tracers to the presence of dust. The diagnostics used in this work employ the ratios of bright near-infrared emission lines [S III] 9530, [Fe II] 12566 and [Fe II] 16443 to Paschen lines in publicly-available JWST/NIRSpec MSA medium-resolution spectroscopy of 55 galaxies at z &lt; 3. We compare the rest-frame near-infrared and rest-frame optical diagnostics and find that ~90% of our sample have consistent classifications across wavelengths (49/55), while the remaining sources can be explained through ionizing radiation obscured by dust and/or elevated N/Fe abundances. We identify three objects classified as star-forming in the rest frame optical and as active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the rest-frame near-infrared, which we interpret as obscured AGN. We also identify three objects which are classified as AGN in the rest-frame optical and star forming in the rest-frame near-infrared. We interpret two of these objects as AGN with obscured star formation and the other with elevated N/Fe. We discuss how future spatially-resolved and/or mid-infrared spectroscopy can test the relative contributions of AGN and stars to the ionizing photon budgets of these disagreeing sources.

### 35) [2511.08477](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08477v1): Supermassive Dark Stars and their remnants as a possible solution to three recent cosmic dawn puzzles

<p> Cosmin Ilie, Jillian Paulin, Andreea Petric, Katherine Freese </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) begun to revolutionize our view of the Cosmos. The discovery of Blue Monsters (i.e. ultracompact yet very bright high-z galaxies) and the Little Red Dots (i.e. very compact dustless strong Balmer break cosmic dawn sources) pose significant challenges to pre-JWST era models of the assembly of first stars and galaxies. In addition, JWST data further strengthen the problem posed by the origin of the supermassive black holes that power the most distant quasars observed. Stars powered by Dark Matter annihilation (i.e. Dark Stars) can form out of primordial gas clouds during the cosmic dawn era and subsequently might grow via accretion and become supermassive. In this paper we argue that Supermassive Dark Stars (SMDSs) offer natural solutions to the three puzzles mentioned above. Moreover, we present the best evidence so far, for the existence of SMDSs: the identification of a He~IIλ2511~Å absorption feature at S/N~4 in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z13-0.

<p>
We present an Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 9 continuum detection (3.3 σ) of MACS0416_Y1 that confirms the suspected warm dust (91^+62_-35 K) of this Lyman-Break Galaxy (LBG) at z = 8.3 with log_10 M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub> = 9.0 ± 0.1. A modified black-body fit to the ALMA Bands 3 through 9 data of MACS0416_Y1 finds an intrinsic infrared luminosity of 1.0^+1.8_-0.6 × 10^12 L<sub>&odot;</sub>, placing this UV-selected LBG in the regime of Ultra Luminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs). Its luminous but modest dust reservoir (1.4^+1.3_-0.5 × 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) is co-spatial to regions with a UV-continuum slope β_UV ≈ -1.5 as seen by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging. Although this implies some dust obscuration, the JWST photometry implies less obscured star formation than seen in the complete characterization by ALMA, implying some spatial separation of dust and stars on scales below 200 pc, i.e., smaller than those probed by JWST and ALMA. This source is an extreme example of dust-obscured star formation contributing strongly to the cosmic build-up of stellar mass, which can only be revealed through direct and comprehensive observations in the (sub)mm regime.

### 37) [2511.08300](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08300v1): A Strong Gravitational Lensing Model of PSZ2 G118.46+39.32

<p> Isaac Smith, Catherine Cerny, Keren Sharon, Guillaume Mahler, Gourav Khullar, Benjamin Beauchesne, The SLICE Collaboration </p>
<p>
We present the first strong gravitational lensing model for the cluster PSZ2 G118.46+39.32 (z = 0.3967) using new NIRCam imaging from the Strong LensIng and Cluster Evolution (SLICE) JWST program. We leverage the broad coverage of the SLICE ultrawide JWST filters to identify new lensed galaxies, some of which are not visible in HST, to model the cluster's mass distribution. The model was constructed with a total of 11 multiply imaged systems, decomposed into 30 images with 60 clumps used as strong lensing constraints. PSZ2 G118.46+39.32 shows a clear bimodal structure, indicating that it may be undergoing a merger. The predicted mass distribution of the model aligns with the X-ray gas in the cluster, suggesting it is in a pre-merger state.

### 38) [2511.07765](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07765v2): JWST Lensed Quasar Dark Matter Survey III: Dark Matter Sensitive Flux Ratios and Warm Dark Matter Constraint from the Full Sample

Djorgovski, S. F. Hoenig, A. Kusenko, T. Morishita, V. Motta, L. A. Moustakas, W. Sheu, D. Sluse, D. Stern, M. Stiavelli, D. Williams </p>
<p>
We present the full sample of measurements of the warm dust emission of 31 strongly-lensed, multiply imaged quasars, observed with JWST MIRI multiband imaging, which we use to constrain the particle properties of dark matter. The strongly lensed warm dust region of quasars is compact and statistically sensitive to a population of dark matter halos down to masses of 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. The high spatial resolution and infrared sensitivity of MIRI make it uniquely suited to measure multiply imaged warm dust emission from quasars and thus to infer the properties of low-mass dark halos. We use the measured flux ratios to test for a warm dark matter turnover in the halo mass function. To infer the dark matter parameters, we use a forward modeling pipeline which explores dark matter parameters while also accounting for tidal stripping effects on subhalos, globular clusters, and complex deflector macromodels with m=1, m=3,  and  m=4 elliptical multipole moments. Adopting a comparable prior on the projected density of substructure to our previous analyses, the data presented here provide a factor of 2 improvement in sensitivity to a turnover in the halo mass function. Assuming subhalo abundance predicted by the semi-analytic model galacticus we infer with a Bayes factor of 10:1, a half-mode mass m_hm &lt; 10^7.8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> (m&gt;5.6 keV for a thermally produced dark matter particle). If instead we use a prior from N-body simulations, we infer m_hm &lt; 10^7.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> (m&gt;6.9 keV). This is one of the strongest constraints to date on a turnover on the halo mass function, and the flux ratios and inference methodology presented here can be used to test a broad range of dark matter physics.

### 39) [2511.07578](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07578v1): From Feedback-Free Star Clusters to Little Red Dots via Compaction

<p> Avishai Dekel, Dhruba Dutta Chowdhury, Sharon Lapiner, Zhiyuan Yao, Shmuel Gilbaum, Daniel Ceverino, Joel Primack, Rachel Somerville, Romain Teyssier </p>
<p>
We address the origin of the Little Red Dots (LRDs) seen by JWST at cosmic morning (z \!=\! 4 \!-\! 8) as compact stellar systems with over-massive black holes (BHs). We propose that LRDs form naturally after feedback-free starbursts (FFB) in thousands of star clusters and following wet compaction. Analytically, we show how the clusters enable efficient dry migration of stars and BHs to the galaxy center by two-body segregation and dynamical friction against the disk. The clusters merge to form compact central clusters as observed. Mutual tidal stripping does not qualitatively affect the analysis. The young, rotating clusters are natural sites for the formation of BH seeds via rapid core collapse. The migrating clusters carry the BH seeds, which merge into central super-massive BHs (SMBHs). Compactions are required to deepen the potential wells such that the SMBHs are retained after post-merger gravitational-wave recoils, locked to the galaxy centers. Using cosmological simulations at different epochs, with different codes and physical recipes, we evaluate the additional growth of LRD-matching compact central stellar systems by global compaction events. Adding to the dry growth by cluster mergers, the compactions can increase the escape velocities to retain the SMBHs. The LRDs appear at z \!~\! 8, after the formation of FFB clusters, and disappear after z \!~\! 4 when the stellar mass is above 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> by growing post-compaction blue disks around the nuclear LRDs. The LRD abundance is expected to be ~\! 10^-5 \!-\! 10^-4 Mpc^-3, increasing from z \!~\! 4 to z\!~\! 8.

### 40) [2511.07544](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07544v1): Warm and cold molecular gas in the cluster center of MACS 1931-26 with JWST and ALMA

<p>
We perform one of the first spatially resolved studies of warm (&gt;100 K) and cold (10-100 K) molecular gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM), focusing on the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) of a cool-core galaxy cluster, MACS1931-26 at z=0.35. This galaxy has a massive H<sub>2</sub> reservoir and a radio-loud active galactic nucleus (AGN) and is undergoing a starburst event. We present new JWST observations of this system, revealing warm H<sub>2</sub> gas that is co-spatial with the cold molecular gas traced by CO, extending over 30 kpc around the BCG in a tail-like structure reaching into the circumgalactic medium of this galaxy. Analysis of the mid-infrared pure H<sub>2</sub> rotational lines H<sub>2</sub>S(1), H<sub>2</sub>S(5), and H<sub>2</sub>S(9) indicate warm gas temperatures of 515.6 ± 0.8 K and 535.2± 1.9 K in the BCG and tail regions, respectively. We compare cold gas, traced by the CO(3-2) observed with ALMA, to the warm gas traced by JWST. The warm-to-cold molecular gas fraction is comparable in the BCG (1.4&percnt;±0.2&percnt;) and the CGM tail (1.9&percnt;±0.3&percnt;). Our analysis suggests that the dissipation of the kinetic energy of the H<sub>2</sub>-emitting gas is sufficient to lead to the formation of the CO gas. This observation provides new insights into the molecular gas distribution and its potential role in the interplay between the central galaxy and its circumgalactic environment.

<p>
We present an overview of the JWST GLIMPSE program, highlighting its survey design, primary science goals, gravitational lensing models, and first results. GLIMPSE provides ultra-deep JWST/NIRCam imaging across seven broadband filters (F090W, F115W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F444W) and two medium-band filters (F410M, F480M), with exposure times ranging from 20 to 40 hours per filter. This yields a 5σ limiting magnitude of 30.9 AB (measured in a 0.2 arcsec diameter aperture). The field is supported by extensive ancillary data, including deep HST imaging from the Hubble Frontier Fields program, VLT/MUSE spectroscopy, and deep JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution multi-object spectroscopy. Exploiting the strong gravitational lensing of the galaxy cluster Abell S1063, GLIMPSE probes intrinsic depths beyond 33 AB magnitudes and covers an effective source-plane area of approximately 4.4 arcmin<sup>2</sup> at z ~ 6. The program's central aim is to constrain the abundance of the faintest galaxies from z ~ 6 up to the highest redshifts, providing crucial benchmarks for galaxy formation models, which have so far been tested primarily on relatively bright systems. We present an initial sample of ~ 540 galaxy candidates identified at 6 &lt; z &lt; 16, with intrinsic UV magnitudes spanning M_ UV = -20 to -12. This enables unprecedented constraints on the extreme faint end of the UV luminosity function at these epochs. In addition, GLIMPSE opens new windows for spatially resolved studies of star clusters in early galaxies and the detection and characterization of faint high-z active galactic nuclei. This paper accompanies the first public data release, which includes reduced JWST and HST mosaics, photometric catalogs, and gravitational lensing models.

<p>
We present a measurement of the free-streaming length of dark matter (DM) and subhalo abundance around 28 quadruple image strong lenses using observations from JWST MIRI presented in Paper III of this series. We improve on previous inferences on DM properties from lensed quasars by simultaneously reconstructing extended lensed arcs with image positions and relative magnifications (flux ratios). Our forward modeling framework generates full populations of subhalos, line-of-sight halos, and globular clusters, uses an accurate model for subhalo tidal evolution, and accounts for free-streaming effects on halo abundance and concentration. Modeling lensed arcs leads to more-precise model-predicted flux ratios, breaking covariance between subhalo abundance and the free-streaming scale parameterized by the half-mode mass m_hm. Assuming subhalo abundance predicted by the semi-analytic model \ttgalacticus (N-body simulations), we infer (Bayes factor of 10:1) m_hm &lt; 10^7.4 M<sub>&odot;</sub> (m_hm &lt; 10^7.2 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), a 0.4 dex (0.3 dex) improvement relative to omitting lensed arcs. These bounds correspond to lower limits on thermal relic DM particle masses of 7.4 and 8.4 keV, respectively. Conversely, assuming DM is cold, we infer a projected mass in subhalos (10^6 &lt; m/M<sub>&odot;</sub>&lt;10^10.7) of 1.6_-1.1^+2.4 × 10^7  M<sub>&odot;</sub>  kpc^-2 at 95 &percnt; confidence. This is consistent with \ttgalacticus predictions (0.6 × 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>  kpc^-2), but in mild tension with recent N-body simulations (0.3 × 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>  kpc^-2). Our results are among the strongest bounds on WDM, and the most precise measurement of subhalo abundance around strong lenses. Further improvements will follow from the large sample of lenses to be discovered by Euclid, Rubin, and Roman.

<p>
The detection of strong Balmer breaks and absorption features in Little Red Dots (LRDs) suggests they host AGN embedded within dense gas envelopes, potentially powered by super-Eddington accretion. We present GLIMPSE-17775, a luminous (L_bol~10^45 erg s<sup>-1</sup>) LRD at z=3.501 behind Abell S1063 (μ~2), observed with deep JWST/NIRCam and a ~20 hr (80 hr de-lensed) NIRSpec/G395M spectrum. The data reveal 40+ emission and absorption features, including a rich forest of low-ionization FeII lines and numerous broad hydrogen recombination transitions. We use this depth to test the dense-gas interpretation through five independent diagnostics. Nearly all permitted lines show exponential wings with consistent FWHM, the signature of Thomson scattering requiring n_e≳10^8 cm^-3. Adopting this width yields M_BH~10^6.7M<sub>&odot;</sub>, a factor of ten lower than Gaussian fits, and λ_Edd~1.8. Additional diagnostics support the same picture: a pronounced Balmer break (f_ν,4050/f_ν,3670=2.0±0.1), enhanced HeI &lambda;7065 and &lambda;10830 with P-Cygni absorption, Bowen-fluorescent OI &lambda;8446-&lambda;11290 emission requiring Lyβ pumping, and 16 FeII lines matching fluorescence models. These features indicate a dense (n~10^8 cm^-3), partially ionized cocoon where scattering and fluorescence dominate line formation, providing strong evidence that at least some LRDs are powered by super-Eddington black-hole growth in the early Universe.

Hands, the PHANGS collaboration </p>
<p>
High-resolution JWST images of nearby spiral galaxies reveal polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission structures that trace molecular gas, including CO-dark regions. We identify ISM cloud structures in PHANGS-JWST 7.7 μm PAH maps for 66 galaxies, smoothed to 30 pc and at native resolution, extracting 108,466 and 146,040 clouds, respectively. Molecular properties were inferred using a linear conversion from PAH to CO. Given the tendency for clouds in galaxy centers to overlap in velocity space, we opted to flag these and omit them from the analysis in this work. The remaining clouds correspond to giant molecular clouds, such as those detected in CO(2-1) emission by ALMA, or lower surface density clouds that either fall below the ALMA detection limits of existing maps or genuinely have no molecular counterpart. Cross-matching with ALMA CO maps at 90 pc in 27 galaxies shows that 41 % of PAH clouds have CO associations. The converted molecular properties vary little across environments, but the most massive clouds are preferentially found in spiral arms. Fitting lognormal mass distributions down to 2×10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> shows that spiral arms host the highest-mass clouds, consistent with enhanced formation in arm gravitational potentials. Cloud molecular surface densities decline by a factor of ~ 1.5-2 toward 2 - 3 R_e. However, the trend largely varies in individual galaxies, with flat, decreasing, and even no trend as a function of galactocentric radius. Factors like large-scale processes and morphologies might influence the observed trends. We publish two catalogs online, one at the common resolution of 30 pc and another at the native resolution. We expect them to have broad utility for future PAH clouds, molecular clouds, and star formation studies.

### 45) [2511.06481](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06481v1): The Calibration of Short Wavelength Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Emission as Star Formation Rate Indicators with JWST

Elmegreen, Helena Faustino Vieira, John S. Gallagher, Kathryn Grasha, Kelsey E. Johnson, Thomas S. -Y. Lai, Matteo Messa, Göran Östlin, Linda J. Smith, Monica Tosi </p>
<p>
We use JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging acquired by the Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic Star clusTers (FEAST) program along with archival HST imaging to map ionized gas (Paα, Brα, and Hα) and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission (3.3 and 7.7 μm) across a sample of four nearby galaxies (NGC 5194, 5236, 628, and 4449). These maps are utilized to calibrate the PAH features as star formation rate (SFR) indicators in 40 pc size regions around massive emerging young star clusters (eYSCs). We find a tight, sub-linear (power-law exponent, α  ~  0.8) relation between the PAH luminosities (3.3 and 7.7 μm) and SFR (extinction corrected Paα) in near solar metallicity environments. PAH destruction in more intense ionizing environments and/or variations in the age of our sources may drive the deviation from a linear relation. In the metal-poor environment of NGC 4449 (~1/3 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>), we see substantial deficits in the PAH feature strengths at fixed SFR and significantly higher scatter in the PAH-SFR relations. We determine that the 3.3/7.7 μm PAH luminosity ratio increases towards lower metallicity environments. This is interpreted as a result of a shift in the size distribution towards smaller PAHs at lower metallicities, possibly due to inhibited grain growth. Focusing on the regions in NGC 4449, we observe a decreasing 3.3/7.7 μm ratio towards higher SFR, which could indicate that small PAHs are preferentially destroyed relative to larger PAHs in significantly sub-solar metallicity conditions. We estimate that ~2/3 of the PAH emission in typical local star-forming galaxies is excited by older stars and unrelated to recent (&lt;10 Myr) star formation.

### 46) [2511.06085](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06085v1): A JWST/NIRSpec Integral Field Unit Survey of Luminous Quasars at z ~ 5-6 (Q-IFU): Rest-frame Optical Nuclear Properties and Extended Nebulae

It remains debatable how billion-solar-mass supermassive black holes (SMBHs) form and evolve within the first billion years. We report results from a James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRSpec integral field unit (IFU) survey of 27 luminous quasars at z ~ 5-6, enabling a systematic investigation of their key physical properties and the associated, extended line emission. Our sample hosts SMBHs with log(M_BH/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ~ 8.6-9.7 and Eddington ratios of ~ 0.1-2.6 based on Hβ, and the Hβ-based and Hα-based BH mass are broadly consistent with each other. Our sample may have a slightly smaller median BH mass and larger median Eddington ratio than lower-redshift quasars within the same luminosity range, although the difference could still be explained by statistical uncertainties. They generally follow the empirical correlations between [O III] λ5007 equivalent width and bolometric luminosities or Eddington ratios formed by lower-redshift quasars. The majority of them fall within the Eigenvector~1 planes formed by lower-redshift quasars. Nevertheless, a subset of the sample shows enhanced, blueshifted [O III] emission associated with fast outflows. Spatially extended [O III] line emission is detected in 6 objects and shows morphologies and kinematics consistent with merging activities and/or turbulent and clumpy interstellar media (ISM). Tentative evidence of quasar radiative feedback shaping the ISM of a merging companion galaxy is seen in the object with the most extended [O III] emission. Our results provide crucial insight into the rapid growth of SMBHs and the gaseous environments they reside in at z~5-6.

### 47) [2511.05647](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05647v1): Not all protoclusters host evolved galaxies: Evidence for reduced environmental effects in a lower halo mass protocluster at z = 7.66

<p> Callum Witten, Pascal A. Oesch, Jake S. Bennett, Romain A. Meyer, Emma Giovinazzo, Alba Covelo-Paz, William M. Baker, Lucy R. Ivey </p>
<p>
The progenitors of present-day galaxy clusters offer crucial insight into how galaxies and large-scale structure co-evolve in the early Universe. We present JWST/NIRCam grism spectroscopy of the photometrically identified z=7.66 protocluster core in the SMACS J0723.3-7327 lensing field, SMACS-PC-z7p7. Six [O III]-emitters and five additional photometric candidates are found within a 0.3 arcmin<sup>2</sup> (1.5 cMpc^2) region, corresponding to an overdensity of δ~ 200. Despite the extreme overdensity, the resident galaxies exhibit star-formation histories, UV-slopes and neutral hydrogen column densities that are consistent with those of field galaxies at similar redshifts. This is in stark contrast with the consistently high neutral hydrogen column densities, old stellar populations and large dust masses of galaxies within a z=7.88 protocluster in the Abell 2744 field. Comparison with the TNG-Cluster and TNG300 simulations indicates a halo mass of log_10(M_200c[M<sub>&odot;</sub>]) = 11.4±0.2, and implies that, on average, SMACS-PC-z7p7 will evolve into a present-day Fornax-like cluster (log_10(M_200c, z=0[M<sub>&odot;</sub>]) = 13.7±0.6). The uniformly young, highly star-forming nature of the galaxy population of SMACS-PC-z7p7 suggests that environmental effects only become significant above halo masses of log_10(M_200c[M<sub>&odot;</sub>]) ≳ 11.5. Comparison to other z≳7 protoclusters reveals that vigorous star formation persists in lower-mass protoclusters, whereas accelerated evolution and suppression of star formation emerge in more massive haloes. SMACS-PC-z7p7 therefore represents an early stage of protocluster assembly, where residence within an overdense environment still enhances star formation, and feedback processes have yet to exert a significant influence.

Sanders, Greta Toni, Laurence Tresse, Andrea Weibel, John R. Weaver, Lilan Yang </p>
<p>
We study the stellar mass function (SMF) of quiescent and star-forming galaxies and its dependence on morphology in 10 redshift bins at 0.2&lt;z&lt;5.5 using the COSMOS2025 catalog built from 0.54   deg<sup>2</sup> JWST imaging from COSMOS-Web. Galaxies are selected by type using the NUVrJ rest-frame color diagram and classified morphologically by bulge-to-total light ratio (B/T). The quiescent SMF shows rapid early build-up, with the most massive systems (log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≳11) assembled by z~1 and evolving little since. The star-forming SMF evolves more slowly, following a mass-evolution scenario where galaxies grow via star formation and quench at the characteristic mass log(M^*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)~10.6. Bulge systems (B/T&gt;0.6) dominate the quiescent SMF at log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&gt;10 at all redshifts, while disks (B/T&lt;0.2) dominate at log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;9. However, most bulge-dominated galaxies are star-forming, with their fraction increasing with redshift and decreasing mass, consistent with being progenitors of quiescent bulges. We find evidence for environmental quenching onset at z~3 from the upturn in the quiescent SMF at log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;9.5, contributed by disk-dominated galaxies consistent with satellite quenching that retains disk morphologies. Number densities of log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&gt;10 quiescent galaxies are lower than recent literature by 0.1-0.7 dex, but agree well with simulations at 2&lt;z&lt;3. At z&gt;3, simulations increasingly underpredict observations. Finally, we build an empirical model describing galaxy number density evolution by parametrizing quenching rates, baryon conversion efficiency, and bulge formation. Our model supports a scenario where star-forming galaxies grow central bulges before quenching in massive halos.

### 50) [2511.05113](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05113v1): Spatially-resolved PAH_3.3 emission and stellar ages in ram pressure stripped clumps at z~0.3

<p>
Ram pressure stripping (RPS) plays a crucial role in shaping galaxy evolution in dense environments, yet its impact on the molecular and dusty phases of the interstellar medium remains poorly understood. We present JWST/NIRCam 3.3 micrometres PAH emission maps for the nine most striking RPS galaxies in the Abell 2744 cluster at redshift z_cl = 0.306, tracing the effects of environmental processes on small dust grains. Exploiting multi-band JWST/NIRCam and HST photometry, we perform spatially-resolved UV to mid-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, characterising stellar populations in both galactic disks and clumps detected in the stripped tails. We detect PAH_3.3 mission in eight of the nine galaxies at 5 sigma, with morphologies revealing disk truncation and elongation along the RPS direction. In three galaxies, PAH_3.3 emission is also found in star-forming clumps embedded in the stripped tails up to a distance of 40 kpc. Star formation rates inferred from PAH_3.3 emission agree with those derived from SED fitting averaged over the past 100 Myr within an intrinsic scatter of 0.4 dex, but the relation appears to be age dependent. The spatial correlation between PAH strength, stellar age, and SFR - consistent across disks and tails - demonstrates that PAH-carrying molecules can survive and be stripped by ram pressure. Finally, age gradients revealed by the SED fitting provide the first observational evidence outside the Local Universe for the fireball model of star formation in stripped clumps. This work represents the first detailed study of PAH emission in cluster galaxies, offering new insights into the fate of dust and star formation in extreme environments.

### 51) [2511.04843](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04843v2): JWST provides a new view of cosmic dawn: latest developments in studies of early galaxies

<p> Jorryt Matthee </p>
<p>
Studies of the distant Universe are providing key insights into our understanding of the formation of galaxies. The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has significantly enhanced our observational capabilities, leading to an expanded redshift frontier, providing unprecedented detail in the characterization of early galaxies and enabling the discovery of new populations of accreting black holes. This review aims to provide an introduction to the basic processes and components that shape the observed spectra of galaxies, with a focus on their relevance to techniques with which high-redshift galaxies are selected. The review further introduces specific topics that have attracted significant attention in recent literature, including the discovery of highly efficient galaxy formation in the early Universe, the relation between galaxies and the process of reionization, new insights into the formation of the first stars and the enrichment of interstellar gas with heavy elements, and breakthroughs in our understanding of the origins of supermassive black holes.

<p> Alejandro Guzmán-Ortega, Gustavo Bruzual, Vicente Rodriguez-Gomez, Lars Hernquist </p>
<p>
We use the TNG50 cosmological simulation and three-dimensional radiative transfer post-processing to generate dust-aware synthetic observations of galaxies at 3 ≤ z ≤ 6 and log_10(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 8.5 , tailored to match the depth and resolution of current deep JWST surveys (NGDEEP and JADES). We analyse the performance of spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting on the simulated sample, focusing on the recovery of photometric redshift and stellar mass. At z ≤ 5 , we find that 90 per cent of redshifts are recovered within ±0.2 , but performance declines at z = 6 . Stellar masses are generally well-recovered within a factor of 2, but are systematically underestimated regardless of redshift, a trend that is more pronounced at the high-mass end ( log_10(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 10 ) . In addition, we study the observer-frame colours of galaxies in this redshift range as well as the SED-inferred UVJ diagram. We find that TNG50 galaxies broadly follow the tendencies marked by observations, but tend to be slightly redder at lower masses and bluer at higher masses, regardless of redshift. Finally, using a colour-based definition of quiescence, we determine the fraction of quiescent galaxies as a function of stellar mass at 3 ≤ z ≤ 6 , which we find to be broadly consistent with observations.

### 53) [2511.04748](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04748v1): Dents in the Mirror: A Novel Probe of Dark Matter Substructure in Galaxy Clusters from the Astrometric Asymmetry of Lensed Arcs

<p> Derek Perera, Daniel Gilman, Liliya L. R. Williams, Liang Dai, Xiaolong Du, Gregor Rihtarsic, Joaquin Becerra-Espinoza, Allison Keen </p>
<p>
Astrometric perturbations of lensed arcs behind galaxy clusters have been recently suggested as promising probes of small-scale (≲10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) dark matter substructure. Populations of cold dark matter (CDM) subhalos, predicted in hierarchical structure formation theory, can break the symmetry of arcs near the critical curve, leading to positional shifts in the observed images. We present a novel statistical method to constrain the average subhalo mass fraction (f_sub) in clusters that takes advantage of this induced positional asymmetry. Focusing on CDM, we extend a recent semi-analytic model of subhalo tidal evolution to accurately simulate realistic subhalos within a cluster-scale host. We simulate the asymmetry of lensed arcs from these subhalo populations using Approximate Bayesian Computation. Using mock data, we demonstrate that our method can reliably recover the simulated f_sub to within 68&percnt; CI in 73&percnt; of cases, regardless of the lens model, astrometric precision, and image morphology. We show that the constraining power of our method is optimized for larger samples of well observed arcs, ideal for recent JWST observations of cluster lenses. As a preliminary test, we apply our method to the MACSJ0416 Warhol arc and AS1063 System 1. For Warhol we constrain the upper limit on log f_sub &lt; -3.40^+1.06_-0.97, while for AS1063 System 1 we constrain log f_sub = -2.36^+0.56_-0.89 (both at 68&percnt; CI), consistent with CDM predictions. We elaborate on our method's limitations and its future potential to place stringent constraints on dark matter properties in cluster environments.

<p>
Recent observations from JWST have revealed unexpectedly luminous galaxies, exhibiting stellar masses and luminosities significantly higher than predicted by theoretical models at Cosmic Dawn. In this study, we present a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations targeting high-redshift (z ≥ 10) galaxies with dark matter halo masses in the range 10^10 - 10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z=10, using state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulation codes (Enzo, Ramses, Changa, Gadget-3, Gadget-4, and Gizmo). This study aims to evaluate the convergence of the participating codes and their reproducibility of high-redshift galaxies with the galaxy formation model calibrated at relatively low redshift, without additional physics for high-redshift environments. The subgrid physics follows the AGORA CosmoRun framework, with adjustments to resolution and initial conditions to emulate similar physical environments in the early universe. The participating codes show consistent results for key galaxy properties (e.g., stellar mass), but also reveal notable differences (e.g., metallicity), indicating that galaxy properties at high redshifts are highly sensitive to the feedback implementation of the simulation. Massive halos (M_halo≥5×10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z=10) succeed in reproducing observed stellar masses, metallicities, and UV luminosities at 10≤ z≤12 without requiring additional subgrid physics, but tend to underpredict those properties at higher redshift. We also find that varying the dust-to-metal ratio modestly affects UV luminosity of simulated galaxies, whereas the absence of dust significantly enhances it. In future work, higher-resolution simulations will be conducted to better understand the formation and evolution of galaxies at Cosmic Dawn.

### 55) [2511.04122](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04122v1): Neural Network identification of Dark Star Candidates. II. Spectroscopy

<p> Adiba Amira Siddiqa, Sayed Shafaat Mahmud, Cosmin Ilie </p>
<p>
Some of the first stars in the Universe might be powered by Dark Matter (DM) annihilations, rather than nuclear fusion. Those objects, i.e. Dark stars (DS), offer a unique window into understanding DM via the observational study of the formation and evolution of the first stars and their Black Hole (BH) remnants. In \citeNNSMDSPhot (Paper~I) we introduced a feedforward neural network (FFNN) trained on synthetic DS photometry in order to detect and characterize dark star  photometric candidates in the early universe based on data taken with the NIRCam instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). In this work we develop a FFNN trained on synthetic DS spectra in order to identify  spectroscopic dark star candidates in the data taken with JWST's NIRSpec instrument. In order to validate our FFNN model we apply it to real data for the four spectroscopic Supermassive Dark Star (SMDS) candidates recently identified in \citeilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar and reconfirm that indeed \JADESeleven, \JADESzthirteen, \JADESfz, and \JADESfo have spectra that are consistent with those of Supermassive Dark Stars. The main advantage of our FFNN model, in comparison to the Nedleaer-Mead Monte Carlo parameter estimator used in \citeilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar, is that the approach introduced here predicts parameters in milliseconds, over 10,000 times faster than the traditional method used in \citeilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar. With this in mind, the FFNN model we developed and validated in this work will be adapted for Bayesian uncertainty analyses and automatic analyses of NIRSpec publicly available data for high redshift objects. This study establishes a robust and efficient tool for probing Dark Stars and understanding their role in cosmic evolution.

<p> Sayed Shafaat Mahmud, Adiba Amira Siddiqa, Cosmin Ilie </p>
<p>
The formation of the first stars in the universe could be significantly impacted by the effects of Dark Matter (DM). Namely, if DM is in the form of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), it could lead to the formation (at z~ 25-10) of stars that are powered by DM annihilations alone, i.e. Dark Stars (DSs). Those objects can grow to become supermassive (M~ 10^6 \M<sub>&odot;</sub>) and shine as bright as a galaxy (L~ 10^8 \M<sub>&odot;</sub>). Using a simple χ^2 minimization, the first three DSs photometric candidates (i.e. \JADESeleven, \JADEStwelve, and \JADESzthirteen) were identified by \citeIlie:2023JADES. Our goal is to develop tools to streamline the identification of such candidates within the rather large publicly available high redshift JWST data sets. We present here the key first step in achieving this goal: the development and implementation of a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) search for Dark Star candidates, using data from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) photometric catalog. Our method reconfirms JADES-GS-z13 and JADES-GS-z11 as dark star candidates, based on the chi-squared goodness of fit test, yet they are ~10^4 times faster than the Neadler-Mead χ^2 minimization method used in \citeIlie:2023JADES. We further identify six  new photometric Dark Star candidates across redshifts z ~ 9 to z ~ 14. These findings underscore the power of neural networks in modeling non-linear relationships and efficiently analyzing large-scale photometric surveys, advancing the search for Dark Stars.

### 57) [2511.03802](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03802v1): Making the most of pure parallels: Machine learning augmented photometric redshifts for sparse JWST filter sets

<p> Kenneth J. Duncan </p>
<p>
Photometric redshifts (photo-zs) are an essential tool for galaxy evolution science with JWST. However, for deep surveys with more limited filter sets (i.e. N_filt ~6) such as large pure parallel surveys, the most commonly used template-fitting based photo-z approaches can yield highly confident but spurious results for high-z populations of interest. The utility and legacy value of these datasets could therefore be negatively impacted. To address this challenge, we present an application of machine learning (ML) based photo-z techniques to deep JWST photometric datasets. We employ two different ML algorithms, using Gaussian processes and nearest-neighbour estimates, alongside a more standard template fitting approach. We show that simple nearest-neighbour based estimates can provide more accurate photo-zs than template fitting out to z~8, as well as reducing the fraction of catastrophic outliers by a factor of ~2-3. Additionally, `hybrid' estimates combining template and ML can yield further improvements in overall accuracy and reliability while retaining some ability to predict photo-z out to z &gt; 10. The nearest-neighbour only or hybrid estimates can achieve photo-zs with robust scatter of σ_NMAD~0.03-0.04 and outlier fractions of ~3-10&percnt; between 0 &lt; z ≲ 8 from just 6 NIRCam bands, with negligible additional computational costs compared to standard template fitting. Our methodology is easily adaptable to alternative datasets, filter combinations or training samples. Overall, our results highlight the potential for even simple ML techniques to enhance the scientific return of JWST pure parallel and wide-area surveys.

This work presents a theoretical investigation of the very-high redshift Universe using the state-of-the-art GALaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) model, run on merger trees from the Planck-Millennium N-body simulation. We show that GAEA successfully reproduces a wide range of high-z observational estimates including: the galaxy stellar mass function up to z~13 and the total (galaxies and AGN) UV luminosity function (LF) up to z~10. We find that the AGN UV emission represents an important contribution at the bright end of the UVLF up to z~8, but it is negligible at higher redshift. Our model reproduces well the observed mass-metallicity relation at z≤4, while it slightly overestimates the normalization of the relation at earlier cosmic epochs. At z≥11, current UVLF estimates are at least one order of magnitude larger than model predictions. We investigate the impact of different physical mechanisms, such as an enhanced star formation efficiency coupled with a reduced stellar feedback or a negligible stellar feedback at z&gt;10. In the framework of our model, both the galaxy stellar mass and UV luminosity functions at z≥10 can be explained by assuming feedback-free starbursts in high-density molecular clouds. However, we show that this model variant leads to a slight increase of the normalization of the z≥10 mass-metallicity relation, strengthening the tension with available data. A model with negligible stellar feedback at z&gt;10 also predicts larger numbers of massive and bright galaxies aligning well with observations, but it also overestimates the metallicity of the interstellar medium. We show that these model variants can in principle be discriminated using the relation between the star formation rate and galaxy stellar mass.

### 59) [2511.03681](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03681v1): Only Nitrogen-Enhanced Galaxies Have Detectable UV Nitrogen Emission Lines at High Redshift

<p> Peixin Zhu, Lisa J. Kewley, Tiger Yu-Yang Hsiao, James Trussler </p>
<p>
The detections of bright UV nitrogen emission lines in some high-redshift galaxies suggest unexpectedly high nitrogen-to-oxygen ratios (log(N/O)≳-1.0) compared to local values (log(N/O)≳-1.5) at similar metallicities (12+log(O/H)≲8.0). Although the presence of these `N-enhanced' galaxies indicates signatures of atypical chemical enrichment processes in the early universe, the prevalence of nitrogen enhancement in high-z galaxies is unclear. So far, only ~10 z&gt;5 galaxies have nitrogen abundance measurements, and they all suggest elevated N/O ratios. Do all high-redshift galaxies exhibit elevated N/O ratios, or are we simply missing `N-normal' galaxies whose nitrogen abundances follow the local N/O scaling relation? To tackle these questions, we calculate the detection limits of UV NIII] or NIV] lines in current JWST surveys CEERS and JADES, and compare them to predictions from both `N-enhanced' and `N-normal' AGN narrow-line region and H II region photoionization models. We find that CEERS can only detect galaxies with significant nitrogen enhancement (log(N/O)≳-0.4), while JADES can only detect galaxies with moderately elevated N/O ratios compared to local values (log(N/O)≳-1.0). Even for the deepest exposure in JADES, UV nitrogen lines produced by `N-normal' galaxies at z&gt;5 are too faint and thus not detectable, making their nitrogen abundance unmeasurable. Our results suggest that the existing sample of galaxies with measurable nitrogen abundances at z≳5 is incomplete and biased toward galaxies with significantly elevated N/O ratios. Deep (t_exp~40-500 hours) spectroscopic surveys will be crucial for building a complete sample to study nitrogen enrichment mechanisms in the early universe.

### 60) [2511.03659](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03659v2): ALMA and JWST Imaging of z &gt; 6 Quasars: No Spatial Position Offset Observed Between Quasars and Their Host Galaxies

<p> Aurora Wilde, Marcel Neeleman, Romain Meyer, Roberto Decarli, Fabian Walter, Brenda Frye, Xiaohui Fan </p>
<p>
We present a study determining the spatial offset between the position of the supermassive black hole (as traced through their broad line regions) and the host galaxy in six z &gt; 6 quasars. We determined the host galaxy's position from ≲0.1^&Prime; (≲ 600 pc) resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) [CII] 158 μm and corresponding dust continuum imaging. We determined the quasar's position from ≲ 400 pc resolution James Webb Space Telescope Near-Infrared Camera (JWST NIRCam) imaging. We estimated the observational uncertainties on the quasar's position using astrometric data from the Global Astrometric Interferometer for Astrophysics (GAIA) of field stars within the NIRCam images. We find that all six quasars are found within the central ~ 400 pc of their host galaxy dust continuum and [CII] emission. Apparent offsets seen in rest-frame optical JWST observations are not detected in our ALMA data, suggesting they likely result from dust obscuration rather than a true physical separation between the SMBH and its host galaxy. Kinematic modeling of these data further reveals that none of the galaxies show evidence for recent merger activity, and most of the galaxies can be accurately modeled using a simple disk model. The lack of an offset supports theoretical models that predict that positional offset within these galaxies are either short-lived or intrinsically rare.

### 61) [2511.02906](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02906v1): Dark Secrets of Baryons: Illuminating Dark Matter-Baryon Interactions with JWST

<p> Souradeep Das, Ranjini Mondol, Abhijeet Singh, Ranjan Laha </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered numerous bright galaxies at high redshifts (z≈ 10 &ndash; 14). Many astrophysical models and beyond the Standard Model physics scenarios have been proposed to explain these observations. We investigate, for the first time, the implications of dark matter (DM) scattering with baryons (protons and electrons) in light of the JWST UV luminosity function (UVLF) observations. These interactions suppress structure formation on galactic scales, which may have an observable effect on the UVLF measurements at high redshifts. Using a recent galaxy formation model designed to explain high-redshift observations, we obtain strong upper limits on DM-baryon scattering cross-sections and explore new regions of the parameter space. For DM-proton scattering with cross-section &prop; v^-2 velocity dependence, we obtain the strongest limit for DM masses of ~ 1 &ndash; 500 MeV. For other cases that we study (DM-proton scattering cross-section &prop; v^0, v^-4, and DM-electron scattering cross-section &prop; v^0, v^-2, v^-4), our limits are competitive with those obtained from other cosmological observables. Our study highlights the potential of JWST observations as a novel and powerful probe of non-gravitational interactions of DM.

### 62) [2511.02902](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02902v1): A close look at the black hole masses and hot dusty toruses of the first quasars with MIRI-MRS

<p>
The presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs, M_BH~10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) at z&gt;7 remains a puzzle. While their existence appears to require exotic formation or growth processes, it is possible that BH mass estimates are incorrect due to differences from the low-z quasars where BH mass scaling relations are calibrated. In this work, we employ JWST MIRI-MRS spectroscopy to measure the rest-frame optical/IR properties of the four highest-redshift known luminous type-1 quasars at 7.08≤ z&lt;7.64. We use three new broad lines to measure updated BH masses, Hα, Paα and Paβ, finding them to be in the range (4-15)\cdot10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Our black hole mass estimates from all tracers agree with each other and with previous, less accurate, ground-based measurements based on MgII. The flux ratios of the H lines deviate from expectations for case A and B recombination in the same way as in z&lt;3 quasars, indicating similar physical conditions in the Broad Line Region. Rest-frame near-IR continuum emission from a hot dusty torus surrounding the accretion disc is unambiguously detected in all four objects. We model the emission with SKIRTOR and constrain the inclination (face-on) and the opening angle (θ=40-60&deg;) of the tori. These constraints are consistent for the four objects and with expectations from luminous quasars. We estimate a total dust mass (1-4)\cdot10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> in the tori, corresponding to (0.2-7)&percnt; of the total dust in the quasar host galaxies. Given observed accretion rates, these SMBHs will deplete their tori in only ~5 Myr. Overall, we confirm that z&gt;7 SMBHs in quasars could not have grown from stellar-remnant BHs if the radiative efficiency of accretion is 10&percnt;. We also find no evidence that inferred BH masses and accretion processes in z&gt;7 quasars differ significantly from their near-identical counterparts at z&lt;3.

<p>
We present an analysis of the gas-phase mass-metallicity relationship (MZR) and fundamental metallicity relationship (FMR) for 65 star-forming galaxies at 2 &lt; z &lt; 8 from the JWST/EXCELS survey. We calculate gas-phase metallicities (12 + log(O/H)) using strong-line calibrations explicitly tested against the EXCELS sample, and report direct-method metallicities for 25 galaxies. Our sample spans 8.1&lt;log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;10.3 in stellar mass and 0&lt;log(SFR/M<sub>&odot;</sub>   yr^-1)&lt;2 in star-formation rate, consistent with typical main-sequence star-forming galaxies at the same redshifts. We find a clear MZR at both 2&lt;z&lt;4 (&langle; z &rangle; = 3.2) and 4&lt;z&lt;8 (&langle; z &rangle; = 5.5), with consistent slopes and mild evolution in normalization of ≃ 0.1   dex, matching trends from simulations and recent observations. Our results demonstrate rapid gas-phase enrichment in the early Universe, with galaxies at fixed mass reaching ≃ 50 per cent of their present-day metallicity by z ≃ 3 (within the first ≃ 15 per cent of cosmic time). We find tentative evidence for SFR-dependence in the MZR scatter, though the results remain inconclusive and highlight the need for larger high-redshift samples. Comparison with locally derived FMRs reveals a clear offset consistent with other z &gt; 3 studies. We discuss potential drivers of this offset, noting that high-redshift samples have significantly different physical properties compared to local samples used to define the z=0 FMR. Our results confirm that low-mass, high specific star-formation rate galaxies common at high redshift are inconsistent with the equilibrium conditions underlying the local FMR, and highlight the rapid chemical enrichment at early cosmic epochs.

The AXIS Community Science Book represents the collective effort of more than 500 scientists worldwide to define the transformative science enabled by the Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), a next-generation X-ray mission selected by NASA's Astrophysics Probe Program for Phase A study. AXIS will advance the legacy of high-angular-resolution X-ray astronomy with ~1.5'' imaging over a wide 24' field of view and an order of magnitude greater collecting area than Chandra in the 0.3-12 keV band. Combining sharp imaging, high throughput, and rapid response capabilities, AXIS will open new windows on virtually every aspect of modern astrophysics, exploring the birth and growth of supermassive black holes, the feedback processes that shape galaxies, the life cycles of stars and exoplanet environments, and the nature of compact stellar remnants, supernova remnants, and explosive transients. This book compiles over 140 community-contributed science cases developed by five Science Working Groups focused on AGN and supermassive black holes, galaxy evolution and feedback, compact objects and supernova remnants, stellar physics and exoplanets, and time-domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. Together, these studies establish the scientific foundation for next-generation X-ray exploration in the 2030s and highlight strong synergies with facilities of the 2030s, such as JWST, Roman, Rubin/LSST, SKA, ALMA, ngVLA, and next-generation gravitational-wave and neutrino networks.

### 65) [2510.27332](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27332v1): Jacobi capture as a pathway to off-center massive black hole binaries in dwarf galaxies

<p> Thibaut L. François </p>
<p>
The recent detection of high-redshift supermassive black holes with JWST has renewed interest in the processes driving black hole growth. At the same time, both simulations and observations point to a widespread population of off-center intermediate-mass black holes in dwarf galaxies. Their ability to merge outside galactic centers may play a key role in shaping black hole mass assembly. Here, we investigate the dynamics of off-center black holes in dwarf galaxies hosting cored dark matter haloes, where long dynamical friction timescales and core stalling naturally arise. By embedding off-center black holes into an idealized galactic potential and scanning a wide range of orbital configurations, we assess the likelihood of close interactions through Jacobi capture. We find that captures occur in about 13% of cases. Such captures, possibly sustained within compact stellar systems like stripped nuclei or globular clusters, represent a crucial first step toward assembling massive black hole binaries beyond galactic centers.

### 66) [2510.27300](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27300v1): Fluorine Evolution in the Galactic Halo

<p> Valeria Grisoni, Federico Rizzuti, Gabriele Cescutti </p>
<p>
The chemical evolution of fluorine is still a matter of debate in Galactic archaeology, especially at low metallicities, where it is particularly challenging to obtain the corresponding chemical abundances from observations. We present here the first detailed theoretical study of the chemical evolution of fluorine at low metallicity by means of a stochastic chemical evolution model for the Galactic halo, in light of the most recent data for fluorine, which further pushed observations to lower metallicities down to [Fe/H]~-4 dex, more than a factor of 10 lower in metallicity than previous detections. We employ a state-of-the-art stochastic chemical evolution model to follow the evolution in the Galactic halo, which has been shown to reproduce well the main observables in this Galactic component and the abundance patterns of CNO and neutron-capture elements, and we implement nucleosynthesis prescriptions for fluorine, focusing on the chemical evolution of this element. By comparing recent observations with model predictions, we confirm the importance of rotating massive stars at low metallicities to explain both the [F/Fe] vs [Fe/H] and [F/O] vs [O/H] diagrams. In particular, we showed that we can reach high [F/Fe]~2 dex at [Fe/H]~-4 dex, in agreement with recent observations at the lowest metallicity. With a stochastic chemical evolution model for the Galactic halo, we confirm the importance of rotating massive stars as fluorine producers, as hinted by previous studies using chemical evolution models for the Galactic disc. We also expect an important production of F at high redshift, in agreement with recent detections of supersolar N by JWST. Further data for fluorine at low metallicities and also at high redshift would be needed to put further constraints on the chemical evolution of fluorine and be compared to our theoretical predictions.

### 67) [2510.27214](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27214v1): AGN&ndash;Host Galaxy Image Decomposition with JWST

<p> Callum Dewsnap, Pauline Barmby, Sarah C. Gallagher </p>
<p>
The ability to disentangle the light of an AGN from its host galaxy is strongly dependent on the spatial resolution and depth of the imaging. As the capabilities of imaging systems improve with time, confirming that our standard techniques adequately model the increasingly complex structures unveiled is essential. With JWST providing unprecedented image quality, we can test how measurements of galaxy morphology vary with the choice of point-spread function (PSF) and fitting software. We perform two-component Sérsic+PSF fits of the surface brightness profiles of 87 X-ray AGNs (0.1 &lt; z &lt; 4) from the CEERS survey. We create model PSFs for NIRCam F115W imaging using both photutils and PSFEx. We find that PSFEx models consistently fail to match the radial profile of typical point sources within our sample. We then perform AGN&ndash;host decompositions on each source by creating Sérsic+PSF models using both Galfit and AstroPhot. We find that Galfit and AstroPhot converge to different regions of the parameter space, providing consistently differing host galaxy properties. While we can measure the AGN and host magnitudes accurately, we find that the host galaxy morphological parameters are not well-determined &ndash; the Sérsic index and effective radius are strongly covariant. Significant changes in the host galaxy parameters do not correspond to changes in the statistical quality of fit, nor to significant changes in the model's radial profile. These results indicate that the Sérsic profile does not uniquely well-represent typical AGN host galaxies in extragalactic survey fields. We also provide recommendations for studies of AGN hosts comparable to ours.

### 68) [2510.27036](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27036v1): Quantifying Spectroscopic Flux Variations Between JWST NIRISS and NIRSpec: Slit Losses in Emission Line Measurements of z~1-3 Galaxies

We analyze JWST NIRISS and NIRSpec spectroscopic observations in the Abell 2744 galaxy cluster field. From approximately 120 candidates, we identify 12 objects with at least a prominent emission lines among \Oii, \Hb, \Oiiia, \Oiiib, and \Ha that are spectroscopically confirmed by both instruments. Our key findings reveal systematic differences between the two spectrographs based on source morphology and shutter aperture placement. Compact objects show comparable or higher integrated flux in NIRSpec relative to NIRISS (within 1σ uncertainties), while extended sources consistently display higher flux in NIRISS measurements. This pattern reflects NIRSpec's optimal coverage for compact objects while potentially undersampling extended sources. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that NIRSpec recovers at least 63&percnt; of NIRISS-measured flux when the slit covers &gt;15&percnt; of the source or when R_e&lt;1kpc. For lower coverage or larger effective radii, the recovered flux varies from 24&percnt; to 63&percnt;. When studying the \Ha/\Oiiib emission line ratio, we observe that measurements from these different spectrographs can vary by up to ~0.3 dex, with significant implications for metallicity and star formation rate characterizations for individual galaxies. These results highlight the importance of considering instrumental effects when combining multi-instrument spectroscopic data and demonstrate that source morphology critically influences flux recovery between slit-based and slitless spectroscopic modes in JWST observations.

### 69) [2510.26990](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26990v1): Faint active galactic nuclei supplied 31-75% of hydrogen-ionizing photons at z&gt;5

<p> Mainak Singha, Sangeeta Malhotra, James Ely Rhoads </p>
<p>
The origin of the ionizing photons that completed hydrogen reionization remains debated. Using recent JWST and ground-based surveys at 4.5 ≤ z ≤ 6.5, we construct a unified rest-UV AGN luminosity function that separates unobscured Type I and obscured Type II populations, and show that "little red dots" and X-ray selected sources are magnitude-filtered subsets of Type I with a mixture fraction eta = 0.10 +/- 0.02. We anchor the Lyman-continuum (LyC) escape fraction to outflow incidence and geometric clearing rather than assuming quasar-like values for all classes, and propagate uncertainties through a joint fit. Integrating over -27 &lt; M_UV &lt; -17, AGN inject Ndot<sub>ion</sub>,AGN = (3.77 +1.08/-0.95) x 10^51 s<sup>-1</sup> Mpc^-3, nearly twice earlier estimates and comparable to the Ly-alpha inferred requirement at z ~ 6. When combined with the JWST galaxy UV luminosity function and a harder stellar ionizing efficiency of log10(xi<sub>ion</sub>) = 25.7, AGN contribute 31-75% of the total ionizing photons for representative galaxy escape fractions f<sub>esc</sub>,gal = 0.03-0.20. The resulting hydrogen photoionization rate, Gamma_HI ~ (0.5-2) x 10^-12 s<sup>-1</sup> at z ~ 5-6, lies squarely within the Ly-alpha forest constraints once mean free paths and IGM clumpiness are accounted for, remaining consistent for combined AGN-galaxy models up to f<sub>esc</sub>,gal ≤ 5%. These results suggest that AGN and galaxies jointly sustained the ionizing background during the final stages of reionization, with AGN remaining a major but not exclusive contributor.

### 70) [2510.26970](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26970v1): A Critical Examination of the PAH Hypothesis

<p> Alan T. Tokunaga, Lawrence S. Bernstein, Takashi Onaka </p>
<p>
The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) hypothesis proposes that the aromatic infrared bands (AIBs) observed at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3, and 12.7 mic originate from gas-phase PAH molecules. These bands exhibit consistent peak wavelengths and profiles in diverse sources, and ISO SWS and JWST spectra show a nearly identical red wing of the 3.3 mic AIB and blue wing of the 11.2 mic AIB in the dominant Class A sources. This spectral uniformity suggests that the AIBs arise from a small, well-defined set of gas phase PAH species, regardless of the excitation conditions or the nature of the source such as HII regions, reflection nebulae, planetary nebula, young stellar objects, or the diffuse interstellar medium. However, a small number of gas phase PAH species is inconsistent with current modeling of the AIBs that require a wide range of PAH types and sizes. It is also inconsistent with the lack of observed UV and optical absorption bands from gas phase PAH molecules. Furthermore, there is no plausible formation pathway to produce only a small number of specific PAH molecules in the interstellar medium. These issues require quantitative investigation in order to definitively establish gas-phase PAH molecules as the carrier of the AIBs.

### 71) [2510.26884](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26884v1): Constraining the AGN tori at cosmic noon using high-resolution JWST imaging and simultaneous SED fitting

<p> Devang H. Liya, David J. Rosario, Matthaios Charidis </p>
<p>
There is evidence for significant evolution in the gaseous and dust properties of galaxies since the era of cosmic noon (1≲ z≲ 2.5). The well known co-evolution of supermassive black holes with their host galaxies suggests a constant connection between the small-scale (nuclear) and large-scale regions of galaxies. A fundamental component of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is the "torus", a dense, dusty structure that acts as the interface between the accretion disc and the ISM of the host galaxy. The transitional nature of the torus makes it a prime subject to search for evolution since cosmic noon. We use high-resolution near- and mid-IR imaging from the JWST CEERS program to disentangle the emission from the torus in unprecedented detail for 88 X-ray selected AGN at z~2. We employ a novel SED fitting technique that combines archival low-resolution multi-band photometry at UV to FIR wavelengths with the new high-resolution JWST photometry to constrain essential AGN and torus parameters, such as accretion disc luminosity, torus opening angle, and inclination angle. We demonstrate that this SED fitting approach leads to better AGN characterisation and tighter constraints on AGN parameters. The population-level analysis finds that the Covering Fraction (CF) distribution peaks at ≈0.25 with a long tail towards higher CF. Despite the well-known evolution of the ISM and structural properties of AGN hosts to these redshifts, the CF distribution of our sample does not show any strong statistical difference with that found in local AGN of equivalent luminosity, or with those at intermediate redshifts.

<p>
We present combined JWST NIRSpec and MIRI/MRS integral field spectroscopy data of the nuclear and circumnuclear regions of the highly dust obscured Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 7582, which is part of the sample of AGN in the Galaxy Activity, Torus and Outflow Survey (GATOS). Spatially resolved analysis of the pure rotational H<sub>2</sub> lines (S(1)-S(7)) reveals a characteristic power-law temperature distribution in different apertures, with the two prominent southern star-forming regions exhibiting unexpectedly high molecular gas temperatures, comparable to those in the AGN powered nuclear region. We investigate potential heating mechanisms including direct AGN photoionisation, UV fluorescent excitation from young star clusters, and shock excitation. We find that shock heating gives the most plausible explanation, consistent with multiple near- and mid-IR tracers and diagnostics. Using photoionisation models from the PhotoDissociation Region Toolbox, we quantify the ISM conditions in the different regions, determining that the southern star-forming regions have a high density (n_H ~ 10^5 cm^-3) and are irradiated by a moderate UV radiation field (G_0 ~ 10^3 Habing). Fitting a suite of Paris-Durham shock models to the rotational H<sub>2</sub> lines, as well as rovibrational 1-0 S(1), 1-0 S(2), and 2-1 S(1) H<sub>2</sub> emission lines, we find that a slow (v_s ~ 10 km/s) C-type shock is likely responsible for the elevated temperatures. Our analysis loosely favours local starburst activity as the driver of the shocks and circumnuclear gas dynamics in NGC 7582, though the possibility of an AGN jet contribution cannot be excluded.

### 73) [2510.26308](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26308v1): Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS: Evidence for Galactic Cosmic Ray Processing

<p> R. Maggiolo, F. Dhooghe, G. Gronoff, J. de Keyser, G. Cessateur </p>
<p>
Spectral observations of 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) with JWST/NIRSpec and SPHEREx reveal an extreme CO2 enrichment (CO2/H2O = 7.6+-0.3) that is 4.5 sigma above solar system comet trends and among the highest ever recorded. This unprecedented composition, combined with substantial absolute CO levels (CO/H2O = 1.65+-0.09) and red spectral slopes, provides direct evidence for galactic cosmic ray (GCR) processing of the outer layers of the interstellar comet nucleus. Laboratory experiments demonstrate that GCR irradiation efficiently converts CO to CO2 while synthesizing organic-rich crusts, suggesting that the outer layers of 3I/ATLAS consist of irradiated material which properties are consistent with the observed composition of 3I/ATLAS coma and with its observed spectral reddening. Estimates of the erosion rate of 3I/ATLAS indicate that current outgassing samples the GCR-processed zone only (depth ~15-20 m), never reaching pristine interior material. Outgassing of pristine material after perihelion remains possible, though it is considered unlikely. This represents a paradigm shift: long-residence interstellar objects primarily reveal GCR-processed material rather than pristine material representative of their primordial formation environments. With 3I/ATLAS approaching perihelion in October 2025, immediate follow-up observations are critical to confirm this interpretation and establish GCR processing as a fundamental evolutionary pathway for interstellar objects.

### 74) [2510.25950](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25950v1): Lyman-α radiation pressure regulates star formation efficiency

<p> D. Manzoni, A. Ferrara </p>
<p>
Order-unity star formation efficiencies (SFE) in early galaxies may explain the overabundance of bright galaxies observed by JWST at high redshift. Here we show that Lyman-α (Lyα) radiation pressure limits the gas mass converted into stars, particularly in primordial environments. We develop a shell model including Lyα feedback, and validate it with one-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. To account for Lyα resonant scattering, we adopt the most recent force multiplier fits, including the effect of Lyα photon destruction by dust grains. We find that, independently of their gas surface density Σ_g, clouds are disrupted on a timescale shorter than a free-fall time, and even before supernova explosions if Σ_g ≳ 10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> pc^-2. At log(Z/Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) = -2, relevant for high-redshift galaxies, the SFE is 0.01 ≲ \hatε_* ≲ 0.66 for 10^3 ≲Σ_g [M<sub>&odot;</sub> pc^-2] ≲ 10^5. The SFE is even lower for decreasing metallicity. Near-unity SFEs are possible only for extreme surface densities, Σ_g ≳ 10^5M<sub>&odot;</sub> pc^-2, and near-solar metallicities. We conclude that Lyα radiation pressure severely limits a possible extremely efficient, feedback-free phase of star formation in dense, metal-poor clouds.

### 75) [2510.25848](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25848v1): Spiral Structure Diversity in Milky Way Analogs from TNG50: The Role of Gas and Disk Dynamics

<p> Soumavo Ghosh, Elena D'Onghia </p>
<p>
The generation of spiral arms and the mechanisms controlling their properties within a realistic cosmological framework - the complete understanding is still beyond our grasp. Using a statistically significant sample of Milky Way- and Andromeda-like (MW/M31) analogs from the high-resolution TNG50 cosmological simulation, we carry out the first systematic investigation of spiral-arm formation, their observable properties, and the underlying physical drivers. The selected analogs predominantly exhibit two-armed (m = 2) spirals in both stars and gas, while the gaseous disks often display stronger, more tightly wound, and multi-armed patterns (m&gt;2). Spiral features appear across stellar populations of different ages, confirming their density-wave nature and producing coherent spirals in both metallicity and mean stellar age distributions-consistent with recent Gaia observations of the Milky Way. Our analysis reveals a diverse dynamical scenario for spiral generation: gas content, disk coldness, and shear jointly regulate the growth and morphology of spiral perturbations. We find that the gas content and the dynamical coldness of the disk jointly regulate spiral growth: galaxies with higher gas fractions and colder disks develop more prominent spirals. The measured relation between spiral pitch angle and disk shear shows significant scatter around the analytic prediction, likely due to the combined influence of bars, gas inflows, and feedback. These results demonstrate that spiral density waves can persist in fully cosmological disks, linking internal dynamical processes to galaxy assembly and offering testable predictions for present and future surveys such as JWST and Roman.

Silverman, Takumi S. Tanaka, Bei You, Hassen M. Yesuf, Jorge A. Zavala </p>
<p>
Recent JWST observations have revealed a population of red, compact, high-redshift objects called 'Little Red Dots'(LRD), whose host components have remained largely unconstrained, possibly due to their extreme compactness. Current morphological studies have been limited by small samples, as well as by insufficient imaging depth, which may not allow reliable separation between point-like and extended components, leaving the existence and properties of extended components in LRD largely unconstrained. Here, we perform the image stacking analysis of 217 LRDs in four NIRCam bands, representing the largest and homogeneous sample observed from COSMOS-Web survey to date. Our results reveal an unambiguous detection of faint extended emission in the F444W band, with a typical size of ~200 parsecs and magnitude of ~27.7 AB at z~6.5. We perform four-band photometric SED fitting based on galaxy templates and derive a stellar mass of 8.91+-~0.1 logM_sun. Given this stellar mass, the host galaxy is compact, i.e., ~2.5 times smaller than star-forming populations at similar mass, and the typical black hole mass of LRDs is elevated by ~1.5 dex above the local MBH-M<sub>&sext;</sub> relation. This work provides direct observational evidence for the existence of LRD host galaxies and offers crucial insights into the growth of the host galaxy and the co-evolution of galaxies and their black holes within the first billion years after the Big Bang.

<p>
We present analysis of JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec observations of the galaxy SXDF-NB1006-2 at z = 7.212, as part of the Reionization and the ISM/Stellar Origins with JWST and ALMA (RIOJA) project. We derive the physical properties by conducting spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, revealing that our target is a young (age ~2 Myr) starburst galaxy with intense radiation field. We detect multiple nebular emission lines from NIRSpec IFS data. We identify a robust broad component of [O III]&lambda;5008 emission, indicating the presence of ionized gas outflows. The derived gas depletion time of a few hundred Myr implies that our target could be one of the progenitors of massive quiescent galaxies at z~4-5 identified by recent JWST observations. The spatial distribution of optical and far-infrared (FIR) [O III] emission lines differs in morphology, likely resulting from different critical densities and inhomogeneous density distributions within the galaxy. Potential old stellar populations may be necessary to account for the derived metallicity of ~0.2 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>, and their presence can be confirmed by future MIRI observations. Including our target, star-forming galaxies at z&gt;6 detected by ALMA are generally very young but more massive and brighter in UV than galaxies identified by only JWST. The ALMA-detected galaxies may also have a steeper mass-metallicity relation. These findings suggest that the ALMA-detected galaxies may have experienced more efficient mass assembly processes in their evolutionary pathways.

<p>
We investigate the properties of extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) at z=4-9 and their role in reionization. Compact, low-mass galaxies with intense optical emission lines are linked to elevated specific star formation rates (sSFRs) and recent bursts of star formation. Feedback in these systems may enable the leakage of ionizing radiation into the intergalactic medium. Using JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy from the CAPERS, CEERS, and RUBIES surveys, we compile 160 NIRCam-selected EELGs in the EGS field. These galaxies show extreme rest-frame equivalent widths (EWs), with a median EW([O III]+Hβ)=1616Å and EW(Hα)=763Å. They are low-mass (median log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=8.26) with high sSFRs (median 43 Gyr^-1), above the z~6 main sequence. UV slopes are diverse, with a mean β=-2.0, and only 7% have extremely blue continua (β&lt;-2.6). Emission-line diagnostics suggest stellar populations as the primary ionizing source, although an AGN fraction of 14% is found. These galaxies are efficient ionizing photon producers, with mean log(ξ<sub>ion</sub> [Hz erg^-1])=25.34, exceeding typical values at similar redshifts. Escape fractions, however, are heterogeneous: 9% of EELGs show escape fractions &gt;10% for both Lyα and LyC photons, while 82% lack detectable Lyα emission. The median inferred LyC escape fraction is modest (4.4%) but enhanced in super-Eddington systems with sSFR &gt;25 Gyr^-1. The galaxies are extremely compact, with a median effective radius of 0.49 kpc, and exhibit a recent star-formation burst. Our analysis indicates that sSFR and star-formation rate surface density are the primary drivers of their extreme emission line strengths.

### 79) [2510.25383](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25383v1): Rapid bulge assembly in young galaxy disks at Cosmic Dawn

<p> Anshuman Borgohain, Kanak Saha </p>
<p>
Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have begun to reveal a surprising morphological diversity in galaxies within the first billion years after the Big Bang, including indications of structural maturity previously thought to arise much later. These findings raise fundamental questions about when and how well-known structural components of galaxy morphology, such as bulges and disks, first emerged. However, directly identifying and resolving such structures at z &gt; 6 remains challenging due to limited spatial resolution and sensitivity. In this work, we present a clear and robust morphological analysis of a sample of 190 galaxies at z ≥ 6, demonstrating that distinct bulge and disk components were already beginning to emerge during this early epoch. Using multi-component light profile fitting, we model the radial brightness distributions of a subset (20) of galaxies with an inner spheroidal (Sersic) component and an underlying exponential disk. These systems exhibit high bulge-to-total (B/T) light ratios (~ 0.47) and central stellar mass surface densities (~ 2.82*10^8 M_sun kpc^-2 ) - values close to those of nearby quiescent galaxies. Combined with their intense central star formation rate surface densities (~ 1.26*10^1 M_sun yr^-1 kpc^-2 ), our results indicate a rapid building of inner stellar mass and bulge assembly within these young systems. We propose that these early bulge-disk galaxies represent progenitors of massive star-forming and quiescent systems observed at lower redshifts. Their subsequent evolution may proceed through physical processes such as disk growth, compaction, quenching, or bulge-disk co-evolution, driven by both internal dynamics and external interactions.

At low redshift, massive quiescent galaxies (MQGs) are most frequently found in massive, rich galaxy clusters, but at high redshift the trend is less clear. Here, we present spectroscopic evidence of the effects of environment on the formation and assembly of high-redshift MQGs. We identify 25 (5) log (M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>≥10.5 (10.0≤log (M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>&lt;10.5) spectroscopically-confirmed quiescent galaxies in the UDS and EGS fields at 3&lt;z&lt;5 with NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy from RUBIES and other public JWST NIRSpec programs. We measure the density contrast in these fields by applying a Monte Carlo Voronoi Tesselation density mapping technique to photometric and spectroscopic redshifts of m_F444W&lt;27.5 sources. We robustly detect 12 massive overdense peaks with log (M_Peak/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≥13 and six extended massive protoclusters (log (M_Struct/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≥13.85). We observe that MQGs are preferentially found in these massive peaks and within these massive structures: ≈50&percnt; of MQGs are found in massive peaks, compared to ≈20&percnt; of massive star forming galaxies (MSFGs) and ≈15&percnt; of the overall spectroscopically-confirmed population. We also find an apparent dependence on both quiescent galaxy mass and environment, with 75&percnt; of the most massive (log (M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>≥10.75) residing inside overdense peaks. We compare the star formation histories (SFHs) of the MQGs with the high-redshift galaxy stellar mass function from observations and simulated quiescent galaxies at z&gt;5, finding that the masses from the inferred MQG SFHs regularly exceed either observed or simulated high-redshift galaxies, which suggests indicates that mergers and ex-situ star formation play a key role in the mass assembly of MQGs in overdense environments.

<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) Time-Domain Field (TDF) has been monitored by NuSTAR and XMM-Newton with a regular cadence for five years starting in 2019. The survey has accumulated 3.5Ms of NuSTAR exposure and 228 ks quasi-simultaneous XMM-Newton observations covering 0.31 deg<sup>2</sup>. This paper presents the results from the most recent two-years' 2Ms NuSTAR and 166 ks XMM observations in NuSTAR cycles 8 and 9. These observations reached a 20%-area flux of 2.20 x 10^-14 erg cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> in the 8-24 keV band. 75 NuSTAR sources and 274 XMM-Newton sources are detected at 99% reliability level. The logN-logS measured in cycles 8+9 are consistent with those measured in the previous cycle 5+6 NuSTAR NEP survey, but in a larger area (0.3 deg<sup>2</sup> compared with 0.19 deg<sup>2</sup>). The slope of the cycles 8+9 8-24 keV logN-logS curve is flatter than other works (α89 = 1.13 +/- 0.46), but is consistent with the Euclidean value of α = 1.50. In addition, we found ~36% of the NuSTAR sources to be heavily obscured (NH ≥ 10^23 cm<sup>2</sup>). The Compton-thick (NH ≥ 10^24 cm<sup>2</sup>) (CT-) AGN fraction is 9+18-8% in the NEP-TDF, which is consistent with the measurements in previous surveys.

<p>
Carbonaceous nano-grains are a significant component of interstellar dust and dominate the mid-infrared emission of photodissociation regions (PDRs). We study the evolution of nano-grains across the illuminated edge of the Horsehead PDR, especially their abundance and size properties. This work is part of the Physics and Chemistry of PDR Fronts program studying dust and gas in PDRs with JWST. We use NIRCam+MIRI photometric bands and NIRSpec+MRS spectroscopy to map the illuminated edge. We model dust emission using the THEMIS dust model with the SOC radiative transfer code. Detailed modeling of high angular resolution JWST data allows us to obtain constraints on nano-grain properties. We find that diffuse ISM dust cannot account for the observed data, requiring evolved grains. A sharp density increase is observed at the illuminated edge, consistent with ALMA observations revealing a sharp transition between molecular and ionized gas. Although the PDR length could not be directly determined, we estimate an upper limit of approximately 0.015 pc. This implies a lower limit on small grain abundance (greater than 0.003), showing small grains are not depleted at the Horsehead edge, unlike in the Orion Bar. Our findings indicate a high-density environment and less steep size distribution for nano-grains at the illuminated edge versus the diffuse ISM. This implies nano-grain destruction mechanisms might be less efficient in the Horsehead's moderate-UV field than in more intense PDRs. These results support a model where nano-grain population recovery is slower in moderate-UV environments, leading to a unique dust size distribution at the edge of the Horsehead Nebula.

<p> Ritvik Sai Narayan, Melinda Soares-Furtado, Mary Anne Limbach, Nishanth Ramanujam, Andrew Vanderburg, Johanna M. Vos </p>
<p>
Young stars host only a small fraction of the known exoplanet population because their photometric variability, magnetic activity, and frequent placement in dense, poorly-resolved regions hamper exoplanet detections. Yet, measuring planets at these ages is crucial since these phases are when dynamical processes that drive planetary migration are most active. We assess the expected yield of a hypothetical Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope transit survey of the Rosette Nebula, a ~10 Myr star-forming region with a dense and diverse stellar population. Using the Roman Exposure Time Calculator to quantify sensitivity to Rosette members, we establish detection thresholds for companions and evaluate yields via Monte Carlo injection-recovery simulations. We predict the detection of 33 ± 9 young transiting exoplanets orbiting stellar hosts in a month-long survey, and 29 ± 8 in a two-week survey. The extended baseline primarily improves sensitivity to longer-period planets orbiting FGK stars, while most M dwarf detections are well-sampled within two weeks. Irrespective of the temporal baseline, transit detections are dominated by of 1-2 R_\oplus super-Earths and sub-Neptunes with P≲8 days. Such a sample would substantially expand the census of only three detected planets younger than 20 Myr, probing an age regime in which planetary radii remain inflated, the stability of close-in orbits is uncertain, and planetary migration may still be ongoing. This survey offers a path to constrain early planetary evolution and establish prime follow-up targets for the James Webb Space Telescope, Vera Rubin Observatory, and the Habitable Worlds Observatory.

### 84) [2510.23549](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23549v1): Cosmic Vine: High abundance of massive galaxies and dark matter halos in a forming cluster at z=3.44

<p>
The Cosmic Vine is a massive protocluster at z=3.44 in the JWST CEERS field, offering an ideal laboratory for studying the early phases of cluster formation. Using the data from the DAWN JWST Archive, we conduct a comprehensive study on the large-scale structure, stellar mass function (SMF), quiescent members, and dark matter halos in the Cosmic Vine. First, we spectroscopically confirm 136 galaxies in the Vine at z=3.44, and an additional 47 galaxies belonging to a diffuse foreground structure at z=3.34 which we dub the Leaf. We identify four subgroups comprising the Cosmic Vine and two subgroups within the Leaf. Second, we identified 11 quiescent members with log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=9.5-11.0, the largest sample of quiescent galaxies in overdense environments at z&gt;3, which gives an enhanced quiescent galaxy number density 2x10^(-4)cMpc^(-3) that is three times above the field level at log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &gt; 10. Notably, these quiescent members form a tight red sequence on the color-magnitude diagram, making it one of the earliest red sequences known to date. Third, by constructing the SMFs for both star-forming and quiescent members, we find that both SMFs are top-heavy, with a significantly enhanced quiescent fraction at log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&gt;10.5 compared to field counterparts. The stellar mass-size analysis reveals that star-forming members are more compact at higher masses than their field counterparts. Finally, we estimate a halo mass of log(Mh/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=13.2+-0.3 for the protocluster core, and log(Mh/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=11.9-12.4 for satellite subgroups. The phase-space analysis indicates that three subgroups are likely infalling to the core. This work reveals a high abundance of massive galaxies and dark matter halos in a forming cluster, demonstrating the accelerated assembly of massive galaxies in massive halos when the Universe was less than 2 billion years old.

### 85) [2510.23548](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23548v1): The MandelZoom project II: the impact of stellar feedback on black hole accretion through an α-disc in dwarf galaxies with a resolved interstellar medium

<p> Eun-jin Shin, Matthew C. Smith, Debora Sijacki, Martin A. Bourne, Sophie Koudmani </p>
<p>
We present a suite of high-resolution simulations to study how different stellar feedback channels regulate the growth of central intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in dwarf galaxies hosting nuclear star clusters (NSCs). We employ a super-Lagrangian refinement scheme to resolve the self-gravity radius of the α-accretion disc (&lt;0.01~pc) and follow the gas inflows from the interstellar medium (ISM) to the black hole (BH), allowing for the self-consistent emergence of circumnuclear discs (CNDs). In the absence of stellar feedback, as expected, the galactic disc fragments excessively, producing a massive CND. When radiative stellar feedback is included, fragmentation is suppressed, with even more massive CNDs forming and feeding the IMBH. With supernova (SN) feedback only, clustered SNe strongly heat the ISM, yielding both the lowest CND masses and BH accretion rates. When both radiative stellar feedback and SNe are included, the CND becomes intermittent: it survives for 10&ndash;100~Myr, and is then destroyed by feedback before being replenished by fresh galactic inflows, while substantial BH growth still takes place. These results highlight the critical importance of accurately modelling the combined effects of key stellar feedback processes to understand IMBH growth. Our simulation suite brackets the likely range of CND states, with IMBHs exhibiting significant growth and systematic spin-up in all dwarf galaxy models explored. These findings bode well for the detection of IMBHs with future observational facilities such as SKA, the Rubin Observatory, and LISA, and make them highly relevant progenitor candidates of the high-redshift supermassive BHs observed by JWST.

### 86) [2510.23220](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23220v1): Using Type-II Cepheids as Extragalactic Standard Candles: Distances to M31

<p> V. D. Pipwala, H. N. Lala, B. Lemasle, E. K. Grebel, G. Bono, G. Fiorentino </p>
<p>
Several standard candles have been tested and used to measure accurate extragalactic distances over the past decades. There have been discussions regarding the possibility of using Type-II Cepheids (T2Cs) as an alternative tool, but rarely was this ever implemented. The aim of this project is to assert the use of T2Cs as a new avenue for calibrating the extragalactic distance scale, by using M31 as a benchmark galaxy. Since Ordinary Least Squares regression methods are not immune to outliers and offer an incomplete treatment of the uncertainties, we favor a Bayesian robust regression model to compute new Period&ndash;Luminosity (PL) and Period&ndash;Wesenheit (PW) relations calibrated using ~100 T2Cs, ~1000 fundamental-mode and ~750 first-overtone classical Cepheids (CCs) in the LMC. Using these relations, we employ a classification routine based on Bhattacharyya distances to filter out any contaminants from the M31 sample. We validate our method by verifying that we retrieve an accurate distance for the LMC. We find a distance to M31 of 24.487±0.001 (statistical) ±0.052 (systematic) mag using CCs and of 24.409±0.025 (statistical) ±0.156 (systematic) mag using T2Cs. Both values are in excellent agreement with literature values derived from meta-analyses, from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of CCs, from the Tip of the Red Giant Branch method, and from HST observations of RR Lyrae. In almost all cases, we reach a relative accuracy better than 98&percnt;, although the archival ground-based data we use cannot compare with HST photometry. We demonstrate that T2Cs can also be used as accurate tracers for determining extragalactic distances, thereby making them excellent candidates for JWST, LSST, and ELT observations. These stars allow us to probe galaxies deprived of young populations and are beyond the reach of the fainter RR Lyrae.

<p>
We present an analysis of the rest frame optical JWST NIRSpec Fixed Slit spectra of extended host galaxy emission in 12 quasars from the Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) sample at redshifts 6.0 &lt; z &lt; 6.4. The spatial point spread function is modeled primarily by a sum of two Gaussians as a function of wavelength and is used to fit and subtract the quasar from the 2D spectra, leaving only extended galaxy emission which we analyze. Ten of 12 systems show spatially extended line emission and five of 12 systems show an extended stellar continuum. From the extended [OIII]5008 emission line, we measure a 132 ± 19 km/s ionized outflow in one system and 52 ± 12 km/s rotation, suggesting a coherent disk, in another. From the extended narrow Hα emission, which we hypothesize is ionized by star-forming regions rather than the quasar, we measure star formation rates ranging from ~ 7 to 111 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr, the majority of which are consistent with the star-forming main sequence at z ≈ 6. The positions of our host galaxies on the log10[OIII]5008/Hβ vs. log10[NII]6584/Hα (R3N2) Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram indicate ionization rates typical of AGN activity in the low-redshift universe, but are consistent with the placement of similar z ≈ 6 quasar host galaxies, suggesting that the R3N2 line ratios cannot distinguish AGN and star-formation powered line emission at high redshifts. We conclude from the consistency between our quasar host sample with z ~ 6 galaxies that the presence of a low-luminosity AGN causes little significant change in the properties of galaxies at z ≈ 6 on 10 Myr timescales.

### 88) [2510.22043](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22043v1): Tracing The Start and End of Cosmic Reionization &ndash; Exploring The Role of Ionizing Sources as drivers

<p> Arghyadeep Basu </p>
<p>
This thesis investigates the Epoch of Cosmic Reionization (EoR), a key period in the early Universe when the first luminous sources formed and their radiation transformed the intergalactic medium (IGM) from neutral to ionized. Understanding this process reveals how the first stars and galaxies formed, influenced their surroundings, and shaped large-scale structures. The work traces both hydrogen and helium reionization by identifying the sources that produced ionizing radiation and examining how this radiation affected the thermal and ionization history of the IGM. Using the SPICE cosmological radiation-hydrodynamics simulations, the first part analyzes the ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF) of high-redshift galaxies. It shows that different supernova feedback models drive distinct UVLF variability across mass and redshift, potentially alleviating the bright-galaxy tension seen by JWST. The second part explores how spectra from ionizing sources i.e. single and binary stars, X-ray binaries, emission from the interstellar medium, and active galactic nuclei impact the timing, topology, and thermal history of hydrogen reionization and the Lyman-alpha forest. At lower redshifts, radiative-transfer simulations reveal how helium reionization driven by quasars progressed and how the timing and temperature of the IGM relate to quasar luminosity functions and He II Ly-alpha observations. Finally, predictions for the 3.5 cm hyperfine transition of singly ionized helium-3 offer a novel probe of the post-reionization IGM. Together, these studies combine galaxy formation, radiative processes, and IGM evolution to provide a coherent picture of cosmic reionization and its observable signatures.

<p>
Recent JWST observations have uncovered a population of compact, high-redshift (z&gt;6) galaxies exhibiting extreme nebular conditions and enhanced nitrogen abundances that challenge standard chemical evolution paradigms. We present a joint UV and optical abundance analysis using a new suite of ttCloudy photoionization models covering a wide density range (n_e=10^2-10^9 cm^-3), combined with HST and JWST spectroscopy for a sample of star-forming galaxies across 0.0≲ z ≲10.6. We find that assuming uniform, low-density conditions (n_e~10^2 cm^-3) in high-density environments (n_e~10^5 cm^-3) can bias nebular diagnostics by overestimating T_e (up to 1800 K), overpredicting log U (by &gt;1 dex), and underestimating O/H (up to 0.67 dex), while only modestly inflating N/O. Therefore, robust abundance determinations at high-z require a multi-phase density model. Using this model, we recalculate O/H and N/O abundances for our sample and present the first log U diagnostics and ICFs for high-ionization UV N lines. We find that the UV tracers systematically overestimate N/O by ~0.3-0.4 dex relative to the optical benchmark. We find that N/O increases with redshift, correlating with both n_e and star formation rate surface density (Σ_SFR), suggesting that N/O is temporarily enhanced in compact, high-pressure environments. However, the n_e evolution with z is more gradual than the (1+z)^3 scaling of virial halo densities, suggesting that n_eevolution is shaped by both cosmological structure growth and baryonic processes. These trends point to prompt N/O enrichment potentially driven by very massive stars, with key implications for interpreting UV emission and determining reliable chemical abundances from JWST observations of the early universe.

<p> Konstantinos Kritos, Joseph Silk </p>
<p>
Little Red Dots, discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope, are hypothesized to be active galactic nuclei containing a supermassive black hole, possibly surrounded by a dense stellar cluster, large amounts of gas, and likely by a population of stellar-mass black holes. We develop a simple nuclear star cluster model to evolve the rapid mass growth of black hole seeds into the supermassive regime. The combined processes of tidal disruption events, black hole captures, and gas accretion are accounted for self-consistently in our model. Given the observed number density of Little Red Dots, and under reasonable assumptions, we predict at least a few tens of tidal disruption events and at least a few black hole captures at z=4-6, with a tidal disruption event rate an order of magnitude larger than the black hole capture rate. We also estimate the uncertainties in these estimates. Finally, we comment on the low x-ray luminosity of Little Red Dots.

### 91) [2510.21707](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21707v1): Connecting Chemical Enrichment with Resolved Star Formation Histories

<p> Christopher T. Garling, Alex M. Garcia, Niusha Ahvazi, Nitya Kallivayalil, Kristen B. W. McQuinn, Robert Feldmann, Roger E. Cohen </p>
<p>
We present a new framework for modeling the chemical enrichment histories of galaxies by integrating the chemical evolution with resolved star formation histories (SFHs) derived from color-magnitude diagrams. This novel approach links the time evolution of the metallicity of the star-forming ISM to the cumulative stellar mass formed in the galaxy, enabling a physically motivated, self-consistent description of chemical evolution. We apply this methodology to four isolated, gas-rich Local Group dwarf galaxies &ndash; WLM, Aquarius, Leo A, and Leo P &ndash; using deep HST and JWST imaging. For WLM, Aquarius, and Leo A, we independently validate our metallicity evolution results using ages and metallicities of individual red giant stars with spectroscopic measurements, finding good agreement. We quantify systematic uncertainties by repeating our analysis with multiple stellar evolution and bolometric correction libraries. We then compare the observed chemical enrichment histories to predictions from the TNG50 and FIREbox cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and the Galacticus semi-analytic model. We find that the enrichment history of WLM is best reproduced by the FIREbox simulation, while TNG50 and Galacticus predict higher metallicities at early times. Our results suggest that differences in stellar feedback and metal recycling prescriptions drive significant variation in the predicted chemical enrichment of dwarf galaxies, particularly at early times. This work demonstrates the power of combining resolved SFHs with physically motivated chemical evolution models to constrain galaxy formation physics and highlights the need for further observational and theoretical studies of metal retention and recycling in low-mass dwarf galaxies.

Strong gravitational lensing by massive galaxy clusters offers particularly rare opportunities to observe multiple images of distant (z≳2) Type Ia supernovae (SNe) and resolve the properties of their host galaxies. A recent outstanding example is the Type Ia SN "H0pe" (z=1.78), discovered in James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam images when it was still triply imaged by the galaxy cluster PLCK G165.7+67.0 (G165, z=0.35). In this work we build a new strong lensing model of G165, first by using only the position of multiple images of background galaxies. We then increase significantly the number of constraints around the position of SN H0pe by modeling the extended surface brightness of the SN host galaxy. The average uncertainty on mass model parameters is reduced by more than an order of magnitude. We also study the spatial distribution of dust in the arc to estimate the dust extinction at the position of SN H0pe. We find good statistical agreement of the extinction estimate at ≲1σ with three fully independent methods based on spectral energy distribution fitting. Moreover, our extended-image lens model of G165 allows us to map the dust distribution of the host galaxy from the image plane to the source plane. Supernova H0pe exploded in a region with a relatively high extinction of A_V ≈ 0.9 mag at around ~ 1 kpc from its host center. This work shows that extended image modeling in lensing clusters simultaneously reduces the uncertainty on lens model parameters and enables spatially resolved analyses of lensed transients host galaxies. Such modeling advances are expected to play an important role in future cosmological analyses using strongly lensed SNe.

High-redshift protoclusters are crucial for understanding the formation of galaxy clusters and the evolution of galaxies in dense environments. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its unprecedented near-infrared sensitivity, enables the first exploration of protoclusters beyond z&gt;10. Among JWST surveys, COSMOS-Web Data Release 0.5 offers the largest area ~0.27 deg<sup>2</sup>, making it an optimal field for protocluster searches. In this study, we searched for protoclusters at z~9-10 using 366 F115W dropout galaxies. We evaluated the reliability of our photometric redshift by validation tests with the JADES DR3 spectroscopic sample, obtaining the likelihood of falsely identifying interlopers as ~25&percnt;. Overdensities (δ) are computed by weighting galaxy positions with their photometric redshift probability density functions (PDF), using a 2.5 cMpc aperture and a redshift slice of ±0.5. We selected the most promising core galaxies of protocluster candidate galaxies with an overdensity greater than the 95th percentile of the distribution of 366 F115W dropout galaxies. The member galaxies are then linked within an angular separation of 7.5 cMpc to the core galaxies, finding seven protocluster candidates. These seven protocluster candidates have inferred halo masses of M_halo ~ 10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. The detection of such overdensities at these redshifts provides a critical test for current cosmological simulations. However, confirming these candidates and distinguishing them from low-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies or Balmer-break galaxies will require follow-up near-infrared spectroscopic observations.

<p>
We aim to characterise the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and the 3D correlation between stellar mass, metallicity and star-formation rate (SFR) known as the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) for galaxies at 5&lt;z&lt;7. Using ~800 [O III] selected galaxies from deep NIRCam grism surveys, we present our stacked measurements of direct-T_e metallicities, which we use to test recent strong-line metallicity calibrations. Our measured direct-T_e metallicities (0.1-0.2 Z<sub>&odot;</sub> for M<sub>&sext;</sub> ≈5×10^7-9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, respectively) match recent JWST/NIRSpec-based results. However, there are significant inconsistencies between observations and hydrodynamical simulations. We observe a flatter MZR slope than the SPHINX^20 and FLARES simulations, which cannot be attributed to selection effects. With simple models, we show that the effect of an [O III] flux-limited sample on the observed shape of the MZR is strongly dependent on the FMR. If the FMR is similar to the one in the local Universe, the intrinsic high-redshift MZR should be even flatter than observed. In turn, a 3D relation where SFR correlates positively with metallicity at fixed mass would imply an intrinsically steeper MZR. Our measurements indicate that metallicity variations at fixed mass show little dependence on the SFR, suggesting a flat intrinsic MZR. This could indicate that the low-mass galaxies at these redshifts are out of equilibrium and that metal enrichment occurs rapidly in low-mass galaxies. However, being limited by our stacking analysis, we are yet to probe the scatter in the MZR and its dependence on SFR. Large carefully selected samples of galaxies with robust metallicity measurements can put tight constraints on the high-redshift FMR and, help to understand the interplay between gas flows, star formation and feedback in early galaxies.

<p> James Sunseri, Zachary L. Andalman, Romain Teyssier </p>
<p>
Among the emerging excess of massive, bright galaxies at Cosmic Dawn z ≳ 9 seen by the James Webb Space Telescope, several exhibit spectral features associated with active galactic nuclei (AGN). These AGN candidates suggest that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) grow rapidly in the early Universe. In a series of numerical experiments, we investigate how SMBHs grow within and influence the most massive galaxies at Cosmic Dawn using cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations run with the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES. Our suite of simulations explore how super-Eddington accretion, seed mass, and the strength of feedback influence SMBH-galaxy co-evolution in the early Universe. We find that SMBH growth is sensitive to stellar feedback which generates a turbulent-multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) that stochastically starves the SMBH. In the absence of AGN feedback, we find that the SMBH is starved ~ 50&percnt; of the time after the onset of star formation in the galaxy. SMBH growth can become self-regulated by AGN feedback if the SMBH becomes massive enough, either by accretion or seeding, for its feedback to dominate the surrounding nuclear region. We find no evidence of galaxy-scale, AGN-driven quenching in the star formation rate (SFR) across all simulations in our suite.

<p> Francesca Tonolo </p>
<p>
This perspective offers a viewpoint on how the challenges of molecular scattering investigations of astrophysical interest have evolved in recent years. Computational progress has steadily expanded collisional databases and provided essential tools for modeling non-LTE astronomical regions. However, the observational leap enabled by the JWST and new observational facilities has revealed critical gaps in these databases. In this framework, two major frontiers emerge: the characterization of collisional processes involving heavy projectiles, and the treatment of ro-vibrational excitation. The significant computational effort of these investigations emphasizes the need to test and develop robust theoretical methods and approximations, capable of extending the census of collisional coefficients required for reliable astrophysical modeling. Recent developments in these directions are outlined, with particular attention to their application and their potential to broaden the coverage of molecular systems and physical environments.

<p> K. El Bourakadi, M. Yu. Khlopov, M. Krasnov, H. Chakir, M. Bennai </p>
<p>
We explore how inflationary features shape the early stages of cosmic structure formation. Using the transfer function formalism, we trace the evolution of primordial perturbations, showing how causal physics and oscillatory signatures from inflation influence the matter power spectrum. The variance of smoothed density fields is then applied to model the collapse of overdense regions and predict dark matter halo abundances through the Press-Schechter framework. Extending to the baryonic sector, we analyze primordial gas collapse in minihalos, emphasizing molecular hydrogen cooling and the thermochemical pathways leading to Population III star formation. Finally, we examine primordial black holes as potential seeds for early galaxies, connecting their accretion-driven growth to the stellar masses and disk properties of high-redshift systems. Our results indicate that oscillatory features from inflation can leave measurable imprints on halo abundances and early galaxy properties, providing a testable link between high-energy physics and astrophysical observations with JWST

Galaxies exhibit a tight correlation between their star-formation rate and stellar mass over a wide redshift range known as the star-forming main sequence (SFMS). With JWST, we can now investigate the SFMS at high redshifts down to masses of ~10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, using sensitive star-formation rate tracers such as Hα emission &ndash; which allow us to probe the variability in star formation histories. We present inferences of the SFMS based on 316 Hα-selected galaxies at z~4-5 with log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 6.4 -10.6. These galaxies were identified behind the Abell 2744 lensing cluster with NIRCam grism spectroscopy from the "All the Little Things'' (ALT) survey. At face value, our data suggest a shallow slope of the SFMS (SFR &prop; M<sub>&sext;</sub>^α, with α=0.45). After correcting for the Hα-flux limited nature of our survey using a Bayesian framework, the slope steepens to α= 0.59^+0.10_-0.09, whereas current data on their own are inconclusive on the mass dependence of the scatter. These slopes differ significantly from the slope of ≈1 expected from the observed evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function and from simulations. When fixing the slope to α=1, we find evidence for a decreasing intrinsic scatter with stellar mass (from ≈ 0.5 dex at M<sub>&sext;</sub>=10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> to 0.4 dex at M<sub>&sext;</sub>=10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>). This tension might be explained by a (combination of) luminosity-dependent SFR(Hα) calibration, a population of (mini)-quenched low-mass galaxies, or underestimated dust attenuation in high-mass galaxies. Future deep observations across facilities can quantify these processes, enabling better insights into the variability of star formation histories.

### 99) [2510.18946](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18946v1): The THESAN project: Lyman-alpha emitters as probes of ionized bubble sizes

<p> Meredith Neyer, Aaron Smith, Mark Vogelsberger, Luz Ángela García, Rahul Kannan, Enrico Garaldi, Laura Keating </p>
<p>
We use the THESAN radiation-hydrodynamics simulations to investigate how Lyman-α emitters (LAEs) trace ionized bubble sizes during the Epoch of Reionization. We generate realistic LAE catalogs by combining accurate intrinsic Lyα production and intergalactic transmission with an empirical model for dust absorption and gas outflows. By calibrating to observationally-constrained Lyα luminosity functions, we reproduce the rapid decline in Lyα visibility toward higher redshifts while revealing mild tensions in LAE fractions near the end of reionization. Before the midpoint of reionization, galaxies within larger line-of-sight bubbles (≳ 10 cMpc) have higher observed Lyα luminosity and equivalent width (EW), demonstrating that the evolving LAE fraction provides a practical statistical tracer for bubble size. These correlations weaken as percolation progresses and the IGM becomes increasingly ionized. In LAE selected samples with L_Lyα &gt; 10^41.5 erg s<sup>-1</sup>, Lyα properties correlate with bubble size more strongly than UV magnitude, especially at z ≳ 7. This simulation-based framework maps LAE selections to bubble-size statistics, clarifies biases in more idealized models, and will supply public catalogs to interpret current and forthcoming JWST and narrow-band LAE surveys in terms of the evolving topology of reionization.

Characterizing dust attenuation is crucial for revealing the intrinsic physical properties of galaxies. We present an analysis of dust attenuation in 18 spectroscopically confirmed star-forming main-sequence galaxies at z = 4.4-5.7 observed with JWST/NIRSpec IFU and NIRCam, selected from the ALPINE and CRISTAL ALMA large programs. We fit the emission line fluxes from NIRSpec and the broad-band photometry from NIRCam with Prospector, using both spatially integrated emission and ~0.6 kpc pixel-by-pixel measurements. We derive the stellar-to-nebular dust attenuation ratio (f=E(B-V)_star/E(B-V)_neb) from the SED fits and the Balmer decrement with Hα and Hβ. Although individual galaxies show large scatter, the best-fit value is f = 0.51^+0.04_-0.03, slightly higher than that measured for local starburst galaxies. We find weak correlations of f with galaxy properties, increasing with higher specific star-formation rates, younger stellar ages, and more recent star-formation. For the range of E(B-V)_star = 0.009-0.15 mag for in our sample, assuming f = 1 (often adopted in high-redshift studies) instead of f = 0.51 underestimate line luminosities and ionizing photon production efficiency ξ<sub>ion</sub> by ~3-36&percnt; and ~4-46&percnt;, respectively. We also find that the total stellar masses estimated from spatially-integrated SED fits with a delayed-τ star-formation histories are systematically smaller than the sum of pixel-by-pixel SED fits, with a median offset of ~ 0.26 dex, likely because the integrated fits are biased toward luminous young stellar populations.

We present an analysis of rest-frame optical and far-infrared continuum emission in three luminous submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) at 3.0≲ z≲4.5. The SMGs are spatially resolved down to 400-500 pc (~0.05'') resolution by James Webb Space telescope (JWST) and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations. Despite similarities in their observed far-infrared properties (flux density, infrared luminosity, and effective radius), the three SMGs exhibit heterogeneous morphologies both across wavelengths and among the sources themselves. While two of them (AzTEC-4 and AzTEC-8) show a disk-like structure in optical continuum, AzTEC-1 is dominated by highly concentrated component with the Sérsic index of n=5.4, where its far-infrared continuum emission is clumpy and less concentrated. AzTEC-4, which is confirmed to be at z=4.198, shows a two-arm spiral of dust, but not in the stellar distribution. These three SMGs exemplify that multiple physical mechanisms exist in triggering starbursts in luminous SMGs at high redshift: secular instability in gas disks (AzTEC-4) in addition to possible minor mergers (AzTEC-8), and a combination of the efficient gas supply to the central core induced by a gas-rich major merger and the reformation of cold gas disk (AzTEC-1).

<p>
The `near-far' approach to studying reionization leverages the star formation histories of the Milky Way (MW) or Local Group (LG) galaxies, derived from resolved photometry, to infer the low-mass/faint-end of the stellar mass functions (SMFs) or the ultraviolet luminosity functions (UVLFs) of high-redshift galaxies (z ≳ 6), beyond the current JWST detection limits (M_UV ≳ -15). Previous works considered only intact low-mass galaxies in the MW and LG, neglecting disrupted galaxies such as stellar streams and phase-mixed objects. Using the FIRE-2 simulations, we show that these disrupted galaxies contribute up to ~50&percnt; of the total stellar mass budget of the proto-MW/LG at z =6-9. Including all the progenitors of these disrupted galaxies improves the normalization of the recovered SMFs/UVLFs by factors of ~2-3 and reduces the halo-to-halo variation in the slope by ~20-40&percnt;. This enables robust constraints down to at least the resolution limit of the simulations, near M<sub>&sext;</sub> ~ 10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> or M_UV ~ -10 at z ≳ 6. We also show that `fossil record' reconstructions - which assume each present-day system descends from a single reionization-era progenitor - are sensitive to the stellar mass/UV magnitude thresholds, which introduces bias in the inferred low-mass/faint-end slopes. Additionally, we demonstrate that neglecting disrupted systems underestimates the contribution of galaxies with M_UV ≲ -15 to the reionization-era UV luminosity density. Finally, we estimate that a significant fraction (~50&percnt;) of streams with M<sub>&sext;</sub> ≳ 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z=0 should be detectable from upcoming Rubin Observatory and Roman Space Telescope observations.

### 103) [2510.17956](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17956v1): Using Strong Lensing to Detect Subhalos with Steep Inner Density Profiles

<p> Kassidy E. Kollmann, James W. Nightingale, Mariangela Lisanti, Andrew Robertson, Oren Slone </p>
<p>
The inner region of a subhalo's density distribution is particularly sensitive to dark matter microphysics, with alternative dark matter models leading to both cored and steeply-rising inner density profiles. This work investigates how the lensing signature and detectability of dark matter subhalos in mock HST-, Euclid-, and JWST-like strong lensing observations depends on the subhalo's radial density profile, especially with regards to the inner power-law slope, β. We demonstrate that the minimum-mass subhalo detectable along the Einstein ring of a system is strongly dependent on β. In particular, we show that subhalos with β~ 2.2 can be detected down to masses over an order-of-magnitude lower than their Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) counterparts with β~ 1. Importantly, we find that the detectability of subhalos with steep inner profiles is minimally affected by increasing the complexity of the main lens galaxy's mass model. This is a unique characteristic of these subhalos, as those with NFW or shallower profiles become essentially undetectable when multipole perturbations are added to the lens model. The results of this work highlight how the underlying dark matter physics can significantly impact the expected number of subhalo detections from strong gravitational lensing observations. This is important for testing Cold Dark Matter against alternatives, such as Self-Interacting Dark Matter, which predict the existence of subhalos with diverse inner density profiles.

JWST has revealed a population of red, compact, high-redshift (z~3-10) objects referred to as "Little Red Dots'' (LRDs). These objects exhibit unusual spectral features reminiscent of stellar spectra with blackbody-like SEDs, large hydrogen Balmer breaks, Balmer line absorption, and classical stellar absorption features such as calcium H&K and the calcium triplet. Following the recent suggestion that these may be actively accreting direct-collapse black holes in the process of assembly, i.e. quasi-stars, we present evolutionary models of quasi-stars using our recently released, publicly available MESA-QUEST modeling framework. We compute a grid of models spanning a range of black hole masses and predict the luminosities, temperatures, surface gravities, and lifetimes of these objects. We find that these models lie along a Hayashi track once they hit their "late-stage'' which constitutes the majority of their lives (~ 20~Myr). We present scaling relations for estimating the mass of a quasi-star as a function of the bolometric luminosity, as well as the bolometric luminosity as a function of the effective temperature for the Hayashi track. The short lifetimes in tandem with the observed number density of LRDs imply the possibility that every supermassive black hole was once a quasi-star. We compare synthetic spectra of our quasi-star models to observations of LRDs, and show that these models are broadly capable of reproducing the continuum spectra of observed LRDs. These results indicate that quasi-stars are promising candidates for the origin of supermassive black holes via direct collapse in the early universe.

### 105) [2510.17804](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17804v1): Resolving the dusty star-forming galaxy GN20 at z=4.055 with NOEMA and JWST: A similar distribution of stars, gas and dust despite distinct apparent profiles

We present high-resolution (0.13"-0.23") NOEMA observations of the dust continuum emission at 1.1 mm (rest-frame 220 micron) and JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging of the z=4.055 starburst galaxy GN20. The sensitive NOEMA imaging at 1.6 kpc resolution reveals extended dust emission, ~14 kpc in diameter (r_e~2.5 kpc, b/a=0.5), that is centrally asymmetric and clumpy. The dust emission is as extended as the stellar emission and the molecular gas traced by CO(2-1), with a common center, and is brightest in the strongly-obscured nuclear part of the galaxy. Approximately one-third of the total dust emission emerges from the nucleus and the most prominent clump to the south, and (only) 60% from the central 3.5x1.5 kpc (0.5"-0.2"), implying that the starburst is very extended. The combined JWST and NOEMA morphology suggests GN20 experienced a recent interaction or merger, likely invigorating the starburst. The radial surface brightness profiles of the molecular gas and near-IR stellar emission are similar, while in contrast, the dust emission appears significantly more concentrated. Through self-consistent radiative transfer modeling of the integrated and resolved CO and dust emission, we derive an M_mol=2.9^+0.4_-0.3×10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub> with α_CO=2.8^+0.5_-0.3. We find that the extended dust implies a lower global dust optical depth than previously reported, but a high dust mass of M_dust=5.7^+0.8_-0.6× 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and gas-to-dust ratio of ~50. Furthermore, we show the distinct apparent radial profiles of the gas and dust can be explained purely by radiative transfer effects and the observations are consistent with the gas and dust mass being similarly distributed throughout the starburst. The latter highlights the importance of accounting for radiative transfer effects when comparing molecular gas and dust distributions from different tracers.

<p>
We present the results of James Webb Space Telescope observations of the protostar ST6 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) with the Medium Resolution Spectrograph of the Mid-Infrared Instrument (4.9-27.9 μm). Characterized by one-third to half-solar metallicity and strong UV radiation fields, the environment of the LMC allows us to study the physics and chemistry of star-forming regions under the conditions similar to those at earlier cosmological epochs. We detected five icy complex organic molecules (COMs): methanol (CH_3OH), acetaldehyde (CH_3CHO), ethanol (CH_3CH<sub>2</sub>OH), methyl formate (HCOOCH_3), and acetic acid (CH_3COOH). This is the first conclusive detection of CH_3COOH ice in an astrophysical context, and CH_3CHO, CH_3CH<sub>2</sub>OH, and HCOOCH_3 ices are the first secure detections outside the Galaxy and in a low-metallicity environment. We address the presence of glycolaldehyde (HOCH<sub>2</sub>CHO, a precursor of biomolecules), an isomer of HCOOCH_3 and CH_3COOH, but its detection is inconclusive. ST6's spectrum is also rich in simple ices: H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, CH_4, SO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>CO, HCOOH, OCN^-, HCOO^-, NH_3, and NH_4^+. We obtain the composition and molecular abundances in the icy dust mantles by fitting the spectrum in the 6.8-8.4 μm range with a large sample of laboratory ice spectra using the ENIIGMA fitting tool or the local continuum method. We found differences in the simple and COM ice abundances with respect to H<sub>2</sub>O ice between ST6 and Galactic protostars that likely reflect differences in metallicity and UV flux. More laboratory ice spectra of COMs are needed to better reconstruct the observed infrared spectra of protostars.

We present a statistical study of spatially resolved chemical enrichment in 18 main-sequence galaxies at z=4&ndash;6, observed with \jwst/NIRSpec IFU as part of the ALPINE-CRISTAL-\jwst survey. Performing an optimized reduction and calibration procedure, including local background subtraction, light-leakage masking, stripe removal, and astrometry refinement, we achieve robust emission-line mapping on kiloparsec scales. Although line-ratio distributions vary across galaxies in our sample, we generally find mild central enhancements in [O sciii]/Hβ, [O scii]/[O sciii], [S scii]_6732/[S scii]_6718, Hα/Hβ, and L_Hα/L_UV, consistent with elevated electron density, dust obscuration, and bursty star formation accompanied by reduced metallicity and ionization parameter. These features point to inside-out growth fueled by recent inflows of pristine gas. Nevertheless, the median metallicity gradient is nearly flat over a few kpc scale, Δlog(O/H) = 0.02 ± 0.01 dex kpc^-1, implying efficient chemical mixing through inflows, outflows, and mergers. From pixel-by-pixel stellar and emission-line characterizations, we further investigate the resolved Fundamental Metallicity Relation (rFMR). Metallicity is described by a fundamental plane with stellar mass and SFR surface densities, but with a stronger dependence on Σ_SFR than seen in local galaxies. Our results indicate that the regulatory processes linking star formation, gas flows, and metal enrichment were already vigorous ~1 Gyr after the Big Bang, producing the nearly flat metallicity gradient and a stronger coupling between star formation and metallicity than observed in evolved systems in the local universe.

To fully characterize the formation and evolution of galaxies, we need to observe their stars, gas, and dust on resolved spatial scales. We present the ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST survey, which combines kpc-resolved imaging and spectroscopy from HST, JWST, and ALMA for 18 representative main-sequence galaxies at z=4-6 and log(M/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &gt; 9.5 to study their star formation, chemical properties, and extended gas reservoirs. The co-spatial measurements resolving the ionized gas, molecular gas, stars, and dust on 1-2 kpc scales make this a unique benchmark sample for the study of galaxy formation and evolution at z~5, connecting the Epoch of Reionization with the cosmic noon. In this paper, we outline the survey goals and sample selection, and present a summary of the available data for the 18 galaxies. In addition, we measure spatially integrated quantities (such as global gas metallicity), test different star formation rate indicators, and quantify the presence of Hα halos. Our targeted galaxies are relatively metal rich (10-70% solar), complementary to JWST samples at lower stellar mass, and there is broad agreement between different star formation indicators. One galaxy has the signature of an active galactic nuclei (AGN) based on its emission line ratios. Six show broad Hα emission suggesting type 1 AGN candidates. We conclude with an outlook on the exciting science that will be pursued with this unique sample in forthcoming papers.

We present the stellar mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and mass-metallicity-star formation relation ("fundamental metallicity relation"; FMR) of 18 massive (log(M/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 9.5-11) main-sequence galaxies at z~5 from the ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST sample. This sample complements recent studies by JWST at up to two orders of magnitude lower stellar masses. The metallicities are derived using strong optical lines, and verified by temperature-based oxygen abundance measurements for five galaxies for which faint auroral lines are detected. We find little evolution at the massive end of the MZR between z~5 and cosmic noon at z~2, suggesting a fast metal enrichment at early times. The FMR at z=5 exhibits a 5x larger scatter (preferentially to lower metallicities) compared the local FMR relation. This scatter can be explained by a bursty star formation and the direct build-up of metals in early galaxies as well as differences in age and outflow efficiencies. Capitalizing on all available samples, we find that the observed MZR and FMR over three orders of stellar mass is generally in good agreement with results from cosmological simulation, although some underestimate the metal enrichment at low stellar masses. This may be due to too efficient metal-rich outflows. We show that the ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST galaxies likely joined the current FMR at z~10 and will evolve into massive (log(M/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)~11.4) galaxies with super-solar metallicities by z=0.

### 110) [2510.15024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15024v1): An Investigation into the Low-Mass Fundamental Metallicity Relation in the Local and High-z Universe

<p> Isaac H. Laseter, Michael V. Maseda, Andrew J. Bunker, Alex J. Cameron, Mirko Curti, Charlotte Simmonds </p>
<p>
Recent JWST/NIRSpec observations have revealed high-z star-forming galaxies depart from the Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR), yet the z = 0 FMR has not been well-characterized in the low-mass regime (log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≲ 9) for an appropriate comparison of low- and high-z systems. We attempt to rectify this limitation through a meta-analysis, providing a local, observational comparison for future high-z FMR studies. We analyzed common FMR fitting methods for ~ 700 [OIII]λ4363 emitters with log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≲ 9 at z ~ 0. We find no evidence of the FMR below log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≲ 9 through any method, suggesting that slowly-evolving, quasi-steady state gas reservoirs are not yet established. We simultaneously find a weak positive correlation between metallicity and star formation, and that these systems are gas-rich with substantial diversity in effective yields (y_eff) spanning ~ 3~dex. We demonstrate increasing y_eff correlates with decreasing FMR offsets, which in the context of the analytical and non-equilibrium gas models of Dalcanton et al. (2007), indicates a scenario where star formation bursts rapidly return and eject metals from the ISM before subsequent gas-balancing. Pristine infall diluting the ISM metal-content cannot lead to the y_eff diversity we measure, and thus is not the primary process behind FMR deviations. Our results suggest low-M<sub>&sext;</sub> systems, regardless of redshift, depart from a steady-state gas reservoir shaping the canonical FMR, in which metallicity variations are primarily driven by star formation and enriched outflows. With this characterization, we demonstrate z ≳ 3 [OIII]λ4363 systems are indeed more metal-poor than z ~ 0 counterparts (Δ12+log(O/H) = 0.3~dex) at fixed M<sub>&sext;</sub>.

<p>
JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopy enables dynamical mass measurements for typical star-forming galaxies only a billion years after the Big Bang. We model the Hα morpho-kinematics of 163 galaxies at redshift z≈4-6 from FRESCO and CONGRESS (with JADES imaging), using the ttgeko code, and infer rotational velocities and dispersions within r_e. Our sample spans log M<sub>&sext;</sub>≈7-10 and log M_dyn≈9-11. Gas masses are estimated via scaling relations, yielding baryonic masses and dark-matter (DM) fractions f_DM(r&lt;r_e) within the Hα half-light radius. We find high median fractions of &langle; f_gas&rangle;=0.77 and &langle; f_DM&rangle;=0.73, where f_gas is measured with respect to the baryonic mass and f_DM with respect to the DM+baryonic mass. About two-thirds of systems are DM-dominated within r_e~0.5-1 kpc. Both f_gas and f_DM decrease with stellar mass, consistent with simulations. The stellar Tully-Fisher relation shows a tentative offset to higher v_circ at fixed M<sub>&sext;</sub> and substantial intrinsic scatter, suggesting that the relation is only beginning to emerge at z~5. We measure a negative correlation between f_DM and baryonic surface density Σ_bar, weaker but broadly consistent with trends at cosmic noon and at z~0. Qualitatively comparing with modified NFW profiles coupled to an empirical stellar-to-halo mass relation suggests that the lowest f_DM (≲0.4) require cored inner DM profiles, while the highest fractions favour cuspier profiles, potentially reflecting adiabatic contraction. Overall, the elevated f_gas and f_DM at z≳4 are compatible with progenitors of baryon-dominated systems at z~2 and naturally anticipate overmassive black holes at fixed M<sub>&sext;</sub>.

### 112) [2510.14613](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14613v1): The multimessenger view of Pulsar Timing Array black holes with the Horizon-AGN simulation

<p> Hippolyte Quelquejay Leclere, Kunyang Li, Marta Volonteri, Stanislav Babak, Ricarda S. Beckmann, Yohan Dubois, Clotilde Laigle, Natalie A. Webb </p>
<p>
We use the Horizon-AGN cosmological simulation to study the properties of supermassive black hole binaries (MBHBs) contributing most to the gravitational wave background (GWB) signal expected in the pulsar timing array (PTA) band. We develop a pipeline to generate realistic populations of MBHBs, allowing us to estimate both the characteristic strain and GWB time series observable by PTA experiments. We identify potential continuous wave (CW) candidates standing above the background noise, using toy PTA sensitivities representing the current EPTA and future SKA. We estimate the probability of detecting at least one CW with signal-to-noise ratio &gt;3 to be 4&percnt; (20&percnt;) for EPTA (SKA)-like sensitivities, assuming a 10-year baseline. We find the GWB to be dominated by hundreds to thousands of binaries at redshifts in the range 0.05-1, with chirp masses of 10^8.5-10^9.5  M<sub>&odot;</sub>, hosted mainly in quiescent massive galaxies residing in halos of mass ~ 10^13  M<sub>&odot;</sub>. CW candidates have larger masses, lower redshifts and are found in even more massive halos, typical of galaxy groups and clusters. The majority of these systems would appear as AGN rather than quasars, because of their low Eddington ratios. Nevertheless, CW candidates with f_Edd&gt;10^-3 can still outshine their hosts, particularly in radio and X-ray bands, suggesting them as the most promising route for identification. Our findings imply that optical and near-infrared searches based on light curve variability are challenging and biased toward more luminous systems. Finally, we highlight important caveats in the common method used to compare PTA observations with theoretical models. We find that GWB spectral inferences used by PTAs could be biased toward shallower slopes and higher amplitudes at f=1/yr, thereby reducing the apparent tension between astrophysical expectations and PTA observations.

<p>
Metal absorbers represent a powerful probe of galaxy feedback and reionization, as highlighted by both observational and theoretical results showing an increased abundance of low-ionised metal species at higher redshifts. The origin of such absorbers is currently largely unknown because of the low number of galaxy counterparts detected, suggesting that they might be surrounded by low-mass faint sources that fall below the detection threshold of current instruments. We use the THESAN-ZOOM radiation hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the connection between properties of neutral oxygen (OI) absorbers and galaxies within the redshift range z = 5 - 8. We find that the circumgalactic medium of galaxies becomes progressively ionised with cosmic time, leading to a decrease of ≈ 0.2 in the covering fraction of neutral oxygen, while the total oxygen covering fraction remains constant. The observable absorbers (N_OI ≳ 10^13 cm<sup>2</sup>) are not confined to haloes: at z ≥ 5 the majority (≳ 60&percnt;) arise beyond R_vir, and including these systems is essential to reproduce the observed increase in absorber incidence with redshift. The simulated absorbers preferentially reside in overdensities rich in low-mass galaxies (M<sub>&sext;</sub> ≤ 10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), explaining the scarcity of detected counterparts, while not excluding the possibility of nearby star-forming sources (≥ 5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1) similar to those suggested by the latest ALMA observations and, at larger distances, by the JWST. These results establish OI absorbers as sensitive tracers of the evolving ionisation structure around faint galaxies to be probed by forthcoming deep spectroscopic surveys.

### 114) [2510.13952](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13952v1): Modelling the nebular emission of galaxies across cosmic time with COLT

<p> William McClymont, Aaron Smith, Sandro Tacchella </p>
<p>
Extragalactic nebular emission has long been a workhorse probe of the processes driving galaxy evolution, but the richness of JWST spectroscopy has shifted the bottleneck from data acquisition to physical interpretation and modelling. In this context, we present a major update to the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code COLT to facilitate self-consistent modelling of nebular line and continuum emission from simulated galaxies. We introduce a new thermal equilibrium solver that iteratively couples to the existing ionization solver and radiation field to compute effective gas temperatures by accurately balancing photoionization heating, radiative and dielectronic recombination, collisional ionization, charge exchange, metal and primordial line cooling, free-free emission, and Compton scattering. To prevent over-cooling where non-equilibrium hydrodynamics dominate, we introduce a Courant-limited cooling prescription tied to each cell's sound-crossing time, preserving temperatures in the diffuse halo while allowing physically motivated cooling in the interstellar medium (ISM). Applied to an isolated local galaxy simulation, the equilibrium solver reshapes the ISM phase space by reducing spuriously excessive lukewarm (T=10^3-10^4K) gas and better resolving warm ionized and cold neutral phases, while leaving the CGM largely intact. We further implement a level population solver based on modern atomic data, enabling accurate cooling and emissivities for a large library of UV to infrared metal lines, together with newly implemented primordial nebular continuum emission from free-free, free-bound, and two-photon processes. Finally, by applying COLT to the high-redshift THESAN-ZOOM simulations, we reproduce observed emission-line ratios, establishing COLT as a robust framework for forward modelling nebular emission across cosmic time.

<p>
We investigate the stellar shape and size-mass relationship of X-ray selected Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) host galaxies using the high-angular resolution and deep sensitivity in the near-infrared of the COSMOS-Web JWST survey field. We present the rest-frame 1-μm size, stellar mass, Sersic index, axis-ratio, Gini-M_20 parameters of 690 moderate luminosity AGNs between redshift 0-3 and with stellar mass log M_s~ 10.75. We find that AGN host galaxies have an effective radius of 1-5 kpc, which is between star-forming (SFG) and quiescent galaxies (QGs) of the same stellar mass. AGN hosts have similar size-mass trends as SFG and QGs, being smaller at higher redshift for the same stellar mass. The slope of the size-mass relationship of AGN host galaxies is steeper than that of star-forming galaxies. Their rest-frame 1μm stellar morphology indicates a significant spheroidal component. We observed a low merger fraction (6%) in our sample as well as substructures similar to disks, bars, and spiral arms in the residual images, which are in tension with evolutionary pathways that require major mergers. However, it may also be due to the different timescales between mergers and AGN activity.

### 116) [2510.13629](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13629v1): The Supernova 1987A system and its recent evolution - a review

<p> Michael J. Barlow </p>
<p>
Supernova 1987A was the closest supernova event to be observed in nearly 400 years. The outflowing ejecta from the explosion continues to interact with extended circumstellar material and with the equatorial ring (ER) in the triple ring system, while observations of the system have continued across the whole electromagnetic spectrum. This review mainly focuses on works published over the past ten years on Supernova 1987A and its remnant. These include (a) submillimetre, infrared and X-ray studies of molecules, ions and dust in the ejecta, and (b) infrared, optical and X-ray studies of dust and ionized gas in the ER and in the surrounding circumstellar medium, including their time evolution as the ER is shocked and eroded by the impact of high velocity ejecta. Since 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope has become available for high angular resolution infrared observations of Supernova 1987A and has made significant contributions to both (a) and (b) above. Its discovery of redshifted narrow-line emission from multiple ion species located at the centre of the ejecta strongly requires the presence there of either a cooling hot neutron star, or a pulsar wind nebula, to power the emission.

<p>
We report the discovery of two z ~ 12 galaxy candidates with unusually red UV slopes (betaUV ≳ -1.5), and probe the origin of such colors at cosmic dawn. From Prospector fits to the UNCOVER/MegaScience dataset &ndash; deep JWST/NIRCam imaging of Abell 2744 in 20 broad- and medium-bands &ndash; we identify several new z &gt; 10 galaxies. Medium-band data improve redshift estimates, revealing two lensed (mu ~ 3.3) z ~ 12 galaxies in a close pair with beta_UV ≳ -1.5 at an UV absolute magnitude of M_UV ~ -19 mag, lying away from typical scatter on previously known MUV-betaUV relations. SED fitting with Prospector, Bagpipes, and EAZY support their high-z nature, with probability of low-z interlopers of p(z &lt; 7) &lt; 10%. The potential low-z interlopers are z ~ 3 quiescent galaxies (QGs), but unexpected to be detected at the given field of view unless z ~ 3 QG stellar mass function has a strong turn up at log Mstar/M<sub>&odot;</sub> ~ 9. Unlike typical blue high-redshift candidates (beta_UV ≲ -2.0), these red slopes require either dust or nebular continuum reddening. The dust scenario implies Av ~ 0.8 mag, which is larger than theoretical predictions, but is consistent with a dust-to-stellar mass ratio (log M_dust/M_star ~ -3). The nebular scenario demands dense gas (log nH /cm^3 ~ 4.0) around hot stars (log Teff [K] ~ 4.9). Spectroscopic follow-up is essential to determine their true nature and reveal missing galaxies at the cosmic dawn.

<p>
Since the launch of JWST, the sample size of reionization-era Lyman-alpha-emitters (LAEs) has been steadily growing; yet inferences about the neutral hydrogen fraction in the intergalactic medium exhibit increasing variance at redshift z ~ 7, possibly indicating significant field-to-field fluctuations in the progression of cosmic reionization. In this paper, we present new JWST/NIRSpec and Keck/LRIS spectra of nine LAEs in the redshift z ~ 7 protocluster, LAGER-z7OD1. Measurements of Lyman-alpha-transmission and Lyman-alpha velocity offset along multiple sightlines map the Lyman-alpha damping wing optical depth across the galaxy overdensity. In the standard context of inside-out ionization, we estimate radii of ionized bubbles (R(min) = 0.07 - 0.69 Mpc) based on the distance from each LAE to the first neutral patch along the sightline. The resulting 3D topology reveals three distinct sub-clusters where the ionized bubbles are approaching overlap. Five of the nine LAEs plausibly ionized their bubbles, a few bursts of star formation and a modest escape fraction are sufficient. We demonstrate, however, that the actual ionized volumes are likely larger, at least R(ism) = 0.42 - 1.29 Mpc, based on an empirical model for interstellar attenuation of Lyman-alpha. Modeling galactic attenuation of Lyman-alpha significantly increases the inferred intergalactic transmission (thus enlarging the ionized pathlength). The errorbars on the reddening correction allow fully overlapping bubbles, and our results are consistent with accelerated reionization in the protocluster.

### 119) [2510.12594](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12594v1): A constant upper luminosity limit of cool supergiant stars down to the extremely low metallicity of I Zw 18

<p> Abel Schootemeijer, Ylva Götberg, Norbert Langer, Giacomo Bortolini, Alec S. Hirschauer, Lee Patrick </p>
<p>
Stellar wind mass loss is often assumed to depend on their metallicity Z. Therefore, evolutionary models of massive stars at lower Z are able to retain more of their H-rich layers and evolve into brighter cool supergiants (cool SGs; T_eff &lt; 7 kK). Surprisingly, in galaxies in the range 0.2 ≲ Z / Z<sub>&odot;</sub> ≲ 1.5 previous studies did not find a Z-dependence of the upper luminosity limit L_max of cool SGs. Here, we study four extra galaxies with HST and JWST. Observations of the extremely low-Z dwarf galaxy I Zw 18 from JWST allow us to go down to Z / Z<sub>&odot;</sub> ≈ 1/40. For cool SGs in all studied galaxies including I Zw 18, we find a constant L_max ≈ 10^5.6L<sub>&odot;</sub>, similar to literature results for 0.2 ≲ Z / Z<sub>&odot;</sub> ≲ 1.5. In I Zw 18 and the other studied galaxies, the presence of Wolf-Rayet stars has been claimed. Although we cannot rule out that some of them become intermediate-temperature objects, this paints a picture in which evolved stars with L&gt;10^5.6L<sub>&odot;</sub> burn He as hot He-rich stars down to extremely low Z. We argue that Z-independent late-phase mass loss would be the most likely mechanism responsible. Regardless of the exact stripping mechanism, for the Early Universe our results imply a limitation on black hole masses and a contribution of stars born with M≳ 30M<sub>&odot;</sub> to its surprisingly strong nitrogen enrichment. We propose a scenario in which single stars at low Z emit sufficiently hard ionizing radiation to produce lines of He II and C IV. In this scenario, late-phase Z-independent mass loss produces hot He-rich stars. Due to the well-understood Z-dependence of radiation-driven winds of hot stars, a window of opportunity would open below 0.2Z<sub>&odot;</sub>, where self-stripped He-rich stars can exist without dense WR winds that absorb hard ionizing radiation.

### 120) [2510.12572](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12572v1): JWST and Keck Observations of the Off-Nuclear TDE AT 2024tvd: A Massive Nuclear Star Cluster and Minor-Merger Origin for its Black Hole

<p>
We present JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam observations of the first optically selected off-nuclear tidal disruption event (TDE), AT 2024tvd, along with Keck/KCWI integral field unit spectroscopy. The spectra show broad H and He emission lines that are characteristic of a TDE. Stellar kinematics show smooth host-galaxy morphology and ordered bulge rotation, with no evidence of disturbances in velocity, dispersion, age or metallicity space. We construct the first quasi-simultaneous spectral-energy distribution (SED) from X-rays to infrared for a TDE and decompose it into three components: the TDE accretion flow, an unresolved nuclear star cluster (NSC), and heated dust emission. The accretion component implies a black hole mass of log(M<sub>&bull;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 5.50± 0.04, an instantaneous super-Eddington accretion rate of log (M&#775;/M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1) = -1.22 ± 0.04, and an outer disk photosphere radius of log(r_out/r_g) = 3.8 ± 0.1. The dust emission is well described by a blackbody with T_dust = 873± 15 K and peak luminosity log (L_dust/erg s<sup>-1</sup>) = 40.80± 0.01, consistent with a dust echo near the sublimation radius. The SED is best fit when including additional stellar emission above the galaxy background at the TDE location, corresponding to log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 7.97^+0.16_-0.26, which we interpret as a massive NSC or an ultra-compact dwarf galaxy. These results support a minor-merger origin for the MBH responsible for the TDE over scenarios involving gravitational recoil or dynamical ejection from the nucleus.

### 121) [2510.12488](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12488v1): Faint galaxies in the Zone of Avoidance revealed by JWST/NIRCam

<p>
The Zone of Avoidance (ZoA) remains one of the last frontiers in constructing a comprehensive three-dimensional map of the Universe. Galactic extinction, stellar crowding, and confusion noise have historically limited the detection of background galaxies in these regions, with implications for large-scale structure and cosmological measurements. We assess the capability of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) to detect extragalactic sources in a heavily contaminated region of the Milky Way. We analyzed JWST/NIRCam wide-filter images of NGC 3324 with a customized implementation of SExtractor v2.28. Sources were detected in the F444W band, cross-matched with F090W and F200W, and validated against recent DAOPHOT point spread function (PSF) photometry. A refined sample was obtained through full width at half maximum (FWHM) - signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) criteria and visual inspection. We identified 102 galaxies across the JWST/NIRCam field of view. The magnitude (F444W) distribution is bimodal, with about 10% brighter than m_F444W &lt; 15 mag and about 60% in the range 17 &lt; m_F444W &lt; 19 mag. Typical sizes are FWHM ~6.5 arcsec, from compact to extended systems with isophotal areas up to ~2000 pixels (~7.9 arcsec^2). Morphologies span from compact to spiral and lenticular systems, including a compact group at the eastern edge of the field. We also report the detection of "transnebular galaxies", visible through the most opaque regions of the molecular cloud. These results demonstrate the potential of JWST/NIRCam to probe extragalactic sources through highly obscured Galactic regions, opening new avenues for mapping large-scale structures across the ZoA.

### 122) [2510.12475](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12475v1): Jets in Low-Mass Protostars

<p> Somnath Dutta </p>
<p>
Jets and outflows are key components of low-mass star formation, regulating accretion and shaping the surrounding molecular clouds. These flows, traced by molecular species at (sub)millimeter wavelengths (e.g., CO, SiO, SO, H<sub>2</sub>CO, and CH_3OH) and by atomic, ionized, and molecular lines in the infrared (e.g., H<sub>2</sub>, [Fe II], [S I]), originate from protostellar accretion disks deeply embedded within dusty envelopes. Jets play a crucial role in removing angular momentum from the disk, thereby enabling continued mass accretion, while directly preserving a record of the protostar's outflow history and potentially providing indirect insights into its accretion history. Recent advances in high-resolution, high-sensitivity observations, particularly with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in the infrared and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at (sub)millimeter wavelengths, have revolutionized studies of protostellar jets and outflows. These instruments provide complementary views of warm, shock-excited gas and cold molecular component of the jet-outflow system. In this review, we discuss the current status of observational studies that reveal detailed structures, kinematics, and chemical compositions of protostellar jets and outflows. Recent analyses of mass-loss rates, velocities, rotation, molecular abundances, and magnetic fields provide critical insights into jet launching mechanisms, disk evolution, and the potential formation of binary systems and planets. The synergy of JWST's infrared sensitivity and ALMA's high-resolution imaging is advancing our understanding of jets and outflows. Future large-scale, high-resolution surveys with these facilities are expected to drive major breakthroughs in outflow research.

<p> Tiancheng Yang, Tao Wang, Ke Xu, Hanwen Sun, Luwenjia Zhou, Lizhi Xie, Gabriella De Lucia, Claudia del P. Lagos, Kai Wang, Fabio Fontanot, Yuxuan Wu, Shiying Lu, Longyue Chen, Michaela Hirschmann </p>
<p>
JWST observations reveal numerous quiescent galaxies (QGs) at high redshift (z ~ 4-8), challenging models of early galaxy formation and quenching. Accurate number density estimates are crucial for comparison with theory but remain uncertain. We systematically study QGs at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 8 using a mass-complete sample from the JWST/PRIMER survey with deep NIRCam and MIRI imaging. The MIRI data, probing rest-frame near-infrared at z ~ 3-8, are vital for robust stellar mass measurement and QG identification. We find that nearly all photometrically selected, point-like QG candidates located in the UVJ QG region are actually "Little Red Dots", for which the UVJ colors were wrongly estimated due to inaccurate photometric redshift estimation. MIRI reduces significantly contamination to high-mass QGs from star-forming galaxies, yielding lower number densities than previous studies. The evolution of QG number density is strongly mass-dependent. The density of high-mass QGs (log (M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &gt; 10.3) decreases rapidly from n = 1×10^-5~Mpc^-3 at z=3-4 to n=2×10^-6~Mpc^-3 at z = 4-5, becoming negligible (n ≲ 10^-6~Mpc^-3 ) at z &gt; 5. Conversely, low-mass QGs (9&lt;log (M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;10.3) maintain a nearly constant number density (n~3×10^-6~Mpc^-3) across z = 4-8. This suggests low-mass QGs at z &gt; 4 are likely temporarily quenched, akin to mini-quenched galaxies. Comparison with major hydrodynamical and semi-analytical models shows most underestimate high-mass QG densities at z&gt;4 and fail to reproduce the constant low-mass QG density at z&gt;5.

<p>
We present ionizing photon production efficiencies (ξ<sub>ion</sub>) for 63 z=1.5-6.9 star-forming galaxies using precise nebular dust attenuation corrections from the JWST/AURORA survey. A subset of objects within AURORA have individually-determined nebular dust attenuation curves, which vary significantly in shape and normalization, resulting in reduced systematic uncertainty when constraining the total attenuation of Hα luminosity, and thus the intrinsic ionizing output within our sample. We find evidence for positive correlations between ξ<sub>ion</sub> and redshift, equivalent width of [OIII]λ5007, and O32=[OIII]λ5007/[OII]λ3726,3729, and negative correlations between ξ<sub>ion</sub> and stellar attenuation, UV luminosity (L_UV), stellar mass, and direct-method metallicity. We test alternate dust prescriptions within this sample, and find that the total attenuation is lower when using the commonly-assumed Galactic extinction curve or when assuming that stellar attenuation is equal to nebular attenuation. We also find that assuming either of these alternate dust prescriptions can change the slope of relationships between ξ<sub>ion</sub> and galaxy property, notably inducing a flat trend between ξ<sub>ion</sub> and L_UV within AURORA. While the novel nebular dust curves derived from AURORA spectroscopy reveal obscured ionizing photon production within star-forming galaxies at these redshifts, a more complete understanding of stellar attenuation is required to fully reduce dust systematics on ξ<sub>ion</sub> for inclusion in reionization models.

<p>
Galaxy mergers play an important role in many aspects of galaxy evolution, therefore, more accurate merger identifications are paramount for achieving a complete understanding of galaxy evolution. As we enter the era of very large imaging surveys, we are able to observe mergers extending to even lower masses and higher redshifts. Despite low-mass galaxies being more common, many previous merger identification methods were mostly calibrated for high-mass, local galaxies, which are easier to identify. To prepare for upcoming surveys, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) using mock itHST CANDELS images at z ~ 1 created from the IllustrisTNG50 cosmological simulation. We successfully identify galaxy mergers between a wide range of galaxies (10^8M<sub>&odot;</sub> &lt; M<sub>&sext;</sub> &lt; 10^12.5M<sub>&odot;</sub>, and μ&gt;1:10), achieving overall accuracy, purity, and completeness of ~73&percnt;. We show, for the first time, that a CNN trained on this diverse set of galaxies is capable of identifying both major and minor mergers, early and late stage mergers, as well as nonmerging galaxies, similar to that of networks trained at lower redshifts and/or higher masses (with accuracies ranging between 66-80&percnt;) for the first time. We discuss the inherent limits of galaxy merger identification due to orientation angle and explore the confounding variables, such as star formation, to consider when applying to real data. This network enables the exploration of the impact of previously overlooked mergers of high mass ratio and low stellar masses on galaxy evolution in CANDELS, and can be expanded to surveys from itJWST, Rubin, itRoman, and itEuclid.

<p>
Strong Lyα emission observed from galaxies when the Universe is expected to be highly neutral is thought to trace large ionized regions that facilitate the transmission of Lyα through the IGM. In this work, we use deep JWST Lyα spectroscopy to constrain the size of a candidate ionized bubble at z~8.7 in the EGS field, with a potential radius of R_b=2 physical Mpc (pMpc) or larger. We measure a photometric galaxy density and find that the volume is a factor of ~2.5-3.6 overdense, suggesting that there may be a large population of galaxies capable of creating an R_b~2 pMpc bubble. Then, we infer the Lyα transmission through the IGM for galaxies in the EGS volume using our deep spectroscopy, finding T_IGM=0.26_-0.14^+0.25. This transmission is consistent with the average at z~9 and is mildly inconsistent with the transmission expected for an R_b~2 pMpc bubble (T_IGM, 2pMpc=0.53-0.63), implying that such a large bubble is unlikely to be present. However, the photometric galaxy density in the EGS field is larger than in several other deep fields. This overdensity and the moderate Lyα transmission may be consistent with smaller, R_b~0.5-1 pMpc bubbles in EGS. This additionally motivates the need for future wider area Lyα spectroscopy in EGS and other fields to obtain a more representative understanding of the sizes of ionized bubbles in the early stages of reionization, and the properties of the galaxies that create them.

<p>
Rest-frame optical observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered a population of massive galaxies, exceeding 10^10 solar masses, present less than a billion years after the Big Bang. The large stellar masses of these galaxies require an efficient conversion of baryons into stars, which may exceed theoretical expectations. However, the formation process of massive galaxies so early in the Universe's history is perplexing, as observations provide limited information to constrain their evolutionary pathways. Here, we present multi-wavelength observations of a galaxy complex consisting of at least five galaxies within a ~10 kpc region, referred to as the \quintet, using JWST and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. This system, located in the core of a galaxy protocluster at approximately 650 million years after the Big Bang, reveals the detailed physical processes involved in the formation of massive galaxies. These processes include a dynamic cycles of merger induced gas stripping, leading the temporal termination of star formation, and recycling of the stripped gas, with subsequent enhancement of star formation in other galaxies of the system, which is expected to evolve into massive galaxies that host more than 10^10 solar masses of stars. The new observations represent the first comprehensive evidence of a massive galaxy formation through gas-rich, multiple-galaxy mergers induced by a dense protocluster environment in the 650 Myrs after the Big Bang. Our results suggest that the protocluster core is indeed one of the main drivers of efficient galaxy formation and rapid evolution in the early Universe, as predicted by theoretical studies.

Terrazas, Rainer Weinberger </p>
<p>
We present the Blue Jay survey, a Cycle-1 JWST program aimed at studying the stellar and gas content of galaxies at Cosmic Noon. The survey consists of deep spectroscopy for 153 targets observed over two pointings in the COSMOS field using the NIRSpec micro-shutter assembly (MSA). We employ the three medium-resolution gratings G140M, G235M, and G395M, with exposure times of 13 hours, 3.2 hours, and 1.6 hours, respectively. We thus obtain full coverage of the 1-5 micron range, corresponding to the entire rest-frame optical wavelength range. The sample is carefully selected to provide a census of galaxies over the redshift range 1.7 &lt; z &lt; 3.5 above a redshift-dependent minimum stellar mass that ranges from 10^8.7 M<sub>&odot;</sub> to 10^9.3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>.The Blue Jay sample is representative of the entire galaxy population at these redshifts, without strong biases in color, star formation rate, or other properties. The sizes of massive galaxies at these redshifts are comparable to the NIRSpec shutters, which requires custom strategies for designing and reducing the observations. Since the standard A-B nod subtraction leads to flux self-subtraction, we construct a master background from empty shutters and subtract it from each of the science spectra. This, in turn, allows for the use of shorter slitlets consisting of only two shutters per galaxy instead of the usual three, with a substantial increase in the multiplexing of the NIRSpec MSA. We measure multi-band photometry using archival JWST and HST observations in two different ways: in a large elliptical aperture encompassing the entire source and from the exact area in the sky where the NIRSpec 1D spectrum is extracted. This enables self-consistent fits of spectroscopic and photometric data. The Blue Jay dataset, which we publicly release, represents the ideal sample for studying the stellar populations, neutral gas, and ionized gas in Cosmic Noon galaxies.

### 129) [2510.11772](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11772v2): MESA-QUEST: Tracing the formation of direct collapse black hole seeds via quasi-stars

<p>
The origin of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed at redshifts z≥ 9 remains one of the most challenging open questions in astrophysics. Their rapid emergence suggests that massive "heavy seeds'' must have formed early, possibly through the direct collapse of pristine gas clouds in the first galaxies. We present MESA-QUEST, a new framework built upon the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code, designed to model the structure and evolution of quasi-stars &ndash; massive, radiation-supported envelopes hosting accreting black holes at their cores &ndash; believed to be the progenitors of direct-collapse black hole (DCBH) seeds. Our implementation introduces flexible boundary conditions representing both Bondi accretion and saturated-convection regimes, and explores the impact of several stellar wind and mass-loss prescriptions, including Reimers, Dutch, and super-Eddington radiation-driven winds. We find that quasi-stars can grow central black holes to ≥ 10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> under favorable conditions, with saturated-convection models yielding BH-to-total mass ratios up to 0.55M_* &ndash; five times higher than Bondi-limited cases. However, strong radiation-driven winds can dramatically curtail growth, potentially quenching heavy-seed formation unless balanced by sustained envelope accretion. Our results delineate the physical limits under which quasi-stars can remain stable and produce heavy seeds capable of evolving into the earliest SMBHs detected by JWST and Chandra. Future extensions will incorporate rotation, magnetic fields, and GR-radiation hydrodynamics to refine accretion physics and constrain the viability of the quasi-star pathway for early SMBH formation.

### 130) [2510.11702](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11702v3): The Sunburst Arc with JWST. IV. The importance of interaction, turbulence, and feedback for Lyman-continuum escape

<p>
At present, the best opportunity for detailed Lyman Continuum escape studies is in gravitationally lensed galaxies at z &gt;~ 2. Only one such galaxy currently exists in the literature with sufficient spatial magnification: The Sunburst Arc at redshift z = 2.37. Here, we present rest-frame optical JWST NIRSpec integral field observations of the Sunburst Arc that cover a large fraction of the source plane. From this dataset, we generate precise maps of ISM kinematics, dust geometry, ionization, and chemical enrichment. We extract a stacked spectrum of five gravitationally lensed images of the Lyman-Continuum leaking cluster, as well as an magnification-corrected, integrated spectrum of most of the galaxy, enabling a direct comparison to other LyC leakers in the literature. We find that the galaxy rotates but also shows strong, possibly dominant, signatures of turbulence, which are indicative of recent or ongoing major interaction. The cluster that leaks ionizing photons shows little variation in kinematics or dust coverage, but dramatically elevated ionization, indicating that photoionization is the predominant mechanism that creates paths for LyC escape. We conjecture that tidal stripping of H I gas due to an interaction could have removed a large portion of the neutral ISM around the LyC emitting cluster, making it easier for the cluster to completely ionize the rest.

<p>
We present JWST/NIRSpec dense-shutter spectroscopy (DSS). This novel observing strategy with the NIRSpec micro-shutter assembly (MSA) deliberately permits a high number of controlled spectral overlaps to reach extreme multiplex while retaining the low background of slit spectroscopy. In a single configuration over the JADES Origins Field we opened shutters on all faint (F444W&lt;30 mag) z<sub>phot</sub>&gt;3 candidates in the MSA, prioritising emission-line science and rejecting only bright continuum sources. Using 33.6 and 35.8 ks on-source in G235M and G395M, we observed a single mask with ~850 sources, obtaining secure spectroscopic redshifts for ~540 galaxies over 2.5&lt;z&lt;8.9. The per-configuration target density in DSS mode is 4-5x higher than standard no- and low-overlap MSA strategies (&lt;200 sources), with no loss in redshift precision or accuracy. Line-flux sensitivities are 30 percent lower at fixed exposure time, matching the expected increase in background noise, but the gain in survey speed is 5x in our setup, more than justifying the penalty. The measured line sensitivity exceeds NIRCam WFSS by a minimum factor of ~5 (i.e. ~25 in exposure time) at λ~4 μm, demonstrating that controlled overlap is a compelling method to gain deep, wide-band spectra for large samples. Crucially, we envisage the MSA could deliver even higher target allocation densities than what used here. We derive Balmer-line based SFRs, gas-phase metallicities (including a large sample suitable for strong-line calibrations), and identify rare sources (mini-quenched systems and broad-line AGN). This approach is immediately applicable wherever deep imaging enables robust pre-selection and astrometry, providing an efficient method to obtain large samples of faint emission-line galaxies, a compelling middle ground between the completeness of slitless surveys and the sensitivity and bandwidth of NIRSpec/MSA.

<p>
Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are key diagnostics of the physical conditions in the interstellar medium and are widely used to trace star formation in the mid-infrared (mid-IR). The relative strengths of mid-IR PAH emission features (e.g., 6.2, 7.7, 11.3 um) are sensitive to both the size and ionization state of the molecules and can be strongly influenced by the local radiation field. However, at low metallicities ( Z &lt; 0.2 Zsun), detecting PAHs remains notoriously difficult, likely reflecting a combination of suppressed formation and enhanced destruction mechanisms. We present new JWST/MIRI MRS observations of the metal-poor (Z = 0.1 Zsun) dwarf galaxy CGCG 007-025. We confirm the tentative PAH detection previously reported from Spitzer data and, for the first time, identify a compact (approx. 50 pc) PAH-emitting region nearly co-spatial with the newly detected [NeV](I.P. = 97 eV) emission and the galaxy's most metal-poor, strongly star-forming region. The 11.3 um PAH feature is clearly detected, while no emission is found from the other typically brighter features, suggesting a PAH population dominated by large, neutral molecules resilient to hard ionizing fields. When compared with models, mid-IR line ratios involving [NeIII], [OIV], and [NeV] can only be reproduced by a combination of star formation and AGN ionization, with the latter contributing 4&ndash;8%. The [OIV] and [NeV] luminosities exceed what massive stars or shocks can produce, highlighting a puzzling scenario in line with recent JWST observations of similar galaxies. This work provides a crucial reference for studying the physical conditions of the dust and star formation in low-metallicity starburst regions, environments typical of the early universe.

We report the spectroscopic detection of neutral gas inflow into a massive (M_* ≃ 4× 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) quiescent galaxy observed at z<sub>spec</sub> = 2.6576 with JWST. From the redshifted absorption of the NaI doublet at λλ5890, 5896 Ang, we estimate an inflow velocity v=278^+79_-79 km s<sup>-1</sup> and a column density log(N_NaI/cm<sup>2</sup>) = 13.02^+0.03_-0.03. We derive the inflowing mass of the gas M_in = 1.6^+0.1_-0.1 × 10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and rate M&#775;_in = 19^+6_-7   M<sub>&odot;</sub>   yr^-1. The presence of several surrounding galaxies suggests that the galaxy may be accreting gas from nearby companions. However, we cannot confirm it with current data and the intergalactic medium or cosmic filaments are also viable sources of the inflowing gas. Despite the ongoing inflow, the galaxy remains quiescent, with an upper limit to the star formation rate of 0.2   M<sub>&odot;</sub>   yr^-1. Moreover, its star formation history suggests that the galaxy has remained quiescent during the past ~1 Gyr, with half of its stars formed by redshift z_50=11^+18_-3. We discuss that the inflow is not massive, dense, or long-lived enough to ignite significant star formation, or it is fueling low-level AGN activity instead. This is direct evidence that quiescent galaxies can accrete cold gas after their quenching while keeping their star formation subdued. Follow-up observations with JWST and ALMA will be needed to constraint the nature of the inflowing gas.

We present a spectroscopically-selected [OIII]+Hb emitters catalogue at 6.75&lt;z&lt;9.05 and the resulting [OIII] 5008 ÅLuminosity Function (LF) in the COSMOS field. We leverage the 0.3 deg<sup>2</sup> covered to date by COSMOS-3D using NIRCam/WFSS F444W (90% of the survey) to perform the largest spectroscopic search for [OIII] emitters at 6.75&lt;z&lt;9.05. We present our catalogue of 237 [OIII] emitters and their associated completeness function. The inferred constraints on the [OIII] LF enable us to characterise the knee of the [OIII] LF, resulting in improved [OIII] LF constraints at z~7,8. Notably, we find evidence for an accelerated decline of the [OIII] luminosity density between z~7 and z~8, which could be expected if the metallicity of [OIII] emitters, as well as the cosmic star-formation rate density, is declining at these redshifts. We find that theoretical models that reproduce the z~7,8 [OIII] LF do not reproduce well the [OIII] equivalent width distribution, pointing to potential challenges in the modelling of[OIII] and other nebular lines in the early Universe. Finally, we provide the first constraints on the cosmic variance of [OIII] emitters, estimating at 15% the relative uncertainty for the z~7,8 [OIII] LF in the 0.3 deg<sup>2</sup> field. This estimate is in good agreement with that inferred from clustering, and shows that the [OIII] LF derived from smaller extragalactic legacy fields is strongly affected by cosmic variance. Our results highlight the fundamental role that wide-area JWST slitless surveys play to map the galaxy large-scale structure down into the reionisation era, serving as a springboard for a variety of science cases.

Neutral gas in galaxies during the Epoch of Reionisation regulates star formation, dust growth, and the escape of ionising photons, making it a key ingredient in understanding both galaxy assembly and reionisation. Yet, direct constraints on the HI content of galaxies at z&gt;6 have been scarce. With JWST, Lyα damping wings in galaxy spectra can now provide a direct probe of this neutral component. We analyse JWST/NIRSpec prism spectra of 12 UV-luminous galaxies from the REBELS-IFU program at z~6.5-7.7, deriving HI column densities by modelling Lyα damping wings. Significant damped Lyα absorption is detected in eight galaxies, with N_HI≳10^21 cm<sup>2</sup>. We use the column densities and sizes derived for these sources to estimate their HI mass and compare with L_[CII]-M_HI calibrations. The resulting HI masses show a tentative correlation with those inferred from [CII], although the [CII]-based estimates are systematically larger, suggesting that the HI reservoirs may extend beyond the [CII]-emitting gas. We also combine the DLA-based measurements with FIR-derived dust-to-gas ratios, dust attenuation, and gas-phase metallicities. No correlation is found between DLA-based and FIR-based dust-to-gas ratios, but combining the REBELS-IFU sample with literature samples at lower metallicities reveals a strong correlation between A_V/N_HI and metallicity. These findings suggest that by z~7 massive galaxies can already host substantial, enriched reservoirs of neutral gas and dust, consistent with A_V/N_HI-metallicity trends at lower redshift. At the highest redshifts (z&gt;8), however, we see tentative evidence for systematically lower A_V/N_HI at fixed metallicity, which may point to pristine gas accretion or more efficient dust destruction/expulsion.

We present spatially resolved rest-optical spectroscopy of 38 star-forming galaxies at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.7 from the JWST/NIRSpec MSA-3D survey, which uses slit-stepping to build IFU-like datacubes at 0.1'' resolution. We map emission-line morphology, excitation, and kinematics of the warm ionized gas using [N II]/Hα, [S II]/Hα, and [O III]/Hβ. Relative to z~0 galaxies at fixed stellar mass, our sources show systematically lower [N II]/Hα and [S II]/Hα and elevated [O III]/Hβ, consistent with harder radiation fields and lower metallicities. Radially, [O III]/Hβ profiles are typically flat or mildly positive, whereas [N II]/Hα also remains flat or declines outward, mirroring metallicity trends. On kpc scales, we find a strong positive correlation between [N II]/Hα and velocity dispersion (σ), linking local excitation to turbulent or shock-driven kinematics. Six galaxies (~ 16% of the sample) host spatially localized regions with elevated [N II]/Hα, high EW(Hα), and V_RMS = \sqrtV^2 + σ^2 &gt; 200 km/s, indicative of weak AGN activity, shocks, or outflows. For these candidates we infer modest warm-ionized outflow rates of 1-4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr and kinetic powers ~ 0.1-1% of the AGN bolometric luminosity (from central [O III] or Hα). These values place our sample at the low-energy tail of known AGN-driven outflows yet in continuity with M&#775;_out-L_AGN scaling relations across 0 &lt; z &lt; 6. A completeness assessment shows MSA-3D is sensitive to AGN with L_AGN ≥ 10^43 erg/s, underscoring both the promise and current limitations of detecting weak AGN activity in distant galaxies with resolved spectroscopy.

### 137) [2510.11248](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11248v1): PDRs4All XVII: Formation and excitation of HD in photodissociation regions. Application to the Orion Bar

The James Webb Space Telescope enabled the first detection of several rovibrational emission lines of HD in the Orion Bar, a prototypical photodissociation region. This provides an incentive to examine the physics of HD in dense and strong PDRs. Using the latest data available on HD excitation by collisional, radiative and chemical processes, our goal is to unveil HD formation and excitation processes in PDRs by comparing our state-of-the-art PDR model with observations made in the Orion Bar and discuss if and how HD can be used as a complementary tracer of physical parameters in the emitting region. We compute detailed PDR models, using an upgraded version of the Meudon PDR code, which are compared to NIRSpec data using excitation diagrams and synthetic emission spectra. The models predict that HD is mainly produced in the gas phase via the reaction D + H2 = H + HD at the front edge of the PDR and that the D/HD transition is located slightly closer to the edge than the H/H2 transition. Rovibrational levels are excited by UV pumping. In the observations, HD rovibrational emission is detected close to the H/H2 dissociation fronts of the Orion Bar and peaks where vibrationally excited H2 peaks, rather than at the maximum emission of pure rotational H2 levels. We derive an excitation temperature around Tex ~ 480 - 710 K. Due to high continuum in the Orion Bar, fringes lead to high noise levels beyond 15 μm, no pure rotational lines of HD are detected. The comparison to PDR models shows that a range of thermal pressure P = (3-9)x10^7 K cm^-3 with no strong constraints on the intensity of the UV field are compatible with HD observations. This range of pressure is compatible with previous estimates from H2 observations with JWST. This is the first time that observations of HD emission lines in the near-infrared are used to put constraints on the thermal pressure in the PDR.

### 138) [2510.11010](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11010v2): The Relation Between AGN and Host Galaxy Properties in the JWST Era: II. The merger-driven evolution of Seyferts at Cosmic Noon

<p>
In Paper I, we exploited the unsurpassed resolution and depth of JWST/NIRCam imagery to investigate the relationship between AGN and host-galaxy properties in the JWST era, finding a correlation between the level of spatial disturbance (as measured by shape asymmetry, A_S) and obscuration (N_H). Here in Paper II, we report an expansion of our X-ray and infrared analysis of Seyfert-luminosity host galaxies with four additional metrics to the single-metric morphology analysis of Paper I, as well as new samples of inactive control galaxies. This expanded study of one of the largest and most complete, multi-wavelength samples of AGN detected at 0.6&lt;z&lt;2.4 in the GOODS-South and North fields, confirms that mergers surprisingly play a significant role in obscured, sub-quasar AGN host galaxies. Additionally, the pattern of morphological disturbances observed amongst the X-ray- and mid-IR-selected AGN suggests that these represent different phases of AGN evolution tied to a major-merger timeline, as opposed to distinct populations of AGN. These results indicate that mergers are important in triggering sub-quasar AGN at these redshifts.

### 139) [2510.10772](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10772v1): Black Holes in the Shadow: The Missing High-Ionization Lines in the Earliest JWST AGNs

<p> Greta Zucchi, Xihan Ji, Piero Madau, Roberto Maiolino, Ignas Joudzbalis, Francesco D'Eugenio, Sophia Geris, Yuki Isobe </p>
<p>
Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered a substantial population of high-redshift, broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs), whose properties challenge standard models of black hole growth and AGN emission. We analyze a spectroscopic sample of 34 Type 1 AGNs from the JWST Advanced Deep Survey (JADES) survey, spanning redshifts 1.7 &lt; z &lt; 9, to constrain the physical nature of the accretion flows powering these sources with broad-line diagnostics statistically for the first time. At z &gt; 5, we find a marked suppression of high-ionization emission lines (HeII, CIV, NV) relative to prominent broad Halpha and narrow [OIII] features. This contrast places strong constraints on the shape of the ionizing spectral energy distribution (SED) and on the physical conditions in the broad-line region (BLR). By comparing the observations to photoionization models based on SEDs of black holes accreting at sub-Eddington ratios, we show that standard AGN continua struggle to reproduce the observed broad line ratios and equivalent widths across a wide ionization parameter range. These results suggest the need for modified SEDs &ndash; either intrinsically softened due to super-Eddington accretion or radiative inefficiencies in the innermost disk, or externally filtered by intervening optically thick gas that absorbs or scatters the highest-energy photons before they reach the BLR.

### 140) [2510.10749](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10749v1): The JWST-NIRCam View of Sagittarius C. III. The Extinction Curve

<p>
Determining the infrared extinction curve towards the Galactic centre is crucial for accurately correcting observed data and deriving the underlying stellar populations. However, extinction curves reported in the literature often show discrepancies. We aim to derive the infrared extinction curve towards the Galactic centre based on JWST-NIRCam data for the first time, using observations of the Sagittarius C region in the 1-5 μm range. We determined extinction ratios using two different methods, both based on measuring the reddening vector using the slope of red clump stars, whose intrinsic properties are well known, in observed colour-magnitude diagrams. The extinction curve derived in this work is in good agreement with previous results in the literature. We obtained the following extinction ratios relative to F162M: A_F115W : A_F162M : A_F182M : A_F212N : A_F360M : A_F405N : A_F470N : A_F480M = 1.84 ± 0.03 : 1.00 : 0.789 ± 0.005 : 0.607 ± 0.014 : 0.306 ± 0.011 : 0.248 ± 0.017 : 0.240 ± 0.019 : 0.21 ± 0.03. Besides, we found different values of the extinction index for the short- (λ~ 1-2.5 μm, α~ 2) and long-wavelength (λ~ 2.5-5 μm, α~ 1.4) regimes, with the extinction curve flattening at longer wavelengths. Comparison with extinction curves derived both inside and outside the Galactic centre suggests that the infrared extinction curve does not significantly vary in the central regions, and shows no significant evidence for variations between different lines of sight beyond the inner Galaxy within the uncertainties.

### 141) [2510.10376](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10376v1): JWST Catches a Strongly Gravitationally Lensed AGN In Transition from Type II to Type I

<p> Michael K Florian, Michael D Gladders, Gourav Khullar, Keren Sharon, Aidan P Cloonan, Eirk Solhaug, Brian Welch, Matthew Bayliss, Hakon Dahle, Taylor A Hutchison, Jane R Rigby </p>
<p>
JWST has enabled the discovery of a statistical sample of obscured (type II) active galactic nuclei (AGN) at cosmic noon. Studies comparing those type II AGN with type I AGN at that epoch have reinforced the long-standing idea of an evolutionary link between those classes of objects. Mergers, the idea goes, disturb the morphologies and angular momentum of galaxies. The disruption of angular momentum allows material to be funneled toward galactic cores, sparking AGN activity and potentially also a burst of star-formation. That material enshrouds the galactic nucleus, leading to a type II AGN. Later, AGN feedback clears the circumnuclear dust, leading to a transition into a type I AGN, and also quenches star formation. If this is a common outcome, a class of intermediate objects should exist. Such objects would be somewhat disturbed and dusty and sit below the star-forming galaxy main sequence, and their star-formation histories would show an increase in star-formation at around the time of the suspected merger. We present new JWST observations of SDSSJ2222+2745, a strongly lensed AGN at z=2.801. The lensing magnification enables a detailed study of the host galaxy spanning the rest-ultraviolet through near infrared. JWST and HST photometry, morphological models, and models of the host's spectral energy distribution reveal that SDSSJ2222+2745 is actively transitioning from a type II to type I AGN. Catching a lensed AGN at this special evolutionary phase makes SDSSJ2222+2745 a unique laboratory to study the physical processes involved in the transition and their relationships to the AGN and the host galaxy at incredible spatial-resolution down to about 20pc at z=2.801.

### 142) [2510.09972](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09972v1): PAH Spectral Diversity in NGC 7027 and the Evolution of Aromatic Carriers

<p> Charlotte Smith-Perez, Aidan Hembruff, Els Peeters, Alexander G. G. M. Tielens, Alessandra Ricca </p>
<p>
Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) constitute a significant fraction of the Universe's carbon budget, playing a key role in the cosmic carbon cycle and dominating the mid-infrared spectra of astrophysical environments in which they reside. Although PAHs are known to form in the circumstellar envelopes of post-AGB stars, their formation and evolution are still not well-understood. We aim to understand how pristine complex hydrocarbons and PAHs in circumstellar environments transition to the PAHs observed in the ISM. The mid-infrared PAH spectra (5-18 micron) of the planetary nebula, NGC 7027, are investigated using spectral cubes from JWST MIRI-MRS. We report the first detection of spatially-resolved variations of the PAH spectral profiles across class A, AB, and B in all major PAH bands (6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.2 micron) within a single source, NGC 7027. These variations are linked to morphological structures within NGC 7027. Clear correlations are revealed between the 6.2, 7.7, and 8.6 micron features, where the red components (6.26, 7.8, 8.65 micron) exhibit a strong correlation and the same is found for the blue components of the 6.2 and 7.7 (6.205 and 7.6 micron). The blue component of the 8.6 (8.56 micron) appears to be independent of the other components. We link this behaviour to differences in molecular structure of their PAH subpopulations. Decomposition of the 11.2 micron band confirms two previously identified components, with the broader 11.25 micron component attributed to emission from very small grains of PAH clusters rather than PAH emission. We show that PAH profile classes generally vary with proximity to the central star's UV radiation field, suggesting class B PAHs represent more processed species while class A PAHs remain relatively pristine, challenging current notions on the spectral evolution of PAHs.

Galaxy-scale outflows are of critical importance for galaxy formation and evolution. Dust grains are the main sites for the formation of molecules needed for star formation but are also important for the acceleration of outflows that can remove the gas reservoir critical for stellar mass growth. Using the MIRI medium-resolution integral field spectrograph aboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we detect the 3.28 μm aromatic and the 3.4 μm aliphatic hydrocarbon dust features in absorption in a redshift 4.601 hot dust-obscured galaxy, blue-shifted by ΔV=-5250^+276_-339 kms<sup>-1</sup> from the systemic redshift of the galaxy. The extremely high velocity of the dust indicates that the wind was accelerated by radiation pressure from the central quasar. These results pave a novel way for probing the physics of dusty outflows in active galaxies at early cosmic time.

<p>
Broadband mid-infrared (MIR) imaging with high spatial resolution is useful to study extended dust structures in the circumnuclear regions of nearby AGN. However, broadband imaging filters cannot distinguish dust continuum emission from emission lines, and so accounting for the emission line contamination becomes crucial in studying extended dust in these environments. This paper uses Cycle 1 MIR imaging from JWST/MIRI and spectroscopy from JWST/MRS for 11 local Seyfert galaxies, as part of the Galactic Activity, Torus and Outflow Survey (GATOS). Three of the objects (NGC 3081, NGC 5728, and NGC 7172) exist in both datasets, allowing direct measurement of the line emission using the spectroscopy for these objects. We find that extended MIR emission persists on scales of 100s of parsecs after the removal of contamination from emission lines. Further, the line contamination levels vary greatly between objects (from 5% to 30% in the F1000W filter), and across filters, so cannot be generalised across a sample and must be carefully treated for each object and band. We also test methods to estimate the line contamination when only MRS spectroscopy or MIRI imaging is available, using pre-JWST ancillary data. We find that these methods estimate the contamination within 10 percentage points. This paper serves as a useful guide for methods to quantify and mitigate for emission line contamination in MIRI broadband imaging

Cosmic noon represents the prime epoch of galaxy assembly, and a sweet spot for observations with the James Webb Telescope (JWST) and ground-based near-IR integral-field unit (IFU) spectrographs. This work analyses JWST NIRSpec Micro Shutter Array (MSA), NIRCam Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS) of K20-ID7, a large spiral, star-forming (SF) galaxy at z=2.2, with evidence for radial gas inflows. By exploiting the synergy with ground-based IFU ERIS observations, we conduct a comprehensive and resolved study of the interstellar medium (ISM) and stellar properties, from rest optical to near-IR, via emission-line diagnostics, resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of high-resolution imaging, and Paβ line detection in NIRCam WFSS data. Our analysis reveals massive (M<sub>&sext;</sub>≃(0.67-3.5)×10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) SF clumps with star formation rates (SFRs) ~3-24 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr, and quite low dust attenuation (A_V≃0.4), electron density (n_e&lt;300 cm^-3), and ionisation (log(U)≃ -3.0). The central bulge turns out to be modestly massive (M<sub>&sext;</sub>=(7±3)×10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), heavily obscured (A_V=6.43±0.55), and likely to have formed most of its stellar mass in the past (SFR=82±42 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr over the last 100 Myr), yet still forming stars at a lower rate (SFR=12±8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr over the last 10 Myr). We infer a metallicity 12+log(O/H)~8.54 and an apparent enhancement of the N/O abundance (log(N/O)≃ -1.0) in all distinct galaxy regions, a likely consequence of dilution effects due to radial inflows of metal-poor gas. We measure a sub-solar sulfur abundance (log(S/O)≃-1.9). Finally, the radial stellar age profile reveals older stellar populations in the inner galaxy regions compared to the outskirts, pointing to an inside-out growth of K20-ID7.

<p>
Measurements of quasar lifetimes at high redshift indicate that the earliest billion-solar-mass supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have only been active as luminous quasars for less than a million years. Recently, extended Lyα nebulae around z~6 quasars have revealed that these short observed lifetimes are unlikely a sightline-dependent effect. However, the interpretation of Lyα emission is not straightforward due to its resonant nature. In this work, we use rest-frame optical emission lines, which more directly trace photoionization by the quasar, to unambiguously validate the short line-of-sight quasar lifetimes observed at early cosmic epochs. We use deep James Webb Space Telescope/NIRSpec IFU observations of five z~ 6 quasars with small proximity zones to search for their extended emission line nebulae in Hα and [O III]5007, and detect extended emission in both emission lines around four quasars in our sample. We then use the light-crossing time of these nebulae to measure quasar lifetimes along transverse sightlines. Using their Hα nebulae, we also confirm that recombination is likely the dominant emission mechanism behind their previously detected Lyα nebulae. Our results confirm the existence of high-redshift quasars with extremely short lifetimes, t_Q ≲ 10^5 yr, hosting billion-solar-mass black holes, indicating that rapid accretion is likely responsible for the assembly of SMBHs in the early Universe.

### 147) [2510.09568](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09568v1): Galaxy Underdensities Host the Clearest IGM Lyα Transmission and Indicate Anisotropic Reionization

<p> Yongda Zhu, George D. Becker, Anson D'Aloisio, Ryan Endsley, Nakul Gangolli, Christopher Cain, Charlotte A. Mason, Seyedazim Hashemi, Hui Hong </p>
<p>
How galaxies drive reionization and what governs its geometry remain fundamental questions. We present JWST/NIRCam wide-field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) observations toward two of the most Lyα-transmissive QSO sightlines near the end of reionization. We find that regions at z ~ 5.7 along both sightlines previously found to be low-density in Lyα emitters are also underdense in [O III] emitters, with densities less than half the cosmic mean. Other transmissive regions, however, are found to coincide with average-density environments, indicating that multiple pathways may produce high IGM transmission. For the first time, we measure the two-dimensional cross-correlation between IGM transmission and galaxy positions, revealing evidence for anisotropic ionization geometry. Specifically, we detect enhanced transmission at transverse distances of Δr ~ 0.8 times the mean free path, consistent with ionizing photons escaping preferentially along large-scale structures that are aligned with, but offset from, the line of sight. This anisotropic escape may contribute to the observed patchiness of reionization and challenges the assumption of isotropic ionized bubble growth in current models.

### 148) [2510.08997](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08997v1): Galaxy Metallicity Gradients in the Reionization Epoch from the FIRE-2 Simulations

<p>
We employ the high-redshift suite of FIRE-2 cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations to investigate the evolution of gas-phase metallicity radial gradients in galaxies in the epoch of reionization (EoR). Our sample consists of 22 galaxies spanning the redshift range z ~ 10-5. We find that galaxies at z~10 exhibit a median metallicity gradient of -0.15 dex\cdot kpc^-1 with substantial scatter, which gradually flatten to -0.1 dex\cdot kpc^-1 at z~6, accompanied by a reduction in scatter. In the EoR, metallicity gradients correlate positively with stellar mass: more massive galaxies display flatter gradients with smaller scatter, broadly consistent with recent JWST observations. At fixed stellar mass, galaxies with higher star formation rates (SFRs) exhibit steeper negative gradients, while sSFR shows a strong anti-correlation with gradient slope. Because EoR galaxies in FIRE-2 generally lack significant rotational support, we adopt the ratio of peak-to-peak velocity shear to twice the velocity dispersion (Δv/2σ) as a proxy for the strength of gas flows. We find a strong positive correlation between metallicity gradients and Δv/2σ: galaxies with lower Δv/2σ (i.e., weaker gas flows) tend to exhibit steeper negative gradients. Furthermore, galaxies with steeper gradients display higher central SFR surface densities, suggesting localized star formation with inefficient interstellar medium mixing that drives inside-out chemical enrichment in galaxy evolution in the early Universe.

### 149) [2510.08801](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08801v1): The Distribution of Quenched Galaxies in the Massive z = 0.87 Galaxy Cluster El Gordo

<p>
El Gordo (ACT-CL J0102-4915) is a massive galaxy cluster with two major mass components at redshift z=0.87. Using SED fitting results from JWST/NIRCam photometry, the fraction of quenched galaxies in this cluster was measured in two bins of stellar mass: 9&lt;log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;10 and 10≤log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;12. While there is no correlation between the quenched fraction and angular separation from the cluster's overall center of mass, there is a correlation between the quenched fraction and angular separation from the center of the nearest of the two mass components for the less-massive galaxies. This suggests that environmental quenching processes are in place at z~1, and that dwarf galaxies are more affected by those processes than massive galaxies.

### 150) [2510.08721](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08721v1): Planetary Nebula Evolution for Single Stellar Models. The Formation of Neutral Spikes

<p> Guillermo Garcia-Segura, Arturo Manchado, Jesus A. Toala, Martin A. Guerrero, Alberto J. Castro-Tirado </p>
<p>
Two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations are presented from the formation up to the late evolution of planetary nebula, for 6 different stellar models from 1 to 5 Mo. The hydrodynamical models use stellar evolution calculations as inner boundary conditions and updated values for the number of ionizing photons. Special emphasis is placed on the formation of neutral spikes, as recently observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. The results indicate that neutral spikes can be detected either at the formation of planetary nebulae or in their decline. In the first case, the temporal window decreases with the mass of the model, ranging from 3,000 years in the 1 Mo case to 0 for 5 Mo. In the second case, only the 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 Mo cases allow us to detect the neutral spikes for most of the remaining time.

### 151) [2510.08715](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08715v1): JWST imaging of omega Centauri: II. Evidence for a split white dwarf cooling sequence in the near-infrared

<p>
We present a detailed analysis of the white dwarf cooling sequence (WD CS) in omega Centauri based on combined Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and JWST observations. Our analysis confirms the previously reported split - based on HST observations in ultraviolet filters - in the upper part of the WD CS, consistent with the presence of two distinct WD populations, and extends it to a significantly fainter and cooler limit (down to ~8000 K), corresponding to cooling ages of about 1 Gyr. We used artificial star (AS) tests and cooling models to confirm that the split is evidence of two WD populations with different masses and progenitors: one sequence of canonical WDs produced by the He-normal progenitors, and one sequence of low-mass WDs originated from the cluster He-rich component. We show that the fraction of WDs from the He-rich component in the outer regions is smaller than that found in the innermost regions. We also studied the kinematics of WDs and showed that in the outer regions, the velocity distribution of WDs from He-rich progenitors is slightly radially anisotropic, while that of canonical WDs is slightly tangentially anisotropic. Both the radial variation of the fraction of WDs from the He-rich population and the difference between their velocity distribution and that of canonical WDs are consistent with spatial and kinematic differences previously found for He-rich and He-normal main-sequence (MS) stars and in general agreement with models predicting that He-rich stars form more centrally concentrated than He-normal stars.

### 152) [2510.08455](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08455v2): A first look at quasar-galaxy clustering at z≃7.3

<p>
We present JWST observations of the environments surrounding two high-redshift quasars &ndash; J0252-0503 at z = 7.0 and J1007+2115 at z = 7.5 &ndash; which enable the first constraints on quasar-galaxy clustering at z ~ 7.3. Galaxies in the vicinity of the quasars are selected through ground-based and JWST/NIRCam imaging and then spectroscopically confirmed with JWST/NIRSpec using the multi-shutter assembly (MSA). Over both fields, we identify 51 z&gt;5 galaxies, of which eight are found within a Δv_rmLOS=±1500 km s<sup>-1</sup> line-of-sight velocity window from the quasars and another eight in the background. The galaxy J0252\_8713, located just 7 pkpc and Δv_rmLOS ≈ 360 km s<sup>-1</sup> from quasar J0252-0503, emerges as a compelling candidate for one of the most distant quasar-galaxy mergers. Combining the galaxy discoveries over the two fields, we measure the quasar-galaxy cross-correlation and obtain a correlation length of r_0^QG≈7.6_-1.6^+1.7 h^-1 cMpc, based on a power-law model with a fixed slope of γ_QG = 2.0. Under the assumption that quasars and galaxies trace the same underlying dark matter density fluctuations, we infer a minimum dark matter halo mass for z≃7.3 quasars of log_10(M_rmhalo, min/rmM<sub>&odot;</sub>)= 11.6±0.6 in a halo model framework. Compared to measurements from EIGER at &langle; z &rangle; = 6.25 and ASPIRE at &langle; z &rangle; = 6.7 (where log_10(M_rmhalo, min/rmM<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≳ 12.3), our clustering results provide tentative evidence for a non-monotonic redshift evolution of quasar clustering properties. We further estimate a quasar duty cycle of f_duty≈0.1&percnt;, consistent with constraints from quasar proximity zones and IGM damping wings. (abridged)

### 153) [2510.08354](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08354v1): Mephisto: Self-Improving Large Language Model-Based Agents for Automated Interpretation of Multi-band Galaxy Observations

<p> Zechang Sun, Yuan-Sen Ting, Yaobo Liang, Nan Duan, Song Huang, Zheng Cai </p>
<p>
Astronomical research has long relied on human expertise to interpret complex data and formulate scientific hypotheses. In this study, we introduce Mephisto &ndash; a multi-agent collaboration framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that emulates human-like reasoning for analyzing multi-band galaxy observations. Mephisto interfaces with the CIGALE codebase (a library of spectral energy distribution, SED, models) to iteratively refine physical models against observational data. It conducts deliberate reasoning via tree search, accumulates knowledge through self-play, and dynamically updates its knowledge base. Validated across diverse galaxy populations &ndash; including the James Webb Space Telescope's recently discovered "Little Red Dot" galaxies &ndash; we show that Mephisto demonstrates proficiency in inferring the physical properties of galaxies from multi-band photometry, positioning it as a promising research copilot for astronomers. Unlike prior black-box machine learning approaches in astronomy, Mephisto offers a transparent, human-aligned reasoning process that integrates seamlessly with existing research practices. This work underscores the possibility of LLM-driven agent-based research for astronomy, establishes a foundation for fully automated, end-to-end artificial intelligence (AI)-powered scientific workflows, and unlocks new avenues for AI-augmented discoveries in astronomy.

<p>
Recent observations have revealed a remarkably rapid buildup of cosmic dust in the interstellar medium (ISM) of high redshift galaxies, with complex dust compositions and large abundances already appearing at redshifts z&gt;6. Here we present a comprehensive, joint analysis of observations taken with the  James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA) of the highly magnified, dusty `normal' galaxy, A1689-zD1 at z=7.13. We perform detailed spectro-photometric modeling of the rest-frame UV to far-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) based on archival photometry of the source and report new rest-frame optical strong-line measurements and metallicity estimates from recent JWST/NIRSpec IFU data. We find that despite its substantial dust mass, M_dust~ 1.5× 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, A1689-zD1 has remarkably low dust-to-gas and dust-to-metal mass ratios, DTG = (5.1^+3.0_-1.9)× 10^-4 and DTM = (6.1^+3.6_-2.3)× 10^-2, respectively, due to its high metallicity 12+log(O/H) = 8.36± 0.10 and substantial gas mass, M_gas = (2.8^+0.2_-1.7)× 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. The DTG and DTM mass ratios are an order of magnitude lower than expected for galaxies in the local universe with similar chemical enrichment. These low relative measurements are also corroborated by the deficit observed in the A_V/N_HI ratio of A1689-zD1 in the line-of-sight. We find that this deviation in the DTG and DTM mass ratios appears to be ubiquitous in other metal-rich galaxies at similar redshifts, z≳ 6. This suggests that the processes that form and destroy dust at later times, or the dust emissivity itself, are drastically different for galaxies in the early Universe.

### 155) [2510.07747](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07747v1): Object Classification from JWST Catalogs

<p> B. L. Crompvoets, H. Kirk, R. Gutermuth, J. Di Francesco </p>
<p>
JWST's exquisite data have opened the doors to new possibilities in detecting broad classes of astronomical objects, but also to new challenges in classifying those objects. In this work, we introduce SESHAT, the Stellar Evolutionary Stage Heuristic Assessment Tool for the identification of Young Stellar Objects, field stars (main sequence through asymptotic giant branch), brown dwarfs, white dwarfs, and galaxies, from any JWST observation. This identification is done using the machine learning method XGBoost to analyze thousands of rows of synthetic photometry, modified at run-time to match the filters available in the data to be classified. We validate this tool on real data of both star-forming regions and cosmological fields, and find we are able to reproduce the observed classes of objects to a minimum of 80&percnt; recall across every class, without additional information on the ellipticity or spatial distribution of the objects. Furthermore, this tool can be used to test the filter choices for JWST proposals, to verify whether the chosen filters are sufficient to identify the desired class of objects. SESHAT is released as a Python package to the community for general use.

### 156) [2510.07595](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07595v1): Composition of planetary debris around the white dwarf GD 362

<p>
White dwarf stars with high abundances of heavy elements in their atmospheres and infrared excesses are believed to be accreting planetary material. GD 362 is one of the most heavily polluted white dwarfs and has an exceptionally strong mid-infrared excess, reprocessing 2.4% of the star's light into the mid-infrared. We present a high signal-to-noise, medium-resolution spectrum of GD 362 obtained with JWST, covering 0.6 to 17 microns, along with photometry out to 25.5 microns. The mid-infrared spectrum is dominated by an exceptionally strong 9 to 11 micron silicate feature, which can be explained by a combination of olivine and pyroxene silicate minerals. Grains such as carbon, hotter than silicates, are required to explain the near-infrared emission. The silicates and carbon reside in a disk from 140 to 1400 stellar radii, and the disk scale height is greater than half the stellar radius. The elemental abundances of the solid material, relative to Si, are within a factor of 2 of meteoritic (CI chondrites) for C, O, Mg, Al, and Fe, with Al elevated and O slightly depleted. A similar pattern is observed for the abundances of accreted material in the stellar photosphere. Hydrogen is an exception, because no significant H-bearing minerals or water were detected in the disk, despite a large H abundance in the photosphere.

<p>
We investigate the evolution of the bar fraction and length using an extended JWST NIRCam imaging dataset of galaxies at 1 ≤ z ≤ 4. We assess the wavelength dependence of the bar fraction and bar length evolution by selecting a nearly mass-complete CEERS disc sample and performing visual classifications on the short (F200W) and long (F356W+F444W) wavelength channels. A similar bar fraction is observed for both samples, and combined, we find a declining bar fraction from 0.16^+0.03_-0.03 to 0.07^+0.03_-0.01 over the redshift range. No evolution in the F356W+F444W bar length is measured, with a mean of 3.6 kpc. A slight increase of ~ 1 kpc towards z = 1 is measured in the F200W sample, with a mean of 2.9 kpc. We find that the correlation between bar length and galaxy mass, for massive galaxies at z &lt; 1, is unseen at z &gt; 1. By incorporating barred galaxies at z&lt;1, we show that there is a modest increase in the bar length (≈ 2 kpc) towards z=0, but bars longer than ≈8 kpc are only found at z&lt;1. We show that bars and discs grow in tandem, for the bar length normalised by disc size does not evolve. Not only is a significant population of bars forming beyond z = 1, but our results also show that some of these bars are as long and strong as the average bar at z≈0.

<p>
JWST has identified a large population of faint, broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early universe that are powered by black holes (BHs) that often appear overmassive relative to their host galaxies. In this study, we examine the relationship between BH mass and galaxy stellar mass at 3&lt;z&lt;7 using a sample of 70 broad-line AGN identified using NIRSpec/G395M spectroscopy from the CEERS, JADES, and RUBIES surveys. Roughly half (43&percnt;) of our sample appear heavily reddened and are classified as little red dots (LRDs). We estimate BH masses (M_BH) using single-epoch virial techniques, while host stellar masses (M<sub>&sext;</sub>) are inferred using a combination of two-dimensional surface brightness profile fitting and spectral energy distribution modeling. We find that a majority of our sources (50/70) have M_BH/M<sub>&sext;</sub> ratios that are 1-2 dex higher than that observed in AGN locally. Using a forward-modeling Bayesian framework that accounts for uncertainties, intrinsic scatter, and selection effects, we infer a M_BH-M<sub>&sext;</sub> relationship that is &gt;3σ above the relationship measured for local broad-line AGN. We derive an intrinsic scatter in this relationship of 0.9 dex, which does not vary over the redshift range of our sample. We also find that the M_BH/M<sub>&sext;</sub> ratio increases by 2.3 dex from z = 3.5 and z = 6.5 with a confidence level of &gt; 3σ. We attribute this trend with the increasing fraction of LRDs in our sample at z&gt;4 as their host masses are ~1 dex lower than the non-LRD AGN in our sample. These results support a picture in which the BHs powering JWST's broad-line AGN are genuinely overmassive and become increasingly so with redshift. We discuss the implications of our findings on early BH growth relative to that of their host galaxies and the constraints it places on BH seeding models.

We present a large spectroscopic survey with itJWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Low Resolution Spectrometer (LRS) targeting 37 infrared-bright galaxies between z=0.65-2.46 with infrared luminosities log L_IR/L<sub>&odot;</sub>&gt;11.5 and log M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>=10-11.5. Targets were taken from a itSpitzer 24 μm-selected sample with archival spectroscopy from the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) and include a mix of star-forming galaxies and dust-obscured AGN. By combining IRS with the increased sensitivity of LRS, we expand the range of spectral features observed between 5-30 μm for every galaxy in our sample. In this paper, we outline the sample selection, itJWST data reduction, 1D spectral extraction, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) feature measurements from λ_rest=3.3-11.2 μm. In the itJWST spectra, we detect PAH emission features at 3.3-5.3 μm, as well as Paschen and Brackett lines. The 3.3 μm feature can be as bright as 1&percnt; of the 8-1000 μm infrared luminosity and exhibits a tight correlation with the dust-obscured star-formation rate. We detect absorption features from CO gas, CO<sub>2</sub> ice, H<sub>2</sub>O ice, and aliphatic dust. From the joint itJWST and itSpitzer analysis we find that the 11.3/3.3 μm PAH ratios are on-average three times higher than that of local luminous, infrared galaxies. This is interpreted as evidence that the PAH grains are larger at z~1-2. The size distribution may be affected by coagulation of grains due to high gas densities and low temperatures. These conditions are supported by the observation of strong water ice absorption at 3.05 μm, and can lower stellar radiative feedback as large PAHs transmit less energy per photon into the interstellar medium.

### 160) [2510.07369](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07369v1): ttgeko: A tool for modelling galaxy kinematics and morphology in JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopic observations

<p> A. Lola Danhaive, Sandro Tacchella </p>
<p>
Wide-field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) is a powerful tool for studying large samples of galaxies across cosmic times. With the arrival of JWST, and its NIRCAM grism mode, slitless spectroscopy can reach a medium spectral resolution of (R~ 1600), allowing it to spatially resolve the ionised-gas kinematics out to z~ 9. However, the kinematic information is convolved with morphology along the dispersion axis, a degeneracy that must be modelled to recover intrinsic properties. We present the Grism Emission-line Kinematics tOol (ttgeko), a Python package that forward-models NIRCam grism observations and infers emission-line morphologies and kinematics within a Bayesian framework. ttgeko combines Sérsic surface-brightness models with arctangent rotation curves, includes full point-spread function (PSF) and line-spread function (LSF) convolution, and leverages gradient-based sampling via ttjax/ttnumpyro for efficient inference. It recovers parameters such as effective radius, velocity dispersion, rotational velocity, rotational support, and dynamical mass, with typical run times of ~20 minutes per galaxy on GPUs. We validate performance using extensive mock data spanning position angle, S/N, and morphology, quantifying where degeneracies limit recovery. Finally, we demonstrate applications to real FRESCO Hα emitters at z≈ 4-6, recovering both rotation- and dispersion-dominated systems. ttgeko opens the way to statistical studies of galaxy dynamics in the early Universe and is publicly available at https://github.com/angelicalola-danhaive/geko.

<p> George H. Rieke, Yang Sun, Jianwei Lyu, Christopher N. A. Willmer, Yongda Zhu, Pierluigi Rinaldi, Meredith A. Stone, Kevin N. Hainline, Pablo G. Perez-Gonzalez </p>
<p>
We evaluate the underlying assumptions for the identification of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) through near- and mid-infrared photometry and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting out to z ~ 3. For massive galaxies, log(M) &gt; 9.5, our high resolution spectra of the rest optical range generally confirm the results of SED fitting, which relies primarily on excesses above the stellar emission between 1 and 6 microns to identify AGN. However, the method is undermined if the redshift used for the SED fitting is incorrect. Low mass galaxies, log(M) &lt; 9:5, can contain relatively warm dust that emits in the 4 - 6 micron range. We show that the potential contamination of AGN samples by purely star forming low-mass galaxies can be avoided by the use of the infrared properties of Haro 11 as a limiting star-forming SED template. However, relatively few star forming galaxies emit as strongly in the 3 - 6 micron range as this template, so this could result in missing some obscured AGNs to avoid a minor contamination. Including the behavior of the galaxies at rest lamda ~ 13.5 microns can mitigate this problem and yield more complete samples of bona fide AGN. JWST/MIRI supports this approach out to z ~ 0.6.

### 162) [2510.07259](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07259v1): The cosmic web's Lyman-α glow at z ≈ 2.5; varying hydrodynamic models, dust, and wide-field, narrow-band imaging detection

<p>
The diffuse glow of the cosmic web in Lyman-α emission has long been predicted, yet remained elusive to direct wide field detection. We present theoretical calculations that, when compared with recent observations made using the Condor Array Telescope in New Mexico reported in Lanzetta et al. 2024, point to its discovery at z ≈ 2.5. Synthetic Lyman-α surface brightness maps are constructed from five state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations (Illustris-TNG, SIMBA, EAGLE, CROCODILE, and Sherwood), incorporating dust attenuation, star formation, collisional excitation, and recombination physics. Our cosmic web Lyman-α surface brightness predictions are consistent with the UV excess detected at high significance in the recent deep, wide field, narrow-band imaging Condor data. The calculations presented here thus demonstrate that diffuse Lyman-α emission is observable with current (and next-generation) wide field low surface brightness facilities, opening the path to direct cartographic mapping of the cosmic web. These findings mark a turning point: for the first time, cosmology moves beyond inference from absorption and high-density peaks, into panoramic imaging of the faint intergalactic scaffolding that underpins structure formation in the Universe.

### 163) [2510.07131](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07131v1): CURLING &ndash; II. Improvement on the H_0 Inference from Pixelized Cluster Strong Lens Modeling

<p>
Strongly lensed supernovae (glSNe) provide a powerful, independent method to measure the Hubble constant, H_0, through time delays between their multiple images. The accuracy of this measurement depends critically on both the precision of time delay estimation and the robustness of lens modeling. In many current cluster-scale modeling algorithms, all multiple images used for modeling are simplified as point sources to reduce computational costs. In the first paper of the CURLING program, we demonstrated that such a point-like approximation can introduce significant uncertainties and biases in both magnification reconstruction and cosmological inference. In this study, we explore how such simplifications affect H_0 measurements from glSNe. We simulate a lensed supernova at z=1.95, lensed by a galaxy cluster at z=0.336, assuming time delays are measured from LSST-like light curves. The lens model is constructed using JWST-like imaging data, utilizing both Lenstool and a pixelated method developed in CURLING. Under a fiducial cosmology with H_0=70 km  s<sup>-1</sup> Mpc^-1, the Lenstool model yields H_0=69.91^+6.27_-5.50 km s<sup>-1</sup> Mpc^-1, whereas the pixelated framework improves the precision by over an order of magnitude, H_0=70.39^+0.82_-0.60 km  s<sup>-1</sup> Mpc^-1. Our results indicate that in the next-generation observations (e.g., JWST), uncertainties from lens modeling dominate the error budget for H_0 inference, emphasizing the importance of incorporating the extended surface brightness of multiple images to fully leverage the potential of glSNe for cosmology.

<p>
We present results of Pop. III formation in the MEGATRON suite of simulations, which self-consistently follows radiation and non-equilibrium chemistry, and resolves gas at near-pc resolution of a Milky Way-mass halo at Cosmic Dawn. While the very first Pop. III stars form in halos with masses well below the atomic cooling limit, whose cooling is dominated by molecular hydrogen, the majority of Pop. III stars form in more massive systems above the 10^4~K atomic cooling threshold. The shift in cooling regime of halos hosting new Pop. III stars occurs within 100 Myr of the first Pop. III star as the Lyman-Werner (LW) background rapidly increases to 10^-21 erg s<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> Hz^-1 sr^-1. We find that the global Pop. III star formation rate stabilizes to a value of 10^-3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1 at z=20. Among the three processes that quench Pop. III star formation in mini-halos, the LW background, gas starvation, and external chemical enrichment, the LW background is most important. A small fraction of haloes undergo multiple episodes of Pop. III star formation when the earlier forming stars all directly collapse to black holes. If the halos become massive enough, they can form up to ~100 Pop. III stars in a single burst, which may be observable by JWST with moderate gravitational lensing. Pop. III stars form at a wide range of distances from UV-bright galaxies, with only 0.06&percnt; of Pop. III stars forming within the virial radius of galaxies with M_UV &lt; -17. Finally, by tracking Pop. III star remnants down to z=0, we find that 75-80 % reside in the stellar halo of our simulated Milky Way analogue, while the remainder are gravitationally bound to lower-mass systems, including satellite halos.

<p>
H2 is the most abundant molecule in the interstellar medium and is a useful tool to study photodissociation regions, where radiative feedback from massive stars on molecular clouds is dominant. The James Webb Space Telescope, with its high spatial resolution, sensitivity, and wavelength coverage provides unique access to the detection of most of H2 lines and the analysis of its spatial morphology. Our goal is to use H2 line emission detected with the JWST in the Horsehead nebula to constrain the physical parameters (e.g., extinction, gas temperature, thermal pressure) throughout the PDR and its geometry. The study of H2 morphology reveals that FUV-pumped lines peak closer to the edge of the PDR than thermalized lines. From H2 lines, we estimate the value of extinction throughout the PDR. We find that AV is increasing from the edge of the PDR to the second and third H2 filaments. Then, we study the H2 excitation in different regions across the PDR. The temperature profile shows that the observed gas temperature is quite constant throughout the PDR, with a slight decline in each of the dissociation fronts. This study also reveals that the OPR is far from equilibrium. We observe a spatial separation of para and ortho rovibrational levels, indicating that efficient ortho-para conversion and preferential ortho self-shielding are driving the spatial variations of the OPR. Finally, we derive a thermal pressure in the first filament around P &gt; 6x10^6 K cm^-3, about ten times higher than that of the ionized gas. We highlight that template stationary 1D PDR models cannot account for the intrinsic 2D structure and the very high temperature observed in the Horsehead nebula. We argue the highly excited, over-pressurized H2 gas at the edge of the PDR interface could originate from the mixing between the cold and hot phase induced by the photo-evaporation of the cloud.

### 166) [2510.06771](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06771v1): Low-noise Fourier Transform Spectroscopy Enabled by Superconducting On-Chip Filterbank Spectrometers

<p> Chris S. Benson, Peter S. Barry, Patrick Ashworth, Harry Gordon-Moys, Kirit S. Karkare, Izaak Morris, Gethin Robson </p>
<p>
Historically employed spectroscopic architectures used for large field of view mapping spectroscopy in millimetere and sub-millimetre astronomy suffer from significant drawbacks. On-chip filterbank spectrometers are a promising technology in this respect; however, they must overcome an orders-of-magnitude increase in detector counts, efficiency loss due to dielectric properties, and stringent fabrication tolerances that currently limit scaling to resolutions of order 1000 over a large array. We propose coupling a medium-resolution Fourier transform spectrometer to a low-resolution filterbank spectrometer focal plane, which serves as a post-dispersion element. In this arrangement, medium resolution imaging spectroscopy is provided by the Fourier transform spectrometer, while the low resolution filterbank spectrometer serves to decrease the photon noise inherent in typical broadband Fourier transform spectrometer measurements by over an order of magnitude. This is achieved while maintaining the excellent imaging advantages of both architectures. We present predicted mapping speeds for a filterbank-dispersed Fourier transform spectrometer from a ground-based site and a balloon-borne platform. We also demonstrate the potential that an instrument of this type has for an R~1000 line intensity mapping experiment using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as an example platform. We demonstrate that a filterbank-dispersed Fourier transform spectrometer would be capable of R~1000 measurements of CO power spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10&ndash;100 with surveys of 10^5&ndash;10^6 spectrometer hours.

### 167) [2510.06681](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06681v1): The Star-forming Main Sequence and Bursty Star-formation Histories at z&gt;1.4 in JADES and AURORA

<p> Leonardo Clarke, Alice E. Shapley, Natalie Lam, Michael W. Topping, Gabriel B. Brammer, Ryan L. Sanders, Naveen A. Reddy, Shreya Karthikeyan </p>
<p>
We analyze JWST spectroscopic and HST+JWST photometric observations of 659 star-forming galaxies at 1.4 &lt; z &lt; 9 from DR3 of the JADES survey and the AURORA Cycle 1 program. We measure the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) for galaxies above 10^8.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> where the sample is largely representative, estimating star-formation rates (SFRs) using the Hα line flux and rest-frame far UV (1600Å) continuum measurements, each independently corrected for dust attenuation. We find that the intrinsic, measurement-error-subtracted scatter in the SFMS (σ_int) increases with decreasing stellar mass for the Hα-based SFMS, and we find no mass dependence of σ_int in the UV-based SFMS. Additionally, we find that σ_int decreases with increasing redshift, from 0.36^+0.02_-0.02 dex to 0.22^+0.08_-0.07 dex (Hα SFMS), and from 0.28^+0.02_-0.02 dex to 0.20^+0.08_-0.07 dex (UV SFMS) between z~2 and z~ 6.5. We also measure the redshift evolution of the specific SFR and find that, assuming sSFR&prop; (1+z)^γ, γ=1.89^+0.16_-0.15 for the Hα-based SFMS, and γ=1.36^+0.13_-0.13 for the UV-based SFMS. Analyzing the observed Hα/UV luminosity ratios and star-formation histories from the \sc prospector fitting code, we find that 41&ndash;60&percnt; of the sample is inconsistent with having a constant star-formation history. Finally, we find tentative evidence for shorter SFR burst timescales with increasing redshift based on the distribution of L_Hα/νL_ν,1600 vs. Δlog(L_Hα). Taken together, these results are consistent with theoretical predictions of bursty star formation in the early Universe and provide valuable constraints for theoretical models of galaxy evolution.

### 168) [2510.06362](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06362v1): Evidence of violation of Case B recombination in Little Red Dots

<p> G. P. Nikopoulos, D. Watson, A. Sneppen, V. Rusakov, K. E. Heintz, J. Witstok, G. Brammer </p>
<p>
Little Red Dots (LRDs) are a new class of compact extragalactic objects, with a v-shaped optical spectral energy distribution breaking close to the Balmer break wavelength, and broad, typically exponentially-shaped lines. They are believed to be supermassive black holes surrounded by very dense, ionized gas, leading us to explore for any departures from Case B recombination by examining the ratios of multiple hydrogen Balmer lines: Hα, Hβ, Hγ, and Hδ. We analyze a dozen high-S/N LRDs with JWST/NIRSpec, measuring Balmer ratios in the seven objects with coverage of at least three lines. We decompose the line ratios into their respective broad and narrow components. Broad line ratios are consistent with Case B plus dust extinction in all objects but one, RUBIES EGS-49140, which departs from Case B expectations by more than 5σ. The narrow components are consistent with minimal dust attenuation, while two objects exhibit narrow Hα/Hβ≈ 1.8. Such low decrements are observed in highly ionized density bounded nebulae, associated with starburst environments. Nevertheless, both flat decrement cases can be reconciled assuming an unresolved absorption feature. RUBIES EGS-49140, shows a high broad Hα/Hβ, but Hγ/Hα and Hδ/Hα ratios are lower than expected for extinction-modified Case B, hinting at an unphysically steep dust law. These line ratios may be due to increased optical depth in the Balmer lines, as a direct effect of high density (logn_e &gt; 9) gas surrounding the black hole. If Case B recombination does hold in most LRDs, they must be moderate-to-heavily dust obscured (A_V≃1-8) while the host-galaxy should be dust-free, suggesting that the extinction in the broad lines is local to the LRD and not due to the general ISM of the host galaxy.

<p>
Now detected out to redshifts of z~ 14.5, the rest-frame ultraviolet and optical spectra of galaxies encode numerous physical properties of the interstellar medium (ISM). Accurately extracting these properties from spectra remains a key challenge that numerical simulations are uniquely suited to address. We present a study of the observed ISM of galaxies in MEGATRON: a suite of cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations coupled to on-the-fly non-equilibrium thermochemistry, with multiple prescriptions for star formation/feedback and parsec-scale resolution; capable of directly predicting spectroscopic properties of early galaxies. We find that irrespective of feedback physics used, the ISM of high-redshift galaxies is denser, less metal enriched, and subject to higher ionization parameters and radiation fields compared to similar mass galaxies in the local Universe &ndash; in agreement with interpretations of JWST observations. Using common observational techniques to infer bulk galaxy properties, we find that ISM gas density controls the slope of the mass-metallicity relation. Similarly, at the densities reached in some high-redshift galaxies, O32 becomes a density tracer rather than one of ionization parameter. This motivates the use of other line ratios like C43 and N43 to infer the ionization state of the gas. Finally, various feedback models populate different regions of strong-line diagnostic diagrams as the line ratios are sensitive to the feedback-modulated density-temperature structure of the ISM. Therefore, observed strong-line diagnostics can provide a strong constraint on the underlying physics of star formation and feedback in the high-redshift Universe.

### 170) [2510.06325](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06325v1): Preferential Accretion onto the Secondary Black Hole Strengthens Gravitational Wave Signals

<p> Julia M. Comerford, Joseph Simon </p>
<p>
Pulsar timing arrays have recently found evidence for nanohertz gravitational waves that are consistent with being produced by a cosmological population of binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, the amplitude of this gravitational wave background is larger than predicted from theoretical and empirical models of SMBH binary populations. We investigate preferential accretion onto the secondary, less massive SMBH of the binary as a potential solution to this discrepancy. We carry out the first observationally-based analysis of the effect of preferential accretion on the SMBH binary population, and we find that preferential accretion onto the secondary SMBH increases the binary SMBH mass ratio, causing many minor galaxy mergers to lead to major SMBH mergers. The fraction of SMBH mergers that are major mergers increases by a factor of 2-3 when preferential accretion is included. Further, we find that only a small amount of preferential accretion (10% total SMBH mass growth) is needed to bring the predicted gravitational wave background amplitude into agreement with observations. Preferential accretion has an even larger effect on gravitational wave signals detected by LISA, which will probe SMBH binaries at higher redshifts where the environment is more gas-rich, and can also help explain the rapid build up of overmassive black holes at high redshifts observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. It also shortens the time to the first detection of an individual SMBH binary emitting continuous waves. Preferential accretion strengthens the gravitational wave signals produced by any binary embedded in a circumbinary disk, including LIGO sources.

Infrared emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) play a major role in determining the charge balance of their host environments that include photo-dissociation regions (PDRs) in galaxies, planetary nebulae, and rims of molecular clouds. We aim to investigate the distribution and sizes of charged PAHs across the key zones of the Orion Bar PDR. We employ JWST MIRI-MRS observations of the Orion Bar from the Early Release Science program ''PDRs4All'' and synthetic images in the JWST MIRI filters. We investigate the spatial morphology of the AIBs at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.0 μm that commonly trace PAH cations, and the neutral PAH-tracing 11.2 μm AIB, their (relative) correlations, and the relationship with existing empirical prescriptions for AIBs. The 6.2. 7.7, 8.6, 11.0, and 11.2 μm AIBs are similar in spatial morphology, on larger scales. Analyzing three-feature intensity correlations, two distinct groups emerge: the 8.6 and 11.0 μm vs. the 6.2 and 7.7 μm AIBs. We attribute these correlations to PAH size. The 6.2 and 7.7 μm AIBs trace cationic, medium-sized PAHs. Quantum chemical calculations reveal that the 8.6 μm AIB is carried by large, compact, cationic PAHs, and the 11.0 μm AIB's correlation to it implies, so is this band. The 6.2/8.6 and 7.7/8.6 PAH band ratios thus probe PAH size. We conclude that the 6.2/11.2 AIB ratio is the most reliable proxy for charged PAHs, within the cohort. We outline JWST MIRI imaging prescriptions that serve as effective tracers of the PAH ionization fraction as traced. This study showcases the efficacy of the 6-9 μm AIBs to probe the charge state and size distribution of the emitting PAHs, offering insights into the physical conditions of their host environments. JWST MIRI photometry offers a viable alternative to IFU spectroscopy for characterizing this emission in extended objects.

We present an analysis of bursty star-formation histories (SFHs) of 346 star-forming galaxies at 1≲ z&lt;7, selected from JWST/NIRSpec G395M and PRISM spectroscopy provided by the CEERS and RUBIES surveys. We analyze the correlation of star-formation rate vs. stellar mass (the star-forming main sequence, SFMS) for our sample and find no significant difference between the intrinsic scatter in the Hα-based SFMS and the UV-continuum-based SFMS. However, the diagnostic power of the SFMS is limited at high redshift and low stellar mass due to observational biases that exclude faint, quenched galaxies. To more directly probe star-formation variability, we examine the dust-corrected Hα-to-UV ratio, which is assumed to trace deviations a from constant SFH over the past ~100 Myr. In our sample, 73^+4_-4% of galaxies exhibit Hα-to-UV ratios inconsistent with a constant SFH. We do not observe any statistically significant evolution in the Hα-to-UV ratio with redshift. Additionally, lower-mass galaxies (7≤log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;8.5) are 30 ± 1% more likely to lie above this equilibrium range &ndash; indicative of a recent (≲ 100 Myr) burst of star formation &ndash; compared to higher-mass systems (8.5≤log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≤10.9). These results suggest that bursty SFHs are more common in low-mass galaxies at z~ 1-7 and that this remains relatively stable across ~0.8-6 Gyr after the Big Bang.

### 173) [2510.05299](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05299v1): Galaxy sizes and compactness at Cosmic Dawn

The James Webb Space Telescope has found an unexpected population of high-mass galaxies (log (M^&sext; / M <sub>&odot;</sub>) ≳ 10) with extremely small effective radii (~ 100 pc) at z ≳ 6. Also, the existence of an unusual size&ndash;mass relation has been claimed. These observations are only partially reproduced by current models, and the physics responsible for the observed relations is still under debate. We expect to unveil the formation channels of the observed compact galaxies. We analyse 7605 snapshots for 169 galaxies of the state-of-the-art cosmological simulation suite FirstLight. We find that galaxies undergo an expansion&ndash;compaction&ndash;re-expansion process. This process operates in a specific mass range; compaction starts at log (M^&sext;_ on / M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ~ 8.5 and ends at log (M^&sext;_off / M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ~ 9.5. In between these masses, the size&ndash;mass relation becomes inverted, with a negative slope. The physical mechanism driving this process in our simulations involves a self-reinforced inflow of gas from the outer regions, that triggers a strong, localised starburst at the centre (within 1  kpc). This contraction continues until conditions favour star formation in a broader area, and the normal inside-out growth pattern resumes. We present evidence for the existence of a universal wet compaction operating at Cosmic Dawn. This mechanism is driven by spherical accretion triggered by the change of the state of the central matter of galaxies, from dark matter- to baryon-dominated. We also propose an analytical expression for the infall process, suitable for use in semi-analytic models. Contrary to low-redshift galaxies, in high-redshift systems compaction ends without gas depletion and star-formation quenching.

<p>
We present the MEGATRON suite of cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations following the formation of Milky Way-mass galaxies from the earliest cosmic epochs when Population III stars form to Cosmic Noon. The suite represents the first set of cosmological simulations that couples a vast non-equilibrium thermochemistry network of primordial species, metals, and molecules to multifrequency, on-the-fly radiation transport, allowing us to directly predict the spectral properties of early galaxies. By initializing the simulations at zero metallicity, resolving haloes well below the atomic cooling threshold, reaching parsec-scale resolution, and modeling a Milky Way-mass environment, we aim to address four key science themes: 1) Star formation at cosmic dawn, 2) Galaxy formation and the interstellar medium in the epoch of reionization, 3) The circumgalactic medium towards cosmic noon, and 4) Reionization in a local volume environment and near-field cosmology. In this introductory work, we present an overview of the physical characteristics of high-redshift MEGATRON galaxies and their environment at z&gt;8. We present a library of &gt;175,000 simulated galaxy spectra and demonstrate how the diversity of galaxy spectra seen by JWST is naturally reproduced in the context of a ΛCDM cosmology. This project represents a step towards making more direct comparisons between simulations and observations and will enable future work to both optimize methods for inferring galaxy properties from observations and to elucidate the physics that governs galaxy formation in the early Universe.

### 175) [2510.04771](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04771v1): A GLIMPSE into the very faint-end of the Hβ+[OIII]λλ4960,5008 luminosity function at z=7-9 behind Abell S1063

<p>
We use the ultra-deep GLIMPSE JWST/NIRCam survey to constrain the faint-end of the Hβ+[OIII]λλ4960,5008 luminosity function (LF) down to 10^39 erg/s at z=7-9 behind the lensed Hubble Frontier Field Abell S1063. We perform SED fitting on a Lyman-Break Galaxy sample, measuring combined Hβ+[OIII] fluxes to construct the emission-line LF. The resulting LF (α=-1.55 to -1.78) is flatter than the UV LF (α&lt;-2), indicating a lower number density of low Hβ+[OIII] emitters at fixed MUV. We explore three explanations: (i) bursty star formation histories reducing the Hβ+[OIII]-to-UV ratio, (ii) metallicity effects on [OIII]/Hβ, or (iii) a faint-end turnover in the UV LF. Assuming an evolving [OIII]/Hβ ratio, we derive a flatter [OIII]λ5008 LF (α=-1.45 to -1.66) and a steeper Hβ LF (α=-1.68 to -1.95). The combination of decreasing metallicity and bursty star formation can reconcile the UV and Hβ+[OIII] LF differences. Converting the LF to the ionising photon production rate, we find that galaxies with Hα flux &gt;10^39 erg/s (SFR(Hα)&gt;5×10^-3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr) contribute 21-61% and 24-104% of the ionising photon budget at 7&lt;z&lt;8 and 8&lt;z&lt;9, respectively (for f<sub>esc</sub>=0.1). The LF shape suggests faint galaxies contribute minimally to the ionising photon production rate. Our cosmic star formation rate density (CSFRD) estimates align with previous work, but GLIMPSE's sensitivity to low SFRs confirms that very faint galaxies are minor contributors to both the ionising photon production rate and the CSFRD. Our results suggest that GLIMPSE has detected the bulk of the total Hβ+[OIII] emission from star-forming galaxies, with fainter sources playing a limited role in cosmic reionisation.

### 176) [2510.04709](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04709v2): Matching JWST UV Luminosity Functions with Refined ΛCDM Halo Models

<p> Saeed Fakhry, Maryam Shiravand, Antonino Del Popolo </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled a population of unexpectedly massive and luminous galaxies at redshifts z ≳ 7, posing a significant challenge to the standard ΛCDM cosmological paradigm. In this work, we address the tension between early JWST observations of luminous high-redshift galaxies and predictions of the standard ΛCDM model by revisiting the physics of dark matter halo formation. Employing refined halo mass functions derived by Del Popolo itet al. (DP1 and DP2) that incorporate angular momentum, dynamical friction, and redshift-dependent collapse barriers, we demonstrate a significant enhancement in the abundance of massive halos at z ≳ 7 compared to the conventional Sheth-Tormen (ST) formalism. Using a semi-empirical framework linking halo mass to UV luminosity, we show that the DP2 model reproduces the observed UV luminosity functions from z = 7 to 14 with moderate star formation efficiencies, whereas the ST model requires implausibly high efficiencies. Our results suggest that the JWST overabundance problem stems not from new physics beyond ΛCDM, but from oversimplified treatments of gravitational collapse, highlighting the critical role of small-scale dissipative dynamics in early structure formation.

<p>
Context. Edge-on disks offer a unique opportunity to directly examine their vertical structure, providing valuable insights into planet formation processes. We investigate the dust properties, as well as the CO and HCO^+ gas properties, in the edge-on disk surrounding the T Tauri star 2MASS J04202144+281349 (SSTTau042021). Aims. We estimate the radial and vertical temperature and density profile for the gas and the dust. Methods. We use ALMA archival data of CO isotopologues and continuum emission at 2, 1.3 and 0.9 mm together with new NOEMA HCO^+ 3-2 observations. We retrieve the gas and dust disk properties using the tomographic method and the scDiskFit model. Results. The vertical CO emission appears very extended, partly tracing the H<sub>2</sub> wind observed by JWST. C^18O, ^13CO and HCO^+ emission characterize the bulk of the molecular layer. The dust and gas have a mid-plane temperatures of ~ 7-11 K. The temperature of the molecular layer (derived from ^13CO and HCO^+) is on the order of 16 K. HCO^+ 3-2 being thermalized, we derive a lower limit for the H<sub>2</sub> volume density of ~ 3 × 10^6 cm^-3 at radius 100-200 au between 1 and 2 scale heights. The atmosphere temperature of the CO gas is of the order ~ 31 K at a radius of 100 au. We directly observe CO and HCO^+ gas onto the mid-plane beyond the dust outer radius (≥ 300 au). The (gas+dust) disk mass estimated up to a radius of 300 au is on the order of 4.6 × 10^-2 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Conclusions. Thanks to the favorable disk inclination, we present the first quantitative evidence for vertical molecular stratification with direct observation of CO and HCO^+ gas along the mid-plane. We estimate the temperature profile with temperature of 7-11 K near the mid-plane, and 15-20 K in the dense part of the molecular layer up to ~ 35 K above.

<p> Marta Volonteri </p>
<p>
These notes review theoretical models of massive black hole formation, growth and observables. They start with a brief summary of basic properties of massive black hole properties. The current view on massive black holes and active galactic nuclei at high redshift is then summarized, highlighting the JWST "revolution'' and the questions raised by the recent observations. The notes then touch on massive black hole formation and growth mechanisms, emphasizing the processes at play at early cosmic times. Then techniques for modeling the cosmic massive black hole evolution, are reviewed with an emphasis on cosmological simulations, before approaching how observables are derived from models. They conclude with a section reflecting on the main questions on the JWST-discovered population in light of the material presented in the earlier sections.

### 179) [2510.04416](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04416v2): Analysis of Galaxies at the Extremes: Failed Galaxy Progenitors in the MAGNETICUM Simulations

<p> Jonah S. Gannon, Lucas C. Kimmig, Duncan A. Forbes, Jean P. Brodie, Lucas M. Valenzuela, Rhea-Silvia Remus, Joel L. Pfeffer, Klaus Dolag </p>
<p>
There is increasing observational evidence for a failed galaxy formation pathway for some ultradiffuse galaxies (UDGs) at low redshift however they currently lack simulated counterparts. We attempt to identify dark matter halos at high redshift within the MAGNETICUM cosmological simulations that could plausibly be their progenitors. We build a toy model of passive galaxy evolution within the stellar mass-halo mass relation to trace z = 0 observations of UDGs back to their z = 2 locations. We identify a population of 443 galaxies that match these parameter space positions within the simulation. We build two comparison samples within the simulation that follow the stellar mass-halo mass relationship at z = 2, one of which is stellar mass matched (with varying smaller halo masses) and the other is halo mass matched (with varying larger stellar masses) to our sample. We identify that our failed galaxy progenitor candidates have 1) flatter, cored dark matter halos; 2) more extended stellar bodies; 3) a larger fraction of their gas in the outskirts of their halos; 4) lower metallicities and 5) higher star formation rates than the control samples. Findings 1) and 2) are similar to low redshift observations of UDGs. Finding 3) will aid the removal of gas and permanent quenching of star formation which is a requirement of the failed galaxy formation scenario. The low metallicities of finding 4) match those observed in low redshift failed galaxy UDGs. Comparing the high star formation rates of finding 5) to recent JWST observations suggests that a starburst would naturally explain the high globular cluster richness of the UDGs. Many of the properties we find for these failed galaxy progenitors can be explained by an assembly bias of their dark matter halo to later formation times. We conclude by proposing that the fraction of failed galaxy UDGs is expected to increase with environmental density.

### 180) [2510.03688](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03688v1): Signatures of Galactic Expansion in Gaia DR3: Implications for the JWST Early-Galaxy Puzzle

<p> G. S. Karapetian, A. P. Mahtessian, L. E. Byzalov, M. A. Hovhannisyan, L. A. Mahtessian </p>
<p>
Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) of massive galaxies at ages below 1 Gyr pose a challenge to standard models of galaxy formation, which predict significantly longer assembly timescales. One possible explanation is that active galactic nuclei (AGN) drive large scale outflows that accelerate galaxy growth. To test this scenario in the local Universe, we analyzed Gaia DR3 data for stars within 5 kpc of the Galactic center, computing galactocentric radial velocities (v_radial_gc) in 27 spatial sectors covering the entire Galaxy, with radial binning of 0.25 kpc. Coordinate transformations and velocity calculations were performed using the Astropy library. We find that 21 of 27 sectors exhibit statistically significant outward motions of 3-50 km/s, while one quadrant shows negative velocities, likely related to the configuration of an activity zone and/or the Galactic bar. Both disk and halo populations also display small but significant mean expansion of 3-9 km/s (p&lt;0.01). These results are consistent with our previous studies, where globular clusters showed outward velocities of 17-31 km/s up to 12 kpc, and axisymmetric analyses of Gaia DR3 stars indicated expansion of ~19 km/s to 5 kpc. Taken together, the evidence suggests that the Milky Way exhibits measurable central expansion, potentially reflecting AGN-driven feedback. This interpretation departs from standard theory and should be regarded as preliminary, requiring further study. However, if confirmed, such expansion could provide a natural explanation for the rapid appearance of massive galaxies observed by JWST.

<p> I. Millán-Irigoyen, M. Mollá, M. Cerviño, M. L. García-Vargas </p>
<p>
Low metallicity stellar populations are very abundant in the Universe, either as the remnants of the past history of the Milky Way or similar spiral galaxies, or the young low metallicity stellar populations that are being observed in the local dwarf galaxies or in the high-z objects with low metal content recently found with JWST. Our goal is to develop new high-spectral-resolution models tailored for low-metallicity environments and apply them to analyse stellar population data, particularly in cases where a significant portion of the stellar content exhibits low metallicity. Methods. We used the state-of-the-art stellar population synthesis code HR-pyPopStar with available stellar libraries to create a new set of models focused on low metallicity stellar populations. We have compared the new spectral energy distributions with the previous models of HR-pyPopStar for solar metallicity. Once we verified that the spectra, except for the oldest ages that show some differences in the molecular bands of the TiO and G band, are similar, we reanalysed the high resolution data from the globular cluster M 15 by finding a better estimate of its age and metallicity. Finally, we analysed a subsample of mostly star-forming dwarf galaxies from the MaNGA survey we found similar stellar mass-mean stellar metallicity weighted by light to other studies that studied star forming dwarf galaxies and slightly higher mean stellar metallicity than the other works that analysed all types of dwarf galaxies at the same time, but are within error bars.

The HCN line was detected at &gt;5σ on 14 Sep 2025 (UT) and a production rate of Q(HCN)=(4.0±1.7)×10^25 s<sup>-1</sup> was derived by non-LTE radiative transfer modelling. Preliminary estimates of the HCN/H<sub>2</sub>O and CN/HCN abundance ratios suggest values similar to Solar System comets.

<p>
One of the most remarkable discoveries of JWST is a population of compact, red sources at z &gt; 4, commonly referred to as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Spectroscopic identifications reported that most LRDs are active galactic nuclei (AGNs), which are preferentially found around z~6 and could imply a key phase in the formation and growth of black holes (BHs) in the early universe. Photometric surveys at lower redshift have recently been carried out to trace their evolution across cosmic time, and a small number of LRDs have been spectroscopically identified at both Cosmic Noon and in the local universe. Here we report the discovery of one of the lowest-z analogs of LRDs, J204837.26-002437.2 (hereafter J2048) at z = 0.4332, using new Gemini-N/GMOS IFU observations combined with archival multi-band photometric SED data. The GMOS data reveal extended blue emission from starburst with a star formation rate of 400 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr-1, together with an extended, highly fast ionized outflow. This is the first spectroscopic confirmation of extended host emission and outflow in an LRD-like galaxy, providing a unique laboratory for understanding the nature of their high-redshift counterparts. Moreover, J2048 would host an extremely overmassive BH with a BH-to-stellar mass ratio of 0.6, with the BH mass and host stellar mass estimated to be 10^10.2 and 10^10.4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, respectively. We discuss the origin and evolutionary fate of J2048, and the implications that such low-z analogs have for interpreting the properties of high-z LRDs.

<p> Djuna Croon, Tim Linden, Jeremy Sakstein </p>
<p>
Upcoming near-infrared facilities (e.g., JWST/NIRCam, ELT/MICADO) will dramatically increase the detectability of galactic center Cepheids despite extreme extinction at optical wavelengths. In this work, we study the impact of dark matter (DM) annihilation on Cepheid stars in the inner parsec of the Milky Way. We show that at densities ρ~ 10^5   GeV   cm^-3, blue-loop evolution can be suppressed, preventing the formation of low-mass (3-6   M<sub>&odot;</sub>) short-period (1-6 days) Cepheids. A dearth of such variables could provide indirect evidence for DM heating. Notably, this effect occurs at lower DM densities than required to impact main-sequence stars. Future surveys will thus offer a novel, complementary probe of DM properties in galactic nuclei.

We present mid-infrared spectroscopic observations of intermediate- to high-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) in the low-metallicity star-forming region NGC 346 located within the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We conduct these integral-field-unit observations with the Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium Resolution Spectroscopy instrument on board JWST. The brightest and most active star-forming region in the SMC, NGC 346 has a metallicity of ~1/5 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>, analogous to the era when star formation in the early Universe (z≃2) peaked. We discuss the emission and absorption features present in the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of five YSOs with coverage from 4.9-27.9μm and three other sources with partial spectral coverage. Via SED model-fitting, we estimate their parameters, finding masses ranging from 2.9-18.0 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. These targets show dusty silicates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and ices of CO<sub>2</sub>, CO, H<sub>2</sub>O and CH_3OH in their protostellar envelopes. We measure emission from H<sub>2</sub> and atomic fine-structure lines, suggesting the presence of protostellar jets and outflows. We detect H I lines indicating ongoing accretion and estimate accretion rates for each source which range from 2.50x10^-6-2.23x10^-4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>yr^-1 based on H I (7-6) line emission. We present evidence for a ~30,000AU protostellar jet traced by fine-structure, H I and H<sub>2</sub> emission about the YSO Y535, the first detection of a resolved protostellar outflow in the SMC, and the most distant yet detected.

Active galactic nuclei (AGN), star formation (SF), and galaxy interactions can drive turbulence in the gas of the ISM, which in turn plays a role in the SF within galaxies. The impact on molecular gas is of particular importance, as it serves as the primary fuel for SF. Our goal is to investigate the origin of turbulence and the emission of molecular gas, as well as low- and intermediate-ionization gas, in the inner few kpc of both AGN hosts and SF galaxies. We use JWST MIRI/MRS observations of a sample consisting of 54 galaxies at z&lt;0.1. We present fluxes of the H2 S(5)6.9091, [Ar II]6.9853, [FeII]5.3403, and [Ar III]8.9914 lines, along with velocity dispersion from W80. For galaxies with coronal emission, [Mg V]5.6098 is also included. Line ratios are compared to photoionization and shock models to explore the origin of the gas emission. AGNs exhibit broader emission lines than SFGs, with the largest velocity dispersions observed in radio-strong (RS) AGNs. H2 gas is less turbulent compared to ionized gas, while coronal gas presents higher velocity dispersions. The W80 values for the ionized gas exhibits a decrease from the nucleus out to radii of approximately 0.5&ndash;1 kpc, followed by an outward increase up to 2-3 kpc. In contrast, the H2 line widths generally display increasing profiles with distance from the center. Correlations W80 and line ratios such as H2 S(5)/[ArII] and [FeII]/[ArII] indicate that the most turbulent gas is associated with shocks, enhancing H2 and [FeII] emissions. We speculate that these shocked gas regions are produced by AGN outflows and jet-cloud interactions in AGN-dominated sources, while in SFGs, they may be created by stellar winds and mergers. This shock-induced gas heating may be an important mechanism of AGN (or stellar) feedback, preventing the gas from cooling and forming new stars.

### 187) [2510.02439](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02439v1): Mapping the Stellar Kinematics in the Central 240 Parsecs of M87 with the James Webb Space Telescope

<p> Refa M. Al-Amri, Jonelle L. Walsh, Emily R. Liepold, Chung-Pei Ma, Jenny E. Greene </p>
<p>
The supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the giant elliptical galaxy M87 is one of the most well-studied in the local universe, but the stellar- and gas-dynamical SMBH mass measurements disagree. As this galaxy is a key anchor for the upper end of the SMBH mass-host galaxy relations, we revisit the central 3''× 3'' (~ 240×240 pc) region of M87 with the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) integral field unit (IFU) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We implement several improvements to the reduction pipeline and obtain high signal-to-noise spectra (S/N ~ 150) in single 0.''05 spaxels across much of the NIRSpec field of view. We measure the detailed shape of the stellar line-of-sight velocity distribution, parameterized by Gauss-Hermite moments up to h_8, in ~ 2800 spatial bins, substantially improving upon the prior high angular resolution studies of the M87 stellar kinematics. The NIRSpec data reveal velocities with V ~ ± 45 km s<sup>-1</sup>, velocity dispersions that rise sharply to ~420 km s<sup>-1</sup> at a projected radius of 0.''45 (36 pc), and a slight elevation in h_4 toward the nucleus. We comprehensively test the robustness of the kinematics, including using multiple velocity template libraries and adopting different polynomials to adjust the template spectra. We find that the NIRSpec stellar kinematics seamlessly transition to recently measured large-scale stellar kinematics from optical Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) IFU data. These combined NIRSpec and KCWI kinematics provide continuous coverage from parsec to kiloparsec scales and will critically constrain future stellar-dynamical models of M87.

### 188) [2510.01747](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01747v1): Discovery of an Accretion Burst in a Free-Floating Planetary-Mass Object

<p>
We report the discovery of a long-lasting burst of disk accretion in Cha J11070768-7626326 (Cha 1107-7626), a young, isolated, 5-10 M_Jupiter object. In spectra taken with XSHOOTER at ESO's Very Large Telescope as well as NIRSPEC and MIRI on the James Webb Space Telescope, the object transitions from quiescence in April-May 2025 to a strongly enhanced accretion phase in June-August 2025. The line flux changes correspond to a 6-8-fold increase in the mass accretion rate, reaching 10^-7 M_Jupiteryr^-1, the highest measured in a planetary-mass object. During the burst, the Hα line develops a double-peaked profile with red-shifted absorption, as observed in stars and brown dwarfs undergoing magnetospheric accretion. The optical continuum increases by a factor of 3-6; the object is ~1.5-2 mag brighter in the R-band during the burst. Mid-infrared continuum fluxes rise by 10-20%, with clear changes in the hydrocarbon emission lines from the disk. We detect water vapour emission at 6.5-7 μm, which were absent in quiescence. By the end of our observing campaign, the burst was still ongoing, implying a duration of at least two months. A 2016 spectrum also shows high accretion levels, suggesting that this object may undergo recurring bursts. The observed event is inconsistent with typical variability in accreting young stars and instead matches the duration, amplitude and line spectrum of an EXor-type burst, making Cha1107-7626 the first substellar object with evidence of a potentially recurring EXor burst.

<p>
Eddington ratio is a paramount parameter governing the accretion history and life cycles of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). This short review presents a multi-faceted view of the importance of the Eddington ratio spanning varied AGN studies. We find that the Eddington ratio is crucial for standardizing the Radius-Luminosity (R-L) relation - a necessary step for employing quasars (QSOs) as standardizable cosmological probes to help clarify the standing of the Hubble tension. In this data-driven era, we consolidated disparate aspects by developing novel relations borne out of large datasets, such as the robust, nearly universal anti-correlation between fractional variability and Eddington ratio derived from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data, which is vital for interpreting forthcoming high-cadence surveys like Rubin Observatory's LSST. Addressing the conundrum where JWST results suggest an overabundance of massive high-redshift black holes, we demonstrate that local AGNs offer clarification: Changing-Look AGNs (CLAGNs), driven by rapid Eddington ratio shifts, cluster in the low-accretion regime, a rate independently confirmed by our integral field spectroscopy and photoionization modeling of a well-known Seyfert 2 galaxy, rich in high-ionization, forbidden, coronal lines. Conversely, for the high-redshift, high-luminosity population where traditional reverberation mapping (RM) is highly impractical, photometric reverberation mapping (PRM) offers a rapid alternative to constrain accretion disk sizes, enabling efficient estimates of black hole masses and Eddington ratios. Finally, we developed tailored semi-empirical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for extremely high-accretion quasars, successfully validating their characteristic extreme physical conditions.

### 190) [2510.01327](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01327v1): Lessons Learned from Studying Hα Galaxy Kinematics with Mock JWST/NIRSpec IFU Observations at z &gt; 6

<p> Siân Phillips, Francesca Rizzo, Mahsa Kohandel, Renske Smit, Andrea Pallottini </p>
<p>
Galaxies with a disk morphology have been established at z &gt; 9 with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). However, confirming their disky nature requires studying their gas kinematics, which can be challenging when relying solely on the warm gas observed by JWST. Unlike the cold gas traced by the Atacama Large Millimetre/Submillimetre Array (ALMA), warm gas is sensitive to outflows, complicating the interpretation of the disk dynamics. This elicits the question of how to compare information obtained from varied tracers, as well as how to physically interpret the low angular and spectral resolution observations generally available at high redshift. We address these challenges through comparative kinematic analysis of idealised and realistic NIRSpec/IFU mock observations derived from two galaxies in the SERRA suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations. With these synthetic data, we determine the robustness of dynamical information recovered from typical IFU observations, and test widely-used criteria for identifying disks and gaseous outflows at high redshift. We find that at the typical NIRSpec/IFU spectral and angular resolution (~ 0.05"/pixel), non-circular motions due to inflows or outflows can mimic the smooth velocity gradient indicative of a disk, and bias measured velocity dispersion upwards by a factor of 2-3×. As a result, the level of rotational support may be underestimated in the NIRSpec/IFU observations. However, the recovered dynamical mass appears to be relatively robust despite biases in v_rot and σ.

<p>
From the luminous quasars at z ~ 6 to the recent z ~ 9-11 AGNs revealed by JWST, observations of the earliest black hole (BH) populations can provide unique constraints on BH formation and growth models. We use the BRAHMA simulations with constrained initial conditions to investigate BH assembly in extreme overdense regions. The simulations implement heavy seeds (~ 10^4-10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) forming in dense, metal-poor gas exposed to sufficient Lyman-Werner flux. With gas accretion modeled via Bondi-Hoyle formalism and BH dynamics and mergers using a subgrid dynamical friction scheme, we isolate the impact of seeding, dynamics, accretion, and feedback on early BH growth. With fiducial stellar and AGN feedback inherited from IllustrisTNG, accretion is strongly suppressed at z ≳ 9, leaving mergers as the dominant growth channel. Gas accretion dominates at z ≲ 9, where permissive models (super-Eddington or low radiative efficiency) build ~ 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> BHs powering quasars by z ~ 6, while stricter IllustrisTNG-based prescriptions yield much lower BH masses (~ 10^6-10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>). Our seed models strongly affect merger-driven growth at z ≳ 9: only the most lenient models (with ~ 10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> seeds) produce enough BH mergers to reach ≳ 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> by z ~ 10, consistent with current estimates for GN-z11. Our dynamical friction model gives low merger efficiencies, hindering the buildup of ≳ 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub> BHs by z ~ 9-10, as currently inferred for GHZ9, UHZ1, and CAPERS-LRD-z9. If the BH-to-stellar mass ratios of these sources are indeed as extreme as currently inferred, they would require either very short BH merger timescales or reduced AGN thermal feedback. Weaker stellar feedback boosts both star formation and BH accretion and cannot raise these ratios.

### 192) [2510.01314](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01314v1): JWST Observations of Starbursts: PAHs Closely Trace the Cool Phase of M82's Galactic Wind

<p>
Stellar feedback drives multiphase gas outflows from starburst galaxies, but the interpretation of dust emission in these winds remains uncertain. To investigate this, we analyze new JWST mid-infrared images tracing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission at 7.7 and 11.3~μm from the outflow of the prototypical starburst M82 out to 3.2 kpc. We find that PAH emission shows significant correlations with CO, Hα, and X-ray emission within the outflow, though the strengths and behaviors of these correlations vary with gas phase and distance from the starburst. PAH emission correlates strongly with cold molecular gas, with PAH&ndash;CO scaling relations in the wind nearly identical to those in galaxy disks despite the very different conditions. The Hα&ndash;PAH correlation indicates that Hα traces the surfaces of PAH-bearing clouds, consistent with arising from ionized layers produced by shocks. Meanwhile the PAH&ndash;X-ray correlation disappears once distance effects are controlled for past 2~kpc, suggesting that PAHs are decoupled from the hot gas and the global correlation merely reflects the large-scale structure of the outflow. The PAH-to-neutral gas ratio remains nearly flat to 2~kpc, with variations following changes in the radiation field. This implies that the product of PAH abundance and dust-to-gas ratio does not change significantly over the inner portion of the outflow. Together, these results demonstrate that PAHs robustly trace the cold phase of M82's wind, surviving well beyond the starburst and providing a powerful, high-resolution proxy for mapping the life cycle of entrained cold material in galactic outflows.

### 193) [2510.01315](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01315v1): Neutral hydrogen in and around galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization

<p>
JWST spectra revealing Lyman-α (Lyα) absorption in z~ 5-14 galaxies offer a unique probe of reionization's earliest stages. However, disentangling absorption by the increasingly neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) from that in galaxies' interstellar and circumgalactic medium (ISM, CGM) remains challenging due to the poorly constrained nature of neutral hydrogen (HI) in and around galaxies at these redshifts. We use the SERRA high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations to characterize the HI distribution and its evolution along sightlines to star-forming regions during reionization, to interpret the contribution of local HI (ISM+CGM) to Lyα absorption in z&gt;5 spectra. We analyze ~ 100 z=6-9.5 galaxies, generating mock sightlines from each galaxy's star formation peak. We study the sightline distribution of HI column densities (N_HI) and its variation with radius, halo mass and redshift. We find broad sightline variation in N_HI (0.5-1.5dex) due to complex ISM morphology driven by bursty star formation, with median log(N_HI/cm<sup>2</sup>) ≃ 21-22. Dense ISM gas is the dominant origin of damped Lyα absorption (DLA) systems along sightlines towards star-forming regions, outweighing gas in the CGM, filaments and proximate absorbers. Median N_HI increases with halo mass, scaling roughly with the virial radius, as expected due to larger potentials and more extended CGM, but shows negligible redshift evolution at fixed halo mass. This suggests post-reionization N_HI distributions may provide useful priors to interpret IGM damping wings at higher redshifts. To interpret strong z&gt;5 DLA candidates found by JWST, we investigate N_HI&gt;10^22 cm<sup>2</sup> sightlines. These trace dense, metal-enriched ISM within &lt;1 kpc of massive halos, a scenario testable with higher-resolution spectroscopy.

<p> Isabelle Cherchneff, Dahbia Talbi, José Cernicharo </p>
<p>
Context. Core-collapse Supernovae of Type II contribute the chemical enrichment of galaxies through explosion. Their role as dust producers in the high-redshift Universe may be of paramount importance. However, the type and amount of dust they synthesise after outburst is still a matter of debate and the formation processes remain unclear. Aims. We aim to identify and understand the chemical processes at play in the dust formation scenario, and derive mass yields for molecules and dust clusters at late post-explosion time. Methods. We revisit existing models by improving on the physics and chemistry of the supernova ejecta. We identify and consider new chemical species and pathways underpinning the formation of dust clusters, and apply a unique exhaustive chemical network to the entire ejecta of a Supernova with a 15 M<sub>&odot;</sub> progenitor. We test this new chemistry for various gas conditions in the ejecta, and derive mass yields for molecules and dust clusters. Results. We obtain the molecular component of the ejecta up to 11 years after explosion. The most abundant species are, in order of decreasing masses, O2, CO, SiS, SiO, CO2, SO2, CaS, N2, and CS. We identify molecules that are tracers of high-density clumps. As for dust clusters, we find the composition is dominated by silicates and silica, along with carbon dust, but with modest amounts of alumina. Pure metal clusters and metal sulphide and oxide clusters have negligible masses. High-density gas favours the formation of carbon clusters in the outer ejecta region whereas low temperatures hamper the formation of silicates in the oxygen core. The results are in good agreement with existing astronomical data and recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. They highlight the importance of chemistry for the derivation of dust budget from Supernovae.

We present the fourth data release of JADES, the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey, providing deep spectroscopic observations in the two GOODS fields. A companion paper presents the target selection, spectroscopic redshifts and success rates, and in this paper, we discuss the data reduction and present emission line flux measurements. The spectroscopy in this work consists of medium-depth, deep and ultradeep NIRSpec/MSA spectra of 5,190 targets, covering the spectral range 0.6&ndash;5.5~&mu;m and observed with both the low-dispersion prism (R=30&ndash;300) and all three medium-resolution gratings (R=500&ndash;1,500). We describe the data reduction, analysis and description of the data products included in this data release. In total, we measured 3,297 robust redshifts out of 5,190 targets, spanning a redshift range from z=0.5 up to z=14.2, including 974 at z&gt;4. This data release includes 1-d and 2-d fully reduced spectra with 3 and 5 pixel extractions, with slit-loss corrections and background subtraction optimized for point sources. Furthermore, we provide redshifts and S/N&gt;5 emission-line flux catalogues for the prism and grating spectra, as well as new guidelines to use these data products. Lastly, we are launching a new JADES Online Database, designed to enable quick selection and browsing of this data release. Altogether, these data provide the largest statistical sample to date to characterise the properties of galaxy populations across Cosmic time.

This paper accompanies Data Release 4 of the JWST Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), which presents the full NIRSpec spectroscopy of the survey. We provide spectra of 5190 targets across GOODS-North and GOODS-South (including the Hubble Ultra Deep Field), observed with the low-dispersion (R ~ 30-300) prism and three medium-resolution (R ~ 1000) gratings spanning 0.8 &lt; λ&lt; 5.5 microns; 2654 were also observed with the higher-resolution (R ~ 2700) G395H grating. The tiered survey design obtained more than 20 hr exposures for ~ 700 galaxies in the Deep and Ultra Deep tiers, and shallower observations (~ 1-3 hr per setting) of &gt; 4400 galaxies in the Medium tiers. Targets were selected from photometric redshifts or colours, with priority given to rest-UV-selected galaxies at z &gt; 5.7 and F444W-selected galaxies at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 5.7. We describe the full target selection and present spectroscopic redshifts and success rates. In total we obtain robust redshifts for 3297 galaxies, including 396 at z &gt; 5.7 and 2545 at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 5.7. To facilitate uniform analyses, we define 'gold' sub-samples based on UV- and F444W-selection. Using the parent samples and redshift success rates, we construct rest-UV luminosity functions at 6 ≲ z ≲ 9 from the Medium- and Deep-JWST tiers. Our number densities agree well with previous determinations from both photometric and spectroscopic samples, with modest interloper fractions confirming the reliability of photometric UV-bright galaxy selections at these redshifts.

We present a search for z≃7 Lyman-break galaxies using the 1.72   deg<sup>2</sup> near-infrared UltraVISTA survey in the COSMOS field, reaching 5 σ depths in Y of 26.2. We incorporate deep optical and Spitzer imaging for a full spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting analysis. We find 289 candidate galaxies at 6.5≤ z ≤ 7.5 covering -22.6 ≤ M_UV ≤ -20.2, faint enough to overlap with Hubble Space Telescope studies. We conduct a separate selection by including complementary Euclid performance verification imaging (reaching 5 σ depths of 26.3), yielding 140 galaxies in 0.65   deg<sup>2</sup>, with 38 sources unique to this sample. We compute the rest-frame UV luminosity function (UV LF) from our samples, extending below the knee (M^*=-21.14^+0.28_-0.25). We find that the shape of the UV LF is consistent with both a Schechter function and double-power law (DPL) at the magnitudes probed by this sample, with a DPL preferred at M_UV&lt;-22.5 when bright-end results are included. The UltraVISTA+Euclid sample provides a clean measurement of the LF due to the overlapping near-infrared filters identifying molecular absorption features in the SEDs of ultra-cool dwarf interlopers, and additional faint galaxies are recovered. A comparison with JWST LFs at z&gt;7 suggests a gentle evolution in the bright-end slope, although this is limited by a lack of robust bright-end measurements at z&gt;9. We forecast that in the Euclid Deep Fields, the removal of contaminant ultra-cool dwarfs as point sources will be possible at J_E &lt; 24.5. Finally, we present a high-equivalent-width Lyman-α emitter candidate identified by combining HSC, VISTA, and Euclid broadband photometry, highlighting the synergistic power these instruments will have in the Euclid Auxiliary Fields for identifying extreme sources in the Epoch of Reionisation.

### 198) [2510.00923](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00923v1): Forecasting the Observable Rates of Gravitationally Lensed Supernovae for the PASSAGES Dusty Starbursts

<p>
More than 60 years have passed since the first formal suggestion to use strongly-lensed supernovae to measure the expansion rate of the Universe through time-delay cosmography. Yet, fewer than 10 such objects have ever been discovered. We consider the merits of a targeted strategy focused on lensed hyperluminous infrared galaxies &ndash; among the most rapidly star-forming galaxies known in the Universe. With star formation rates (SFRs) ~ 200 - 6000~rmM<sub>&odot;</sub>~rmyr^-1, the ~ 30 objects in the Planck All-Sky Survey to Analyze Gravitationally-lensed Extreme Starbursts (PASSAGES) are excellent candidates for a case study, in particular, and have already led to the discovery of the multiply-imaged SN H0pe. Considering their lens model-corrected SFRs, we estimate their intrinsic supernova rates to be an extraordinary 1.8 - 65~rmyr^-1 (core-collapse) and 0.2 - 6.4~rmyr^-1 (Type Ia). Moreover, these massive starbursts typically have star-forming companions which are unaccounted for in this tally. We demonstrate a strong correlation between Einstein radius and typical time delays, with cluster lenses often exceeding several months (and therefore most favorable for high-precision H_0 inferences). A multi-visit monitoring campaign with a sensitive infrared telescope (namely, JWST) is necessary to mitigate dust attenuation. Still, a porous interstellar medium and clumpy star formation in these extreme galaxies might produce favorable conditions for detecting supernovae as transient point sources. Targeted campaigns of known lensed galaxies to discover new lensed supernovae can greatly complement wide-area cadenced surveys. Increasing the sample size helps to realize the potential of supernova time-delay cosmography to elucidate the Hubble tension through a single-step measurement, independent of other H_0 techniques.

### 199) [2510.00400](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00400v1): Uncertainties in high-z galaxy properties inferred from SED fitting using JWST NIRCam photometry

<p> Jiyoung Choe, Taysun Kimm, Harley Katz, Maxime Rey, Daniel Han, J. K. Jang, Joki Rosdahl </p>
<p>
Numerous high-z galaxies have recently been observed with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), providing new insights into early galaxy evolution. Their physical properties are typically derived through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, but the reliability of this approach for such early systems remains uncertain. Applying \sc Bagpipes on simulated SEDs at z=6 from the \sc Sphinx^20 cosmological simulation, we examine uncertainties in the recovery of stellar masses, star formation rates (SFR_10), and stellar metallicities from mock JWST/Near-Infrared Camera photometry. Even without dust or emission lines, fitting the intrinsic stellar continuum overestimates the stellar mass by about 60&percnt; on average (and by up to a factor of five for low-mass galaxies with recent starbursts) and underestimates SFR_10 by a factor of two, owing to inaccurate star formation histories and age-metallicity degeneracies. The addition of dust and nebular emission further amplifies these biases, yielding offsets of approximately +0.3 and -0.4 dex in stellar mass and SFR_10, respectively, while leaving stellar metallicities largely unconstrained. Incorporating bands free of strong emission lines, such as F410M, helps mitigate stellar mass overestimation by disentangling line emission from older stellar populations. We also find that best-fit or likelihood-weighted estimates are generally more accurate than median posterior values. Although stellar mass functions are reproduced reasonably well, the slope of the star formation main sequence depends sensitively on the adopted fitting model. Overall, these results underscore the importance of careful modelling when interpreting high-z photometry, particularly for galaxies with recent star formation burst and/or strong emission lines, to minimise systematic biases in derived physical properties.

### 200) [2510.00292](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00292v1): The Colors of Ices: Measuring ice column density through photometry

<p>
Ices imprint strong absorption features in the near- and mid-infrared, but until recently they have been studied almost exclusively with spectroscopy toward small samples of bright sources. We show that JWST photometry alone can reveal and quantify interstellar ices and present a new open-source modeling tool, icemodels, to produce synthetic photometry of ices based on laboratory measurements. We provide reference tables indicating which filters are likely to be observably affected by ice absorption. Applying these models to NIRCam data of background stars behind Galactic Center (GC) clouds, and validating against NIRSpec spectra of Galactic disk sources, we find clear signatures of CO, H<sub>2</sub>O, and CO<sub>2</sub> ices and evidence for excess absorption in the F356W filter likely caused by CH-bearing species such as methanol. The ice ratios differ between the Galactic disk and Center, with GC clouds showing a higher H<sub>2</sub>O fraction. The large ice abundance in CO, H2O, and possibly complex molecules hints that the high complex molecule abundances observed in gas emission in the CMZ are driven by ice-phase chemistry in non-star-forming gas. Accounting for all likely ices, we infer that &gt;25% of the total carbon is frozen into CO ice in the GC, which exceeds the entire solar-neighborhood carbon budget. By assuming the freezeout fraction is the same in GC and disk clouds, we obtain a metallicity measurement indicating that Z_GC≳2.5Z<sub>&odot;</sub>. These results demonstrate that photometric ice measurements are feasible with JWST and capable of probing the metallicity structure of the cold interstellar medium.

<p>
We present the star formation and dust attenuation properties for a sample of 602 galaxies at redshifts 3&lt;z&lt;7, as part of the JADES survey. Our analysis is based on measurements of the Hα/Hβ Balmer Decrement using medium resolution (R~1000) spectroscopic observations with the JWST/NIRSpec Micro-Shutter Assembly. Stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs) are inferred with ttProspector using deep multi-band imaging. We utilize the Balmer decrement to measure dust-corrected Hα-based SFRs, taking into account the subsolar metallicities observed in galaxies at high redshift. We confirm, with our large sample size, that the correlation between the Balmer decrement and stellar mass is already established out to z~7. We find that the relation between the Balmer decrement and stellar mass does not significantly evolve from the local universe to z~7. We investigate the UV slope as a function of the Balmer optical depth and find that the best-fit correlation for our high redshift sample is sSFR dependent and significantly different at high redshift when compared to galaxies at z≈ 0 and z ≈ 2. For the highest sSFR galaxies in our sample, there is no significant correlation between the UV slope and Balmer optical depth. This is evidence that the UV slope should be used with great caution to correct for dust in high redshift galaxies.

### 202) [2510.00187](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00187v1): SHAPE. I. A SOM-SED hybrid approach for efficient galaxy parameter estimation leveraging JWST

<p> Zihao Wang, Tao Wang, Ke Xu, Hanwen Sun, Ruining Tian, Qi Hao </p>
<p>
With the launch and application of next-generation ground- and space-based telescopes, astronomy has entered the era of big data, necessitating more efficient and robust data analysis methods. Most traditional parameter estimation methods are unable to reconcile differences between photometric systems. Ideally, we would like to optimally rely on high-quality observation data provided by, e.g., JWST, for calibrating and improving upcoming wide-field surveys such as the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) and Euclid. To this end, we introduce a new approach (SHAPE, SOM-SED Hybrid Approach for efficient Parameter Estimation) that can bridge different photometric systems and efficiently estimate key galaxy parameters, such as stellar mass (M<sub>&sext;</sub>) and star formation rate (SFR), leveraging data from a large and deep JWST/NIRCam and MIRI survey (PRIMER). As a test of the methodology, we focus on galaxies at z~ 1.5-2.5. To mitigate discrepancies between input colors and the training set, we replace the default SOM weights with stacked SEDs from each cell, extending the applicability of our model to other photometric catalogs (e.g., COSMOS2020). By incorporating a SED library (SED Lib), we apply this JWST-calibrated model to the COSMOS2020 catalog. Despite the limited sample size and potential template-related uncertainties, SOM-derived parameters exhibit a good agreement with results from SED-fitting using extended photometry. Under identical photometric constraints from CSST and Euclid bands, our method outperforms traditional SED-fitting techniques in SFR estimation, exhibiting both a reduced bias (-0.01 vs. 0.18) and a smaller σ_NMAD (0.25 vs. 0.35). With its computational efficiency capable of processing 10^6 sources per CPU per hour during the estimation phase, this JWST-calibrated estimator holds significant promise for next-generation wide-field surveys.

### 203) [2510.00112](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00112v1): JWST-discovered AGN: evidence for heavy obscuration in the type-2 sample from the first stacked X-ray detection

<p>
One of the most puzzling properties of the high-redshift AGN population recently discovered by JWST, including both broad-line and narrow-line sources, is their X-ray weakness. With very few exceptions, and regardless of the optical classification, they are undetected at the limits of the deepest Chandra fields, even when stacking signals from tens of sources in standard observed-frame energy intervals (soft, hard, and full bands). It has been proposed that their elusive nature in the X-ray band is due to heavy absorption by dust-free gas or intrinsic weakness, possibly due to high, super-Eddington accretion. In this work, we perform X-ray stacking in three customized rest-frame energy ranges (1-4, 4-7.25, and 10-30 keV) of a sample of 50 Type 1 and 38 Type 2 AGN identified by JWST in the CDFS and CDFN fields. For the Type 2 sub-sample, we reach a total of about 210 Ms exposure, and we report a significant (~ 3σ) detection in the hardest (10-30 keV rest frame) band, along with relatively tight upper limits in the rest frame softer energy bands. The most straightforward interpretation is in terms of heavy obscuration due to gas column densities well within the Compton thick regime (&gt; 2 × 10^24 cm<sup>2</sup>) with a large covering factor, approaching 4π. The same procedure applied to the Type 1 sub-sample returns no evidence for a significant signal in about 140 Ms stacked data in any of the adopted bands, confirming their surprisingly elusive nature in the X-ray band obtained with previous stacking experiments. A brief comparison with the current observations and the implications for the evolution of AGN are discussed.

### 204) [2510.00111](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00111v1): JADES: An Abundance of Ultra-Distant T- and Y-Dwarfs in Deep Extragalactic Data

<p>
Ultra-cool T- (T_eff ≈ 500 - 1200 K) and Y-dwarfs (T_eff ≤ssapprox 500 K) have historically been found only a few hundred parsecs from the Sun. The sensitivity and wavelength coverage of the NIRCam instrument on board the James Webb Space Telescope offer a unique method for finding low-temperature brown dwarfs in deep extragalactic datasets out to multiple kiloparsecs. Here we report on the selection of a sample of 41 brown dwarf and brown dwarf candidates across the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) in the GOODS-S and GOODS-N regions. We introduce a new open-source Bayesian tool, the Near-Infrared Fitting for T and Y-dwarfs (ttNIFTY), to derive effective temperatures, metallicities, and distances from JWST photometry. We find that 31 candidates have fits consistent with T-dwarf temperatures out to 5 - 6 kpc, and 10 candidates have fits consistent with Y-dwarf temperatures out to 1 - 2 kpc. The majority of the sources are best fit with sub-solar metallicity models, consistent with them being subdwarfs in the Milky Way thick disk and halo. We report proper motions for nine brown dwarf candidates (three are newly presented), and calculate the number density of T- and Y-dwarfs as a function of temperature and distance above the Milky Way midplane. We further discuss how Y-dwarfs can serve as contaminants in the search for ultra-high-redshift galaxies. Together, these results demonstrate the power of deep JWST extragalactic imaging to probe the coldest substellar populations far beyond the solar neighborhood, providing new constraints on the Milky Way's structure and brown dwarf demographics.

### 205) [2510.00103](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00103v2): The warm outer layer of a Little Red Dot as the source of [Fe II] and collisional Balmer lines with scattering wings

<p>
The population of the Little Red Dots (LRDs) may represent a key phase of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. A cocoon of dense excited gas is emerging as key component to explain the most striking properties of LRDs, such as strong Balmer breaks and Balmer absorption, as well as the weak IR emission. To dissect the structure of LRDs, we analyze new deep JWST/NIRSpec PRISM and G395H spectra of FRESCO-GN-9771, one of the most luminous known LRDs at z=5.5. These reveal a strong Balmer break, broad Balmer lines and very narrow [O III] emission. We unveil a forest of optical [Fe II] lines, which we argue is emerging from a dense (n_H=10^9-10 cm^-3) warm layer with electron temperature T_e≈7000 K. The broad wings of Hα and Hβ have an exponential profile due to electron scattering in this same layer. The high Hα:Hβ:Hγ flux ratio of ≈10.4:1:0.14 is an indicator of collisional excitation and resonant scattering dominating the Balmer line emission. A narrow Hγ component, unseen in the other two Balmer lines due to outshining by the broad components, could trace the ISM of a normal host galaxy with a star formation rate ~5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1. The warm layer is mostly opaque to Balmer transitions, producing a characteristic P-Cygni profile in the line centers suggesting outflowing motions. This same layer is responsible for shaping the Balmer break. The broad-band spectrum can be reasonably matched by a simple photoionized slab model that dominates the λ&gt;1500 Å continuum and a low mass (~10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) galaxy that could explain the narrow [O III], with only subdominant contribution to the UV continuum. Our findings indicate that Balmer lines are not directly tracing gas kinematics near the SMBH and that the BH mass scale is likely much lower than virial indicators suggest.

The data reveal broad Balmer emission from Hα-Hδ and Balmer absorption in Hα-Hε. The absorption lines are kinematically split: Hα is blueshifted while higher-order lines are redshifted suggesting complex gas kinematics; their relative ratios are inconsistent with a single, passive absorbing screen. The line depths require absorption of both the BLR and the continuum, ruling out a stellar origin, consistent with the smooth Balmer break. We fit the broad Hγ-Hα lines and find the data favor a double-Gaussian effective profile, although exponential wings are evident. Depending on the adopted profile, single-epoch virial estimates give log(M<sub>&bull;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=7.86-8.39 and λ_Edd=1.7-0.4. The dynamical mass implied by the narrow lines is low log(Mdyn/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=9.1, suggesting an overmassive black hole. The narrow lines display little attenuation, A_V&lt;0.5 mag; while broad Hα/Hβ~9 and the broad Balmer decrements are inconsistent with standard dust attenuation curves, suggesting collisional processes. The forbidden-line spectrum includes auroral [S II] and [N II], and a forest of [Fe II] lines. Line ratios and kinematics indicate a stratified narrow-line region with both low (n_e=420 cm^-3) and high densities (n_e≳ 6.3×10^5 cm^-3). We detect metal absorption lines in both the optical (Ca II and Na I) and UV range (Fe II UV1-UV3). Our results support a picture of a compact AGN embedded in a dense, high covering-factor and stratified cocoon, with complex neutral-gas kinematics. While the choice of broad-line profile affects the virial estimates of M<sub>&bull;</sub>, we find the effect to be of order 0.6 dex between the different approaches.

High-redshift (z &gt; 2) massive quiescent (MQ) galaxies provide an opportunity to probe the key physical processes driving the fuelling and quenching of star formation in the early Universe. Observational evidence suggests a possible evolutionary link between MQs and dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs; or submillimetre galaxies), another extreme high-redshift population. However, galaxy formation models have historically struggled to reproduce these populations - especially simultaneously - limiting our understanding of their formation and connection, particularly in light of recent JWST findings. In previous work, we presented a re-calibrated version of the L-Galaxies semi-analytic model that provides an improved match to observationally-inferred number densities of both DSFG and MQ populations. In this work, we use this new model to investigate the progenitors of MQs at z &gt; 2 and the physical mechanisms that lead to their quenching. We find that most MQs at z &gt; 2 were sub-millimetre-bright (S_870 &gt; 1 mJy) at some point in their cosmic past. The stellar mass of MQs is strongly correlated with the maximum submillimetre flux density attained over their history, and this relation appears to be independent of redshift. However, only a minority of high-redshift DSFGs evolve into MQs by z = 2. The key distinction between typical DSFGs and MQ progenitors lies in their merger histories: MQ progenitors experience an early major merger that triggers a brief, intense starburst and rapid black hole growth, depleting their cold gas reservoirs. In our model, AGN feedback subsequently prevents further gas cooling, resulting in quenching. In contrast, the broader DSFG population remains sub-millimetre-bright, with star formation proceeding primarily via secular processes, becoming quenched later.

Charting the Epoch of Reionization demands robust assessments of what drives the production of ionizing photons in high-redshift star-forming galaxies (SFGs), and requires better predictive capabilities from current observations. Using a sample of N=159 SFGs at 1&lt;z&lt;8, observed with deep medium-resolution spectroscopy from the JWST/NIRSpec EXCELS survey, we perform a statistical analysis of their ionizing photon production efficiencies (ξ<sub>ion</sub>). We consider ξ<sub>ion</sub>, measured with Balmer line measurements, in relation to a number of key galaxy properties including; nebular emission line strengths (W_λ(Hα) and W_λ( [OIII])), UV luminosity (M_UV) and UV slope (β_UV), as well as dust attenuation (E(B-V)_neb) and redshift. Implementing a Bayesian linear regression methodology, we fit ξ<sub>ion</sub> against the principal observables while fully marginalising over all measurement uncertainties, mitigating against the impact of outliers and determining the intrinsic scatter. Significant relations between ξ<sub>ion</sub> and W_λ(Hα), W_λ([OIII]) and β_UV are recovered. Moreover, the weak trends with M_UV and redshift can be fully explained by the remaining property dependencies. Expanding our analysis to multivariate regression, we determine that W_λ(Hα) or W_λ([OIII]), along with β_UV and E(B-V)_neb, are the most important observables for accurately predicting ξ<sub>ion</sub>,0. The latter identifies the most common outliers as SFGs with relatively high E(B-V)_neb≳0.5, possibly indicative of obscured star-formation or strong differential attenuation. Combining these properties enable ξ<sub>ion</sub>,0 to be inferred with an accuracy of ~0.15 dex, with a population intrinsic scatter of σ_int~0.035 dex.

We present JWST NIRSpec and MIRI MRS observations of the central kiloparsec of M58 (NGC 4579), a nearby LINER galaxy hosting a low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN; L_bol ~ 10^42 erg s<sup>-1</sup>) with a low-power jet. These data provide an unprecedented view of the warm molecular gas phase and reveal clear signatures of feedback. We detect 44 H<sub>2</sub> lines, including bright pure rotational lines (S(1)-S(18)) and rovibrational lines up to ν=2, probing a wide range of excitation conditions. Excitation diagrams show that rotational lines follow a power-law temperature distribution with an exponential cutoff, consistent with heating by low-velocity shocks. H<sub>2</sub> rovibrational lines deviate from thermal models primarily because of sub-thermal excitation at low density. Additionally, there may be a 10% contribution powered by AGN X-ray photons in the nucleus. The dust lanes associated with the spiral inflow appear dynamically undisturbed but show signs of shock heating, while the inner ~200 pc exhibits turbulent kinematics produced by outflowing molecular gas. These results reveal the subtle yet measurable impact of LLAGN feedback on the interstellar medium, demonstrating that even weak, vertically oriented jets and low radiative accretion rates can perturb molecular gas and regulate nuclear reservoirs. This study highlights JWST's transformative ability to uncover hidden modes of AGN feedback.

<p>
We investigate the resolved properties of star-forming clumps and their host galaxies at 0.5&lt;z&lt;5 in the JWST CANUCS fields. We find that the fraction of clumpy galaxies peaks near z~2 for galaxies with masses of log(M_g,*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≥10, while galaxies with masses of 8.5 ≤ log(M_g,*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &lt; 10 show lower clumpy fractions with little redshift evolution. We identify and measure individual clump masses, finding that the aggregated clump stellar mass function (cSMF) follows a power-law slope of α= -2 across all redshift bins, broadly consistent with itin-situ clump formation. However, when split by galaxy masses, the cSMF is found to be flatter (α~-1.6) for massive galaxies and steeper (α~-2.3) for lower mass galaxies, with little redshift evolution in both cases. We explore how different formation mechanisms and disruptive processes affect the shape of the clump mass function. In particular, we find that the cSMF slope is flatter with increasing gas fractions in younger clump populations (&lt;300 Myr old), suggesting that higher gas availability leads to more massive clumps forming at the time of formation. Alternatively, many high-redshift galaxies in the sample have disturbed morphologies and simulations show that clumps of itex-situ origins can flatten the cSMF slope. We also investigate the evolution of clump populations, where we find the cSMF slope become flatter as clumps evolve and age. We interpret this as an indication of the long-term survivability of massive clumps, with feedback mechanisms preferentially disrupting low-mass clumps. Overall, the galaxy-mass dependent cSMF and age distribution point to a complex history for clumps, involving different and competing mechanisms for their formation and destruction.

Using ultra-deep JWST NIRCam imaging from the GLIMPSE Survey, enhanced by gravitational lensing of the AbellS1063 cluster, we investigate the faintest galaxies ever observed in the redshift range z~9 to z~15. We identify 105 galaxy candidates within this range, spanning absolute ultraviolet (UV) magnitudes from M_UV~-18 to M_UV~-13 mag, about three magnitudes fainter, on average, than prior JWST studies. We place strong constraints on the ultra-faint end of the UV luminosity function (UVLF), finding minimal evolution in the faint-end slope, which varies from α=-2.01±0.20 at z=9 to α=-2.10±0.19 at z=13. This behaviour contrasts with the rapid evolution of the faint-end slope observed from z~0 to z~9. By integrating the UVLF down to M_UV=-16, we derive the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD)from z=9 to z=13, revealing a best-fit redshift evolution that follows &prop;(1+z)^-2.94^+0.06_-0.10. This slope is significantly shallower than predictions from most theoretical models. Extending the integration limit to M_UV=-13, we find that galaxies fainter than M_UV=-16 contribute more than 50% of the total cosmic SFR density at z~12. The observed excess in the cosmic SFRD at these high redshifts may suggest an enhancement in the star formation efficiency during the earliest phases of galaxy formation. Alternatively, this could result from other physical mechanisms, such as bursty star formation histories; minimal dust attenuation; or an evolving initial mass function. However, existing models that incorporate these scenarios fail to fully reproduce the observed redshift evolution of SFRD. Finally, we acknowledge the potential impact of low-redshift contamination and cosmic variance, as the small survey volume may not represent the broader galaxy population. Similar observations in different fields and spectroscopic confirmation are required to validate these findings

JWST has revealed an abundance of supermassive black holes (BHs) in the early Universe, and yet the lowest mass seed black holes that gave rise to these populations remain elusive. Here we present a systematic search for broad-line Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) in some of the faintest high-z galaxies surveyed yet by combining ultra-deep JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy with the strong lensing aid in Abell S1063. By employing the profile of the [OIII]λ5007 emission lines as a template for narrow-line components and carefully cross-validating with mock observations, we identify a sample of ten broad-line AGNs at 4.5&lt;z&lt;7.0 (eight secure, two tentative). The inferred BH masses from the broad Hα line explore the intermediate BH mass regime down to ~ 10^5.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. The stellar mass (M_*) is estimated with a galaxy+AGN composite model, and we find the BH to stellar mass ratio spans down to M_BH/M_*≲ 0.1&percnt;, unveiling populations on the empirical M_BH-M<sub>&sext;</sub> relation observed in the local universe. We also derive the black hole mass function and investigate its low-mass end at this epoch. While we confirm the agreement of our results with previous studies at M_BH≳10^6.5M<sub>&odot;</sub>, we find the mass range of ~ 10^5.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> features an enhanced abundance with respect to the extrapolated best-fit Schechter function. Comparison with theoretical models suggests that a possible origin for this enhanced abundance is the direct-collapse BH formation, supporting the scenario that the direct collapse of massive gas clouds is a significant pathway for the earliest supermassive BHs.

[Shortened for arXiv] We conduct a systematic search for log(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 9.5 quiescent galaxies at z &gt; 3 in six extragalactic deep fields observed with NIRCam, with the goal of extracting their physical and statistical features in a uniform and self-consistent manner. We exploit the ASTRODEEP-JWST photometric catalogs to single out robust candidates, including sources quenched only a few tens of Myr before the observation. We apply a SED-fitting procedure which explores three functional forms of star formation history and the χ^2 probabilities of the solutions, with additional checks to minimise the contamination from interlopers, tuning our selection criteria against available spectroscopic data from the DAWN archive and simulated catalogs. We select 633 candidates, which we rank by a reliability parameter based on the probabilities of the quiescent and alternative star-forming solutions, with 291 candidates tagged as "gold". According to the best-fit models, 79&percnt; of the massive (log(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 10.5) quiescent galaxies at 3 &lt; z &lt; 5 stopped forming stars at least 150 Myr before the time of observation, while 89&percnt; of low-mass sources have been quenched for less than 150 Myr. The abundance of low-mass old quiescent systems does not increase significantly with time from z = 5 to 3: low-mass objects seem to be experiencing a short episode of quenching followed by rejuvenation ("breathing''), consistent with a downsizing scenario of galaxy formation. We also find an abrupt drop in the density of massive quiescent candidates at z &gt; 5. We derive estimates for the number density of early passive galaxies up to z = 10 and compare them against various models: tensions with data remain in the modeling of the observed bimodality of time passed since quenching as a function of mass.

### 214) [2509.08448](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08448v2): Black hole mass function shift in proto-stellar-clusters driven by gas accretion

<p> Zacharias Roupas </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has observed compact, massive proto-stellar clusters of low metallicity in the Cosmic Gems arc galaxy at high redshift, which represent likely precursors to globular clusters. We model the mass growth of stellar black holes (BHs) during the first few Myr of the life of a massive, compact, gaseous stellar cluster before stellar feedback expels the primordial gas. At high redshift, in a lower metallicity environment stellar winds get weaker allowing for larger gas-depletion time-scales in the cluster despite of energetic pair-instability supernova (PISN) feedback for sufficiently compact clusters. Mass segregation drives the massive stellar progenitors of BHs in the center of the cluster where gas is most dense. We estimate the conditions for which the initial black hole mass function (BHMF), with a PISN-induced cut-off &lt;55M<sub>&odot;</sub>, gets shifted to values within the upper BH mass gap, ~ 60-130M<sub>&odot;</sub>, or higher, as observed by Gravitational Wave (GW) experiments LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. We find that the BHs are shifted by the end of gas depletion to values within and above the mass gap, well within the range of BH components of the recent GW-signal GW231123, depending on total mass, star formation efficiency, metallicity and compactness. The individual BH mass increase follows approximately a surprisingly steep power law with respect to initial BH mass with an exponent in the range ≈ 4-6. This occurs in gaseous proto-stellar clusters that are sufficiently massive and compact, with typical values of total mass ~ 10^6M<sub>&odot;</sub> and size ~ 1pc. Our analysis suggests that proto-stellar clusters at high redshift such as Cosmic Gems arc clusters have generated through early gas accretion, BHs as heavy as ~ 10^2-10^3M<sub>&odot;</sub>.

We used observations from the JWST Emission Line Survey (JELS) to measure the half-light radii (r_e) of 23 Hα-emitting star-forming (SF) galaxies at z=6.1 in the PRIMER/COSMOS field. Galaxy sizes were measured in JWST Near-infrared Camera observations in rest-frame Hα (tracing recent star formation) with the F466N and F470N narrowband filters from JELS, and compared against rest-R-band, V-band (tracing established stellar populations) and near-ultraviolet sizes. We find a size-stellar mass (r_e-M_*) relationship with a slope that is consistent with literature values at lower redshifts, though offset to lower sizes. We observe a large scatter in r_e at low stellar mass (M_*&lt;10^8.4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) which we believe is the result of bursty star formation histories (SFHs) of SF galaxies at the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). We find that the stellar and ionised gas components are similar in size at z=6.1. The evidence of already-established stellar components in these Hα emitters (HAEs) indicates previous episodes of star formation have occurred. As such, following other JELS studies finding our HAEs are undergoing a current burst of star formation, we believe our results indicate that SF galaxies at the end of the EoR have already experienced a bursty SFH. From our r_e-M_* relationship, we find r_e, F444W=0.76±0.46 kpc for fixed stellar mass M_*=10^9.25 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, which is in agreement with other observations and simulations of star forming galaxies in the literature. We find a close-pair (major) merger fraction of (f_maj. merger=0.44±0.22) f_merger=0.43±0.11 for galaxy separations d≲25 kpc, which is in agreement with other z≈6 studies.

### 216) [2509.07695](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07695v2): Beyond No Tension: JWST z &gt; 10 Galaxies Push Simulations to the Limit

<p> Joe McCaffrey, Samantha Hardin, John H. Wise, John A. Regan </p>
<p>
JWST has identified some of the Universe's earliest galaxies, repeatedly pushing the frontier to ever higher redshifts and stellar masses. The presence of such extreme galaxies at such early times, with large stellar populations and high star-formation rates, naturally results in a tension between observation and theory. This tension between numerical models and observations can be either due to our underlying cosmological models or due to a gap in our understanding of early Universe astrophysics. In a prelude to this letter, we showed how the Renaissance simulations, which focused on high redshift galaxy formation were able to reconstruct similar stellar masses to the earliest and highest mass galaxies that had been discovered by JWST at the time of its publication (McCaffrey et al.2023). Since then many more galaxies have been discovered by JWST, in particular the "Mirage-or-Miracle" (MoM) survey broke the record recently with the highest redshift galaxy MoM-z14, which has a spectroscopically confirmed redshift of z ~ 14.44 followed closely by GS-z14 with a spectroscopically confirmed redshift of z ~ 14.3. We investigate in this letter whether these newly discovered galaxies are in conflict with the Renaissance simulations and thus whether they are causing tension with our established models of cosmology and/or high-redshift astrophysics. We discover that MoM-z14's high mass at early redshift can be explained by the Renaissance simulation suite, whereas the extremely high stellar mass of GS-z14 remains an outlier when compared to previous measurements of high-redshift galaxies detected by JWST and our numerical models (even after accounting for cosmic variance).

<p>
Little Red Dots (LRDs) are a puzzling population of extragalactic sources whose origin is highly debated. In this work, we perform a comprehensive stacking analysis of NIRCam, MIRI and ALMA images of a large and homogeneously-selected sample of LRDs from multiple JWST Legacy fields. We report clear evidence for hot-dust emission in the median stacked spectral energy distribution (SED), featuring a rising near-infrared continuum up to rest-frame λ_rest~~3μm, which is best explained by a standard dusty AGN structure. Although LRDs are likely a heterogeneous population, our findings suggest that most (≳50&percnt;) LRDs show AGN-heated dust emission, regardless of whether the Optical/Ultraviolet (UV) continuum is stellar or AGN-dominated. In either case, the best-fit dusty-AGN SED, combined with the lack of X-ray detection in the deep Chandra stacks, suggests that Compton-thick (N_H&gt;3×10^24 cm<sup>2</sup>) gas obscuration is common, and likely confined within the dust sublimation radius (R_sub~0.1 pc). Therefore, we argue that AGN-heated dust does not directly obscure either the Optical/UV continuum or the broad-line region emission, in order to explain the observed blue UV slopes and prominent Balmer features. While a gas-dust displacement is in line with several models, the formation scenario (in-situ or ex-situ) of this pre-enriched hot dust remains unclear.

### 218) [2509.06622](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06622v2): MARTA: The connection between chemical enrichment, feedback, and dust in a Wolf-Rayet galaxy at z~2

<p>
We present the analysis of the stellar and interstellar medium (ISM) properties of MARTA-4327, a star-forming galaxy at z=2.224 observed by means of deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy in both medium- and high-resolution gratings as part of the "Measuring Abundances at high Redshift with the Te Approach" (MARTA) programme. We report one of the highest-redshift detections of the Wolf-Rayet (WR) blue and red bumps in a non-lensed system. The broad He iiλ4686 feature is consistent with a young (~ 5-6 Myr) burst dominated by WN stars, although both SSP models and empirical templates struggle to reproduce the nitrogen stellar features at ≈ 4640 A. Based on the relative strength of the available optical stellar features, we disfavor the presence of very massive stars (VMS) in this system. Elemental abundance ratios such as Ne/O, N/O, and Ar/O align with observations of local star-forming galaxies (including WR galaxies), suggesting that any impact of the WR population on the chemical enrichment of the ISM is strongly localized. However, the gas-phase Fe/O ratio appears enhanced compared to local galaxies of similar metallicity, which we interpret as evidence for reduced Fe depletion onto dust grains, possibly linked to localized destruction in WR-driven wind environments. In addition, we detect a broad and blueshifted (~70 km/s) Hα component, revealing the presence of an ionized outflow with a mass loading factor η~ 0.2. Finally, we report the robust detection of O Iλ8446 emission (among the firsts at high redshift), which we interpret as originating from Lyβ fluorescence and/or collisional excitation in dense clumps. Overall, MARTA-4327 represents a unique system for studying the role of massive stars in shaping the ISM in galaxies at Cosmic Noon.

<p>
We report the discovery and characterization of a wide binary population in the ultrafaint dwarf galaxy Boötes I using deep JWST/NIRCam imaging. Our sample consists of 52 candidate binaries with projected separations of 7,000 - 16,000 au and stellar masses from near the hydrogen-burning limit to the main-sequence turnoff (~0.1 - 0.8~M<sub>&odot;</sub>). By forward-modeling selection biases and chance alignments, we find that 1.25±0.25&percnt; of Boötes I stars are members of wide binaries with separations beyond 5,000 au. This fraction, along with the distributions of separations and mass ratios, matches that in the Solar neighborhood, suggesting that wide binary formation is largely insensitive to metallicity, even down to [Fe/H] ≈ -2.5. The observed truncation in the separation distribution near 16,000 au is well explained by stellar flyby disruptions. We also discuss how the binaries can be used to constrain the galaxy's dark matter properties. We show that our detection places new limits on primordial black hole dark matter, finding that compact objects with M ≳ 5~M<sub>&odot;</sub> cannot constitute more than ~1&percnt; of the dark matter content. In contrast to previous work, we find that wide binaries are unlikely to provide robust constraints on the dark matter profile of ultrafaint galaxies given the uncertainties in the initial binary population, flyby disruptions, and contamination from chance alignments. These findings represent the most robust detection of wide binaries in an external galaxy to date, opening a new avenue for studying binary star formation and survival in extreme environments.

<p>
We present JWST/MIRI spectra from the Medium-Resolution Spectrometer of IZw18, a nearby dwarf galaxy with a metallicity of ~ 3% Solar. Here, we investigate warm molecular hydrogen, H2, observed in spectra extracted in ~ 120 pc apertures centered on eleven regions of interest. We detect 7 H2 rotational lines, some of which are among the weakest ever measured. The H2 population diagrams are fit with local-thermodynamic-equilibrium models and models of photodissociation regions. We also fit the ortho-/para-H2 ratios (OPRs); in three of the six regions for which it was possible to fit the OPR, we find values significantly greater than 3, the maximum value for local thermodynamic equilibrium. To our knowledge, although predicted theoretically, this is the first time that OPR significantly &gt; 3 has been measured in interstellar gas. We find that OPR tends to increase with decreasing H2 column density, consistent with the expected effects of self-shielding in advancing photodissociation fronts. The population diagrams are consistent with H nucleon densities of ~ 10^5 cm^-3, and an interstellar radiation field scaling factor, G0, of ~ 10^3. This warm, dense H2 gas co-exists with the same highly ionized gas that emits [OIV] and [NeV]. Emission from T ≥ 50K dust is detected, including an as-yet unidentified dust emission feature near 14 μm; possible identification as Al_2O_3 is discussed. The continuum emission from several regions requires that a considerable fraction of the refractory elements be incorporated in dust. Despite stacking spectra in the SE where H2 is found, no significant emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is detected.

### 221) [2509.02664](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02664v2): Little Red Dots Are Nurseries of Massive Black Holes

<p> Fabio Pacucci, Lars Hernquist, Michiko Fujii </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a previously unknown population of compact, red galaxies at z ~ 5, known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). With effective radii of ~ 100 pc and stellar masses of 10^9-10^11   M<sub>&odot;</sub>, a purely stellar interpretation implies extreme central densities, ρ<sub>&sext;</sub>~10^4-10^5   M<sub>&odot;</sub>   pc^-3 and in some cases up to ~ 10^9   M<sub>&odot;</sub>   pc^-3, far exceeding those of globular clusters. At such densities, the dynamical friction time for 10   M<sub>&odot;</sub> stars in the central 0.1 pc is &lt; 0.1 Myr, driving rapid mass segregation. We investigate the dynamical consequences of such an environment using: (i) a Fokker-Planck analysis of long-term core evolution, (ii) an analytical model for the collisional growth of a very massive star (VMS), and (iii) direct N-body simulations. All approaches show that runaway collisions produce a VMS with mass 9×10^3 &lt; M_VMS   [M<sub>&odot;</sub>] &lt; 5×10^4 within &lt;1 Myr. Once the supply of massive stars is depleted, the VMS contracts on a ~ 8000 yr Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale and undergoes a general relativistic collapse, leaving a massive black hole of mass M<sub>&bull;</sub> ~ 10^4   M<sub>&odot;</sub>. We conclude that LRDs are natural nurseries for the formation of heavy black hole seeds via stellar-dynamical processes. This pathway produces seed number densities that far exceed those expected from direct collapse models, and, owing to the dense residual stellar core, can sustain high rates of tidal disruption events.

<p>
We present a systematic search for broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST sample of 18 star-forming galaxies (M<sub>&sext;</sub>&gt;10^9.5~M<sub>&odot;</sub>) at redshifts z=4.4-5.7. Using JWST/NIRSpec IFU, we identify 7 AGN candidates through the detection of broad \Ha emission lines from 33 aperture spectra centred on photometric peaks. These candidates include one highly robust AGN detection with FWHM ~ 2800 \kms and six showing broad components with FWHM ~ 600-1600 \kms, with two in a merger system. We highlight that only broad-line detection is effective since these candidates uniformly lie within narrow emission-line ratio diagnostic diagrams where star-forming galaxies and AGNs overlap. The broad-line AGN fraction ranges from 5.9&percnt; to 33&percnt;, depending on the robustness of the candidates. Assuming that the majority are AGNs, the relatively high AGN fraction is likely due to targeting high-mass galaxies, where simulations demonstrate that broad-line detection is more feasible. Their black hole masses range from 10^6 to 10^7.5~M<sub>&odot;</sub> with 0.1 ≲ L_bol/L_Edd≲ 1. Counter to previous JWST studies at high redshift that found overmassive black holes relative to their host galaxies, our candidates lie close to or below the local M_BH-M<sub>&sext;</sub> scaling relations, thus demonstrating the effect of selection biases. This study provides new insights into AGN-host galaxy co-evolution at high redshift by identifying faint broad-line AGNs in galaxy samples, highlighting the importance of considering mass-dependent selection biases and the likelihood of a large population of AGNs being undermassive and just now being tapped by JWST.

<p>
Protoclusters, galaxy clusters' high redshift progenitors, hold the keys to understanding the formation and evolution of clusters and their member galaxies. However, their cosmological distances and spatial extensions (tens of Mpc) have inhibited complete mapping of their structure and constituent galaxies, which is key to robustly linking protoclusters to their descendants. Here we report the discovery of the Bigfoot, a tridimensional structure at z = 3.98 including 11 subgroups traced by 55 (700) spectroscopic (photometric) redshifts with JWST, extending over 15× 37 × 49cMpc^3 in the PRIMER-UDS field. Bigfoot's large-scale and mass function of member galaxies closely match constrained simulations' predictions for the progenitors of today's most massive clusters (M_0 &gt; 10^15 M__ &odot; ). All subgroups with M_h &gt; 10^12.5 M__ &odot;  exhibit enhanced fractions of massive galaxies (&gt;10^10.0 M__ &odot; ) compared to lower-mass halos and the field, demonstrating the accelerated formation of massive galaxies in massive halos. The presence of this massive protocluster with a large central halo (10^13.0 M__ &odot; ) in a JWST deep field bears important cosmological implication that favors high σ_8 of PLANCK cosmology over low-redshift probes.

<p> P. Nazari </p>
<p>
Complex organic molecules (COMs) have been detected abundantly at various stages of star formation, particularly in the warm protostellar phase. The progress in gas-phase measurements has been accelerated by the advent of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and in ice measurements by the James Webb Space Telescope. Particularly, the community has moved from single-source studies of COMs to statistical analyses because of these powerful instruments. In this article, I review surveys that consider COMs in the gas and ice. The two takeaways from this review include; 1. Gas-phase abundance ratios for some COMs show a small difference across many objects and the ice abundance ratios show similar or higher values to the gas, both pointing to the importance of ice chemistry in COM formation, 2. Some COM ratios show larger differences across many objects which could be due to either chemical or physical effects, thus both factors need to be considered when interpreting the data.

<p>
The cosmic 21-cm signal is a promising probe of the early Universe, owing to its sensitivity to the thermal state of the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) and properties of the first luminous sources. Here, we constrain the 21-cm signal and infer IGM properties using the Population II galaxy parameters derived in a previous study through multi-wavelength synergies. This includes high-redshift UV luminosity functions (UVLFs) from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), cosmic X-ray and radio backgrounds (CXB and CRB), the SARAS 3 global 21-cm signal non-detection, and HERA 21-cm power spectrum upper limits. From CXB and HERA data, we infer the IGM kinetic temperature to be T_K(z=15)≲ 7.7~K, 2.5~K ≲ T_K(z=10) ≲ 66~K, and 20~K≲ T_K(z=6) ≲ 2078~K at 95% credible interval (C.I.). Similarly, CRB and HERA data limit the radio emission efficiency of galaxies, giving T_rad(z=15) ≲ 47~K, T_rad(z=10)≲ 51~K, and T_rad(z=6)≲ 101~K. These constraints, strengthened by UVLFs from HST and JWST, enable the first itlower bound on the cosmic 21-cm signal. We infer an absorption trough of depth -201~mK≲ T_21,min ≲ -68~mK at z_min≈10-16, and a power spectrum of 8.7~mK^2 &lt; Δ_21^2(z=15) &lt; 197~mK^2 at k=0.35~hMpc^-1. Our results highlight the power of multi-wavelength synergies in constraining the early Universe. While promising for upcoming 21-cm experiments, the results depend on our assumption of a redshift-independent X-ray and radio efficiency of galaxies, and the exclusion of a flexible model for Population III stars.

We present the second data release of the Systematic Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES), focusing on JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution spectroscopy of galaxies across cosmic time. This release includes spectroscopic observations of 166 galaxies spanning 0 &lt; z &lt; 7.5, sampling star-forming galaxies, quiescent systems, and active galactic nuclei (AGN), with an emphasis on galaxies at cosmic noon (z ~ 1-3). We describe the target selection strategy, the observational setup with the G140M/F100LP and G235M/F170LP gratings, and the data calibration process. The final data products include the reduced spectra, redshift catalog, emission-line catalogs produced with ttGELATO for emission-line galaxies and ttpPXF fits for quiescent systems, and ancillary spectral energy distribution (SED) fit results derived from multi-band photometry. The SMILES NIRSpec dataset enables investigations of obscured AGN, multi-phase outflows, ionizing properties, and the role of environment in galaxy evolution.

Understanding the morphological structures of Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) is crucial for unveiling their formation pathways and the physical origins of Lyα emission. However, the evolution of their sizes and structural scaling relations remains debated. In this study, we analyze a large sample of 876 spectroscopically confirmed LAEs at 3 ≲ z &lt; 7, selected from the MUSE, VANDELS, and CANDELSz7 surveys in the GOODS-S, UDS, and COSMOS fields. Utilizing James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam imaging data, we measure their rest-frame UV and optical V-band effective radii (R_e) through two-dimensional Sérsic profile fitting. Our results show that these LAEs are generally compact, with a median R_e,UV of 0.50^+0.30_-0.24 kpc and a median R_e,V of 0.57^+0.33_-0.24 kpc. The size evolution follows R_e,UV &prop; (1 + z)^-0.91 ± 0.10 and R_e,V &prop; (1 + z)^-0.93 ± 0.18, respectively. Their UV and optical sizes are statistically comparable, indicating negligible UV-to-optical color gradients. For the first time, we establish the rest-frame optical size-mass relation for LAEs at z&gt;3, finding slopes comparable to typical star-forming galaxies (SFGs), but with slightly smaller sizes at a given stellar mass. These results provide important clues for understanding structural evolution of LAEs in the early universe.

### 228) [2508.03954](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03954v2): Consistent gas-phase C/O abundances from UV and optical emission lines: a robust scale for chemical evolution across cosmic time

<p> Paige M. Kelly, Tucker Jones, Yuguang Chen, Ryan L. Sanders, Danielle A. Berg, Peter Senchyna, Fabio Bresolin, Daniel P. Stark </p>
<p>
The carbon to oxygen (C/O) abundance ratio is a valuable tracer of star formation history, as C and O enrichment occurs on different timescales. However, measurements based on ultraviolet (UV) collisionally excited lines and those based on optical recombination lines may be subject to biases from the abundance discrepancy factor (ADF), which is well established for oxygen but uncertain for carbon. We present precise UV-based measurements of gas-phase C^2+/O^2+ ionic abundance in four H II regions which have prior optical-based measurements, combined with archival UV data for two additional H II regions, in order to establish a reliable abundance scale and to investigate biases between the two methods. We find a clear ADF for the C^2+ ion which is consistent with that of O^2+, assuming a similar temperature structure in the zones of the nebula which these ions occupy. The C/O abundance derived from UV collisional lines and optical recombination lines is therefore also consistent to within &lt;0.1 dex, with an offset of 0.05±0.03 dex in C^2+/O^2+ for the standard T_e method. While the absolute C/H and O/H abundances are subject to large uncertainty from the ADF, our results establish that C/O abundances measured from these different methods can be reliably compared. Thus we confirm the robustness of gas-phase C/O measurements for studying galaxy evolution and star formation timescales, including from rest-UV observations of high redshift galaxies with JWST.

We present a photometric analysis of globular clusters (GCs) in the massive galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1-2403 (z = 0.397) using deep JWST/NIRCam imaging from the PEARLS program. PSF photometry was performed in the short wavelength filters F090W, F115W, F150W, and F200W, yielding a catalog of approximately 3 x 10^3 unresolved, point-like sources consistent with a GC population. Artificial star tests indicate 80% completeness at F200W = 30.36 mag. The color-magnitude diagrams show a narrow GC sequence well reproduced by PARSEC single-stellar-population models spanning ages of 5-9 Gyr and metallicities from [M/H] = -2.0 to +0.2, consistent with evolved GC systems at this redshift. The globular cluster luminosity function (GCLF) follows a log-normal form truncated by incompleteness at the faint end. The brightest sources extend slightly beyond the locus of classical GCs, suggesting a small number of UCD-like systems or stripped nuclei, while the bulk of the population exhibits the luminosities and colors expected for mature globular clusters at z ~ 0.4.

### 230) [2508.03842](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03842v2): LAP1-B is the First Observed System Consistent with Theoretical Predictions for Population III Stars

<p> Eli Visbal, Ryan Hazlett, Greg L. Bryan </p>
<p>
Recently, Nakajima et al. (2025) presented James Webb Space Telescope observations of the z=6.6 Population III (Pop III) candidate LAP1-B, which is gravitationally lensed by galaxy cluster MACS J0416. We argue that this is the first object to agree with three key theoretical predictions for Pop III stars: (1) formation in extremely low-metallicity halos with virial temperatures ranging from T_vir~ 10^3-10^4~K, (2) a top-heavy initial mass function, and (3) formation of low-mass clusters with ~ a ~few× 1000~M<sub>&odot;</sub> in massive Pop III stars. LAP1-B is consistent with recently formed Pop III stars hosted in a ~ 5× 10^7~M<sub>&odot;</sub> dark matter halo, some of which have enriched their surrounding gas either with supernovae or stellar winds. We use the semi-analytic model of Visbal et al. (2020) to predict the abundance of Pop III clusters observable at the high magnification provided by the foreground galaxy cluster MACS J0416. Using fiducial parameters unmodified from previous work, we expect about one observable Pop III galaxy similar to LAP1-B in the range z=6-7. At earlier times, the intrinsic abundance is higher, but Pop III systems would not have been detected because of their increased luminosity distance and lower mass dark matter halos, which would host fewer stars. Thus, we find that LAP1-B was found at the redshift theoretically expected, given current observable limits, despite the fact that most Pop III systems form much earlier.

JWST has revealed a new high-redshift population called little red dots (LRDs). Since LRDs may be in the early phase of black hole growth, identifying them in the early universe is crucial for understanding the formation of the first supermassive black holes. However, no robust LRD candidates have been identified at z&gt;10, because commonly-used NIRCam photometry covers wavelengths up to ~5 μm and is insufficient to capture the characteristic V-shaped spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of LRDs. In this study, we present the first search for z≳10 LRD candidates using both NIRCam and MIRI imaging from COSMOS-Web, which provides the largest joint NIRCam-MIRI coverage to date (0.20 deg<sup>2</sup>). Taking advantage of MIRI/F770W to remove contaminants, we identify one robust candidate, CW-LRD-z10 at z<sub>phot</sub>=10.5^+0.7_-0.6 with M_UV=-19.9^+0.1_-0.2 mag. CW-LRD-z10 exhibits a compact morphology, a distinct V-shaped SED, and a non-detection in F115W, all consistent with being an LRD at z~10. Based on this discovery, we place the first constraint on the number density of LRDs at z~10 with M_UV~-20 of 1.2^+2.7_-1.0×10^-6 Mpc^-3 mag^-1, suggesting that the fraction of LRDs among the overall galaxy population increases with redshift, reaching ~3&percnt; at z~10. Although deep spectroscopy is necessary to confirm the redshift and the nature of CW-LRD-z10, our results imply that LRDs may be a common population at z&gt;10, playing a key role in the first supermassive black hole formation.

<p>
Recent JWST observations have revealed a puzzling population of optically red and compact galaxies with peculiar "V"-shaped spectra at high redshift, known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). Until now, most spectroscopically confirmed LRDs are found at z &gt; 4 and it has been speculated that LRDs are tracing the early stages of black hole evolution. We report an independent rediscovery of a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN), SDSS J102530.29+140207.3, at z = 0.1, which shows spectral features matching those of LRDs seen in the early Universe, including the V-shaped spectrum, broad Balmer lines (with widths of 1000-2000 km/s), and deep Balmer absorption. We present a new GTC observation of this LRD, which reveals an optical continuum similar to those of G-to-K giant stars including an unambiguous G-band absorption originating from the CH molecule. In addition, this local LRD shows a series of absorption lines potentially related to low-ionization ions or atoms but are deeper than what is observed in empirical stellar templates. We further identify a series of [FeII] emission lines indicative of low-ionization gas, which we find also present in an JWST-selected LRD at z = 2.26. We find small but statistically significant variability in Hα consistent with previous findings. Finally, with the new X-ray observation from NuSTAR, we confirm the extreme X-ray weakness of this LRD, which might imply Compton-thick gas obscuration with N_H&gt;10^24~cm<sup>2</sup>. All evidence suggests SDSS J102530.29+140207.3 has a complex gaseous environment and the strong ionic, atomic, and molecular absorptions are hard to explain with typical stellar and AGN models.

### 233) [2507.22863](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22863v2): Formation of over-massive black holes in high-redshift disk galaxies via globular cluster accretion

<p> Hidenobu Yajima </p>
<p>
Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have suggested the existence of over-massive black holes (OMBHs) in high-redshift galaxies. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism for the formation of OMBHs, based on the accretion of globular clusters (GCs) in compact disk galaxies. We derive the conditions under which OMBHs can form, focusing on key parameters such as halo mass, redshift, and halo spin parameter. Our results show that at redshift z = 10, a halo with mass 10^11~M<sub>&odot;</sub> and a spin parameter of ~ 0.02 can form a black hole of 2.3 × 10^8~M<sub>&odot;</sub> through GC migration and accretion via tidal disruption events (TDEs). The resulting black hole-to-stellar mass ratio can reach ~ 0.1, corresponding to the fraction of GC mass accreted onto the black hole. This mechanism thus provides a plausible explanation for the OMBHs observed by JWST. Furthermore, by combining our model with the halo mass function and the spin-parameter distribution, we construct black hole mass functions that reproduce the number densities of the massive BH candidates UHZ1 and GHZ9 at z ≈ 10, as well as the abundances of BHs with masses ≳ 10^8~M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z ≈ 5 inferred from JWST observations. However, our model overpredicts the abundance of BHs with masses &lt; 10^8~M<sub>&odot;</sub>, suggesting that moderately massive, inactive BHs are more frequent.

<p>
We present a spectroscopic analysis of a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN) selected as little red dot at z = 5.3 behind the Bullet cluster (Bz5.3), based on JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec data. The detection of strong FeII, OI, and CaII triplet emission lines, along with the evidence of broad Balmer lines, provides strong evidence of a broad-line region (BLR) and an accreting supermassive black hole. Notably, we report the first detection of the &lambda;1304 bump (i.e., blend of OIλ1304 and SiII) at high redshift, a feature commonly seen in local AGNs but not yet reported in the early Universe. The OIλ1304/&lambda;8446 photon ratio provides an independent measurement of dust attenuation in galaxies. In Bz5.3, this ratio is highly suppressed (0.1&ndash;0.3), implying significant internal dust extinction, with estimated dust attenuation A_V ~ 0.4&ndash;1.0. We identify Lyβ fluorescence as the dominant excitation mechanism of the low-ionization lines, with additional contributions from collisional excitation. High OIλ8446 equivalent width and weak OIλ7774 support this interpretation. The detection of iron emission, whether from broad permitted or narrow forbidden lines, supports the presence of a stratified BLR, as also recently proposed in local LRDs. Photoionization modeling of OIλ8446 and CaII further suggests the coexistence of multiple gas phases with distinct densities and ionization states, highlighting the complexity of the BLR. Bz5.3 thus offers a rare window into early AGN activity and BLR physics at early times.

### 235) [2507.20606](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20606v2): Beyond Extreme Burstiness: Evolving Star Formation Efficiency as the Key to Early Galaxy Abundance

<p> Abhijnan Kar, Shadab Alam, Joseph Silk </p>
<p>
JWST observations have revealed an overabundance of bright galaxies at z ≥ 9, creating apparent tensions with theoretical predictions within standard ΛCDM cosmology. We address this challenge using a semi-empirical approach that connects dark matter halos to observed UV luminosity through physically motivated double power-law star formation efficiency (SFE) model as a function of halo mass, redshift and perform joint Bayesian analysis of luminosity functions spanning z = 4 - 16 using combined HST and JWST data. Through systematic model comparison using information criteria (AIC, BIC, DIC), we identify the optimal framework requiring redshift evolution only in the low-mass slope parameter α(z) while maintaining other SFE parameters constant. Our best-fitting model achieves excellent agreement with observations using modest, constant UV scatter σ_UV = 0.32 dex, significantly lower than the ≳ 1.3 dex values suggested by previous studies for z &gt; 13. This reduced scatter requirement is compensated by strongly evolving star formation efficiency, with α increasing toward higher redshifts, indicating enhanced star formation in low-mass halos during cosmic dawn. The model also successfully reproduces another important observational diagnostic such as effective galaxy bias and cosmic Star Formation Density (SFRD) consistently across the full redshift range. Furthermore, model predictions are consistent up to a redshift of z~ 20. Our results demonstrate that JWST's early galaxy observations can be reconciled with standard cosmology through the interplay of modest stochasticity and evolving star formation physics, without invoking extreme burstiness or exotic mechanisms.

<p>
The polar mid-infrared (MIR) emission detected within 10-100s pcs in some active galactic nuclei (AGN) has been associated with dusty winds driven away by radiation pressure. The physical characterization of this extended polar emission remains uncertain. Here we combine 10-21 μm JWST/MIRI imaging observations with 7-25 μm JWST/MRS integral field spectroscopic observations of 6 nearby, \barD=35.4±4.6 Mpc, AGN from the GATOS Survey to quantify the nature of the extended MIR emission at ~75 pc resolution at 21 μm. These AGN have similar bolometric luminosities, log_10(\barL_bol [erg s<sup>-1</sup>])=44.0±0.3, span a wide range of optical outflow rates, M&#775;=0.003-0.21 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1, column densities, log_10(N_H^X-ray[cm<sup>2</sup>])=22.2-24.3, and Eddington ratios, λ_Edd=0.005-0.06. We cross-correlate the line-only and continuum-only images and find a poor correlation, which indicates that the extended MIR continuum emission is spatially uncorrelated with the warm outflows associated with narrow emission lines within 10-15 μm. Line emission is resolved along the jet axis, while dust emission is perpendicular to it. The 75-450 pc continuum emission has a fairly constant dust temperature, T_d=132^+7_-7 K, and mass, M_d=728^+29_-27 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Using the conditions of energy balance between radiation-pressure and gravity (λ_Edd vs. N_H), we find that our AGN sample is in the gravitationally bounded regime consistent with no detection of dusty winds. At 10 μm, the level of extended line emission contribution is correlated with the outflow kinetic energy and mass outflow rates. We find no correlation with the AGN properties. These results indicate that the radio jet may be triggering the gas outflow and line emission, while the extended dust emission is distributed in molecular clouds and/or shocked regions.

### 237) [2507.17820](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17820v3): A Metal-Free Galaxy at z = 3.19? Evidence of Late Population III Star Formation at Cosmic Noon

<p>
Star formation from metal-free gas, the hallmark of the first generation of Population III stars, was long assumed to occur only in the very early Universe. We report the discovery of MPG-CR3 (Metal-Pristine Galaxy COSMOS Redshift 3; hereafter CR3), an extremely metal-poor galaxy at redshift z= 3.193±0.016. From JWST, VLT, and Subaru observations, CR3 exhibits exceptionally strong Lyα, Hα, and He I λ10830 emission. We measure rest-frame equivalent widths of EW_0(Lyα) =822±101 Angstrom and EW_0(Hα) =2814±327 Angstrom, among the highest seen in star-forming systems. No metal lines, e.g. [O III] λ&lambda;4959,5007, C IV λ&lambda;1548,1550, have statistically significant detections, placing a 2-σ upper limit on the gas-phase metallicity of 12+log(O/H) &lt; 6.52 (Z &lt; 7×10^-3 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) with strong-line calibration established by JWST, making it the most metal-poor galaxy known at cosmic noon. Considering systematic uncertainties of ≳ 0.3 dex in the calibrations, the most conservative 2-σ upper limit is set to 12+log(O/H) &lt; 6.95. The observed Lyα/Hα flux ratio is 13.9±2.5, indicating negligible dust attenuation. Spectral energy distribution modeling with Pop III stellar templates indicates a very young (~2 Myr), low-mass (M_* ≈ 6.1× 10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) stellar population. Further, the photometric redshifts reveal that CR3 could reside in a slightly underdense environment (δ≈ -0.12). CR3 provides evidence that first-generation star formation could persist well after the epoch of reionization, challenging the conventional view that pristine star formation ended by z≳6.

Over the past few years itJWST has been a major workhorse in detecting and constraining the metal enrichment of the first galaxies in the early Universe and finding the source of the ionisation of their interstellar medium. In this work, we present new deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of GS-z11-1, a galaxy at z = 11.28, in which we report the detection of multiple rest-frame UV and optical emission lines: CIII]λλ1907,09, CIV]λλ1548,51, [OII]λλ3726,29, [NeIII]λ3869, Hγ and tentative evidence for HeIIλ1640. The ionisation properties of GS-z11-1 are consistent with star formation, with potential contribution from an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We estimate a galaxy stellar mass of log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 7.8±0.2 and log(SFR/(M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1))= 0.32±0.11 for the fiducial SF-only models. We measured C/O from the SED modelling of C/O = 1.20±0.15 × solar. This is one of the highest C/O abundances at z&gt;10, and it is consistent with either PopII and PopIII enrichment paths. Despite this source being extremely compact, with a half-light radius of 73±10 pc, we see no increased equivalent width of NIV] and NIII] emission lines as seen in some other compact sources at similar redshifts, a potential signature of second-generation stars in GCs. Overall, this galaxy exhibits low metallicity and high ionisation parameter consistent with intense star-formation or AGN activity in the early Universe, possibly observed before the enrichment by the second generation of stars in proto-globular clusters in the core of the galaxy.

A majority of JWST/NIRSpec/IFU studies at high redshifts to date have focused on UV-bright or massive objects, while our understanding of low-mass galaxies at early cosmic times remains limited. In this work, we present NIRSpec/IFS high-resolution observations of two low-mass (M_* &lt; 10^9  M<sub>&odot;</sub>), low-metallicity ([12 + log(O/H)] &lt; 8) galaxies at z ~ 7.66, one of which we identify as hosting a Type-II AGN. We measure flat strong-line metallicity gradients, suggestive of ISM redistribution by outflows or past merging, but also identify tension with the direct-T_e metallicity gradient in one galaxy. We measure v_rot/σ&lt; 1 in both galaxies, consistent with observations of lower rotational support at early cosmic times. We identify broad kinematical components decoupled from galactic rotation with velocities of ~ 250 - 500  km  s<sup>-1</sup> and argue these components trace outflows, for which we infer outflow rates of ~ 8 - 14  M<sub>&odot;</sub>  yr^-1 with v_out/v<sub>esc</sub> ~ 1. We compare our findings to results from the new large-volume AESOPICA simulations, which fully incorporate different models of black hole growth and AGN feedback. We find that our observational results of v_out/v<sub>esc</sub> are consistent with the simulated dwarf AGN population, hinting AGN-driven feedback may contribute to quenching both in our systems and in a wider population of low-mass galaxies in the early Universe. This novel study illustrates the necessity of deep IFU observations to decompose the complex kinematics and morphology of high-z galaxies, trace outflows, and constrain the effect of feedback in the early Universe.

### 240) [2507.14498](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14498v2): The formation and evolution of dust in the colliding-wind binary Apep revealed by JWST

<p>
Carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are significant contributors of carbonaceous dust to the galactic environment, however the mechanisms and conditions for formation and subsequent evolution of dust around these stars remain open questions. Here we present JWST observations of the WR+WR colliding-wind binary Apep which reveal an intricate series of nested concentric dust shells that are abundant in detailed substructure. The striking regularity in these substructures between successive shells suggests an exactly repeating formation mechanism combined with a highly stable outflow that maintains a consistent morphology even after reaching 0.6 pc (assuming a distance of 2.4 kpc) into the interstellar medium. The concentric dust shells show subtle deviations from spherical outflow, which could reflect orbital modulation along the eccentric binary orbit or non-sphericity in the stellar wind. Tracking the evolution of dust across the multi-tiered structure, we measure the dust temperature evolution that can broadly be described assuming an amorphous carbon composition in radiative thermal equilibrium with the central stars. The temperature profile and orbital period place new distance constraints that support Apep being at a greater distance than previously estimated, reducing the line-of-sight and sky-plane wind speed discrepancy previously thought to characterise the system.

<p>
We investigate the chemical evolution of N/O using a sample of 45 local star-forming galaxies (SFGs) from the CLASSY survey. This sample spans a wide range of galaxy properties, with robust determinations of nitrogen and oxygen abundances via the direct-T_e method. We explore how N/O relates to density structure, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), stellar age, compactness, and gas kinematics. In addition, we compare our results with those of galaxies at z =2-10 where N/O ratios were derived from optical or UV nitrogen lines, aiming to identify chemical enrichment pathways across cosmic time. Our analysis shows that the N/O-O/H relation in CLASSY galaxies aligns with the trends seen in local galaxies and extragalactic HII regions, and that galaxies at z = 2-6 exhibit similar N/O values, indicating no significant redshift evolution in N/O for a fixed metallicity. We identify a significant correlation between electron density n_e([S II]) and N/O, suggesting that density structure contributes to the scatter in the N/O-O/H relation. The CLASSY galaxies with high SFRs or compact star formation show elevated N/O, though no strong correlation with stellar mass is found. We also find that high-velocity outflows (v_out &gt; 350 km/s) and low mass-loading factors are linked to elevated N/O, indicating that feedback plays a significant role. These results highlight the importance of density, star formation, and feedback from young stellar populations in shaping N/O enrichment and provide key insights for interpreting high-z galaxies observed with JWST.

### 242) [2507.10681](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10681v3): Insights for Early Massive Black Hole Growth from JWST Detection of the [Ne v] λ3427 Emission Line

<p> Benny Trakhtenbrot, Claudio Ricci, Ezequiel Treister, Michael J. Koss, Richard Mushotzky, Kyuseok Oh, Alessandro Peca, Franz E. Bauer, Kriti Kamal Gupta, Tomer Reiss </p>
<p>
We use the narrow [Ne v] λ3427 emission line detected in the recently published JWST spectra of two galaxies, at z = 6.9 and 5.6, to study the key properties of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in their centers. Using a new empirical scaling linking the [Ne v] line emission with AGN accretion-driven (continuum) emission, derived from a highly complete low-redshift AGN sample, we show that the [Ne v] emission in the two z &gt; 5 galaxies implies total (bolometric) AGN luminosities of order L_bol~(4-8)x10^45 erg/s. Assuming that the radiation emitted from these systems is Eddington limited, the (minimal) black hole masses are of order M_BH&gt;10^7 M_sun. Combined with the published stellar masses of the galaxies, estimated from dedicated fitting of their spectral energy distributions, the implied BH-to-stellar mass ratios are of order M_BH/M_host~0.1-1. This is considerably higher than what is found in the local Universe, but is consistent with the general trend seen in some other z &gt; 5 AGN. Given the intrinsic weakness of the [Ne v] line and the nature of the [Ne v]-to-L_bol scaling, any (rare) detection of the [Ne v] λ3427 line at z &gt; 5 would translate to similarly high AGN luminosities and SMBH masses, thus providing a unique observational path for studying luminous AGN well into the epoch of reionization, including obscured sources.

### 243) [2507.05803](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05803v2): An optical to infrared study of type II SN2024ggi at nebular times

<p> Luc Dessart, Rubina Kotak, Wynn Jacobson-Galan, Kaustav Das, Christoffer Fremling, Mansi Kasliwal, Yu-Jing Qin, Sam Rose </p>
<p>
We present 0.3-21mic observations at ~275d and ~400d for Type II supernova (SN) 2024ggi, combining ground-based optical and near-infrared data from the Keck I/II telescopes and space-based infrared data from the James Webb Space Telescope. Although the optical regions dominate the observed flux, SN2024ggi is bright at infrared wavelengths (65%/35% falls each side of 1mic). SN2024ggi exhibits a plethora of emission lines from H, He, intermediate-mass elements (O, Na, Mg, S, Ar, Ca), and iron-group elements (IGEs; Fe, Co, and Ni) &ndash; all lines have essentially the same width, suggesting efficient macroscopic chemical mixing of the inner ejecta at &lt;~2000km/s and little mixing of 56Ni at larger velocities. Molecular emission in the infrared range is dominated by the CO fundamental, which radiates about 5% of the total SN luminosity. A molecule-free radiative-transfer model based on a standard red-supergiant star explosion (i.e., ~1e51erg, 0.06M<sub>&odot;</sub> of 56Ni from a 15.2M<sub>&odot;</sub> progenitor) yields a satisfactory match throughout the optical and infrared at both epochs. The SN2024ggi CO luminosity is comparable to the fractional decay-power absorbed in the model C/O-rich shell &ndash; accounting for CO cooling would likely resolve the model overestimate of the [OI]0.632mic flux. The relative weakness of the molecular emission in SN2024ggi and the good overall match obtained with our molecule-free model suggests negligible microscopic mixing &ndash; about 95% of the SN luminosity is radiated by atoms and ions. Lines from IGEs, which form from explosion ashes at such late times, are ideal diagnostics of the magnitude of 56Ni mixing in core-collapse SN ejecta. Stable Ni, clearly identified in SN2024ggi (e.g., [NiII]6.634mic), is probably a common product of massive-star explosions.

<p>
One of JWST's most remarkable discoveries is a population of compact red galaxies known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Their existence raises many questions about their nature, origin, and evolution. These galaxies show a steep decline in number density-nearly two orders of magnitude-from z=6 to z=3. In this study, we explore their potential evolution by identifying candidate descendants in CEERS, assuming a single evolutionary path: the development of a blue star-forming outskirt around the red compact core. Our color-magnitude selection identifies galaxies as red as LRDs at z&lt;4, surrounded by young, blue stellar outskirts. Morphological parameters were derived from single Sérsic profile fits; physical properties were obtained from SED fitting using a stellar-only model. These "post-LRD" candidates show LRD-like features with M<sub>&ast;</sub> ~ 10^10  M<sub>&odot;</sub> , central densities ( Σ<sub>&ast;</sub> ~ 10^11  M<sub>&odot;</sub>  kpc^-2 ), compact sizes, and red rest-frame colors, but with an added extended component. Their number density at z = 3 ± 0.5 ( ~ 10^-4.15   Mpc^-3 ) matches that of LRDs at 5 &lt; z &lt; 7 , supporting a possible evolutionary link. We observe a redshift-dependent increase in outskirts mass fraction and galaxy size-from ~ 250 pc at z = 5 to ~ 600 pc at z = 3 -suggesting global stellar growth. Meanwhile, the core remains red and compact, but the V-shaped SED fades as the outskirts grow. These findings support an evolutionary scenario in which LRDs gradually acquire an extended stellar component over cosmic time by cold accretion. This may explain the apparent decline in their observed number density at lower redshift.

<p>
Massive stars at cosmological distances can be individually detected during transient microlensing events, when gravitational lensing magnifications may exceed ~1000. Nine such sources were identified in JWST NIRCam imaging of a single galaxy at redshift z=0.94 known as the "Warhol arc,'' which is mirror-imaged by the galaxy cluster MACSJ0416.1-2403. Here we present the discovery of two coincident and well-characterized microlensing events at the same location followed by a third event observed in a single filter approximately 18 months later. The events can be explained by microlensing of a binary star system consisting of a red supergiant (T ~ 4000 K) and a B-type (T ~ 13,000 K) companion star. The timescale of the coincident microlensing events constrains the estimated projected source-plane size to tens of AU. The most likely binary configurations consistent with the observational constraints on the temperature and luminosity of each star are stars with initial masses M1=23.6+5.3-4.3 Msol and an initial mass ratio between the two stars close to unity. A kinematic model that reproduces the observed light curve in all filters gives a relatively small transverse velocity of 50 km/s. This requires the dominant velocity component of several hundreds of km/s to be roughly parallel to the microcaustic. An alternative possibility would be that the three microlensing events correspond to unrelated stars crossing distinct microcaustics, but this would imply a highly elevated rate of events at their common position, even though no underlying knot is present at the location.

We present stellar atmosphere modeling of JWST NIRCam photometry of nine highly magnified individual stars in a single galaxy at redshift z=0.94 known as the Warhol arc, which is strongly lensed by the galaxy cluster MACSJ0416. Seven of these transients were identified by Yan et al. (2023). The nine sources are all likely red supergiants with temperatures of T~4000K. We present new longslit spectroscopy of the Warhol arc acquired with Keck-I and the Large Binocular Telescope, and use these data to constrain the arc's oxygen abundance to be 12+log(O/H)=8.45+-0.08. We perform a microlensing simulation on synthetic stellar populations using a range of stellar metallicities and initial mass function slopes. The temperature distribution of the simulated detectable stars is sensitive to the choice of stellar metallicity, and setting the stellar metallicity equal to the arc's nebular metallicity (log(Z*/Zsun)=-0.24) produces a simulated temperature distribution that is consistent with the observations, while lower stellar metallicities (log(Z*/Zsun)&lt;-0.75) produce simulated temperatures that are inconsistent with the observations. The expected detection rate is strongly anticorrelated with the IMF slope for alpha&gt;1.2. For the canonical IMF slope alpha=2.35, the simulation yields expected transient detection rates that agree with the observed detection rates in the HST Flashlights filters, but over predicts the detection rate by a factor of ~3-12 (&lt;2sigma tension) in the JWST filters. The simulated detection rate is sensitive to the choice of stellar metallicity, with lower metallicities (log(Z*/Zsun)&lt;-0.75) yielding a significantly lower simulated detection rate that further reduces the modest tension with the observations.

<p>
We use JWST/NIRSpec observations of the radio galaxy 3C 293 to map the emission, extinction, and kinematics of hot molecular and ionized gas, as well as stellar kinematics, within the inner ~ 2 kpc. The stellar velocity field is well described by a rotating disk model, with its kinematical center offset by ~ 0.5 arcsec from the continuum peak. The hot molecular gas is traced by the H<sub>2</sub>2.12μm emission line, and the ionized gas by [Fe II]1.64μm and Paα. The gas presents three main kinematic components: a rotating disk seen as a narrow component (σ ~ 100 kms<sup>-1</sup>); a blueshifted broad outflow (σ ~ 250 kms<sup>-1</sup>); and a fast ionized outflow as a very broad component (σ ~ 640 kms<sup>-1</sup>). Extinction maps reveal high A_V values, up to ~ 35, spatially coincident with dust lanes seen in optical images. In addition to the disk and outflows components, inflows along the dust lanes are detected in H<sub>2</sub> gas, with a mass inflow rate of M&#775;_in ~ 4 x 10^-4 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1, which is lower than the AGN accretion rate. For the outflows, we derive peak mass-outflow rates of 0.08 ± 0.02 M<sub>&odot;</sub>yr^-1 (molecular) and 6.5 ± 1.7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>yr^-1 (ionized). The outflow, driven by the radio jet, has a kinetic power of 5.7% of the jet power - enough to suppress star formation. Our results highlight 3C 293's turbulent post-merger history and JWST's unique capability to probe dust-obscured AGN.

<p> R. González-Díaz, J. M. Vílchez, C. Kehrig, I. del Moral-Castro, J. Iglesias-Páramo </p>
<p>
The study of high-redshift galaxies provides critical insights into the early stages of cosmic evolution, particularly during the so-called 'cosmic noon', when star formation activity reached its peak. Within this context, the origin of the nebular emission remains an open question. In this work, we conduct a systematic, multi-wavelength investigation of a sample of z ~ 2-4 emitters from the MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field surveys, utilising both MUSE and JWST/NIRSpec data and extending the sample presented by previous studies. We derive gas-phase metallicities and key physical properties, including electron densities, temperatures and the production rates of hydrogen- and He+-ionising photons. Our results suggest that a combination of factors-such as stellar mass, initial mass function, stellar metallicity, and stellar multiplicity-likely contributes to the origin of the observed nebular emission. Specifically, for our galaxies with higher gas-phase metallicity (12 + log(O/H) &gt; 7.55), we find that models for binary population with Salpeter IMF (Mup=100 Msol) and stellar metallicity ~ 0.001 (i.e., similar to that of the gas) can reproduce the observed ionising conditions. However at lower metallicities, models for binary population with `top-heavy' initial mass function (Mup = 300 Msol) and Zstar much lower &lt; Zstar) than that of the gas are required to fully account for the observed ionising photon production. These results reinforce that the ionisation keeps challenging current stellar populations, and the ionisation problem persists in the very low metallicity regime.

### 249) [2506.05189](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05189v3): H3+ in irradiated protoplanetary disks: Linking far-ultraviolet radiation and water vapor

<p> Javier R. Goicoechea, Octavio Roncero, Evelyne Roueff, John H. Black, Ilane Schroetter, Olivier Berné </p>
<p>
The likely JWST detection of vibrationally excited H3+ emission in Orion's irradiated disk system d203-506 raises the important question of whether cosmic-ray ionization is enhanced in disks within clustered star-forming regions, or whether alternative mechanisms contribute to H3+ formation and excitation. We present a detailed model of the photodissociation region (PDR) component of a protoplanetary disk -comprising the outer disk surface and the photoevaporative wind - exposed to strong external far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation. We investigate key gas-phase reactions involving excited H2 that lead to the formation of H3+ in the PDR, including detailed state-to-state dynamical calculations of reactions H2(v≥0) + HOC+ -&gt; H3+ + CO and H2(v≥0) + H+ -&gt; H2+ + H. We also consider the effects of photoionization of vibrationally excited H2(v≥4), a process not previously included in PDR or disk models. We find that these FUV-driven reactions dominate the formation of H3+ in the PDR of strongly irradiated disks, largely independently of cosmic-ray ionization. The predicted H3+ abundance in the disk PDR peaks at x(H3+)~1E-8, coinciding with regions of enhanced HOC+ and water vapor abundances, and is linked to the strength of the external FUV field (G0). The predicted H3+ column density (~1E13 cm<sup>2</sup>) agrees with the presence of H3+ in the PDR of d203-506. We also find that formation pumping, resulting from exoergic reactions between excited H2 and HOC+, drives the vibrational excitation of H3+ in these regions. We expect this photochemistry to be highly active in disks where G_0 &gt; 1E3. The H3+ formation pathways studied here may also be relevant in the inner disk region (near the host star), in exoplanetary ionospheres, and in the early Universe.

### 250) [2506.04336](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04336v3): Simulation-based inference of galaxy properties from JWST pixels

<p> Patricia Iglesias-Navarro, Marc Huertas-Company, Pablo Pérez-González, Johan H. Knapen, ChangHoon Hahn, Anton M. Koekemoer, Steven L. Finkelstein, Natalia Villanueva, Andrés Asensio Ramos </p>
<p>
We present an efficient Bayesian SED-fitting framework tailored to multiwavelength pixel photometry from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). Our method employs simulation-based inference to enable rapid posterior sampling across galaxy pixels, leveraging the unprecedented spatial resolution, wavelength coverage, and depth provided by the survey. It is trained on synthetic photometry generated from MILES stellar population models, incorporating both parametric and non-parametric SFHs, realistic noise, and JADES-like filter sensitivity thresholds. We validate this amortised inference approach on mock datasets, achieving robust and well-calibrated posterior distributions, with an R^2 score of 0.99 for stellar mass. Applying our pipeline to real observations, we derive spatially resolved maps of stellar population properties down to S/N_pixel=5 (averaged over F277W, F356W, F444W) for 1083 JADES galaxies and ~2 million pixels with spectroscopic redshifts. These maps enable the identification of dusty or starburst regions and offer insights into mass growth and the structural assembly. We assess the outshining phenomenon by comparing pixel-based and integrated stellar mass estimates, finding limited impact only in low-mass galaxies (&lt;10^8M<sub>&odot;</sub>) but systematic differences of ~0.20 dex linked to SFH priors. With an average posterior sampling speed of 10^-4 seconds per pixel and a total inference time of ~1 CPU-day for the full dataset, our model offers a scalable solution for extracting high-fidelity stellar population properties from HST+JWST datasets, opening the way for statistical studies at sub-galactic scales.

The COSMOS-Web survey, with its unparalleled combination of multiband data, notably, near-infrared imaging from JWST's NIRCam (F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W), provides a transformative dataset down to ~28 mag (F444W) for studying galaxy evolution. In this work, we employ Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), an unsupervised machine learning method, to estimate key physical parameters of galaxies &ndash; redshift, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), specific SFR (sSFR), and age &ndash; directly from photometric data out to z=3.5. SOMs efficiently project high-dimensional galaxy color information onto 2D maps, showing how physical properties vary among galaxies with similar spectral energy distributions. We first validate our approach using mock galaxy catalogs from the HORIZON-AGN simulation, where the SOM accurately recovers the true parameters, demonstrating its robustness. Applying the method to COSMOS-Web observations, we find that the SOM delivers robust estimates despite the increased complexity of real galaxy populations. Performance metrics (σ_NMAD typically between 0.1&ndash;0.3, and Pearson correlation between 0.7 and 0.9) confirm the precision of the method, with ~ 70&percnt; of predictions within 1σ dex of reference values. Although redshift estimation in COSMOS-Web remains challenging (median σ_NMAD = 0.04), the overall success of the highlights its potential as a powerful and interpretable tool for galaxy parameter estimation.

### 252) [2505.20263](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20263v2): Bursty or heavy? The surprise of bright Population III systems in the Reionization era

<p>
The nature of the first, so-called Population III (Pop III) stars has for long remained largely unconstrained. However, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) finally opened new concrete prospects for their detection during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), notably providing promising observational constraints on the Pop III ultra-violet luminosity function (UVLF) at z ≈ 5.6 - 6.6. These preliminary data hint towards an unexpected population of UV-bright Pop III sources, which challenges the prevailing view that Pop III star formation is confined to molecular-cooling mini-halos. Here we show that there are two families of models that can explain these surprising observations, either by allowing for late-time Pop III formation within massive, atomic-cooling halos (with halo masses up to M^III_up ≳ 10^10   M<sub>&odot;</sub>) or by invoking a highly bursty Pop III star-formation activity (with a stochasticity parameter σ^III_UV ≳ 1.5). In these scenarios, Pop III systems would have to be either heavier or burstier than usually assumed, underscoring the need to reconsider common assumptions about Pop III star-formation sites, and the potential implications of JWST candidates for current and future observations.

### 253) [2505.12397](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12397v2): Unveiling the Ionized and Neutral ISM at z &gt; 10 : The Origin of [O III] /[C II] Ratios from a Sub-parsec Resolution Radiative Transfer Simulation

<p> Yurina Nakazato, Kazuyuki Sugimura, Akio K. Inoue, Massimo Ricotti </p>
<p>
Recent multi-wavelength observations by JWST and ALMA are unveiling both ionized and neutral ISM components in high-redshift (z&gt;6) galaxies. In this work, we investigate the origin of rest-frame far-infrared [OIII]88 μm and [CII]158 μm emission by performing zoom-in cosmological simulations of dwarf-galaxy progenitors at z=9-13. Our simulations incorporate on-the-fly radiative transfer at sub-pc (~ 0.1 pc) resolution, allowing us to resolve the multi-phase ISM. We compute emission lines on a cell-by-cell basis, taking into account local temperature, density, metallicity, radiation field strength, column density, and spectral hardness of radiation bins. We find that [OIII] predominantly arises from centrally located ionizing bubbles with temperatures of ~ (1-5)× 10^4 K and high ionization parameters of log U<sub>ion</sub> ≃ -1.5. In contrast, [CII] is produced in the surrounding dense neutral regions at ~ 5× 10^3 K, which are heated by strong FUV radiation (G/G_0 ~ 10^3-5) from the central stellar clusters. This spatial arrangement leads to large local variations in [OIII]/[CII], ranging from ~ 100 to 0.01. Our galaxy reproduces the global ratio [OIII]/[CII]~5-30, consistent with recent ALMA detections at z&gt;6 without invoking enhanced O/C abundance ratios. We further derive that [OIII]/[CII] linearly scales with the mass and density ratios of ionized to neutral gas, M_HII/M_HI and n_HII/n_HI and show that the [OIII]/[CII] ratio typically changes from 5.7 to 0.3 from high-z to low-z. For future synergies of JWST and ALMA, we derived M_HII/M_HI for observed z &gt;6 galaxies using Hβ and [CII] and show the validity of our scaling relations.

<p>
The relative fraction of obscured galaxies at z&gt;4 compared to lower redshifts remains highly uncertain as accurate bookkeeping of the dust-obscured component proves difficult. We address this shortcoming with SCUBADive, a compilation of the JWST counterparts of (sub-)millimeter galaxies in COSMOS-Web, in order to further analyze the distribution and properties of massive dust-obscured galaxies at early times. In this paper, we present a subset of SCUBADive, focusing on 60 "dark'' galaxies that dropout at 1.5\micron. Motivated by JWST observations of AzTECC71, a far-infrared bright F150W-dropout with z<sub>phot</sub>=5.7^+0.8_-0.7, we complete a systematic search of F150W-dropouts with SCUBA-2 and ALMA detections to find more candidate high redshift dusty galaxies. Within our subsample, 16 are most similar to AzTECC71 due to fainter F444W magnitudes (&gt;24 mag) and lack of counterparts in COSMOS2020. Despite high star formation rates (&langle;SFR&rangle;=450^+920_-320 \mdot yr^-1) and large stellar masses (&langle;log_10(\mstar)&rangle;=11.2^+0.5_-0.6 \mdot) on average, these galaxies may not be particularly extreme for their presumed epochs according to offsets from the main sequence. We find that heavily obscured galaxies, which would be missed by pre-JWST optical imaging campaigns, comprise ≳20&percnt; of galaxies across mass bins and potentially contribute up to 60&percnt; at the very high mass end (log_10(\mstar/\mdot)&gt;11.5) of the z&gt;4 stellar mass function.

### 255) [2505.09542](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09542v3): A weak Lyα halo for an extremely bright Little Red Dot: Indications of enshrouded SMBH growth

<p>
The abundant population of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs)-compact objects with red UV to optical colors and broad Balmer lines at high redshift-is unveiling new insights into the properties of early active galactic nuclei (AGN). Perhaps the most surprising features of this population are the presence of Balmer absorption and ubiquitous strong Balmer breaks. Recent models link these features to an active supermassive black hole (SMBH) cocooned in very dense gas (N_H~10^24 cm<sup>2</sup>). We present a stringent test of such models using VLT/MUSE observations of A2744-45924, the most luminous LRD known to date (L_Hα≈10^44~erg s<sup>-1</sup>), located behind the Abell-2744 lensing cluster at z=4.464 (μ=1.8). We detect a moderately extended Lyα nebula (h≈5.7 pkpc), spatially offset from the point-like Hα seen by JWST. The Lyα emission is narrow (FWHM=270± 15~km s<sup>-1</sup>), spatially offset to Hα, and faint (Lyα=0.07Hα) compared to Lyα nebulae typically observed around quasars of similar luminosity. We detect compact N IV]λ1486 emission, spatially aligned with Hα, and a spatial shift in the far-UV continuum matching the Lyα offset. We discuss that Hα and Lyα have distinct physical origins: Hα originates from the AGN, while Lyα is powered by star formation. In the environment of A2744-45924, we identify four extended Lyα halos (Δz&lt;0.02, Δr&lt;100 pkpc). Their Lyα luminosities match expectations based on Hα emission, indicating no evidence for radiation from A2744-45924 affecting its surroundings. The lack of strong, compact, and broad Lyα and the absence of a luminous extended halo, suggest that the UV AGN light is obscured by dense gas cloaking the SMBH with covering factor close to unity.

<p>
We present a JWST and ALMA detailed study of the ISM properties of high-redshift galaxies. Our JWST/NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy targeting three galaxies at z=6-7 detects key rest-frame optical emission lines, allowing us to derive [OII]λλ3726,3729-based electron densities of n_e,optical~1000 cm^-3 on average and [OIII]λ4363-based metallicities of 12+log(O/H)=8.0-8.2 in two galaxies. New ALMA Band 9/10 observations detect the [OIII]52μm line in one galaxy but do not in the others, resulting in FIR-based densities of n_e,FIR≲500 cm^-3 from the [OIII]52μm/[OIII]88μm ratios, systematically lower than the optical [OII]-based measurements. These low FIR-based densities are comparable to those at both z~0 and z&gt;6 in the literature, including JADES-GS-z14-0 at z=14.18, suggesting little evolution up to z~14, in contrast to the increasing trend of optical-based densities with redshift. By conducting a JWST and ALMA joint analysis using emission lines detected with both telescopes, we find that the observed FIR [OIII]52,88μm luminosities are too high to be explained by the optical-based densities at which they would be significantly collisionally de-excited. Instead, a 2-zone model with distinct high- and low-density regions is required to reproduce all observed lines, indicating that FIR [OIII] emission arises predominantly from low-density gas, while optical [OIII] and [OII] lines trace both regions. We further demonstrate that the direct-T_e method can sometimes significantly underestimate metallicities up to 0.8 dex due to the presence of the low-density gas not fully traced by optical lines alone, highlighting the importance of combining optical and FIR lines to accurately determine gas-phase metallicities in the early universe.

### 257) [2505.06965](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06965v2): Black Hole Envelopes in Little Red Dots

<p> Daisaburo Kido, Kunihito Ioka, Kenta Hotokezaka, Kohei Inayoshi, Christopher M. Irwin </p>
<p>
Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope have uncovered a population of compact, red object (z~ 4&ndash;7) known as little red dots (LRDs). The presence of broad Balmer emission lines indicates active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes (BHs), while LRDs exhibit unusually weak X-ray and radio emission and low variability, suggesting super-Eddington accretion that obscures the central engine. We suggest that such an extreme accretion disc inevitably drives strong outflows, which would disrupt the LRDs themselves unless confined within the nuclear region &ndash; posing a general feedback problem for overmassive BHs. To resolve this, we propose that the BH is embedded in a massive, optically thick envelope that gravitationally confines the outflow, making any outflow a no-go. This envelope, powered by accretion on to the BH, radiates at nearly the Eddington limit, and is sustained by an infall of the interstellar medium at a rate on the order of ~ 1 M<sub>&odot;</sub>~yr^-1. A photosphere emerges either within the envelope or in the infalling medium, with a characteristic temperature of 5000 - 7000 K, near the Hayashi limit. The resulting blackbody emission naturally explains the red optical continuum of the distinct V-shaped spectrum observed in most LRDs. Furthermore, the dynamical time-scale at the photosphere, ~ 0.01~pc, is consistent with the observed year-scale variabilities. The nuclear structure and spectral features of LRDs are shaped by this envelope, which not only regulates feedback but also acts as a gas reservoir that sustains rapid BH growth in the early universe.

<p> Giada Quadri, Alessandro Trinca, Alessandro Lupi, Monica Colpi, Marta Volonteri </p>
<p>
The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope has revolutionised our understanding of the high-redshift Universe through its detection of bright, massive galaxies up to z≳ 10 and its identification of peculiar sources called `little red dots' (LRDs). The origin of both classes of objects remains uncertain but is likely linked to the formation and early growth of the first massive black holes (MBHs), which may be more easily explained by invoking phases of super-Eddington accretion. In this study, we used a state-of-the-art zoom-in cosmological simulation of a quasar host to investigate whether these objects could resemble any of the peculiar sources observed with JWST during their assembly. We find that the impact of MBH feedback on star formation is typically moderate, with outflows preferentially escaping perpendicular to the galactic disc. However, for approximately ten percent of the galaxy's lifetime, the system enters a distinct quenched phase following rapid MBH growth driven by super-Eddington accretion. This phase culminates in a powerful feedback event, during which the MBH jet and disc-driven winds interact directly with the galactic disc and carve out a central cavity. We also find that, during the history of the quasar host progenitor, the spectral properties of the system can resemble both LRDs and quenched galaxies, depending on the specific evolutionary stage considered. These findings suggest that both conditions may represent transient phases in the life cycle of high-redshift galaxies.

### 259) [2505.05442](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05442v2): Density modulated star formation efficiency: implications for the observed abundance of ultra-violet luminous galaxies at z&gt;10

<p> Rachel S. Somerville, L. Y. Aaron Yung, Lachlan Lancaster, Shyam Menon, Laura Sommovigo, Steven L. Finkelstein </p>
<p>
The number density of UV luminous galaxies discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope at ultra high redshift (z ≳ 10) is higher, and declines much more slowly with increasing redshift, than expected from extrapolations of lower redshift observations or pre-launch physics-based models. Most of these models assume star formation efficiencies (SFE) of only a few percent, motivated by observations of nearby galaxies. In this work, we incorporate a scaling of SFE with gas surface density (which we refer to as Density Modulated SFE; DMSFE), motivated by cloud-scale simulations and theory, into a semi-analytic cosmological model (SAM) of galaxy formation which is calibrated to match the observed rest-UV sizes of high redshift galaxies. We also model the impact of dust and bursty star formation on the SAM-predicted properties of observed galaxies. We show that with plausible values of the main parameters, such as the fraction of gas in dense clouds f_dense, our new models easily reproduce or even exceed the observed galaxy number densities at z~ 6-17. While no single value of f_dense is able to reproduce the very shallow observed decline of the galaxy number density at z≳ 12, it is plausible and even expected for f_dense to have some effective dependence on cosmic time, which could bring these models into closer agreement with the data. We show that the combined effects of DMSFE, decreasing dust attenuation, and increasingly bursty star formation at earlier cosmic epochs could conspire to reproduce the observed evolution.

<p>
The advent of JWST has opened new horizons in the study of quasar host galaxies during the reionization epoch (z&gt;6). Building upon our previous initial measurements of stellar light from two quasar host galaxies at these redshifts, we now report the detection of the stellar light from the full Cycle 1 sample of 12 distant moderate-luminosity quasar (M1450&gt;-24 mag) host galaxies at z&gt;6 from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). Using JWST/NIRCam observations at 1.5 and 3.6 um combined with 2D image decomposition analysis, we successfully detect the host galaxies in 11 of the 12 targets, underscoring the high detection rates achievable with moderate-luminosity quasars. Based on two-band photometry and SED fitting, we find that our host galaxies are massive, with logM<sub>&sext;</sub>/M_sun = 9.5-11.0. The effective radii range from 0.6 to 3.2 kpc, comparable to the sizes of inactive galaxies with similar masses at z~6 as measured with imaging from COSMOS-Web.Intriguingly, the two quasar hosts with post-starburst features, which reside at the high-mass end of our sample and exhibit relatively compact morphologies, have similar size and stellar mass surface densities to quiescent galaxies at z~4-5. These findings suggest that the so-called galaxy compaction scenario is already in place at the reionization epoch, in which gas inflows during starburst phases drive centrally concentrated star formation followed by rapid quenching, bridging the structural transition of massive galaxies from relatively extended star-forming disks to compact quiescent systems.

<p> John Ellis, Malcolm Fairbairn, Juan Urrutia, Ville Vaskonen </p>
<p>
We confront the star formation rate in different dark matter (DM) models with UV luminosity data from JWST up to z≃25 and legacy data from HST. We find that a transition from a Salpeter population to top-heavy Pop-III stars is likely at z≃10 and that beyond z=10-15 the feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei is progressively reduced, so that at z≃25 the production of stars is almost free from any feedback. We compare fuzzy and warm DM models that suppress small-scale structures with the CDM paradigm, finding that the fuzzy DM mass &gt; 5.6 × 10^-22 eV and the warm DM mass &gt; 1.5  keV at the 95% CL. The fits of the star formation rate parametrisation do not depend strongly on the DM properties within the allowed range. We find no preference over CDM for enhanced matter perturbations associated with axion miniclusters or primordial black holes. The scale of the enhancement of the power spectrum should be &gt; 25 Mpc^-1 at the 95% CL, excluding axion miniclusters produced for m_a &lt; 6.6 × 10^-17 eV or heavy primordial black holes that constitute a fraction f_PBH &gt; \max[105 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/m_PBH, 10^-4 (m_PBH/10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>)^-0.09] of DM.

We leverage the recent GUREFT suite of dissipationless N-body simulations, which were designed for interpreting observations in the high redshift Universe, and provide predictions of dark matter halo mass functions and halo growth rates for a state-of-the-art cosmology over a wide range of halo masses from 6 &lt; z&lt; 30. We combine these results with an empirical framework that maps halo growth rate to galaxy star formation rate and then to rest-frame UV luminosity. We find that even if all of the photometrically selected 15 ≲ z ≲ 30 galaxy candidates are real and actually at these extreme redshifts, there is no fundamental tension with ΛCDM, nor are exotic explanations required. With stellar light-to-mass ratios similar to those in well-studied lower redshift galaxies, our simple model can account for the observed extreme ultra-high redshift populations with star formation efficiencies that peak at values of 20-65 percent. Bursty star formation, or higher light-to-mass ratios such as are expected for lower metallicity stellar populations or a top-heavy Initial Mass Function, would result in even lower required star formation efficiencies, comparable to values predicted by high resolution numerical simulations of high-surface density star forming clouds.

### 263) [2504.12378](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12378v2): Unveiling the trends between dust attenuation and galaxy properties at z ~ 2 - 12 with the James Webb Space Telescope

A variety of dust attenuation/extinction curves have been observed in high-redshift galaxies, with mixed results regarding their correlations with global galaxy properties. These variations are likely driven by factors such as intrinsic dust properties, total dust content, and the dust-star geometry. In this work, we explore how the shape of dust attenuation curves-quantified by the UV-optical slope (S) and UV bump strength (B)-correlates with galaxy properties. Our goal is to identify the key physical mechanisms shaping attenuation curves through cosmic time. We build on arXiv:2402.05996, analyzing 173 dusty galaxies at z ~ 2-11.5, with attenuation curves inferred via SED fitting of JWST data using a modified version of BAGPIPES (arXiv:2304.11178). We investigate trends between S, B, and properties inferred from SED fitting: AV, SFR, stellar mass (M<sub>&sext;</sub>), specific SFR (sSFR), mass-weighted stellar age (a*), ionization parameter (U), and metallicity (Z). For a subset, we also consider oxygen abundance (12 + log(O/H)), derived via Te-based methods. We find that lower AV galaxies tend to have steeper slopes and stronger UV bumps, consistent with radiative transfer predictions involving dust geometry and content. S also correlates with a* and sSFR, suggesting that strong radiation fields in young, bursty galaxies may destroy small grains, flattening the slope. B correlates with 12 + log(O/H), possibly due to metallicity-driven dust composition changes. Overall, attenuation curve shapes appear most strongly linked to: (1) redshift (dust evolution), (2) AV (RT effects), (3) a* or sSFR (radiation field), and (4) oxygen abundance (dust composition). Disentangling these effects requires spatially resolved data and theoretical models including dust evolution.

### 264) [2504.11531](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11531v2): Oxyster: A Circumgalactic Low-ionization Oxygen Nebula next to a Starburst Galaxy at z~1

<p> Pengjun Lu, Mingyu Li, Dalya Baron, Minghao Yue, Song Huang, Zheng Cai </p>
<p>
Extended emission line nebulae around galaxies or active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide a unique window to investigate the galactic ecosystem through the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Using Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam narrow-band imaging and spectroscopic follow-up, we serendipitously discover "Oxyster" - a large ionized nebula next to an interacting starburst galaxy at z=0.924. The nebula is traced by extended [OII]3726,3729 (~ 30 kpc) and [OIII]5007 (~ 20 kpc) emission lines. On the nebula luminosity-size plane, Oxyster surpasses the extended narrow-line regions around low-z AGNs, resembling a higher-z analog of "Hanny's Voorwerp". However, its uniformly low [OIII]/[OII] ratio (O32) sets it apart from typical AGN light echoes. For the host galaxy, HST and JWST images reveal a disturbed red disk galaxy with a single blue spiral "arm". Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting suggests the 2-6× 10^10 ~M<sub>&odot;</sub> host galaxy sits above the star-forming main sequence with an ongoing starburst, especially in the "arm", and have &lt;5&percnt; luminosity contribution from AGN, consistent with X-ray non-detection and radio continuum. Standard photoionization and shock models struggle to explain simultaneously Oxyster's emission line luminosities, low O32 ratio, and the non-detection of Hβ line. A plausible explanation could involve the combination of a recent (&lt;10^8 yrs) starburst and a low-luminosity AGN (L_bol ~ 1×10^42 erg/s). While Oxyster's nature awaits future investigation, its discovery highlights the potential of ground-based narrow-band imaging to uncover extended emission line nebulae around non-AGN systems, opening new avenues for studying the CGM of normal galaxies in the early Universe.

### 265) [2504.10581](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10581v3): Massive Black Hole Seed Formation in Strong X-ray Environments at High Redshift

<p> Kazutaka Kimura, Kohei Inayoshi, Kazuyuki Omukai </p>
<p>
Direct collapse of pristine gas in early galaxies is a promissing pathway for forming supermassive black holes (BHs) powering active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at the epoch of reionization (EoR). This seeding mechanism requires suppression of molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) cooling during primordial star formation via intense far-ultraviolet radiation from nearby starburst galaxies clustered in overdense regions. However, non-detection of 21 cm signals from the EoR reported by the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) experiment suggests that such galaxies may also emit X-rays more efficiently than in the local universe, promoting H<sub>2</sub> production and thereby potentially quenching massive BH seed formation. In this study, we examine the thermal and chemical evolution of collapsing gas in dark matter halos using a semi-analytic model incorporating observationally calibrated X-ray intensities. We find that strong X-ray irradiation, as suggested by HERA, significantly suppresses direct collapse and leads most halos to experience H<sub>2</sub> cooling. Nevertheless, massive BH seeds with M_BH ≳ 10^4~M<sub>&odot;</sub> still form by z≃ 15, particularly in regions with baryonic streaming motion, and their abundance reaches ~ 10^-4~Mpc^-3 sufficient to explain the SMBHs identified by JWST spectroscopy at 3&lt;z&lt;6. While the formation of highly overmassive BHs with masses comparable to their host galaxies is prohibited by X-ray ionization, our model predicts that BH-to-stellar mass ratios of ≃ 0.01-0.1 were already established at seeding.

<p>
Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is crucial for regulating galaxy evolution. Motivated by observations of broad absorption line winds from rapidly accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs), we introduce the Mistral AGN feedback model, implemented in the Arepo code. Mistral comes in two versions: continuous radial (Mistral-continuous) and stochastic bipolar momentum deposition (Mistral-stochastic). Using the framework of the IllustrisTNG simulations, we explore the effect of Mistral on BH and galaxy properties, through an idealized Milky Way-mass galaxy and cosmological zoom simulations run down to z=2. Unlike standard thermal AGN feedback prescriptions, Mistral generates galaxy-scale winds that mimic outflows driven by BH accretion. Mistral-continuous produces short-lived galactic fountains, and is inefficient at regulating the growth of massive galaxies at z=2. In contrast, Mistral-stochastic efficiently suppresses star formation in massive galaxies, reproduces the empirical stellar-to-halo mass relation, and yields a consistent trend of BH-stellar mass evolution. By supporting large-scale outflows while simultaneously preventing gas inflows, Mistral-stochastic additionally regulates the cold and hot gas fractions at both galaxy and halo scales. Mistral-stochastic therefore works self-consistently across the halo mass range explored ≤ft(10^12-3×10^13 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), without adopting a SMBH-mass dependent AGN feedback scheme such as the one used in IllustrisTNG. Our model is a promising tool for predicting the impact of AGN winds on galaxy evolution, and interpreting the growing population of high-redshift galaxies and quasars observed by JWST. This work is part of the "Learning the Universe" collaboration, which aims to infer the physical processes governing the evolution of the Universe.

We designed customized Lyman-break color selection techniques to identify galaxy candidates in the redshift ranges 15 ≤ z ≤ 20 and 20 ≤ z ≤ 28. The selection was performed on the ASTRODEEP-JWST multi-band catalogs of the CEERS, Abell-2744, JADES, NGDEEP, and PRIMER survey fields, covering a total area of ~0.2 sq. deg. We identify five candidates at 15 ≤ z ≤ 20, while no objects are found based on the z≳20 color selection criteria. Despite exhibiting a &gt;1.5 mag break, all the objects display multimodal redshift probability distributions across different SED-fitting codes and methodologies. The alternative solutions correspond to poorly understood populations of low-mass quiescent or dusty galaxies at z~3-7. This conclusion is supported by the analysis of five F200W-dropout objects that we find to be interlopers on the basis of NIRSpec PRISM spectra: four dusty star-forming galaxies at z~2.2-6.6, and a passive galaxy at z=4.91 with log(M_star/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≲ 9. We measured the UV luminosity function under different assumptions on the contamination level within our sample. We find that if even a fraction of the candidates is indeed at z≳15, the resulting UV LF points to a very mild evolution compared to estimates at z&lt;15, implying a significant tension with existing theoretical models. In particular, confirming our bright (M_UV&lt;-21) candidates would require substantial revisions to the theoretical framework. In turn, if all these candidates will be confirmed to be interlopers, we conclude that future surveys may need ten times wider areas to select M_UV≲-20 galaxies at z&gt;15. Observations in the F150W and F200W filters at depths comparable to those in the NIRCam LW bands are also required to mitigate contamination from rare red objects at z≲8.

### 268) [2504.03384](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03384v2): Capturing Small-Scale Reionization Physics: A Sub-Grid Model for Photon Sinks with SCRIPT

<p> Tirthankar Roy Choudhury, Anirban Chakraborty </p>
<p>
The epoch of reionization represents a major phase transition in cosmic history, during which the first luminous sources ionized the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, the small-scale physics governing ionizing photon sinks - particularly the interplay between recombinations, photon propagation, and self-shielded regions - remains poorly understood. Accurately modeling these processes requires a framework that self-consistently links ionizing emissivity, the clumping factor, mean free path, and photoionization rate. In this work, we extend the photon-conserving semi-numerical framework, SCRIPT, by introducing a self-consistent sub-grid model that dynamically connects these quantities to the underlying density field, enabling a more realistic treatment of inhomogeneous recombinations and photon sinks. We validate our model against a comprehensive set of observational constraints, including the UV luminosity function from HST and JWST, CMB optical depth from Planck, and Lyman-α forest measurements of the IGM temperature, photoionization rate, and mean free path. Our fiducial model also successfully reproduces Lyman-α opacity fluctuations, reinforcing its ability to capture large-scale inhomogeneities in the reionization process. Notably, we demonstrate that traditionally independent parameters, such as the clumping factor and mean free path, are strongly correlated, with implications for the timing, morphology, and thermal evolution of reionization. Looking ahead, we will extend this framework to include machine learning-based parameter inference. With upcoming 21cm experiments poised to provide unprecedented insights, SCRIPT offers a powerful computational tool for interpreting high-redshift observations and refining our understanding of the last major phase transition in the universe.

<p>
We present various properties of two bright extended Lyα objects, Himiko and CR7, at z=6.6 thoroughly investigated with JWST/NIRCam photometry, NIRSpec-IFU spectroscopy, and ALMA data, uncovering their physical origins. Himiko (CR7) shows at least five (four) clumps with small separations of 2.4&ndash;7.3 kpc and velocity offsets of Δv&lt;220~km~s<sup>-1</sup> in the [OIII]λ&lambda;4959,5007 line maps, three of which exhibit stellar components with comparable stellar masses ranging in log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=8.4&ndash;9.0 (8.3&ndash;8.8), indicative of major merger systems that are consistent with our numerical simulations. The [CII]158μm and Lyα lines are found in the middle of two clumps (the brightest clump) in Himiko (CR7), suggesting that the distribution of neutral gas does not always coincide with that of ionized gas or stars in merging processes. We find that some of the clumps have broad [OIII] components (250&ndash;400~km~s<sup>-1</sup>) in Himiko and CR7, likely tracing outflow and tidal features, while the central clump in Himiko presents a broad Hα (~1000~km~s<sup>-1</sup>) line explained by an AGN with a low mass black hole of M_BH=10^6.6~M<sub>&odot;</sub>, which contribute to the extended and bright nature of Himiko and CR7. We find low metallicities of 12+log(O/H)=7.9&ndash;8.1 in Himiko and CR7 based on auroral [OIII]&lambda;4363 and strong lines that are consistent with no 1-mm continuum detection corresponding to the dust mass limits of M_dust≲ 9× 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Himiko and CR7 are metal- and dust-poor blue merger systems with stellar and dust masses ≳2 orders of magnitude smaller than the massive dust-rich merger systems represented by submillimeter galaxies.

<p>
We present the survey design and initial results from the Parallel Ionizing Emissivity (PIE) survey. PIE is a large HST survey designed to detect Lyman continuum (LyC) emitting galaxies at 3.1&lt; z &lt;3.5 and stack their images in order to measure average LyC escape fractions as a function of galaxy properties. PIE has imaged 37 independent fields in three filters (F336W, F625W and F814W), of which 18 are observed with a fourth band (F475W) from the accompanying PIE+ program. We use photometric colors to select candidate Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) at 3.1&lt; z &lt;3.5, which can be followed up using ground-based spectrographs to confirm their redshifts. Unlike previous surveys, we use many independent fields to remove biases caused by correlated absorption in the IGM. In this paper, we describe the survey design, photometric measurements, and the use of mock galaxy samples to optimize our color selection. With 3 filters, we can select a galaxy sample of which ≈90&percnt; are LBGs and over 30&percnt; lie in the 3.1&lt; z &lt;3.5 range for which we can detect uncontaminated LyC emission in F336W. We also use mock IGM sightlines to measure the expected transmission of the IGM, which will allow us to determine escape fractions from our stacked galaxies. We color-select ≈1400 galaxies, and predict that this includes ≈80 LyC-emitting galaxies and ≈500 that we can use in stacking. Finally, we present the Keck/LRIS spectrum of a galaxy at z ≈ 2.99, demonstrating that we can confirm the redshifts of z ~ 3 galaxies from the ground.

We present a sample of six F200W and three F277W dropout sources identified as 16&lt;z&lt;25 galaxy candidates using the deepest JWST/NIRCam data to date (5σ depths ~31.5 mag at ≥2 μm), provided by the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) and the Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public survey (NGDEEP). We estimate ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions and densities at z~17 and z~25. The number density of galaxies with absolute magnitudes -19&lt;M_UV&lt;-18 at z~17 (z~25) is a factor of 4 (25) smaller than at z~12; the luminosity density presents a similar evolution. Compared to state-of-the-art galaxy simulations, we find the need for an enhanced UV-photon production at z=17-25 in M_DM=10^8.5-9.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> dark matter halos, provided by an increase in the star formation efficiency at early times and/or by intense compact starbursts with enhanced emissivity linked to strong burstiness, low or primordial gas metallicities, and/or a top-heavy initial mass function. There are few robust theoretical predictions for the evolution of galaxies above z~20 in the literature, however, the continuing rapid drop in the halo mass function would predict a more rapid evolution than we observe if photon production efficiencies remained constant. Our z&gt;16 candidates present mass-weighted ages around 30 Myr, and attenuations A(V)&lt;0.1 mag. Their average stellar mass is M_\bigstar~10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, implying a stellar-to-baryon mass fraction around 10% if the emissivity increases with redshift, or significantly higher otherwise. Three candidates present very blue UV spectral slopes (β~-3) compatible with Pop III young (≲10 Myr) stars and/or high escape fractions of ionizing photons; the rest have β~-2.5 similar to z=10-12 samples.

Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have revealed a population of sources with a compact morphology and a characteristic `v-shaped' continuum, namely blue at rest-frame λ&lt;4000A and red at longer wavelengths. The nature of these sources, called `little red dots' (LRDs), is still debated, as it is unclear if they host active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their number seems to drastically drop at z&lt;4. We take advantage of the 63 °^2 covered by the quick Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) to extend the search for LRDs to brighter magnitudes and to lower redshifts than what has been possible with JWST. The selection is performed by fitting the available photometric data (Euclid, the Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC), and ground-based griz data) with two power laws, to retrieve both the rest-frame optical and UV slopes consistently over a large redshift range (i.e, z&lt;7.6). We exclude extended objects and possible line emitters, and perform a careful visual inspection to remove any imaging artefacts. The final selection includes 3341 LRD candidates at z=0.33-3.6, with 29 detected also in IRAC. The resulting rest-frame UV luminosity function, in contrast with previous JWST studies, shows that the number density of LRD candidates increases from high-z down to z=1.5-2.5 and decreases at lower z. However, less evolution is apparent focusing on the subsample of more robust LRD candidates having IRAC detections, which however has low statistics and limited by the IRAC resolution. The comparison with previous quasar (QSO) UV luminosity functions shows that LRDs are not the dominant AGN population at z&lt;4 and M_UV&lt;-21. Follow-up studies of these LRD candidates are pivotal to confirm their nature, probe their physical properties and check for their compatibility with JWST sources, given the different spatial resolution and wavelength coverage of Euclid and JWST.

### 273) [2503.12019](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12019v2): Multi-copy Axion Transfer Function and Observational Implications of Effective de Broglie Scales

<p> Jiashuo Zhang, Tom Broadhurst, Jeremy Lim, Paloma Morilla, Sung Kei Li </p>
<p>
Ultra-light axions are well-motivated dark matter candidates predicted by the String Axiverse, offering potential solutions to the small-scale challenges faced by conventional heavy particle CDM. In this work, we explore the generic multi-axion scenario motivated in the String Axiverse context and investigate its astronomical implications in both the linear and nonlinear regimes. In the linear regime, we provide a simplified prescription for multi-copy axion transfer functions, and introduce the notion of effective mass (m_eff^-2=\sum_i w_i m_i^-2 with \ w_i\ being fractional contributions of different copies to cosmic matter density) that governs the suppression to Large Scale Structure (LSS), including the turnover scale of the galaxy luminosity function (LF). On galactic scales, individual copies decouple from the collective behavior seen for LSS, leading to different galaxy groups each dominated by different copies (Pozo et al. 2025). This explains the preference for ~ 10^-22eV axions from local, galactic scale observation despite stringent mass constraints set by existing UV LF turnover searches. In the non-linear regime within galaxy halos, we show that similar notion of effective masses or de Broglie scales govern the collective wave interference, influencing the net stellar heating rates and the substructure-induced spread of JWST transients near critical curves. Distinctive to the multi-copy scenario, the effective mass within galaxy halos is generically anticipated to be radially decreasing following the stronger concentration of heavier copies to the galactic center. Such a spatial variation leads to radially increasing spreading scales for micro-lensed transients at different radial positions, a signature that may be tested with future JWST lensing observations.

<p>
We re-analysed ALMA observations of the [OIII]λ88μm emission line in JADES-GS-z14.0, so far the most distant spectroscopically confirmed galaxy at z=14.18. Our analysis shows a tentative detection of a velocity gradient of [OIII]λ88μm using three independent tests: 1) construction of moment maps; 2) extraction of integrated spectra from a grid of apertures; and 3) spectro-astrometry in both the image and uv planes. We performed kinematical fitting using the KinMS code and estimated a dynamical mass of log_10(M_dyn/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)= 9.4^+0.8_-0.4, with the bulk of the uncertainties due to the degeneracy between dynamical mass and inclination. We measure an upper limit on the velocity dispersion (σ_v) of &lt;40~ km/s~which results in an estimate of V_rot/σ&gt; 2.5. This result, if confirmed with higher-resolution observations, would imply that kinematically cold discs are already in place at z~14. Comparison with mock observations from the SERRA cosmological simulations confirms that even low-resolution observations are capable of detecting a velocity gradient in z&gt;10 galaxies as compact as JADES-GS-z14.0. This work shows that deeper ALMA or JWST/NIRSpec IFS observations with high spatial resolution will be able to estimate an accurate dynamical mass for JADES-GS-z14.0, providing an upper limit to the stellar mass of this over-luminous galaxy.

<p> Yifan Zheng, Paulo Montero-Camacho, Zheng Cai, Yi Mao </p>
<p>
Cosmic reionization of HI leaves enduring relics in the post-reionization intergalactic medium, potentially influencing the Lyman-α (Lyα) forest down to redshifts as low as z ≈ 2, which is the so-called ''memory of reionization'' effect. Here, we re-analyze the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from Lyα absorption and quasar correlations using data from the extended Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) Data Release 16 (DR16), incorporating for the first time the memory of reionization in the Lyα forest. Three distinct scenarios of reionization timeline are considered in our analyses. We find that the recovered BAO parameters (α_\parallel, α_\perp) remain consistent with the original eBOSS DR16 analysis. However, models incorporating reionization relics provide a better fit to the data, with a tantalizing preference for early reionization, consistent with recent findings from the James Webb Space Telescope. Furthermore, the inclusion of reionization relics significantly impacts the non-BAO parameters. For instance, we report deviations of up to 3σ in the Lyα redshift-space distortion parameter and ~7σ in the linear Lyα bias for the late reionization scenario. Our findings suggest that the eBOSS Lyα data is more accurately described by models that incorporate a broadband enhancement to the Lyα forest power spectrum, highlighting the importance of accounting for reionization relics in cosmological analyses.

<p>
The strongly lensed Supernova (SN) Encore at a redshift of z = 1.949, discovered behind the galaxy cluster MACS J0138-2155 at z=0.336, provides a rare opportunity for time-delay cosmography and studies of the SN host galaxy, where previously another SN, called SN Requiem, had appeared. To enable these studies, we combine new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging, archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, and new Very Large Telescope (VLT) spectroscopic data to construct state-of-the-art lens mass models that are composed of cluster dark-matter (DM) halos and galaxies. We determine the photometric and structural parameters of the galaxies across six JWST and five HST filters. We use the color-magnitude and color-color relations of spectroscopically-confirmed cluster members to select additional cluster members, identifying a total of 84 galaxies belonging to the galaxy cluster. We construct seven different mass models using a variety of DM halo mass profiles, and explore both multi-plane and approximate single-plane lens models. As constraints, we use the observed positions of 23 multiple images from eight multiply lensed sources at four distinct spectroscopic redshifts. In addition, we use stellar velocity dispersion measurements to obtain priors on the galaxy mass distributions. We find that six of the seven models fit well to the observed image positions. Mass models with cored-isothermal DM profiles fit well to the observations, whereas the mass model with a Navarro-Frenk-White cluster DM profile has an image-position χ^2 value that is four times higher. We build our ultimate model by combining four multi-lens-plane mass models and predict the image positions and magnifications of SN Encore and SN Requiem. Our work lays the foundation for building state-of-the-art mass models of the cluster for future cosmological analysis and SN host galaxy studies.

<p> Fred Angelo Batan Garcia, Massimo Ricotti, Kazuyuki Sugimura </p>
<p>
We model the formation of star clusters in a dwarf galaxy progenitor during the first 700 ~Myr of cosmic history using a cosmological radiation-hydrodynamic simulation with a sub-grid star formation efficiency (SFE) model calibrated from AU-scale radiation-MHD simulations of molecular clouds with varying mass, density, and metallicity. In comparison to a constant SFE model, our model yields more bursty star formation, a more abundant massive star cluster population, and overall a higher stellar mass. Clouds reach SFEs up to 80&percnt;, forming bound star clusters (densities ~10^2-4 ~M<sub>&odot;</sub>\:pc^-2, radii ≲ 3~pc) resembling those observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in strongly lensed galaxies. Star clusters follow a flat power-law mass function dN/dlog M &prop; M^Γ with slope Γ~ -0.4. The most massive star clusters (10^4-5 ~M<sub>&odot;</sub>) grow through mergers and have metallicity spreads of 0.05 - 0.1 dex that roughly scale with mass. The second burst of star formation produce loosely bound star clusters with higher metallicities: -1.95 &lt; log(Z/Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) &lt; -1.50 at lower SFEs (2 - 20&percnt;). At z ~ 8.7, a nuclear star cluster (NSC) is seeded, growing 83&percnt; of its mass ( 2.4 × 10^5 ~M<sub>&odot;</sub>, 20&percnt; of the galaxy's stellar mass) through mergers with pre-existing clusters and the rest through in-situ star formation. The early formation of NSCs has interesting implications for seeding supermassive black holes and the population of itlittle red dots recently discovered by JWST at z ≳ 5

<p>
We use the deep NIRCam and MIRI imaging from the JWST PRIMER survey to study the properties of (sub)mm sources detected by ALMA in the centre of the COSMOS field, with the aim of better constraining the history of dust-enshrouded star formation. The wealth of ALMA data in this field enabled us to isolate a robust sample of 128 (sub)mm sources within the 175 sq. arcmin of the PRIMER COSMOS survey footprint, spanning two decades in (sub)mm flux density. The JWST imaging is deep/red enough to reveal secure galaxy counterparts for all of these sources. Moreover, 52% of the galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts, enabling us to refine the photo-zs for the remaining galaxies. Armed with this robust redshift information, we calculate the star-formation rates (SFR) and stellar masses of all 128 ALMA-detected galaxies, and place them in the context of other galaxies in the field. We find that the vast majority of star formation is dust-enshrouded in the ALMA-detected galaxies, with SFR ranging from ~1000 down to ~20 solar masses per year. We also find that virtually all (126/128) have high stellar masses, at all redshifts, with log(M/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &gt; 10. The unusually high quality of our sample enables us to make a robust estimate of the contribution of the ALMA-detected galaxies to cosmic star-formation rate density from z = 2 out to z = 7. Finally, to correct for the fact that the deep ALMA pointings cover &lt; 20% of the PRIMER COSMOS area, we use our knowledge of all other massive galaxies in the field to produce a completeness-corrected estimate of dust-enshrouded star-formation rate density over cosmic time. This confirms that UV-visible star formation dominates at z &gt; 4, but also indicates that dust-enshrouded star formation likely still made a significant contribution at higher redshifts: extrapolation of our results suggest a ~20% contribution at z = 8, and potentially still ~5% at z = 10.

### 279) [2503.07590](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07590v2): Probing Reionization-Era Galaxies with JWST UV Luminosity Functions and Large-Scale Clustering

<p> Anirban Chakraborty, Tirthankar Roy Choudhury </p>
<p>
JWST has transformed our understanding of early galaxy formation, providing an unprecedented view of the first billion years of cosmic history. In this work, we build upon our previously developed semi-analytical framework that self-consistently models the evolving UVLF of galaxies and the global reionization history while incorporating the effects of radiative feedback. Comparing our predictions with JWST and HST data, we identify a fundamental tension: models that match the UVLF fail to reproduce the observed evolution of galaxy clustering (bias) with redshift, and vice versa. To resolve this, we introduce a redshift- and mass-dependent duty cycle linked to the duration of star formation. This duty cycle increases towards higher redshifts, requiring either an enhanced production of UV radiation or increased star formation efficiency at z&gt;10 to match the JWST UVLFs, but declines at lower redshifts (5&lt;z≤9) and towards low-mass halos to remain consistent with the bias and HST UVLF measurements. Reconciling theory with observations requires the characteristic star formation timescale to be longer in massive halos, and to decrease with redshift at fixed halo mass, evolving from ~ 85 Myr at z=6 to ~ 45 Myr at z=14 for 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> halos. Finally, our extended model, assuming a halo mass-dependent escaping ionizing efficiency (\varepsilon<sub>esc</sub> &equiv; f<sub>esc</sub> × ξ<sub>ion</sub>), whose population-averaged value gradually increases with redshift and corresponds to &langle; f<sub>esc</sub> &rangle; ~ 15% at z=5 for a fixed value of ξ<sub>ion</sub> = 10^25.23 erg^-1 Hz across all galaxies, produces a reionization history consistent with current constraints. These findings underscore the importance of jointly constraining high-redshift galaxy models using both UVLF and bias statistics to accurately interpret JWST data and refine our understanding of early cosmic evolution.

### 280) [2503.01272](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01272v2): Investigating dusty Red Supergiant outflows in Westerlund 1 with 3D Hydrodynamic simulations

<p> C. J. K. Larkin, J. Mackey, T. J. Haworth, A. A. C. Sander </p>
<p>
Recent JWST observations towards Westerlund 1 revealed extensive nebular emission associated with the cluster. Given the age of the region and proximity of that material to massive stars it cannot be primordial star forming gas and the origin is uncertain. We aim to determine whether the nebular emission in Westerlund 1 could be due to ablation flows from Red Supergiant (RSG) stars embedded in the cluster wind driven by the Wolf-Rayet stars in the cluster core. We also aim to explore the efficiency of mass-loading for the RSG wind in this scenario. We use 3D hydrodynamic simulations with the scpion code to study the interaction between the cluster and RSG winds. We compare with the JWST observations by generating synthetic dust-emission maps. We find that the ablation flow morphology is consistent with the observations towards Westerlund 1, with clumps and instabilities. Synthetic observations at 11 μm predict fluxes in the ablation flow of ~1000-6000 MJy ster^-1 which is consistent with the unsaturated components of the JWST F1130W observations in the vicinity of the red supergiants in the region. This good agreement is achieved without any consideration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which have a known 11.3 μm feature that appears in the F1130W band. This suggests that the ablation flow is PAH depleted. Ablation of RSG winds can explain the observed nebulosity in Westerlund 1, at least in the vicinity of the RSGs. Further observations are encouraged to enable detailed studies of these interactions.

<p>
Gravitational time delays offer unique, independent measurements of the Hubble constant, H_0. Precise measurements of H_0 stand as one of the most pressing challenges in modern cosmology, and to do so with time delays requires precise lens models. While much work has focused on streamlining the modeling process to keep pace with the erumpent discovery of strongly-lensed systems, a critical step toward reducing uncertainty in H_0 comes from increasing the precision of individual lens models themselves. In this work, we demonstrate that the unprecedented imaging capabilities of JWST make this goal attainable. We present the first lens model for time-delay cosmography derived from JWST data, applied to the quadruply-imaged quasar WFI2033&ndash;4723. While the primary source of systematic uncertainty in time-delay cosmography is currently the mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD), the sensitivity of models to this MSD varies on how the point spread function (PSF) errors are mitigated. As the PSF is also the primary source of uncertainty in lens modeling, we focus on a comparison of different PSF modeling methods. Within the context of power-law models, we recover results in agreement with previous Hubble Space Telescope (HST)-based models, but with better precision of key lensing parameters through implementation of new PSF modeling techniques. Despite the record-holding precision of this system's HST modeling, we achieve an additional 22% increase in precision of the Fermat potential difference, directly reducing uncertainties of cosmological inference. These results would produce a 3% (1σ of the modeling error) shift of H_0 towards a higher value for this lens, keeping all else constant. This work substantiates the groundbreaking potential of JWST for time-delay cosmography and lays the groundwork for modeling systems previously too faint to provide meaningful constraints on H_0.

### 282) [2502.20437](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20437v3): Introducing the THESAN-ZOOM project: radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of high-redshift galaxies with a multi-phase interstellar medium

We introduce the THESAN-ZOOM project, a comprehensive suite of high-resolution zoom-in simulations of 14 high-redshift (z&gt;3) galaxies selected from the THESAN simulation volume. This sample encompasses a diverse range of halo masses, with M_halo ≈ 10^8 - 10^13~M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z=3. At the highest-resolution, the simulations achieve a baryonic mass of 142~M<sub>&odot;</sub> and a gravitational softening length of 17~cpc. We employ a state-of-the-art multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) model that self-consistently includes stellar feedback, radiation fields, dust physics, and low-temperature cooling through a non-equilibrium thermochemical network. Our unique framework incorporates the impact of patchy reionization by adopting the large-scale radiation field topology from the parent THESAN simulation box rather than assuming a spatially uniform UV background. In total, THESAN-ZOOM comprises 60 simulations, including both fiducial runs and complementary variations designed to investigate the impact of numerical and physical parameters on galaxy properties. The fiducial simulation set reproduces a wealth of high-redshift observational data such as the stellar-to-halo-mass relation, the star-forming main sequence, the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, and the mass-metallicity relation. While our simulations slightly overestimate the abundance of low-mass and low-luminosity galaxies they agree well with observed stellar and UV luminosity functions at the higher mass end. Moreover, the star-formation rate density closely matches the observational estimates from z=3-14. These results indicate that the simulations effectively reproduce many of the essential characteristics of high-redshift galaxies, providing a realistic framework to interpret the exciting new observations from JWST.

### 283) [2502.19484](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19484v2): A Tentative Detection of Molecular Hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) Emission Lines at Cosmic Dawn

We present a theoretical framework for interpreting far-ultraviolet (FUV) fluorescent emission from molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) in high-redshift galaxies, motivated by the unique capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to probe the rest frame FUV at cosmic dawn. Using the Meudon photodissociation region (PDR) code, we model the H<sub>2</sub> fluorescence spectrum under extreme interstellar medium (ISM) conditions in terms of high pressure (10^11~K~ cm^-3), high radiation field (10^6 G_0) combined with low metallicity (Z = 0.1~Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) and high cosmic ionization rate (ζ= 10^-14~s<sup>-1</sup>), characteristic of early galaxies. As a case study, we apply this framework to stacked NIRSpec spectra from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) for galaxies at redshifts z≥7. The stacked spectrum exhibits emission features consistent in profile and wavelength with the predicted H<sub>2</sub> fluorescence lines, including a blue shift suggestive of an outflow of molecular gas. Although individual features remain below robust detection thresholds, this demonstration illustrates the feasibility of using FUV fluorescence modeling to guide and interpret JWST spectroscopy of the molecular ISM at high redshift. Our framework provides a foundation for future searches for molecular hydrogen emission and the study of galactic feedback processes in the early universe.

<p>
Cold and cool gas (T ≤ 10^4 K) in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and its interaction with galaxies remain poorly understood. Simulations predict that cold gas flows into galaxies through cosmic filaments, determining the disk formation and galaxy evolution. The cold gas accretion modes in the CGM and their dependence on dark matter halo mass and redshift remain puzzling. Resolving the kiloparsec-scale kinematics and dynamics of cold gas interacting with the disk, dust, and metals in different environments is particularly lacking at z &gt; 2. Here we report two disturbed cold gas structures traced by ultra-strong MgII absorbers (rest-frame equivalent width Wr &gt; 2 Å) exhibiting high kinematic velocities (&gt; 500 km/s) and their environments at z ~ 4.9 and z ~ 2.6. Observations were conducted with VLT/MUSE, JWST/NIRCam, and ALMA to detect Lya and nebular emission lines, as well as dust continuum emission in the vicinity of these two absorbing gas structures. We identify two Lya emitters associated with a strong MgII absorber pair separated by ~1000 km/s at z~ 4.87. The pair exhibits relative differences in metallicity, dust content, and ionization states, suggesting internal metal and dust exchange within the ultra-large cold gas structure. For the strong MgII absorber at z = 2.5652, we detect a dusty star-forming galaxy at a projected distance of D = 38 kpc. This galaxy exhibits prominent HeI, [SIII], and Paschenγ lines, along with significant dust continuum. It has a star formation rate of ~ 121 +/- 33 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr and likely harbors a rotating disk. These findings tentatively suggest that cold gas at high redshifts plays a critical role in driving disk formation and actively participates in the transfer of metals and dust within the overdense regions of the CGM.

<p> Devesh Nandal, Daniel J. Whalen, Muhammad A. Latif, Alexander Heger </p>
<p>
The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope has revealed a wealth of new galaxies just a few hundred Myr after the Big Bang. Some of these galaxies exhibit unusual N/O ratios that are difficult to explain with stellar populations today. While Wolf-Rayet stars in multiple-burst populations, very massive or rapidly-rotating primordial stars, general relativistic explosions of metal-enriched supermassive stars, or the precursors of globular clusters can in principle account for the nitrogen excess in the galaxies GN-z11 and CEERS 1019, no known stars or supernovae can explain the far higher N/O ratio of 0.46 in GS 3073 at redshift z = 5.55. Here we show that the extreme nitrogen abundances in GS 3073 can be produced by 1000 - 10,000 M<sub>&odot;</sub> primordial (Pop III) stars. We find that these are the only candidates that can account for its large N/O ratios and its C/O and Ne/O ratios. GS 3073 is thus the first conclusive evidence in the fossil abundance record of the existence of supermassive Pop III stars at cosmic Dawn.

### 286) [2502.03683](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03683v2): AGN ruled out as the dominant source of cosmic reionization

<p> Danyang Jiang, Linhua Jiang, Shengxiu Sun, Weiyang Liu, Shuqi Fu </p>
<p>
Cosmic reionization represents the latest phase transition in the Universe, when the Lyman continuum (LyC) photons turned the intergalactic medium (IGM) from neutral to highly ionized. It has long been debated whether galaxies or active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are the major source of LyC photons responsible for reionization. Previous observations slightly favored galaxies as the major ionizing source. However, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) recently discovered an unexpectedly high density of AGN candidates at high redshift, which has largely enhanced the influence of AGNs. Here we derive a definitive upper bound on the AGN contribution to reionization using the latest JWST data, and conclusively rule out AGNs as the dominant ionizing source during the peak epoch of reionization (EoR). We build a sample of galaxies and AGNs in a specific redshift range 7.15 ≤ z ≤ 7.75 with a high completeness. Each object is then decomposed into a point-source component and an extended component in their rest-frame far-UV JWST images. We assume all point-source components are AGNs. Our fiducial AGN sample reaches an unprecedentedly low luminosity of M_UV ≈ -15 mag. Based on this sample, AGNs can contribute at most one third of the LyC photons budget required at z~7.5. Our result implies that galaxies dominate the ionizing source during the EoR.

<p>
Recent observations from JWST have revealed an abundant population of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and so-called "Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) at 2≲ z ≲ 11, many of which are characterized by V-shaped UV-to-optical continua with turnovers around the Balmer limit. The physical nature of these LRDs is unclear, and it remains debated whether the peculiar spectral shape originates from AGN, compact galaxies, or both. We present the analysis of new NIRSpec-IFU data from the BlackTHUNDER JWST Large Programme and archival NIRSpec-MSA data of a lensed LRD at z=7.04. The spectra confirm the presence of a smooth Balmer break and a broad Hβ tracing the Broad Line Region (BLR) of an AGN. The small velocity dispersion of the Hβ narrow component indicates a small dynamical mass of the host galaxy of M_dyn&lt;4 × 10^8~M<sub>&odot;</sub>, which implies that the stellar population cannot contribute more than 10% to the optical continuum. We show that the Balmer break can be well described by an AGN continuum absorbed by very dense (n_H~ 10^10~cm^-3) and nearly dust-free gas along our line-of-sight (possibly gas in the BLR or its surrounding). The same gas is expected to produce Hβ absorption, at a level consistent with a tentative detection (3σ) in the high-resolution spectrum. Such a non-stellar origin of the Balmer break may apply to other LRDs, and would alleviate the issue of extremely high stellar mass surface densities inferred in the case of a stellar interpretation of the Balmer break. We note that this is a rare case of a black hole that is overmassive relative to both the host galaxy stellar and dynamical masses. We finally report indications of variability and the first attempt of AGN reverberation mapping at such an early epoch.

### 288) [2501.11702](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11702v2): Constraints on the z~6-13 intergalactic medium from JWST spectroscopy of Lyman-alpha damping wings in galaxies

<p> Charlotte A. Mason, Zuyi Chen, Daniel P. Stark, Ting-Yi Lu, Michael Topping, Mengtao Tang </p>
<p>
JWST provides a unique dataset to study reionization's earliest stages, promising insights into the first galaxies. Many JWST/NIRSpec prism spectra reveal smooth Lyman-alpha breaks in z&gt;5 galaxies, implying damping wing scattering by neutral hydrogen. We investigate what current prism spectra imply about the intergalactic medium (IGM), and how best to use NIRSpec spectra to recover IGM properties. We use a sample of 99 z~5.5-13 galaxies with high S/N prism spectra in the public archive, including 12 at z&gt;10. We analyse these spectra using damping wing sightlines from inhomogeneous reionizing IGM simulations, mapping between the distance of a source from neutral IGM and the mean IGM neutral fraction. We marginalise over absorption by local HI around galaxies, and Lyman-alpha emission. We observe a decline in the median and variance of flux around the Lyman-alpha break with increasing redshift, consistent with an increasingly neutral IGM, as ionized regions become smaller and rarer. At z≳9 the spectra become consistent with an almost fully neutral IGM. We find S/N&gt;15 per pixel is required to robustly estimate IGM properties from prism spectra. We fit a sub-sample of high S/N spectra and infer mean neutral fractions x_HI=0.33^+0.18_-0.27, 0.64^+0.17_-0.23 (&gt;0.70 excluding GNz11) at z ≈ 6.5, 9.3. We also investigate local HI absorption, finding median column density log_10N_HI≈10^20.8 cm<sup>2</sup>, comparable to z~3 Lyman-break galaxies, with no significant redshift evolution. We find galaxies showing the strongest absorption are more likely to be in close associations (&lt;500 pkpc), implying enhanced absorption in massive dark matter halos. Future deep prism and grating spectroscopy of z&gt;9 sources will provide tighter constraints on the earliest stages of reionization, key for understanding the onset of star formation.

<p>
The high-redshift UV luminosity function provides important insights into the evolution of early galaxies. JWST has revealed an unexpectedly large population of bright (M_UV ≲ -20) galaxies at z≳10, implying fundamental changes in the star forming properties of galaxies at increasingly early times. However, constraining the fainter population (M_UV ≳ -18) has been more challenging. In this work, we present the z≳9 UV luminosity function from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey. We calculate the UV luminosity function from several hundred z≳9 galaxy candidates that reach UV luminosities of M_UV~-17 in redshift bins of z~9-12 (309 candidates) and z~12-16 (63 candidates). We search for candidates at z~16-22.5 and find none. We also estimate the z~14-16 luminosity function from the z≥14 subset of the z~12-16 sample. Consistent with other measurements, we find an excess of bright galaxies that is in tension with many theoretical models, especially at z≳12. However, we also find high number densities at -18≲ M_UV ≲-17, suggesting that there is a larger population of faint galaxies than expected, as well as bright ones. From our parametric fits for the luminosity function, we find steep faint end slopes of -2.5≲α≲-2.3, suggesting a large population of faint (M_UV ≳ -17) galaxies. Combined, the high normalization and steep faint end slope of the luminosity function could imply that the reionization process is appreciably underway as early as z=10.

### 290) [2412.07598](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07598v3): Radiation-driven dusty outflows from early galaxies

<p> Yurina Nakazato, Andrea Ferrara </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered an overabundance of UV-bright (M_UV ≲ -20), massive galaxies at z ≳ 10 in comparison to pre-JWST theoretical predictions. Among the proposed interpretations, such excess has been explained by negligible dust attenuation conditions following radiation-driven outflows launched by young stars when a galaxy goes through a super-Eddington phase. Dust opacity decreases the classical Eddington luminosity by a (boost) factor A, thus favoring the driving of outflows by stellar radiation in compact, initially dusty galaxies. Here, we compute A as a function of the galaxy stellar mass, gas fraction, galaxy size, and metallicity (a total of 8 parameters). We find that the main dependence is on metallicity and, for the fiducial model, A ~ 1800(Z/Z<sub>&odot;</sub>)/(1+N_H/10^23.5  cm<sup>2</sup>). We apply such results to 20 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at z ≳ 10 and evaluate their modified Eddington ratio. We predict that three galaxies are in the outflow phase. Their outflows have relatively low velocities (60 -100  km s<sup>-1</sup>), implying that they are unlikely to escape from the system. For the remaining 17 galaxies that are not currently in the outflow phase, we calculate the past evolution of the modified Eddington ratio from their star formation history. We find that 15 of them experienced an outflow phase prior to observation during which they effectively displaced their dust to larger radii. Thus, dusty outflows driven by stellar radiation appear to contribute to the observed bright UV galaxies at z &gt; 10.

<p>
We explore the radio emission of JWST-selected Broad Line AGN (BLAGN, or type 1) in the GOODS-N field. We use deep radio data at different frequencies (144 MHz, 1.5 GHz, 3 GHz, 5.5 GHz, 10 GHz), and we find that none of the 37 sources investigated is detected at any of the aforementioned frequencies. Similarly, the radio stacking analysis does not reveal any detection down to an rms of ~ 0.15μJy beam^-1, corresponding to a 3σ upper limit at rest frame 5 GHz of L_5GHz=2×10^39 erg s<sup>-1</sup> at the mean redshift of the sample z~ 5.1. We compared this and individual sources upper limits with expected radio luminosities estimated assuming different AGN scaling relations, to check whether these are consistent with the standard BLAGN spectral energy distribution. For most of the sources the radio luminosity upper limits are still compatible with expectations for radio-quiet (RQ) AGN; nevertheless, the more stringent stacking upper limits and the fact that no detection is found might suggest that JWST-selected BLAGN are weaker than standard AGN even at radio frequencies. Indeed, the probability of having none of the BLAGN detected in none of the investigated radio images is expected to be on average very low (P&lt;10^-4). We discuss some scenarios that could explain the possible radio weakness, such as free-free absorption from a dense medium, or the lack of either magnetic field or a corona, possibly as a consequence of super-Eddington accretion. These scenarios would also explain the observed X-ray weakness. We also conclude that ~1 dex more sensitive radio observations are needed to better constrain the level of radio emission (or lack thereof) for the bulk of these sources. The Square Kilometer Array Observatory (SKAO) will likely play a crucial role in assessing the properties of this AGN population.

<p>
We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopic characterization of GHZ9 at z= 10.145 ± 0.010, currently the most distant source detected by the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The spectrum reveals several UV high-ionization lines, including CII, SiIV, NIV], CIV, HeII, OIII], NIII], and CIII]. The prominent rest-frame equivalent widths (EW(CIV)≃65A, EW(OIII])≃28A, EW(CIII])≃48A) show the presence of a hard active galactic nucleus (AGN) radiation field, while line ratio diagnostics are consistent with either AGN or star formation as the dominant ionizing source. GHZ9 is nitrogen-enriched (6&ndash;9.5 (N/O)<sub>&odot;</sub>), carbon-poor (0.2&ndash;0.65 (C/O)<sub>&odot;</sub>), metal-poor (Z = 0.01&ndash;0.1 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>), and compact (&lt; 106 pc), similarly to GN-z11, GHZ2, and recently discovered N-enhanced high redshift objects. We exploited the newly available JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam data set to perform an independent analysis of the Chandra data confirming that GHZ9 is the most likely JWST source associated with X-ray emission at 0.5-7 keV. Assuming a spectral index Γ = 2.3 (1.8), we estimate a black hole (BH) mass of 1.60 ± 0.31 (0.48 ± 0.09) × 10^8M<sub>&odot;</sub>, which is consistent either with Eddington-accretion onto heavy (≥ 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) BH seeds formed at z=18, or super-Eddington accretion onto a light seed of ~ 10^2-10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z = 25. The corresponding BH-to-stellar mass ratio M_BH/M_star= 0.33±0.22 (0.10±0.07), with a stringent limit &gt;0.02, implies an accelerated growth of the BH mass with respect to the stellar mass. GHZ9 is the ideal target to constrain the early phases of AGN-galaxy coevolution with future multi-frequency observations.

### 293) [2410.09256](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09256v3): Measuring Star Formation Histories from Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars I: A Demonstration in M31

<p>
We demonstrate how near-infrared (NIR) imaging of resolved luminous asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars can be used to measure well-constrained star formation histories (SFHs) across cosmic time. Using UKIRT J and K-band imaging of M31, we first show excellent agreement over the past ~8 Gyr between the PHAT SFH of M31's outer disk derived from a deep optical color-magnitude diagram (CMD; ~3.3×10^7 stars with M_F814W ≲ +2), and our spatially-matched SFH based only on modeling AGB stars on a NIR CMD (~7.7×10^3 stars with M_J ≲ -6). We find that only ~1000 AGB stars are needed for reliable SFH recovery, owing to their excellent age sensitivity in the NIR. We then measure the spatially-resolved SFH of M31's inner stellar halo (D_M31, projected ~20-30 kpc) using ~10^4 AGB stars. We find: (i) a dominant burst of star formation across M31's stellar halo 3-5 Gyr ago and lower level, spatially distributed star formation ~1-3 Gyr ago; (ii) M<sub>&sext;</sub>≈3_-1^+5×10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> formed over the past ~8 Gyr. We discuss some caveats and the enormous potential of resolved AGB stars in the NIR for measuring SFHs back to ancient epochs (~14 Gyr ago) in galaxies to large distances (D≳20 Mpc) with JWST, Roman, and Euclid.

### 294) [2408.15615](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15615v3): Narrow line AGN selection in CEERS: spectroscopic selection, physical properties, X-ray and radio analysis

<p>
In this work, we spectroscopically select narrow-line AGNs (NLAGNs) among the ~300 publicly available medium-resolution spectra of the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS). Using both traditional and newly identified emission line NLAGN diagnostics diagrams, we identified 52 NLAGNs at 2&lt;z&lt;9, on which we performed a detailed multiwavelength analysis. We also identified four new z&lt;2 broad-line AGNs (BLAGNs), in addition to the eight previously reported z&gt;4.5 BLAGNs. We found that most of the high-z NLAGN were selected using the recently proposed AGN diagnostic diagrams based on the [Oiii] λ4363 auroral line or high-ionization emission lines. We compared the emission line velocity dispersion and the obscuration levels of the sample of NLAGNs with those of the parent sample without finding significant differences between the two distributions, suggesting a population of AGNs heavily buried and not significantly impacting the host galaxies physical properties, as was further confirmed by spectral energy distribution fitting. The bolometric luminosities of the high-z NLAGNs selected in this work are ~1.5dex below the ones sampled by surveys before JWST, potentially explaining the weak impact of these AGNs. Finally, we investigated the X-ray properties of the selected NLAGNs and of the sample of high-z BLAGNs. We found that all but four NLAGNs are undetected in the deep X-ray image of the field, as well as all the high-z BLAGNs. We did not obtain a detection even by stacking the undetected sources, resulting in an X-ray weakness of ~1-2 dex from what was expected based on their bolometric luminosities. To discriminate between a heavily obscured AGN scenario or an intrinsic X-ray weakness of these sources, we performed a radio (1.4GHz) stacking analysis, which did not reveal any detection and left open the questions about the origin of the X-ray weakness.

### 295) [2408.11098](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11098v3): Supermassive black holes from inflation constrained by dark matter substructure

<p> Shin'ichiro Ando, Shyam Balaji, Malcolm Fairbairn, Nagisa Hiroshima, Koji Ishiwata </p>
<p>
Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations of high-redshift massive galaxy candidates have initiated renewed interest in the important mystery around the formation and evolution of our Universe's largest supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We consider the possibility that some of them were seeded by the direct collapse of primordial density perturbations from inflation into primordial black holes and analyze the consequences of this on current dark matter substructures assuming non-Gaussian primordial curvature perturbation distributions. We derive bounds on the enhanced curvature perturbation amplitude from the number of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in our Galaxy, observations of stellar streams and gravitational lensing. We find this bound region significantly overlaps with that required for SMBH seed formation and enables us to probe Gaussian and non-Gaussian curvature perturbations corresponding to the SMBH seeds in the range  O(10^5&ndash;10^12) M<sub>&odot;</sub>.

### 296) [2407.04777](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04777v3): Challenging the AGN scenario for JWST/NIRSpec LRD and non-LRD broad Hα emitters in light of non-detection of NIRCam photometric variability and X-ray

<p> Mitsuru Kokubo, Yuichi Harikane </p>
<p>
JWST has uncovered a substantial population of high-z (z ≳ 4) galaxies exhibiting broad Hα emission line with a Full Width at Half Maximum exceeding 1,000 km/s. This population consists of a well-known subset called Little Red Dots (LRDs) and the remaining non-LRDs. If all of these broad Hα emitters were attributed to type 1-1.9 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), it would imply a significantly higher number density of low-luminosity AGNs than extrapolated from that of more luminous AGNs. Here, we have examined the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV)-optical flux variability of three LRD and two non-LRD broad Hα emitters using multi-epoch, multi-band JWST/NIRCam imaging data. The rest-frame temporal sampling interval of the NIRCam data (~ 400-500~days/(1+z)) is comparable to typical variability timescales of AGNs with black hole (BH) masses of M_BH ~ 10^7~M<sub>&odot;</sub>; thus, the flux variations should be detectable if AGNs were present. However, no measurable flux variation over the rest-frame wavelength range of λ_rest ~ 1,500-9,000Å has been detected, placing stringent upper limits on the variability amplitudes. This result, combined with the X-ray faintness confirmed by the ultra-deep Chandra data, indicates that, under the AGN scenario, we need to postulate peculiar Compton-thick broad-line AGNs with either (a) an intrinsically non-variable AGN disk continuum, (b) a host galaxy-dominated continuum, or (c) scattering-dominated AGN emission. Alternatively, (d) they could be non-AGNs where the broad-line emission originates from unusually fast and dense/low-metallicity star-formation-driven outflows or inelastic Raman scattering of stellar UV continua by neutral hydrogen atoms.

### 297) [2405.19401](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19401v2): Net-zero gas inflow: Measurement of the gas consumption history of a massive quiescent galaxy

<p>
JWST is discovering increasing numbers of quiescent galaxies 1&ndash;2 billion years after the Big Bang, whose redshift, high mass, and old stellar ages indicate that their formation and quenching were surprisingly rapid. This fast-paced evolution seems to require that feedback from AGN (active galactic nuclei) be faster and/or more efficient than previously expected \citepXie24. We present deep ALMA observations of cold molecular gas (the fuel for star formation) in a massive, fast-rotating, post-starburst galaxy at z=3.064. This galaxy hosts an AGN, driving neutral-gas outflows with a mass-outflow rate of 60±20 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1, and has a star-formation rate of &lt;5.6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1. Our data reveal this system to be the most distant gas-poor galaxy confirmed with direct CO observations (molecular-gas mass &lt; 10^9.1 M<sub>&odot;</sub>; &lt;0.8 % of its stellar mass). Combining ALMA and JWST observations, we estimate the gas-consumption history of this galaxy, showing that it evolved with net zero gas inflow, i.e., gas consumption by star formation matches the amount of gas this galaxy is missing relative to star-forming galaxies. This could arise both from preventive feedback stopping further gas inflow, which would otherwise refuel star formation or, alternatively, from fine-tuned ejective feedback matching precisely gas inflows. Our methods, applied to a larger sample, promise to disentangle ejective vs preventive feedback.

### 298) [2404.10770](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10770v2): Unveiling the Cosmic Gems Arc at z~10 with JWST NIRCam

<p>
We present recent JWST NIRCam imaging observations of SPT0615-JD (also known as the Cosmic Gems Arc), lensed by the galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0615-5746. The 5 arcsec long arc is the most highly magnified z&gt;10 galaxy known. It straddles the lensing critical curve and reveals five star clusters with radii of ~ 1 pc or less. We measure the full arc to have F200W 24.5 AB mag, consisting of two mirror images, each 25.3 AB mag with a median magnification of μ~ 60^+17_-8 (delensed 29.7 AB mag, M_UV = -17.8). The galaxy has an extremely strong Lyman break F115W-F200W &gt;3.2 mag (2σ lower limit), is undetected in all bluer filters (&lt; 2σ), and has a very blue continuum slope redward of the break (β= -2.7 ± 0.1). This results in a photometric redshift z<sub>phot</sub> = 10.2 ± 0.2 (95% confidence) with no significant likelihood below z&lt;9.8. Based on spectral energy distribution fitting to the total photometry, we estimate an intrinsic stellar mass of M_* ~ 2.4 - 5.6 × 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, young mass-weighted age of ~ 21 - 79 Myr, low dust content (A_V &lt; 0.15), and a low metallicity of ≲ 1&percnt;~Z<sub>&odot;</sub>. We identify a fainter third counterimage candidate within 2.2 arcsec of the predicted position, lensed to AB mag 28.4 and magnified by μ~ 2, suggesting the fold arc may only show ~ 60% of the galaxy. SPT0615-JD is a unique laboratory to study star clusters observed within a galaxy just 460 Myr after the Big Bang.

We summarize the properties and initial data release of the JADES Origins Field (JOF), the longest single pointing yet imaged with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). This field falls within the GOODS-S region about 8' south-west of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), where it was formed initially in Cycle 1 as a parallel field of HUDF spectroscopic observations within the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). This imaging was greatly extended in Cycle 2 program 3215, which observed the JOF for 5 days in six medium-band filters, seeking robust candidates for z&gt;15 galaxies. This program also includes ultra-deep parallel NIRSpec spectroscopy (up to 91 hours on-source, summing over the dispersion modes) on the HUDF. Cycle 3 observations from program 4540 added 20 hours of NIRCam slitless spectroscopy and F070W imaging to the JOF. With these three campaigns, the JOF was observed for 380 open-shutter hours with NIRCam using 15 imaging filters and 2 grism bandpasses. Further, parts of the JOF have deep 43 hr MIRI observations in F770W. Taken together, the JOF is one of the most compelling deep fields available with JWST and a powerful window into the early Universe. This paper presents the second data release from JADES, featuring the imaging and catalogs from the year 1 JOF observations.

The inner hundred parsecs of the Milky Way hosts the nearest supermassive black hole, largest reservoir of dense gas, greatest stellar density, hundreds of massive main and post main sequence stars, and the highest volume density of supernovae in the Galaxy. As the nearest environment in which it is possible to simultaneously observe many of the extreme processes shaping the Universe, it is one of the most well-studied regions in astrophysics. Due to its proximity, we can study the center of our Galaxy on scales down to a few hundred AU, a hundred times better than in similar Local Group galaxies and thousands of times better than in the nearest active galaxies. The Galactic Center (GC) is therefore of outstanding astrophysical interest. However, in spite of intense observational work over the past decades, there are still fundamental things unknown about the GC. JWST has the unique capability to provide us with the necessary, game-changing data. In this White Paper, we advocate for a JWST NIRCam survey that aims at solving central questions, that we have identified as a community: i) the 3D structure and kinematics of gas and stars; ii) ancient star formation and its relation with the overall history of the Milky Way, as well as recent star formation and its implications for the overall energetics of our galaxy's nucleus; and iii) the (non-)universality of star formation and the stellar initial mass function. We advocate for a large-area, multi-epoch, multi-wavelength NIRCam survey of the inner 100 pc of the Galaxy in the form of a Treasury GO JWST Large Program that is open to the community. We describe how this survey will derive the physical and kinematic properties of ~10,000,000 stars, how this will solve the key unknowns and provide a valuable resource for the community with long-lasting legacy value.
