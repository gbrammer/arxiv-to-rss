### 1) [2512.16728](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16728v1): A faint M_UV = -14.5 Lyman continuum leaker in the reionization epoch: unprecedented Lyα properties at z=5.725

We report the unprecedented Lyα properties of AMORE6, an extremely metal-poor (12+log(O/H) &lt; 6), low-mass (M<sub>&sext;</sub> = 4.4×10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), and ultra-compact (effective radius ≲30 pc) dwarf galaxy at z=5.7253, gravitationally lensed by the cluster A2744. A prominent, narrow, and nearly-symmetric Lyα emission line is detected at the systemic redshift (the latter traced by Hβ, from JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopy), with rest-frame EW=150±10 Å, FWHM=58±1 km s<sup>-1</sup>, and a slight asymmetry, resulting in a ~10&percnt; flux excess in the red wing of the line. The negligible velocity offset from systemic (dv = 4±67 km s<sup>-1</sup>, 3σ uncertainty), together with the sharpness and symmetry of the profile, indicates minimal radiative transfer effects implying a neutral hydrogen column density consistent with an optically thin medium, compatible with a non-zero ionizing photon escape fraction. If indirect spectral diagnostics calibrated at z&lt;4.5 remain the only viable tools to identify LyC leakers during reionization, then based on its strongest indicator (Lyα), AMORE6 stands out as one of the most compelling LyC-leaking candidates yet discovered in the reionization epoch.

### 2) [2512.16589](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16589v1): JWST MIRI color classification of mid-infrared selected galaxies: MIRI color classification toward cosmic noon

We investigated the James Webb Space Telescope photometric color classification of mid-infrared (MIR) selected galaxies at high redshifts, toward cosmic noon. The aim of the present work is to obtain a z-dependent mid-infrared (MIR) photometric galaxy classification tool based on broad spectral emission and absorption lines using the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) and its broadband filters. We used the largest Spitzer MIR spectral database to obtain synthetic photometry in the JWST/MIRI filters. We formed MIRI filter combinations to trace the strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features and the 9.7 micron silicate feature in seven redshift windows from z = 0.25-2.10. Results. We present z-dependent MIRI color-color plots that separate active galactic nuclei (AGN), star-forming galaxies (SFGs), and silicate absorption-dominated galaxies up to z~2. We applied the photometric MIR colors to the largest (~34 arcmin square) MIRI survey called the Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES), to identify AGN, SFGs, and Si-absorption dominated galaxies out to substantial redshifts. Our JWST/MIRI SFGs sample includes galaxies with total IR luminosities of 10^9.2 ~ 10^11.9 L<sub>&odot;</sub> at 0.9 ≤z &lt; 1.57. The majority of them are consistent with the z~1 main sequence. We also identified the first examples of z~1 galaxies with deep silicate absorption.

<p>
The semi-forbidden CIII] λλ1907,1909 doublet is a key tracer of high-ionization emission in the early universe. We present a study of CIII] emission in galaxies at z=5-7, using publicly available JWST/NIRSpec prism data from programs including CEERS, JADES, RUBIES and CAPERS. We built a sample of 61 CIII]-emitting galaxies, and we classified them as star-forming or active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies using (1) rest-frame UV and optical emission-line diagnostic diagrams, and (2) the presence/absence of broad Balmer emission lines. The UV diagnostics are based on the combination of the rest-frame equivalent width (EW) of CIII] versus CIII]/HeII λ1640, and the EW of CIV versus CIV/HeII λ1640. For optical diagnostics, we employ the OHNO diagram, which combines [OIII] λ5007, Hβ, [NeIII] λ3869, and [OII] λλ3727,3729- and we find it has a low efficiency on separating AGN from SFG. We find that half of the sources in our sample (29 out of 61 galaxies) exhibit at least one secure indication of AGN activity while 13 are potential AGNs based on the CIII] diagnostic. Physical properties, including stellar mass and star formation rate, are derived through spectral energy distribution modeling with Bagpipes. Our analysis reveals that JWST is uncovering a population of strong CIII] emitters at high redshift (5&lt;z&lt;7) with a median EW of 22.8 A. This EW is higher than that of a control sample of CIII] emitters at redshift 3&lt;z&lt;4 with a median EW of 4.7 A. We find that for the same range of Muv, the CIII] EW increases by ~0.67 dex from 3&lt;z&lt;4 to 5&lt;z&lt;7, indicating strong redshift evolution in the line's strength. Finally, we identify five sources in our sample as Little Red Dots (LRDs); while four of these have already been identified as LRD in the literature, one is presented here for the first time.

### 4) [2512.16316](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16316v1): Hydrodynamic Evolution and Detectability of Nova Remnants in the Galactic Center

<p> Zhao Su, Zhiyuan Li </p>
<p>
Thousands of X-ray sources have been detected in the Galactic center (GC), most believed to be cataclysmic variables (CVs). As a potential probe of the old stellar population, in particular CVs, the existence and detectability of novae in the GC remain elusive, due to the prohibitive extinction toward the GC and their relatively low occurrence rate. Nova remnants evolving in the characteristic hot (T~10^6~K) and dense (n_e~10~cm^-3) interstellar medium in the GC may shed light on recent novae and provide useful insight on the GC ecosystem. In this work, we perform hydrodynamical simulations of putative nova remnants in the GC environment and calculate their time-dependent multiwavelength emission to estimate the detectability. Among 79 models sampling the nova parameter space (primarily ejecta mass and velocity), 6, 44, and 51 modelled nova remnants are detectable at their X-ray, radio, and Paschen-α maximum, respectively, for existing  Chandra, VLA, and HST observations of the GC. The predicted peak luminosities are ~10^32~erg~s<sup>-1</sup>, ~10^31~erg~s<sup>-1</sup>, and ~10^36~erg~s<sup>-1</sup> in these three bands and the detectable window ranges from weeks to notably hundred years. By specifying a CV population of the nuclear star cluster, we estimate the probability of detecting at least one remnant to be 20&percnt;, 8&percnt;, and 18&percnt; in X-rays, radio, and Paα. The nova remnant would be best resolved in the X-ray band. Our study highlights the potential for detecting nova remnants through further observations, leveraging JWST and the potentially forthcoming AXIS and SKA.

We exploit a new sample of around 400 bright dusty galaxies from the ALMA CHAMPS Large Program, together with the rich JWST multi-band data products in the COSMOS field, to explore and validate new selection methods for identifying dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). Here, we present an effective empirical selection criterion based on a newly defined parameter: I_star = log(M_star) x log(SFR). Incorporating the F277W-F444W color as a second parameter further improves the purity of the selection. We then apply this method to the COSMOS2025 catalog to search for fainter dusty galaxy candidates below the ALMA CHAMPS detection limit and, through a stacking technique, identify a population of high-redshift (z=6-8) DSFGs with an average flux density ofS_1.2mm = 0.15uJy and a space density of ~6E-6 Mpc^-3. This faint population seems to have been missed by most of the previous submillimeter/millimeter surveys, and ground- and space-based UV-to-NIR surveys. Finally, we discuss the possibility of an evolutionary connection between the z &gt; 10 UV-bright galaxies recently discovered by JWST, the faint dusty z=6-8 galaxies identified here, and the population of z=3-5 massive quiescent galaxies, potentially linked as progenitor-descendant populations based on their abundance, redshifts, and stellar masses.

### 6) [2512.16208](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16208v1): Unveiling the properties and origin of massive quenched galaxies at z≥2 in the COLIBRE hydrodynamical simulations

JWST has uncovered a substantial population of Massive (M<sub>&sext;</sub> ≳ 10^10  M<sub>&odot;</sub>), Quenched Galaxies (MQGs) in the early Universe (z ≳ 2), whose properties challenge current galaxy formation models. In this paper, we examine this population of MQGs within the new COLIBRE cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We report number densities and stellar mass functions in broad agreement with the latest observations. The predicted quenching and formation timescales are qualitatively consistent with observational inferences. Leveraging the state-of-the-art physics in COLIBRE, the model predicts that MQGs have dust and H<sub>2</sub> fractions more than 1 dex lower than their massive star-forming counterparts; while their sizes and kinematics remain broadly similar. We further explore the processes driving galaxies to become massive and quenched in COLIBRE, identifying active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback as the primary quenching mechanism. Compared to star-forming galaxies of similar mass, MQGs host more massive black holes (BHs) and exhibit higher star formation efficiencies. These differences arise from their environments, particularly at local (0.3 cMpc) to intermediate scales (1.0 cMpc) before quenching, where overdense regions are associated with enhanced gas inflows, higher BH accretion and, hence, feedback power. We find that about 55&percnt; of MQGs survive as the main progenitors of z=0 galaxies when they are selected at z=3, although up to 55&percnt; experience rejuvenation episodes. Our results provide robust predictions for MQGs, show that tensions with observations are reduced when an effective observational uncertainty is forward-modelled, and clarify the mechanisms behind their origin.

The earliest stages of star formation are highlighted by complex interactions between accretion, outflow, and radiative processes, which shape the chemical and physical environment of the emerging protostar. James Webb Space Telescope observations of the low-mass, low-luminosity Class 0 protostar IRAS 16253-2429 reveal a central compact source. This object exhibits a rich mid-infrared emission spectrum of OH pure rotational lines and CO<sub>2</sub> ro-vibrational lines. Unusually for a young stellar object, it has no mid-infrared line emission from H<sub>2</sub>O to match the other molecules. We demonstrate that the emitting OH molecules arise from UV photodissociation of H<sub>2</sub>O in its second absorption band at λ= 114-145 nm, and that the OH emission is a fluorescent cascade starting with highest-excitation rotational states. This situation offers the opportunity of using the infrared OH spectrum to measure the UV flux from the central protostar. Thereby we determine the disk-star accretion rate to be 3 × 10^-10  M_\sun  year^-1, and demonstrate that the system luminosity arises mostly from the protostar's photosphere rather than from accretion luminosity. The result is in accord with the measured outflow rate of IRAS 16253-2429 and lies within the outflow/accretion-flow rate trend often inferred for protostars; and with episodic accretion as the dominant mechanism by which this protostar has grown.

Luminous quasars at the redshift frontier z&gt;7 serve as stringent probes of super-massive black hole formation and they are thought to undergo much of their growth obscured by dense gas and dust in their host galaxies. Fully characterizing the symbiotic evolution of SMBHs and hosts requires rest-frame optical observations that span spatial scales from the broad-line region to the ISM and CGM. JWST now provides the necessary spatially resolved spectroscopy to do so. But the physical conditions that regulate the interplay between SMBHs and their hosts at the highest redshifts, especially the nature of early feedback phases, remain unclear. We present JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of J0313-1806 at z=7.64, the most distant luminous quasar known. From the restframe optical spectrum of the unresolved quasar, we derive a black hole mass of M_BH=(1.63 ± 0.10)×10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> based on Hβ and an Eddington rate of λ=L/L_Edd=0.80± 0.05, consistent with previous MgII-based estimates. J0313-1806 exhibits no detectable [O III] emission on nuclear scales. Most remarkably, we detect an ionized gas shell extending out to ~ 1.8 kpc traced by Hβ emission that also lacks any significant [O III], with a 3σ upper limit on the [O III] λ5007 to Hβ flux ratio of log_10 ≤ft( F([OIII])/F(Hβ))=-1.15. Through photoionization modelling, we demonstrate that the extended emission is consistent with a thin, clumpy outflowing shell where [OIII] is collisionally de-excited by dense gas. We interpret this structure as a fossil remnant of a recent blowout phase, providing evidence for episodic feedback cycles in one of the earliest quasars. These findings suggest that dense ISM phases may play a crucial role in shaping the spectral properties of quasars accross cosmic time.

<p>
One of JWST's most unexpected discoveries is the emergence of "Little Red Dots'' (LRDs): compact sources at z ≳ 3 with blue rest-frame UV continua, red optical slopes, and broad Balmer emission lines that challenge standard models and suggest a population of early, unusual active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Using a comprehensive photometric selection and public NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy across six JWST deep fields, we identify a large sample of 118 LRDs with high-S/N spectra, enabling a population-wide analysis of their UV&ndash;optical continuum and emission lines. We find clear correlations between rest-frame color ([0.3-0.9 μm]) and slopes: bluer LRDs have blue UV slopes (β_ν,UV ~ 0.3) and red optical slopes, while redder LRDs exhibit redder UV slopes (β_ν,UV ~ 1.1). The continuum shape shows a similar trend: redder LRDs display prominent Balmer breaks and curvature, while bluer LRDs follow power-law-like optical SEDs. From literature compilations, ~60% of known broad-line AGNs satisfy our LRD criteria, and up to 90% of LRDs show broad Balmer lines. Emission-line diagnostics reveal a shift from high H_α/H_β and low [OIII]&lambda;5007/H_β in redder LRDs to the opposite in bluer ones, along with stronger narrow-line equivalent widths, suggesting a transition from AGN- to host-dominated emission. We fit the spectra with a two-component model combining a gas-enshrouded black hole (BH) and a galaxy host. Redder LRDs require higher-luminosity, unreddened BHs and modestly reddened hosts; bluer LRDs require lower-luminosity, reddened BHs and dust-free galaxies. This framework reproduces the diversity in colors and spectral shape by varying BH luminosity, obscuration, and host-to-BH luminosity ratio.

<p>
Over the last 15 years, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has revolutionized astrophysics by providing unprecedented resolution and sensitivity in observing the cold universe, including the formation of stars, planets, and galaxies. With groundbreaking discoveries ranging from the first detailed images of protoplanetary disks to the kinematics of galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization, ALMA has showcased the vast discovery potential of the (sub-)mm wavelength regime. However, in another 15 years from now&ndash;in the 2040s&ndash;the science landscape will have changed dramatically as new major observational facilities will have started their operations or have come towards advanced maturity in their scientific outcome (e.g., JWST, Rubin Observatory, ELT, Euclid, Gaia, Plato, Ariel, Roman Space Telescope, SPHEREx, LiteBIRD, LISA, SKA and others). At the same time, ALMA's current Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade will have been in place for ~10 years, and ALMA itself will have been operational for 30 years. To fully exploit this era, the community needs a next-generation facility operating at (sub-)mm wavelengths with capabilities far beyond those possible within ALMA's current infrastructure. To this end, ALMA2040 is a community-driven initiative to define the key scientific questions of the 2040s and translate them into a technical vision for a next-generation transformational (sub-)millimeter facility. Our goal with this document is to summarize the current status of the effort, synthesize outcomes from the 2025 workshops, outline next steps toward a reference design concept, and invite broad participation from the global mm/sub-mm community to help shape this future facility. In the following we provide details on the process and scope. We invite everyone who wishes to join the effort and/or contribute to the dedicated White Papers planned for 2026.

### 11) [2512.15477](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15477v1): A Characterization of JWST MIRI Detector Persistence and Implications for High-Contrast Imaging

<p> Alisha Vasan, Mary Anne Limbach, Andrew Vanderburg, Rachel Bowens-Rubin, Kevin B. Stevenson </p>
<p>
The JWST MIRI detector exhibits a flux deficit persistence, but its timescales and impacts remain largely uncharacterized, particularly at the longest imaging wavelengths. In this study, we analyze full-field MIRI imager observations at 21 μm (F2100W) to quantify detector persistence following a saturation event by a bright (K = 5.65 mag) nearby (8.12 ± 0.04 pc) mid M-dwarf star, IRAS 21500+5903. Unlike typical persistence that appears as excess flux, this effect presents as a flux deficit in pixels previously illuminated by the saturating or near saturating source. We measure persistence at two post-saturation epochs: shortly after saturation (11.6 minutes) and an hour later (1.39 hours). Immediately after the saturation event, we detect a persistence level of 1.69 ± 0.10%. By fitting a Bayesian exponential decay model to the two epochs, we estimate that persistence decreases to one-tenth of its initial value after 5.16^+1.49_-0.94 hours. We examine the implications of persistence for MIRI high-contrast imaging using the imager (not coronagraphy). Specifically, we discuss how MIRI detector persistence can produce false-positive exoplanet signals in direct imaging surveys, as well as degrade PSF subtraction, particularly at small inner working angles. We also outline mitigation strategies to avoid these impacts in future observations.

JWST offers an unprecedented view of optically dark or faint galaxies (OFGs), previously missed by HST. They are likely massive, heavily dust-obscured star-forming galaxies (SFGs) that substantially contribute to the cosmic SFR density at z&gt;3. To identify drivers of their high dust attenuation and their role in early universe galaxy evolution, we analyse the stellar morphology of 65 OFGs (from 1892 SFGs at 3&lt;z&lt;4) using NIRCam/F444W imaging from the PRIMER and CEERS fields. We study correlations between dust attenuation (A_v) and galaxy properties, like stellar mass, size, and orientation, and compare scaling relations between OFGs and typical SFGs. We find that OFGs are ~8-9 times more massive and ~4 times more dust attenuated than the parent sample. Structurally, OFGs resemble parent SFGs in median R_e and median Σ_R_e but may be slightly rounder on average. While A_v strongly correlates with stellar mass, it does not show significant dependence on stellar mass-normalised effective radius and stellar mass surface density, Sérsic index, axis ratio, or SFR surface density. The mass-size and mass-surface density relations place OFGs as a higher-mass extension of SFGs, with no concrete proof of evolutionary differences between them. This suggests that OFGs are heavily dust-obscured primarily due to their high stellar masses, which facilitates dust production and retention, with older stellar populations likely contributing as well. Although some OFGs exhibit high Σ_R_e and occupy regions of the mass-size plane similar to quiescent galaxies, the overall sample is not representative of this. Their current structures resemble typical SFGs, with no concrete signs of rapid compaction. Diversity in their physical properties shows that OFGs span a range of evolutionary states with few showing reduced star formation, while most remain actively star-forming.

High-redshift (z &gt; 3), massive quiescent galaxies (QGs) offer a significant window into early Universe galaxy formation. Previous works have predicted miscellaneous properties for these quiescents, from an overdensity of neighbors to elevated quenched fractions among such neighbors (i.e. galactic conformity). However, due to a scarcity in highly-resolved deep-field observations until recently, these properties have not been closely examined and pose unresolved questions for galaxy evolution. With new photometric-redshift catalogs from JWST data in the COSMOS-Web field, we present the S\hatONG sample, comprising 171 photometrically selected massive (≥10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) QGs with 3≤ z<sub>phot</sub> &lt; 5. We look for low-mass neighbors around our sample and find substantial populations of star-forming galaxies (SFGs), contrasting the conformity effect at low-z. Our QGs also exhibit diverse clustering, from having no neighbors to potentially residing in environments no denser than star-forming equivalents, to being accompanied by SFGs with more stellar mass than the QG itself. Using a geometric method, we also report filamentary signals for 4&percnt; of our sample, suggestive of some QGs' rejuvenation via cold gas accretion. We reapply the analysis on seven spectroscopically confirmed QGs in COSMOS-Web (M_* ~ 10^9-10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) and note similar patterns. Lastly, we report on Saigon, the most distant low-mass quiescent galaxy known to date (z = 4.55, M_* = 1.33 ×10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>); this spectroscopically confirmed QG resides in a protocluster candidate with 11 SFGs. These results pave new paths towards understanding QG environment, while also signaling an opportune era to examine their evolution with JWST.

### 14) [2512.14874](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14874v1): GA-NIFS: the highest-redshift ring galaxy candidate from a head-on collision

Collisional ring galaxies are a rare class of interacting systems, making up only ~0.01% of galaxies in the local Universe. Their formation is typically attributed to a head-on collision of a massive galaxy with a compact satellite (intruder), triggering density waves that, propagating outward, produce the characteristic ring morphology. Here, we present the discovery and detailed analysis of GS18660, the most distant ring galaxy known to date, at z=3.08, identified in JWST/NIRSpec IFS observations as part of the GA-NIFS programme. This work aims to characterise the physical and dynamical properties of GS18660 and shed light into the formation of its ring. Specifically, we analyse the ionized gas properties, stellar populations, and gas kinematics of the system, and use the observed geometry to constrain the timescale of the collision. Our analysis is based on NIRSpec IFS data, including low-resolution (R~100) spectroscopy covering ~0.2-1.3um rest-frame, and high-resolution (R~2700) spectroscopy covering 0.4-0.8um rest-frame. Multi-wavelength techniques are applied to derive nebular gas conditions and stellar population properties. Gas kinematic analysis reveals that GS18660 exhibits a rotating disk component with an additional radial expansion velocity of ~200 km/s, consistent with a propagating collisional wave. Nebular line diagnostics indicate intense star formation (SFR ~100 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr) along the ring and in the nucleus. Stellar population analysis shows that the most recent star formation episode, occurring within the last ~50 Myr, predominantly took place in the ring. We also identify a close companion, the intruder galaxy responsible for the collision, moving away with a relative velocity of ~425 km/s. The evidence strongly favours a collisional origin for the ring in GS18660, though the presence of a recently formed bar (and hence a resonance ring) cannot be completely excluded.

### 15) [2512.14844](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14844v1): Doubling NIRSpec/IFS capability to calibrate the single epoch black hole mass relation at high redshift

<p>
The recent discovery of a large population of overmassive black holes (BHs) in the early Universe challenges the validity of the BH-host galaxy coevolution framework. However, the reliability of the estimated BH masses (M_BH) is being questioned, as these are typically derived using single-epoch (SE) relations calibrated locally. Calibrating SE relations at high redshift would therefore enable more accurate M_BH estimates and help identify potential biases. In this work, we release a data-reduction technique for JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations that doubles the effective wavelength coverage, enabling detection of otherwise inaccessible emission. Whenever adjacent dispersers are required, observers should carefully evaluate the tradeoff between integrating longer in the bluer configuration alone versus distributing the exposure time across two dispersers. We apply this pipeline to a sample of 5 quasars at z~2 with M_BH independently measured through reverberation mapping (RM). This enables a joint analysis of both Hβ and Hα; the latter lying beyond the nominal wavelength range. We assess the reliability of the most widely adopted SE calibrations, finding that Hβ yields the closest agreement with RM-based M_BH estimates, whereas Hα-based estimators exhibit a larger scatter. For the least massive BH in our sample (M_BH,RM~10^7.5M<sub>&odot;</sub>), which is accreting at a rate close to the Eddington limit (λ_Edd=0.8), all SE calibrators overestimate M_BH, RM by one order of magnitude. This may indicate a systematic overestimation of M_BH for highly accreting BHs at high redshift. Finally, we provide the first high-redshift SE calibration based on Hα and Hβ. Although a larger sample is needed to reduce the uncertainties, our calibration can already be applied to the newly discovered BH population in the early Universe.

Pirzkal </p>
<p>
The dust content of star-forming galaxies is generally positively correlated with their stellar mass. However, some recent JWST studies have shown the existence of a population of dwarf galaxies with an unexpectedly large dust attenuation. Using the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) data, we identified a sample of 1361 highly extincted low-mass (HELM) galaxies, defined as dwarf galaxies (M_*&lt;10^8.5) with Av&gt;1mag or more massive galaxies with an exceptionally high dust attenuation given their stellar mass (i.e., Av&gt;1.6log_10(M_*/Mo)-12.6). The selection is performed using the multiparameter distribution obtained through a comprehensive spectral energy distribution fitting analysis, based on optical to near-infrared data. After excluding possible contaminants, like brown dwarfs, little red dots, high-z (z&gt;8.5) and ultra-high-z (z&gt;15) galaxies, the sample mainly includes sources at z&lt;1, with a tail extending up to z=7.2. The sample has a median stellar mass of 10^7 Mo and a median dust attenuation of Av=2mag. We analysed the morphology, environment and star-formation rate of these sources to investigate the reason of their large dust attenuation. In particular, HELM sources have sizes (effective radii, Re) similar to non-dusty dwarf galaxies and no correlation is visible between the axis ratios (b/a) and the dust attenuation. This findings indicate that it is unlikely that the large dust attenuation is due to projection effects, but a prolate or a disk-on oblate geometry are still possible, at least for a subsample of the sources. We have found that the distribution of HELM sources is slightly skewed toward more clustered environments than non-dusty dwarfs and tend to be slightly less star forming. This finding, if confirmed by spectroscopic follow-up, indicates that HELM sources could be going through some environmental processes, such as galaxy interactions.

### 17) [2512.14695](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14695v1): JWST Observations of the Double Nucleus in NGC 4486B: Possible Evidence for a Recent Binary SMBH Merger and Recoil

<p>
A recent study of the compact elliptical galaxy NGC 4486B using JWST-NIRSpec IFU kinematics confirmed a supermassive black hole (SMBH) of mass M_BH=3.6±0.7×10^8 (~8% of the stellar mass). In addition to its double nucleus, the nuclear kinematics show pronounced asymmetries: a velocity-dispersion peak displaced by 6 pc from the galaxy center and a ~16 km/s offset in the mean stellar line-of-sight velocity near the SMBH. We examine the origin of the 12 pc double nucleus and these asymmetries and show that the observations favor an SMBH surrounded by an eccentric nuclear disk (END). END formation models require the SMBH to experience a gravitational wave (GW) recoil following a binary SMBH merger. Our orbit-superposition models contain ~50% retrograde stars at the edge of the nuclear region, in striking agreement with END-formation simulations. We infer a pre-merger mass ratio q&gt;0.15 and a recoil kick of ~340 km/s. Our N-body simulations show that with such a kick, the SMBH returns to the center within ~30 Myr. Its flat central core is also consistent with earlier binary black hole scouring. We test two alternative mechanisms-buoyancy-driven oscillations and a pre-merger SMBH binary-but neither reproduces the observed offsets, favoring the GW-kick scenario. Our direct N-body simulations further show that a prograde SMBH binary in a rotating host can stall in a corotation resonance, delaying coalescence. Thus, although NGC 4486B is an old, relaxed galaxy near the Virgo cluster center, its SMBH appears to have merged only recently, making its nucleus a rare nearby laboratory for studying post-merger SMBH dynamics.

<p>
We present deep ALMA Band 7 observations of the [OIII] 88μm line and underlying dust continuum emission in four UV-bright, gravitationally lensed (magnification μ= 1.4-3.8), JWST-selected galaxies at z = 8.5 - 10.3, with observed magnitudes -22.5 ≲ M_UV ≲ -20.5. [OIII] 88μm is confidently detected in UNCOVER-10646 at z=8.5080 ± 0.0011 (15σ) and DHZ1 at z=9.3113 ± 0.0005 (6σ), with both being intrinsically luminous systems [L_[OIII] = (1.1 - 1.6) × 10^9 L<sub>&odot;</sub>] that follow the local [OIII]-SFR relation. [OIII] 88μm remains undetected in the two z&gt;10 targets, including in the z=10.07 X-ray AGN UHZ1, where we obtain a deep limit of L_[OIII] &lt; 6 × 10^7 L<sub>&odot;</sub>. Dust emission is not detected in any individual source nor in a stack (&lt;3σ). The high S/N [OIII] 88μm detection in UNCOVER-10646 uniquely reveals an additional broad component (FWHM = 1366_-329^+473 km/s; ΔBIC≈20) indicative of an ionized outflow. We infer a high outflow rate of M&#775;_out = 128_-46^+80 M<sub>&odot;</sub>yr^-1, corresponding to a mass loading factor η= M&#775;_out/SFR = 2.9_-1.0^+1.8 that is broadly consistent with theoretical predictions and JWST-based studies of ionized outflows at high redshift. While high-resolution ALMA follow-up is required to confirm the outflow, this first systematic study at z&gt;8 highlights the unique diagnostic power of [OIII] 88μm in characterizing galaxies in the early Universe.

Full sky coverage with 30-40 meter-class telescopes is essential to answer fundamental questions in Astrophysics, Cosmology, and Physics, such as the composition of the Universe and the formation of the first stars and supermassive black holes. An ELT/TMT-like telescope in the Northern Hemisphere is a fundamental and necessary facility to provide multiplexing of observing power, diversity of instrumentation, rapid response, and statistical power required to address the questions and the problems, current and future, unveiled by full sky observatories such as JWST, Euclid, or Roman space telescopes. The Northern ELT/TMT will expedite the study of unique, extreme, rare, transient, and/or high-energy events which will give the most information about fundamental Physics problems in the era of multi-messenger and time-domain Astronomy.

<p>
Observational campaigns with JWST have revealed a higher-than-expected abundance of UV-bright galaxies at z≳10, with various proposed theoretical explanations. A powerful complementary constraint to break degeneracies between different models is galaxy clustering. In this paper, we combine PANORAMIC pure parallel and legacy imaging along 34 independent sightlines to measure the cosmic variance (σ_CV) in the number count of Lyman break galaxies at z~10 which is directly related to their clustering strength. We find σ_CV=0.96^+0.20_-0.18, 1.46^+0.54_-0.44, and 1.71^+0.72_-0.59 per NIRCam pointing (~9.7 arcmin<sup>2</sup>, ≲1.5 pMpc at z~10) for galaxies with M_UV&lt;-19.5, -20, and -20.5. Comparing to galaxies in the UniverseMachine, we find that σ_CV is consistent with our measurements, but that the number densities are a factor ≳5 lower. We implement simple models in the UniverseMachine that represent different physical mechanisms to enhance the number density of UV-bright galaxies. All models decrease σ_CV by placing galaxies at fixed M_UV in lower mass halos, but they do so to varying degrees. Combined constraints on σ_CV and the UVLF tentatively disfavor models that globally increase the star formation efficiency (SFE) or the scatter in the M_UV-M_halo relation, while models that decrease the mass-to-light ratio, or assume a power-law scaling of the SFE with M_halo agree better with the data. We show that with sufficient additional independent sightlines, robust discrimination between models is possible, paving the way for powerful constraints on the physics of early galaxy evolution through NIRCam pure parallel imaging.

### 21) [2512.14066](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14066v1): Primordial Black Holes as Seeds for Extremely Overmassive AGN Observed by JWST

<p> Saiyang Zhang, Boyuan Liu, Volker Bromm, Florian Kühnel </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently identified Abell 2744-QSO1 as a compact, metal-poor, black hole (BH) dominated galaxy at z≃ 7. This system exhibits an extreme black-hole-to-stellar mass ratio and unusually low metallicity, posing significant challenges to BH seeding models. Motivated by these discoveries, we perform high-resolution cosmological simulations with a massive primordial black hole (PBH; M_BH=5×10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) seed, incorporating for the first time a fully coupled treatment of PBH accretion, BH feedback, and Population~III/II star formation and stellar feedback. Although PBHs accelerate structure formation through the seed effect, the associated strong thermal feedback from the accretion delays the onset of star formation to z≲ 10, producing short, bursty episodes throughout the subsequent evolution. PBH-driven outflows expel enriched gas from the nucleus, while sustained inflows from the intergalactic medium continuously replenish pristine material. This feedback-regulated cycle naturally yields low accretion rates (m&#775;_BH/m&#775;_edd ~ 1-10&percnt;), subsolar metallicities (Z/Z<sub>&odot;</sub>≲10^-2) and extreme M_BH/M<sub>&sext;</sub> ratios during both the initial star-forming phase and the subsequent quenching phases, in excellent agreement with JWST observations. Our results demonstrate that massive PBHs offer a viable pathway for forming the most extreme high-redshift systems, providing a physically motivated explanation for the extraordinary properties of Abell 2744-QSO1, as a sub-class of the broader population of JWST-discovered "little red dots".

### 22) [2512.13957](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13957v2): From ASTRID to BRAHMA &ndash; The role of overmassive black holes in little red dots in cosmological simulations

<p> Patrick LaChance, Aklant Kumar Bhowmick, Rupert A. C. Croft, Tiziana Di Matteo, Yihao Zhou, Fabio Pacucci, Laura Blecha, Paul Torrey, Yueying Ni, Nianyi Chen, Simeon Bird </p>
<p>
We leverage the overmassive black holes (M_BH/M<sub>&ast;</sub> ≈0.1) present in a realization of the BRAHMA cosmological hydrodynamic simulation suite to investigate their role in the emission of the unique "little red dot'' (LRD) objects identified by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We find that these black holes can produce LRD-like observables when their emission is modeled with a dense gas cloud shrouding the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Between redshifts 5 and 8, we find the number density of LRDs in this simulation to be 2.04 ± 0.32 × 10^-4 \space Mpc^-3, which is broadly consistent with current estimates for the total LRD population from JWST. Their emission in the rest-frame visible spectrum is dominated by their AGN, which induces the red color indicative of LRDs via a very strong Balmer break. Additionally, the elevated mass of the black holes reduces the temperature of their accretion discs. This shifts the peak of the AGN emission towards longer wavelengths, and increases their brightness in the rest-frame visible spectrum relative to lower mass black holes accreting at the same rate. These simulated LRDs have very minimal dust attenuation (A_V = 0.21 ± 0.12), limiting the amount of dust re-emission that would occur in the infrared, making them very likely to fall below the observed detection limits from observatories like the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). In contrast to the BRAHMA box, the ASTRID simulation produces systematically smaller black holes and predicts LRD number densities that are more than two orders of magnitude lower than current measurements. We therefore conclude that the presence of black holes that are overmassive relative to their host galaxy, and enshrouded in dense gas, is necessary for AGN-dominated LRD models to reproduce both the observed properties and abundances of JWST LRD populations.

### 23) [2512.13932](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13932v1): Cold Gas Infall onto A Brightest Group Galaxy via A Gas-Rich Minor Merger

<p> Ming-Yang Zhuang, Jinyi Shangguan, Yuan Bian, Yue Shen, Luis C. Ho, Min Du, Junyao Li, Zhao-Yu Li, Jing Wang </p>
<p>
Dust and cold gas are not uncommon in nearby early-type galaxies (ETGs), and represent an important aspect of their evolution. However, their origin has been debated for decades. Potential sources include internal processes (e.g., mass loss from evolved stars), external mechanisms (e.g., minor mergers or cooling flows), or a combination of both. Gas-rich minor mergers have long been proposed as an important channel for cold gas fueling in both observations and simulations, but direct evidence of cold gas transportation via gas-rich minor mergers remains elusive, particularly in galaxy groups and clusters where environmental effects are prevalent. In this letter, we present the first unambiguous case of direct cold gas transportation onto a brightest group galaxy (BGG) at z=0.25, driven by an ongoing close-separation gas-rich minor merger with a mass ratio of ~1:56. High-resolution JWST imaging reveals a heavily obscured, low-mass satellite that is barely visible at restframe optical wavelengths. Tidal stripping from this satellite deposits gas and dust onto the BGG, forming prominent ~10 kpc dust lanes in situ. Cosmological simulations indicate that such interactions preferentially occur in gas-rich satellites undergoing their first infall in highly eccentric orbits. Our results highlight the pivotal role of gas-rich minor mergers in replenishing cold gas reservoirs and shaping the evolution of central ETGs in galaxy groups.

### 24) [2512.13778](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13778v1): Resolving dust and Lyα emission in a lensed galaxy at the epoch of reionization with JWST/CANUCS

<p>
Lyman α emission is highly sensitive to dust and neutral hydrogen and is therefore expected to be strongly suppressed in dusty or gas-rich galaxies during the epoch of reionization (EoR). Nevertheless, numerous moderately dusty Lyα emitters (LAEs) are observed at this epoch, suggesting that complex interstellar medium (ISM) geometries and feedback-driven outflows may facilitate Lyα escape. We investigate the dust, gas, and stellar properties of the gravitationally lensed LAE HCM 6A at z=6.5676 to characterize its multiphase ISM and the physical conditions regulating Lyα escape. We combine JWST/NIRISS slitless spectroscopy, HST+JWST/NIRCam imaging, and JWST/NIRSpec slit spectra from the CANUCS program. Using a customized BAGPIPES SED-fitting framework with a flexible attenuation law, we derive stellar, nebular, and dust properties on integrated (~kpc), slit-level (~0.1 kpc), and pixel-level (~25 pc) scales, enabled by strong lensing (μ≈ 8.3-9.1). A Lyα map from SLEUTH traces the spatial distribution of Lyα emission. We measure an unlensed stellar mass of log M<sub>&ast;</sub> = 8.3-8.4 and an intrinsic UV magnitude of M_UV = -19.8 ± 0.1. The older region (S1) is moderately dusty with consistent stellar and nebular attenuation indicators, implying a uniform ISM geometry, while the youngest region (S3) shows strong discrepancies among dust tracers, indicating a feedback-shaped multiphase ISM. Lyα emission arises primarily from S3, where a dust-cleared central clump enables efficient Lyα escape. We find Calzetti-like attenuation curves with a UV bump that strengthens with stellar age and decreasing A_V. Our observations provide a uniquely detailed, spatially resolved view of a moderately dusty LAE during the EoR, demonstrating how feedback and multiphase ISM structure govern Lyα escape.

### 25) [2512.13470](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13470v1): The stellar to sub-stellar masses transition in 47 Tuc

<p> C. Ventura, M. Tailo, P. Ventura, F. D'Antona, A. P. Milone, A. F. Marino, C. Fiumi </p>
<p>
Context: The study of the Globular Cluster 47 Tuc offers the opportunity to shed new light on the debated issue on the presence of multiple populations in Globular Clusters, as recent results from HST photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy outlined star-to-star differences in the surface chemical composition. Aims: The goal of the present investigation is the interpretation of recent JWST data of the low main sequence of 47 Tuc, in order to explore the stellar to sub-stellar transition, to derive the mass distribution of the individual sources and to disentangle stars from different populations. Methods: Stellar evolution modelling of low-mass stars of metallicity [Fe/H]=-0.78 and oxygen content [O/Fe]=+0.4 and [O/Fe]=0 is used to simulate the evolution of the first and the second generation of the cluster. The comparison between the calculated sequences with the data points is used to characterize the individual objects, to split the different stellar components and to infer the current mass function of the cluster. Results: The first generation of 47 Tuc harbours 45 % of the overall population of the cluster, the remaining 55 % making up the second generation. The transition from the stellar to the sub-stellar domain is found at 0.074 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and 0.07 M<sub>&odot;</sub> for the first and second generations, respectively. The mass function of both the stellar generations are consistent with a Kroupa-like profile down to 0.22 M<sub>&odot;</sub>.

<p> Moka Nishigaki, Kimihiko Nakajima, Masami Ouchi, Peter Behroozi, Minami Nakane, Yui Takeda, Hiroya Umeda, Hidenobu Yajima, Hiroto Yanagisawa </p>
<p>
We present the statistics of line ratios and direct Te-based metallicities from JWST medium-resolution spectra of 292 galaxies at z=2-10, combining DREAMS observations with those of JADES and CEERS. To remove systematics caused by stellar mass (M<sub>&sext;</sub>) and star formation rate (SFR), we construct stacked spectra binned by redshift within fixed M<sub>&sext;</sub> and SFR ranges, as well as across the full ranges. We find that the [OII]3727/Hb ratio drops by a factor of five from z~3 to 8 at fixed M<sub>&sext;</sub> and SFR, in contrast to the nearly constant [OIII]5007/Hb ratio. We derive metallicities via the direct Te method using the [OIII]4363 line, and identify that high-z galaxies lie on the low-metallicity end of the anti-correlation between ionization parameter and metallicity at z~0. Photoionization modeling demonstrates that the redshift evolution, where metallicity decreases and ionization parameter increases, self-consistently explains the observed line ratios. We then examine the mass-metallicity (MZ) and fundamental (MZ-SFR) relations. Including additional galaxies at z~10-12, we find that the MZ relation monotonically decreases from z~3 to 10 at fixed M<sub>&sext;</sub>, while the MZ-SFR relation shows a significant decline at z&gt;8. Based on the ChemicalUniverseMachine model, this evolutionary trend can be explained by enhanced gas inflow (outflow) by a factor of ~5 (~1.7) at z&gt;8.

<p> Nadara Hudson, Ryan Endsley, John Chisholm </p>
<p>
JWST continues to reveal an astonishing number of massive quiescent galaxies at z&gt;4, with number densities ≳10× higher than model predictions. NIRSpec spectra imply that many of these systems underwent intense starburst episodes (SFR ≳300M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr), though direct evidence of such starbursts in the Gyr largely comes from exceptionally rare dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) selected in the far-infrared. Here, we report the discovery of an extremely red (β=-0.6) yet UV-bright (F115W = 26.0 mag) z~6 star-forming system selected as a Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) over ≈500 arcmin<sup>2</sup> of deep NIRCam imaging. This galaxy (UDS_43065) shows photometric colors implying a prominent Balmer break and strong Hα emission, consistent with a dramatic burst of star formation (SFR ≈ 500-1000 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr) occurring 5-10 Myr ago that formed 20-40% of its total stellar mass (≈1.5×10^10M<sub>&odot;</sub>) with little activity since. This galaxy is one of only two objects with M<sub>&ast;</sub>&gt;10^10M<sub>&odot;</sub> across our full sample of 813 z~6 star-forming LBGs, and the only galaxy with a confident extremely-red UV slope (β&gt;-1). UDS_43065 is clearly resolved yet compact in F444W (r_e=400±10 pc) indicating a very high stellar mass surface density of log(Σ_eff/(M<sub>&odot;</sub> kpc^-2))=10.25±0.13 comparable to quenched z~2-7 galaxies. If the inferred star formation history (SFH) of UDS_43065 is corroborated with further observations, this object would seemingly represent a rarely-seen transitional phase between massive DSFGs and passive systems in the first Gyr, helping resolve the puzzling abundance of early massive quenched galaxies.

To date, many spectroscopic confirmations of z&gt;7 galaxies have been obtained using JWST/NIRSpec prism observations, with most of their physical properties inferred from these observations and corresponding imaging. What is needed are higher-resolution spectra at deeper depths to study these sources in detail. We present The High-(Redshift+Ionization) Line Search (THRILS) program: deep (&gt;8 hr) observations in two pointings of JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy to 1) probe high ionization spectral features in z&gt;8 galaxies that are indicative of top-heavy initial mass functions or growing massive black holes, 2) search for accreting supermassive black holes in typical galaxies at z~4-9 through broad Balmer line emission, and 3) probe the stellar-mass growth histories of massive galaxies. We include spectroscopic redshift measurements for 89 sources from the THRILS data, as well as a detection threshold for the full and half depth integration times of the program.

### 29) [2512.11989](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11989v1): NGDEEP: A New Non-Parametric Measure of Local Star-Formation and Attenuation at Cosmic Noon

<p> Grace M. Forrey, Raymond C. Simons, Jonathan R. Trump, Lu Shen, Anton M. Koekemoer, Micaela B. Bagley, Steven L. Finkelstein, Casey Papovich, Nor Pirzkal </p>
<p>
We introduce a new non-parametric technique to quantify the spatially-resolved relationship between the local star-formation rate (SFR) and dust attenuation. We then apply it to 14 star-forming galaxies at 1.0&lt;z&lt;2.5 using JWST/NIRISS slitless spectroscopy from the NGDEEP survey. First, we construct spatially resolved (~1~kpc per pixel) Balmer decrement (Hα/Hβ) maps of these galaxies and derive their corresponding dust attenuation and intrinsic SFR maps. We then rank-order the map pixels by attenuation and construct a cumulative distribution curve of the total SFR as a function of increasing attenuation. We define A^SFR_10&percnt;, A^SFR_50&percnt;, and A^SFR_90&percnt; as the dust attenuation levels behind which 10&percnt;, 50&percnt;, and 90&percnt; of the total integrated SFR is screened, respectively. These metrics quantify the probability that a given star-forming region lies behind a given level of attenuation. Across the full sample, 50&percnt; of the local star formation occurs behind an attenuation of 3.41 mag or higher (A^SFR_50&percnt;). This indicates that the bulk of star formation in these galaxies is significantly attenuated by dust. The value of A^SFR_10&percnt; equals 1.45 for the average profile, indicating that even the least attenuated star-forming regions are still highly attenuated. The globally measured attenuation more closely matches A^SFR_10&percnt; than A^SFR_50&percnt;. This suggests that the global value is weighted toward the least dust-obscured star-forming regions and significantly underestimates the typical attenuation a star-forming region encounters. Our results demonstrate a new approach for understanding the extremely dusty local conditions of the star-forming interstellar medium in SF galaxies at cosmic noon.

<p>
We present a catalog of 57 high-redshift z&gt;6 galaxy candidates, including 14 spectroscopic confirmations (z = 6.10 &ndash; 9.25), 2 Little Red Dots (z = 4.77, 5.81), and 2 interlopers (z = 3.23, 3.72), based on \JWST NIRCam imaging (7 filters), NIRSpec spectroscopy (PRISM and G395H), and archival \HST imaging (17 filters) of the strong lensing galaxy cluster MACS0647. Our highest redshift confirmation (z = 9.25) is an Extremely Blue Galaxy (presented in~\citealtYanagisawa2024), and here we identify a spectral turnover likely due to damped Lyman-α. We identify an overdensity of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts z = 6.1, confirming the z ~ 6 overdensity identified in \HST images. In one of these galaxies, our high-resolution G395H spectroscopy reveals two spatially resolved components with a velocity difference of ~90 km/s; if these components are gravitationally bound, this would imply a dynamical mass on the order of ~ 10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> given their projected separation. We present spectral line fluxes, widths, and derived physical properties, including stellar masses (10^8 - 10^9  M<sub>&odot;</sub>) and metallicities (10&percnt; - 40&percnt;  Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) for our spectroscopic sample. We note half of our NIRSpec data was obtained with standard 3-slitlet nods and half was obtained with single slitlets yielding similar results, demonstrating the power to observe more sources on a densely packed NIRSpec MSA.

<p>
We present deep JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy of GLIMPSE-16043, a promising z~6 Pop III candidate originally identified through NIRCam photometry as having weak [OIII]λ&lambda;4959,5007 emission. Our follow-up reveals clear [OIII] emission, ruling out a genuine zero-metallicity nature. However, the combination of the measured line fluxes and photometry indicates that its spectral energy distribution requires an extraordinarily strong Balmer jump (-1.66 ± 0.47 mag) and Hα equivalent width (3750±1800 Å), features that cannot be reproduced by current stellar+nebular or pure nebular photoionization models. The only models approaching the observations to almost within 1σ involve a hot (T_eff\!≃\!10^4.7 K) single blackbody embedded in a low-T_e nebular environment, suggestive of scenarios such as a tidal-disruption event or a microquasar with strong disk winds. This cautions that photometric Pop~III selections are vulnerable to contamination when the rest-frame optical continuum is undetected. Motivated by this, we refine the photometric Pop III selection criteria to exclude the locus of extreme Balmer-jump objects. The revised criteria also recover the recently reported spectroscopic candidate AMORE6, demonstrating that the updated selection preserves sensitivity to genuine Pop III-like sources while removing key contaminants. Applying the refined criteria across legacy survey fields and five newly released CANUCS lensing cluster fields, we revisit the Pop III UV luminosity function and estimate the Pop III cosmic star-formation rate density to be ≈[10^-6&ndash;10^-4]~M<sub>&odot;</sub>~yr^-1~cMpc^-3 at z≃6&ndash;7, falling in the range of current theoretical predictions.

<p> Atte Keitaanranta, Peter H. Johansson, Alexander Rawlings, Toni Tuominen, Antti Rantala, Thorsten Naab, Shihong Liao, Bastián Reinoso </p>
<p>
We present a cosmological zoom-in simulation targeting the high redshift compact progenitor phase of massive galaxies, with the most massive galaxy reaching a stellar mass of M<sub>&sext;</sub>=8.5× 10^10  M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z=5. The dynamics of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is modelled from seeding down to their coalescence at sub-parsec scales due to gravitational wave (GW) emission by utilising a new version of the KETJU code, which combines regularised integration of sufficiently massive SMBHs with a dynamical friction subgrid model for lower-mass SMBHs. All nine massive galaxies included in this study go through a gas-dominated phase of early compaction in the redshift range of z~ 7-9, starting at stellar masses of M<sub>&sext;</sub>≳ 10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and ending at a few times M<sub>&sext;</sub>~ 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. The sizes, masses and broad band fluxes of these compact systems are in general agreement with the population of systems observed with JWST known as `Little Red Dots'. In the compact phase, the stellar and SMBH masses grow rapidly, leading to a sharp decline in the central gas fractions. The outer regions, however, remain relatively gas-rich, leading to subsequent off-centre star formation and size growth. Due to the very high central stellar densities (ρ<sub>&sext;</sub>≳ 10^13 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/kpc^3), the SMBHs merge rapidly, typically just ~ 4-35 Myr after the SMBH binaries have become bound. Combining KETJU with the phenomenological PhenomD model resolves the complete evolution of the GW emission from SMBH binaries through the Pulsar Timing Array frequency waveband up to the final few orbits that produce GWs observable with the future LISA mission.

<p>
It has been over 24 years since the iconic Crab Nebula has been visited by the high spatial resolution eye of the Hubble Space Telescope. The expanding nebula is dynamic on these timescales, with many of the outer filaments of the nebula known to show proper motions of 0.3'' or more per year. Over time, it has become increasingly difficult to compare the fine scale structure of the nebula with recent data at other wavelengths. We have re-observed the Crab in an HST Cycle 31 program using the WFC3 camera and filters similar to those previously used to make the existing mosaic that dates from 1999-2000 and was obtained with the WFPC2 camera. Two central fields were observed with the F487N filter, providing an uncontaminated hydrogen band for comparison. We also observed two primarily continuum band filters (F547M and F763M), allowing us to study the optical synchrotron nebula component of the Crab's emission. We compare these new data to the first epoch of WFPC2 data as well as to more contemporaneous NIR/MIR imagery from JWST. Finally, we highlight two previously unrecognized groupings of filaments with similar emission characteristics that are nearly diametrically opposed from the pulsar but whose origin remains uncertain.

### 34) [2512.11050](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11050v1): Balmer Transition Signatures from Gas-Enshrouded, Dust-Poor Active Galactic Nuclei

<p> Zu Yan, Kohei Inayoshi, Kejian Chen, Jingsong Guo </p>
<p>
Little red dots (LRDs), a population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) recently discovered by JWST, show distinctive Balmer-transition features, including prominent Balmer absorption, pronounced Balmer breaks, and large equivalent widths of broad Hα emission, all of which indicate the presence of dense gas surrounding their central black holes. A further key property of LRDs is their large Balmer decrements with broad Hα/Hβ line-flux ratios far exceeding the Case B recombination value. These ratios of Hα/Hβ&gt;3 have often been interpreted as evidence for heavy dust extinction (A_V≳ 3 mag), however such dust would inevitably produce strong near-to-mid infrared re-emission that is hardly seen in JWST/MIRI observations. To investigate the physical origin of these observed Balmer features, we perform radiation transfer calculations through dust-free, dense gas. We show that the observed large Balmer decrements (Hα/Hβ and Hα/Hγ) naturally arise from Balmer resonance scattering without invoking dust. At sufficiently high densities (n_H ≳ 10^8-10~cm^-3), the elevated multiple Balmer-line ratios converge to values that closely mimic dust reddening, explaining why LRD spectra resemble obscured AGNs. Furthermore, when the Balmer break and broad Balmer lines originate in the same dense gas, their strengths are physically linked, allowing us to constrain the density structure and infer a low broad-line region gas mass of ~ O(10~M<sub>&odot;</sub>). Such a small gas reservoir would be enriched by even a single supernova, implying that LRDs with observed low-metallicity signatures likely experienced minimal star formation in their nuclei.

We present new JWST IFS observations of the active galaxy NGC 1068, combining Mid-IR and optical IFS data from MIRI and MUSE to characterize the multi-phase circumnuclear gas properties and its interaction with the AGN outflow and radio jet. MIRI data trace the multiphase gas emission up to 400 pc from the nucleus at 20&ndash;60 pc resolution, unveiling a clumpy ionized structure around the radio hot-spots and a rotating warm molecular disc. Innovative Mid-IR diagnostic diagrams highlight the role of the AGN as the main excitation source for the ionized gas in the entire MIRI field of view, consistent with optical diagnostics, and supporting the AGN-driven wind scenario. Density sensitive [NeV] and [ArV] Mid-IR transitions reveal high-density clumps (n_e &gt; 10**4 cm**-3) along the edges of the jet and outflow, tracing gas compression by the expanding wind. We combined multi-cloud kinematic (MOKA) and photo-ionization (HOMERUN) modeling to characterize the ionized outflow properties and found that [OIV] traces an outflow 300 km/s faster than that inferred from [OIII], showing that the two lines originate from distinct gas components. This kinematic dichotomy is confirmed by the photoionization analysis, which requires a dust-poor component dominating the optical lines and a dust-rich component responsible for the Mid-IR emission. The Mid-IR-revealed dusty component carries a significantly larger ionized-gas mass than what can be inferred from optical lines alone, showing that most of the outflowing mass is hidden from classical optical diagnostics. Our modelling point to a two-stage acceleration scenario, with velocities up to ~2000 km/s, consistent with an energy-driven wind. Our findings indicates that the outflow entrains up to a few 10**6 solar masses of ionized gas and couples efficiently with the surrounding ISM, injecting turbulence and impacting the host-galaxy environment.

<p>
The galaxy cluster XLSSC 122 is a rare system at z = 1.98, hosting surprisingly evolved member galaxies when the Universe was only one-third of its present age. Leveraging deep JWST/NIRCam imaging, we perform a weak-lensing analysis and reconstruct the cluster's mass distribution, finding a mass peak that coincides with both the X-ray peak and the position of the brightest cluster galaxy. We obtain mass and concentration estimates of M_200c=1.6 ± 0.3× 10^14~M<sub>&odot;</sub> and c_200 c=6.3 ± 0.3, respectively, in agreement with recent strong-lensing estimates. The high concentration in particular motivates tests against empirical and simulation-derived mass&ndash;concentration relations. Placing our weak-lensing mass map in the context of Chandra X-ray data, MeerKAT radio imaging, ALMA+ACA/ACT Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) mapping, and a new JWST intracluster light measurement, we identify consistent NE&ndash;SW elongation across datasets and a pronounced offset along the same axis between the SZ and mass/X-ray peaks, pointing to significant merger activity. XLSSC 122 thus serves as a JWST pilot study for high-z lensing, demonstrating the telescope's unique ability to map cluster mass distributions at z~2 and motivating a uniform sample of analogous systems with joint lensing, X-ray, SZ, and radio data to probe cluster assembly at Cosmic Noon.

We present a comprehensive study of the ionizing properties of 1721 galaxies at 5.6&lt;z&lt;6.5 using deep JWST/NIRCam photometric imaging from the NEP, JADES, and PRIMER surveys spanning an unmasked area ~550arcmin<sup>2</sup> across UV magnitudes -22≲ M_UV≲-17.5. Our 90&percnt; stellar mass complete sample suggests little relation of UV slope with magnitude, β_UV=(-0.040±0.022)M_UV-2.88^+0.43_-0.44, implying f<sub>esc</sub>^LyC≃5&percnt; based on calibrations from the Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS). We measure a constant ionizing photon production efficiency with UV magnitude, log_10(ξ<sub>ion</sub>, 0/Hz erg^-1) = -0.006^+0.019_-0.017~M_UV + 25.05^+0.39_-0.34, consistent with HST canonical values. The total production rate of photons escaping into the IGM is computed as log_10(\dotn<sub>ion</sub>/s<sup>-1</sup>Mpc^-3)=50.31^+0.07_-0.06 for M_UV&lt;-17 galaxies from our star forming and smouldering UV luminosity functions (UVLFs), which differ in the faint-end slope (α_SFG=-2.2±0.2; α_sm=-1.7±0.2). Extrapolating to the latest UVLF turnover limits from the massive lensing galaxy cluster Abell S1063 (M_UV, lim=-13.5) implies that a recombination-weighted HII clumping factor C_HII, rec=6.2^+4.1_-2.1 is required to produce fully stably reionized at z≃6. A clumping factor of this magnitude resolves the ionizing photon budget crisis. Our methodology paves the way for indirect clumping measurements from galaxies which will provide insight into earlier stages of the EoR when the Lyα-forest becomes saturated and more direct quasar measurements become impossible.

### 38) [2512.10516](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10516v2): Isotopomer-Specific Carbon Isotope Ratio of Complex Organic Molecules in Star-Forming Cores

<p> Ryota Ichimura, Hideko Nomura, Kenji Furuya, Tetsuya Hama, T. J. Millar </p>
<p>
The recent observation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar ices by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), along with previous gas-phase detections, underscores the importance of grain surface and ice mantle chemistry in the synthesis of COMs. In this study, we investigate the formation and carbon isotope fractionation of COMs by constructing a new astrochemical reaction network that distinguishes the position of ^13C within species (e.g., H^13COOCH_3 and HCOO^13CH_3 are distinguished). We take into account the position of ^13C in each species in gas and solid phase chemistry. This new model allows us to resolve isotopomer-specific ^12C/^13C ratios of COMs formed in the star-forming cores. We consider thermal diffusion-driven radical-radical reactions on the ice surface and non-thermal radiolysis chemistry in the bulk (surface + mantle) ice. We find that carbon isotope fractionation of the functional groups in COMs appears through both non-thermal radiolysis in cold environments and thermal diffusion in warm environments, depending on the COMs. In particular, COMs containing methyl groups show isotopomer differences in ^12C/^13C ratios that reflect their formation pathways and environments. These isotopomer-resolved fractionation patterns provide a diagnostic tool to probe the origins of COMs in star-forming cores. Our results suggest that future comparisons between high-sensitivity isotopic observations and isotopomer-specific models will be helpful for constraining the relative contributions of thermal and non-thermal formation processes of COMs.

### 39) [2512.09996](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09996v1): GA-NIFS: Powerful and frequent outflows in moderate-luminosity AGN at z~3-6

The period between z ~ 3-6, a key transformational phase in galaxy evolution preceding `cosmic noon' (z ~ 1-3), is very poorly explored in terms of feedback from AGN acting through gas outflows. In this work, we study the properties of outflows in AGN (mostly X-ray-selected) from the GOODS-S field, exploiting JWST NIRSpec IFU observations as part of the GA-NIFS GTO survey. Together with its twin sub-sample from COSMOS reported in a previous GA-NIFS work, this constitutes the largest spatially resolved sample of AGN outflows at these redshifts to date, comprising 16 targets with outflows (out of a total of 19 AGN), and probes the unexplored regime of AGN at z ~ 3-6 with bolometric luminosities ~10^45-46 erg/s. We mapped the rest-optical ionised gas emission lines at sub-kpc scales and spectrally isolated the broad wings tracing fast outflows from the gas at rest in the host galaxies. The incidence of ionised outflows in the GOODS-S + COSMOS GA-NIFS sample is high (&gt;75&percnt;), among the highest at any redshift. We inferred outflow velocities between ~600-2000 km/s, maximum radii of &lt;1-4 kpc, and ionised gas mass outflow rates of ~0.1-100 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr, which in some cases can exceed the host galaxy star formation rate (SFR). We find that the outflow properties inferred for the GOODS-S + COSMOS GA-NIFS AGN sample and their relations with L_bol and SFR generally align with those observed for other spatially resolved literature samples of AGN outflows across different redshifts and AGN luminosities. Nonetheless, after accounting for any luminosity bias, our analysis suggests a cosmic evolution of the outflow properties, with higher median mass outflow rates (and possibly also mass loading factors) at higher redshifts, especially at z&gt;3, indicating that AGN outflows were stronger in the early Universe than at later times, and thus potentially more capable of affecting their host galaxy.

### 40) [2512.09980](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09980v1): UV Luminosity Functions from HST and JWST: A Possible Resolution to the High-Redshift Galaxy Abundance Puzzle and Implications for Cosmic Strings

<p> Mattéo Blamart, Adrian Liu, Robert Brandenberger, Julian B. Muñoz, Bryce Cyr </p>
<p>
Recent observations of high redshift galaxies by the James Webb Space Telescope suggest the presence of a bright population of galaxies that is more abundant than predicted by most galaxy formation models. These observations have led to a rethinking of these models, and numerous astrophysical and cosmological solutions have been proposed, including cosmic strings, topological defects that may be remnants of a specific phase transition in the very early moments of the Universe. In this paper, we integrate cosmic strings, a source of nonlinear and non-Gaussian perturbations, into the semi analytical code Zeus21, allowing us to efficiently predict the ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF). We conduct a precise study of parameter degeneracies between star-formation astrophysics and cosmic-string phenomenology. Our results suggest that cosmic strings can boost the early-galaxy abundance enough to explain the measured UVLFs from the James Webb and Hubble Space Telescopes from redshift z = 4 to z = 17 without modifying the star-formation physics. In addition, we set a new upper bound on the string tension of Gμ≤ssapprox 10^-8 (95&percnt; credibility), improving upon previous limits from the cosmic microwave background. Although with current data there is some level of model and prior dependence to this limit, it suggests that UVLFs are a promising avenue for future observational constraints on cosmic-string physics.

### 41) [2512.09815](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09815v1): Footprints in the Wind: Probing X-ray Outflows in NGC 7469 using Near-Infrared Emission Lines

<p>
AGN winds play an important role in the co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies, yet their driving mechanisms and impact on star formation remain subjects of active investigation. Critically, the lack of X-ray Integral Field Units currently limits our ability to acquire spatially resolved velocity information in the X-ray regime. However, instead, this can be achieved using the James Webb Space Telescope. As part of an ongoing investigation of the nuclear feedback processes in the nearby luminous AGN NGC 7469, we present an analysis of the kinematics of the X-ray emitting outflows using near-infrared footprint lines such as [Mg VIII] 3.03 um. These high-ionization emission lines are associated with the same gas analyzed in the X-ray, and thus can be used to probe the footprint of the X-ray wind's velocity structure and ionization state. Thanks to the wide wavelength range available with JWST we also use nebular (e.g. [S IV] 10.51 um) and coronal (e.g. [Ne V] 14.32 um) emission lines to offer a comprehensive multi-phase view of the outflows. We present mass and kinetic energy outflow rates, and find that while the feedback processes in NGC 7469 are not efficient by theoretical benchmarks, the most massive and energetic component is the high ionization X-ray gas.

### 42) [2512.09512](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09512v1): SLICE &ndash; Combining Strong Lensing and X-ray in AC 114. Insights into the Merger Scenario

<p>
AC114 is a historically significant galaxy cluster, being one of the first strong lensing clusters detected from the ground in the early 1990s, prior to the launch of the HST. Despite this early prominence, no detailed lensing analyses have been carried out for more than fifteen years. We here study this cluster using JWST imaging obtained as part of the SLICE program, complemented by archival HST and X-ray observations. JWST data reveal ten new multiply imaged systems and enable the identification of conjugate substructures in several of the sixteen systems, significantly increasing the number of strong lensing constraints. Using these data, we construct a parametric mass model with Lenstool and extend it by explicitly incorporating the Chandra data in a combined strong lensing+X-ray fit. Our best-fit model reproduces the multiple images with an RMS of 0.4" while simultaneously matching the X-ray data. The dark matter distribution is unimodal and centered on the brightest cluster galaxy, with a large core radius of 83+-5kpc, consistent with values reported in other strong lensing clusters. The strong lensing constraints require the inclusion of an external shear component which position angle points unambiguously towards a nearby (~1Mpc), well defined mass concentration at the same redshift in the North-West, for which we propose the naming AC114b. The spatial coverage of the XMM-Newton data encompasses the whole structure, allowing us to probe the X-ray properties of the companion cluster and the thermodynamics of AC114, providing evidence for a major merger, in line with previous signatures seen in Chandra, radio and optical spectroscopic data. Our results shed new light on the merging scenario, revealing a major merger caught in a late post-collisional phase, where AC114 is the dominant system and Ac114b has likely been stripped of its hot gas.

<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed an unexpected excess of UV-bright galaxies at z&gt;10, unaccounted for by extrapolations from pre-JWST observations and theoretical models. Understanding the physical properties and star formation histories (SFH) of high redshift systems is key to distinguish between the different proposed scenarios. We identify and analyse a sample of 2420 robust candidates at z~7-14 drawn from the ASTRODEEP-JWST dataset over ~0.2 deg<sup>2</sup> and model their properties with non-parametric SFHs to derive their specific star formation rate (sSFR) and stellar population properties. We find that the median sSFR and M/L remain roughly constant across the probed redshift range. We show that this result is robust against potential systematics unless a hidden population of dust-enshrouded starbursts, undetectable in current data, exists at these redshifts. In any case, the absence of observed high-sSFR systems at the highest redshifts suggests that any dust-free starburst phase must be short-lived. The observed sSFR evolution is in tension with most (though not all) theoretical models, making it a key quantity for discriminating among competing scenarios. The sample shows a wide range of physical conditions and galaxy classes, including systems with low sSFR and high mass-to-light ratios (M/L) up to z~10, indicative of already evolved galaxies only a few hundred Myr after the Big Bang, and different degrees of dust attenuation. We finally attempt to reconstruct the assembly histories of two sub-samples: a) the highest-M/L galaxies at z~7-8, which appear to have formed the bulk of their stars at least 500 Myr before observation, implying progenitors observable as UV-bright sources at z&gt;20, and b) z&gt;11 galaxies, which formed through stochastic SFH, remaining UV-faint for most of their early evolution, before undergoing recent (~50 Myr old) episodes of major growth.

<p>
We investigate the host galaxy of the long gamma-ray burst GRB 230307A, which is associated with a kilonova candidate likely produced by a binary neutron-star (BNS) merger. The transient occurred at a projected offset of ~ 40 kpc from its spiral-galaxy host. We consider two explanations for this large distance: (i) NSs that merge inside a remote globular cluster, or (ii) a BNS that formed in the disk whose orbit was strongly modified by the NS natal kicks. Using JWST data and comparisons with known globular clusters, we show that a globular-cluster origin is extremely unlikely, ruling out case (i). Considering case (ii), using JWST and MUSE data, we derive the host galaxy morphology, stellar mass, estimate the atomic gas (HI+He) contribution, and the host rotation curve. Assuming an NFW halo and applying Bayesian inference, we obtain a mass model for the host galaxy. From this model, we compute the time required for a disk-formed BNS, with a given natal kick, to reach the observed offset while marginalizing over uncertainties and over the initial position in the disk. We compare these results with BNS-merger simulations from the SEVN population-synthesis code combined with PARSEC stellar evolutionary tracks, which provide the coalescence time and kick velocity for each realization. The two approaches have an overlap in the kick-time diagram, but only 0.1&percnt; of the simulated systems fall within the 2σ region of the galaxy mass model. This indicates that a disk origin is possible, but requires fine-tuned conditions for the kilonova to occur at such a large distance from the host galaxy.

Understanding the physical conditions and feedback mechanisms in early massive galaxies is essential to uncover how they formed and evolved during the first billion years of the Universe. In this context, the galaxy EGSY8p7/CEERS-1019 at z=8.6 provides an excellent benchmark, given its stellar mass of 10^9.3M<sub>&odot;</sub> and elevated N/O abundance despite its sub-solar metallicity. In this study, we present new JWST/NIRSpec observations offering the first spatially resolved spectroscopy of this galaxy, with higher sensitivity and spectral resolution than previous studies. We identify broad (FWHM=650km/s) Hβ and [OIII] emission components whose emission is located between the two rest-frame UV clumps of the galaxy and extended over a distance of ~1kpc. The morphology and kinematics of these components indicate that the broad emission arises from outflowing gas rather than from an AGN broad-line region. The kinetic energy injection rate from stellar feedback is an order of magnitude higher than that of the outflow, while the radiation pressure rate is comparable to the outflow momentum rate. These results suggest that stellar feedback alone can drive the outflow, with radiation pressure potentially providing the required momentum transfer. We derive a low mass-loading factor (η=0.16) and ionizing photon escape fraction (f<sub>esc</sub>=0.021±0.014). Together with the high electron density measured (n_e=2200cm^-3), these results support the interpretation that most of the gas remains confined within the galaxy. Comparisons of diagnostic emission-line ratios with photoionization and shock models support a star-formation-driven ionization scenario, ruling out any excitation by AGN radiation. Finally, the absence of detectable Wolf-Rayet features suggests that alternative mechanisms must be considered to explain the high N/O ratio in this galaxy.

### 46) [2512.08543](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08543v1): High-Redshift Galactic Outflows: Orientation Effects, Kinematics, and Metallicity in TNG50 and SERRA

Context: Recently, JWST/NIRSpec observations have provided the first detections of warm ionised outflows in low-mass galaxies at high redshifts (z&gt;3), revealing an occurrence rate of 25-40% depending on the intensity of the emission lines. This fraction is lower than predicted by simulations, which suggest that fast outflowing gas should be a common feature of all star-forming galaxies in the early Universe. Aims: In order to better understand the discrepancies between simulations and observations, we identify and characterize outflows in high-redshift galaxies using the TNG50 cosmological and SERRA zoom-in simulations. Our study examines how outflow detectability depends on the line of sight, explores the properties of the fast gas, and investigates its relationship with key galactic properties. Methods: We analyse approximately 60000 galaxies from TNG50 and 3000 galaxies from SERRA over the redshift ranges z=3-5 and z=4-5, respectively, spanning stellar masses of Mstar=10^7.5-10^11M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Outflows in the immediate vicinity of each galaxy are identified using a Gaussian mixture model algorithm that uses the gas velocity, star-formation-rate, and location as input parameters. We subsequently compare the simulated outflows to those observed in the JWST/JADES NIRSpec survey. Results: Outflow masses in both TNG50 and SERRA broadly reproduce the JWST/JADES measurements within roughly 0.5dex, though simulations tend to predict slightly higher values, suggesting that optical emission lines capture only a fraction of the multiphase outflow. However, simulated outflow velocities are typically an order of magnitude lower than those inferred from observations. TNG50 indicates a clear orientation dependence as outflows in face-on galaxies are approximately 15% more likely to be detected than in edge-on systems, with this difference increasing to nearly 40% for more massive, disc-shaped galaxies.

We present spatially resolved analysis of stellar populations in the brightest z&gt;6 galaxy known to date (AB mag 23), the strongly lensed MACS0308-zD1 (dubbed the "Cosmic Spear'') at z<sub>spec</sub>=6.2. New JWST NIRCam imaging and high-resolution NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy span the rest-frame ultraviolet to optical. The NIRCam imaging reveals bright star-forming clumps and a tail consisting of three distinct, extremely compact star clusters that are multiply-imaged by gravitational lensing. The star clusters have effective radii of R_eff ~ 5 pc, stellar masses of M_* ~ 10^6-10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, and high stellar mass surface densities of Σ_* &gt; 10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>~pc^-2. While their stellar populations are very young (~ 5-9 Myr), their dynamical ages exceed unity, consistent with the clusters being gravitationally bound systems. Placing the star clusters in the size vs.~stellar mass density plane, we find they occupy a region similar to other high-redshift star clusters within galaxies observed recently with JWST, being significantly more massive and denser than local star clusters. Spatially resolved analysis of the brightest clump reveals a compact, intensely star-forming core. The ionizing photon production efficiency (ξ<sub>ion</sub>) is slightly suppressed in this central region, potentially indicating a locally elevated Lyman continuum escape fraction facilitated by feedback-driven channels.

<p>
We present a comprehensive analysis of the nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) abundance ratio in star-forming galaxies at redshift z~1-6, with a median redshift of z=2.7, using deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy. Leveraging detections of faint auroral emission lines in 76 galaxies at z&gt;1 from both the MARTA survey and a large compilation of high-redshift literature objects, we derive direct electron temperature-based abundances for nitrogen and oxygen using rest-frame optical lines. We establish the first high-redshift calibrations of strong-line N/O diagnostics based on direct abundance measurements, finding no significant evolution for either N2O2 = [NII]6585/[OII]3727,3729 and N2S2 = [NII]6585/[SII]6717,6731 diagnostics compared to local realisations. We then investigate the N/O-O/H relation across cosmic time using both direct abundances and strong-line based measurements (additional 430 galaxies). We find evidence for mild but systematic nitrogen enhancement at high redshift: galaxies at z&gt;1 exhibit N/O ratios elevated by ~0.18 dex (median offset) at fixed O/H compared to the local relation, with a more pronounced enhancement at low metallicity (12+log(O/H) &lt; 8.1) where the offset reaches up to ~0.3-0.4 dex. We consider several scenarios to explain the observed trends, including bursty star formation, differential metal loading, and inflows of pristine gas. Our results provide the most extensive confirmation of elevated N/O ratios at high-redshift to date based on rest-optical diagnostics and within a self-consistent frame.

We present six galaxy-scale strong lenses with HST imaging modeled using GIGA-Lens. This is Paper V of the DESI Strong Lens Foundry series. These systems were discovered in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys using ML/AI methods and confirmed with DESI, Keck/NIRES, and VLT/MUSE spectroscopy. They span z_d = 0.39 - 1.1 and z_s = 1.4 - 3.3. This is the first HST strong lens sample modeled with full forward modeling &ndash; all lens and source parameters sampled simultaneously in a single inference &ndash; with explicit convergence validation using both \widehatR and effective sample size (ESS) for each system. All inferred parameters satisfy \widehatR &lt; 1.1 and ESS ≳ 10,000, demonstrating that GIGA-Lens achieves statistically robust inference even for some of the most complex galaxy-scale lenses known. These results pave the way for scaling to much larger, high-resolution strong lens samples from HST, Euclid, JWST, and Roman. Convergence-validated modeling will be critical for key science goals, including constraining the mass-density profile of galaxies, detecting low-mass dark matter (sub)halos, and delivering precise and accurate cosmological constraints.

<p>
Methods: We obtained adaptive optics-assisted integral field spectroscopy in the near-infrared (IR) K band (1.93-2.47 μm) with VLT/SINFONI, complemented by VLA X and C bands (3-6 cm) and ALMA band 3 (~3.3 mm) observations. Results: The near-IR continuum reveals two infrared sources, IRS 2 and IRS 7, while the main protostellar core IRAS 18162-2048 remains undetected up to 2.47 μm. IRS 7 shows a peculiar Hydrogen Recombination Line Brγ profile with a narrow emission component superimposed on a broad absorption feature, consistent with a B2/B3 zero-age main-sequence star. Extended H<sub>2</sub> emission exhibits a `sawtooth' pattern in the excitation diagram, characteristic of UV radiation in a PDR rather than shock excitation. The radiative transfer model Cloudy reproduces the H<sub>2</sub> ro-vibrational populations for T_gas=600 K and n_H=7.9×10^3 cm^-3. VLA X and C bands observations reveal a compact radio source previously reported as a stationary condensation (SC) and coincident with IRS 7. For the first time, we detect IRS 7/SC in mm wavelengths. The spectral index in the 3-6 cm and 3.3 mm regime is consistent with optically thin free-free emission. Conclusions: Our near-IR and radio observations reveal that IRS 7/SC is a B2/B3 ZAMS star that has begun to photoionise its environment, giving rise to an extended PDR and a compact \ionH ii region. The coexistence of this source with the deeply embedded protostar IRAS 18162-2048 and other bubble-like structures in the field, suggests a multigenerational star-forming environment. Future itJames Webb Space Telescope observations targeting the H<sub>2</sub> pure rotational lines (3-28 μm) and other HRLs less affected by extinction will be essential to characterise the cooler molecular and ionised gas to fully disclose the formation history of the region.

### 51) [2512.07050](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07050v1): JWST reveals extended stellar disks for ALMA-bright dusty star-forming galaxies in the Spiderweb protocluster

<p>
We present JWST/NIRCam imaging of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) detected by Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the Spiderweb protocluster at z=2.16. We identify 22 DSFGs detected by both ALMA and JWST, 10 of which are spectroscopically confirmed as protocluster members. This is the first systematic analysis of a statistical DSFG sample in z~2 protocluster environments using JWST/NIRCam data. Most of the DSFG members exhibit very red colors and reside in the dusty star-forming region of the rest-frame UVJ diagram, indicating strong dust obscuration. The Gini-M20 diagram suggests that most DSFGs in this protocluster are late-type disks, with a significant fraction displaying clumpy and disturbed rest-frame UV/optical morphologies, but few showing clear merger signatures. The DSFG members exhibit relatively large stellar disks and effective radii with a median stellar mass of log(M/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 10.8 +/- 0.3, placing them above coeval field DSFGs and typical protocluster galaxies in the size-mass relation at both rest-frame optical and near-infrared wavelengths. These sizes are comparable to those of more evolved field DSFGs at z~1-2, indicating accelerated structural growth in dense environments. Moreover, these DSFG members show a decreasing trend in stellar size from shorter to longer wavelengths, with a moderately steep slope comparable to coeval field DSFGs. These results may support an inside-out growth scenario for protocluster evolution, in which massive galaxies near the center are more evolved and more strongly affected by AGN feedback and environmental effects, e.g., ram-pressure stripping. We propose that the cold gas accretion at the protocluster outskirts drives intense star formation and stellar disk growth in ALMA-detected DSFGs, which are expected to evolve into massive elliptical galaxies at later stages.

<p>
The visibility of Lyman-α emission at z&gt;7 provides crucial insights into the reionization process and the role of galaxies in shaping the ionized intergalactic medium. Using JWST FRESCO data, we investigate the environments of Lyman-α emitters (LAEs) in the GOODS-N and GOODS-S fields by identifying [OIII] emitters and analyzing their large-scale distribution. Using the FRESCO redshifts, we recover eight new LAEs from archival Keck/MOSFIRE observations at z=7.0-7.7, including a potential AGN candidate at z ~ 7.2. Complemented by six literature LAEs, our sample consists of 14 LAEs in total, all of which are [OIII] emitters except for one very faint source not detected by FRESCO. We define seven groups of [OIII] emitters centered around the brightest LAEs and find that these bright LAEs do not reside in more overdense environments than the average galaxy population. The overdensity parameters for LAEs and [OIII] emitters without Lyman-α, calculated for sources with M_UV&lt;-19.5 to ensure completeness, are similar, indicating that overdensities alone cannot fully explain Lyman-α visibility. While LAEs have slightly higher recent star formation (SFR_10/SFR_50 ≈ 1.3×) and [OIII] EW (≈1.5×), they show no significant differences from [OIII] emitters in UV slope (β), UV magnitude (M_UV), or stellar mass (log_M<sub>&sext;</sub>). Our results suggest that other factors may contribute to the observability of Lyman-α emission. Future spectroscopic surveys with broader wavelength coverage and more complete sampling will be crucial for refining our understanding of reionization.

<p>
Galactic-scale outflows are a crucial component of galaxy evolution, yet their properties in the early universe remain poorly constrained. We present the first statistical investigation of cool gas outflows in galaxies spanning a wide cosmic timeline from z ≈ 1 to z ≈ 10. Using thousands of public JWST/NIRSpec spectra, we employ a signal-to-noise weighted spectral stacking technique on the \ionMg 2 λ&lambda;2796, 2803 absorption doublet. We robustly detect blueshifted \ionMg 2 absorption in all stellar mass and redshift bins. The outflow equivalent width exhibits a strong, positive correlation with stellar mass (M_*) at all epochs, increasing from ~ 1~Å at M_* ≈ 10^9~M<sub>&odot;</sub> to over 3~Å at M_* &gt; 10^10.5~M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Our work provides the first statistical constraints on cool outflows in the low-mass (M_* ≲ 10^9.5~M<sub>&odot;</sub>), high-redshift (z &gt; 3) regime, vital for constraining feedback in the numerous progenitors of typical present-day galaxies. Crucially, the scaling relation between outflow properties and stellar mass shows no significant evolution at z &gt; 3. This suggests a persistent, unevolving feedback mechanism governing the baryon cycle in the early universe, placing strong constraints on models that invoke a fundamental change in feedback physics at Cosmic Dawn, such as the feedback-free starburst model.

<p>
Rotating galaxies with relaxed gaseous disks have been discovered across cosmic time, from the local Universe to high redshift (z&gt;4). But few such sources have been confirmed at z&gt;4, making them a precious sample to examine what conditions result in such ordered kinematics in an early, more chaotic Universe. One of the best examples of this sample is the galaxy DLA0817g1 (z=4.2603), which shows remarkably clear rotation in ALMA [CII] data. We present recent JWST/NIRSpec IFU data (R~2700) of DLA0817g1, which we combine with archival ALMA [CII] observations to place constraints on its ISM conditions and morpho-kinematics. From a combination of line ratios, we find a high gas-phase metallicity (~0.7 solar), high fraction of obscured star formation, low ionisation (compared to other high-redshift galaxies observed with JWST), and no significant evidence for AGN (based on the WHAN diagnostic). Dynamical modelling with 3DBarolo reveal nearly identical rotation in Halpha and [CII], but with a higher velocity dispersion in the former. Using our metallicity estimate and previous CO and [CII] detections, we derive a new estimate of the molecular gas mass, relieving a previous strain in the mass budget. Altogether, we suggest that this is a 'smouldering' galaxy, where past star formation resulted in significant chemical enrichment (i.e., Zgas and Mdust), but the current activity is low (i.e., lower ionisation parameter and electron temperature). These new observations have opened a window into questions regarding the interplay of gas, metallicity, star formation, and kinematics in a prototypical early disk galaxy.

"Little red dots" (LRDs) represent a new population of astronomical objects uncovered by JWST whose nature remains debated. Although many LRDs are suspected as active galactic nuclei (AGN), they show little variability on days-years timescales. We report the discovery of two gravitationally lensed LRDs at redshift ~4.3 behind the cluster RXCJ2211-0350, one of which (RX1) is quadruply imaged with time delays spanning ~130 years. RX1 exhibits intrinsic color and brightness variations of up to 0.7 magnitude among its images. These changes are consistent with blackbody-temperature variations of a photosphere, indicating long-term variability analogous to Cepheid-like pulsations but in a far more extended (R ~ 2000 AU) and massive (M ≳ 10^6   M<sub>&odot;</sub>) systems. These results suggest LRDs as a distinct class of AGN with stellar-like envelopes.

Determining the physical properties of galaxies during the first billion years after the big bang is key to understanding both early galaxy evolution and how galaxies contributed to the epoch of reionization. We present deep ALMA observations of the redshifted [OIII] 88um line for the gravitationally lensed (μ= 11.4±1.9) galaxy A383-5.1 (z=6.027) that has previously been detected in [CII] 158um. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging identified this sub-L* galaxy as a ''Little Red Dot'' (LRD). With a line luminosity of L_[OIII] = (1.29±0.24)×10^8 L<sub>&odot;</sub> (corrected for lensing magnification) A383-5.1 is one of the faintest galaxies with combined [CII] and [OIII] detections. The ALMA data reveal no dust continuum emission, consistent with previous observations. The high line luminosity ratio of [OIII]/[CII] ~ 14±5 is consistent with A383-5.1 being low-metallicity and dust-poor. The non-detection of dust continuum in bands 6 and 8 is consistent with the high [OIII]/[CII] ratio and suggests a presence of a strong ultraviolet radiation field, which would be less affect by dust attenuation, implying that galaxies of this type could contribute significantly to the ionization of the intergalactic medium. The presence of strong ionizing field could provide an important piece of information for understanding the nature of LRDs and their role in cosmic reionization.

<p>
We present the first spatially resolved investigation of near-infrared coronal lines in dwarf galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN), using JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy. Coronal lines (CLs), which are forbidden transitions from highly ionized species with ionization potentials up to 450 eV, act as sensitive tracers of the AGN ionizing continuum and feedback processes. Across four dwarf galaxies with ionized gas outflows traced by the optical [O III] lines, we report the detection of 16 unique species of near-infrared CLs. Line ratio diagnostics indicate that photoionization from the AGN dominates the excitation of CLs. We find that the coronal line region in dwarf galaxies, traced by the various CLs, extends up to 0.5 kpc, and can constitute up to 10% of their host galaxy size. Correlations between CL luminosities and [O III] ionized gas outflow properties are consistent with a scenario in which AGN-driven outflows likely facilitate the detection of CLs and contribute to their extent. Several CLs, including [Si VI], [Si VII], and [Mg VIII], exhibit a secondary broad component (W_80 &gt; 300 km/s). If we interpret this spatially compact gas as part of an outflow, this would indicate that the outflowing gas includes a wide range of ionizations. The estimated energetics imply this highly ionized component is compact yet powerful enough to perturb gas in the central regions of the host dwarfs. These results indicate that AGN in low-mass galaxies may produce outflows capable of influencing their structure and evolution.

### 58) [2512.04208](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04208v1): A Black-Hole Envelope Interpretation for Cosmological Demographics of Little Red Dots

<p> Hiroya Umeda, Kohei Inayoshi, Yuichi Harikane, Kohta Murase </p>
<p>
Little red dots (LRDs) newly discovered with JWST are active galactic nuclei (AGN) that may represent black hole (BH) growth at the earliest cosmic epochs. These sources show puzzling features unlike typical AGNs, including red optical continua, weak hot-dust emission, and a lack of detectable X-rays. Previously, LRDs have often been interpreted as dust-reddened AGNs, leading to severe inconsistencies with the luminosity and BH mass densities inferred for previously known AGNs over 0&lt;z&lt;5. The BH-envelope (BHE) model has been proposed to explain these characteristics, in which an accreting BH is enshrouded by a dense, optically thick gaseous envelope. In this Letter, we reanalyze the SEDs of ~ 400 photometric LRDs in the COSMOS-Web survey using the BHE model and reassess their implications for cosmological BH evolution. We find that the optical-NIR spectra of LRDs are well reproduced by blackbody emission with an effective temperatures of 4000-6000~\K. Within the BHE framework, the inferred bolometric luminosities decrease by ≳1-2 orders of magnitude compared to dust-reddened AGN assumptions. As a result, the revised luminosity function, BH accretion density, and BH mass function become consistent with those of AGNs at z&lt;5. The stellar masses of LRD hosts are estimated by attributing the UV excesses to star formation. Although the resulting M_BH/M<sub>&sext;</sub> ratio remains higher than the local empirical value, the excess is modest. Overall, the BHE model not only resolves the spectral features of LRDs but also brings their statistical properties into agreement with the broader cosmological BH population.

### 59) [2512.04166](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04166v1): JWST Confirmation of a Runaway Supermassive Black Hole via its Supersonic Bow Shock

<p> Pieter van Dokkum, Connor Jennings, Imad Pasha, Charlie Conroy, Ish Kaul, Roberto Abraham, Shany Danieli, Aaron J. Romanowsky, Grant Tremblay </p>
<p>
We present JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of a candidate runaway supermassive black hole at the tip of a 62 kpc-long linear feature at z=0.96. The JWST data show a sharp kinematic discontinuity at the tip, with a radial velocity change of ≈ 600 km/s across 0.1'' (1 kpc). The velocity gradient, together with the projected post-shock flow velocity of ≈ 300 km/s, is well described by a simple shock-compression model of a supersonic object, with a velocity of v_BH = 954^+110_-126 km/s and an inclination i=29^+6_-3 deg. The previously puzzling kinematics along the linear feature, with the observed radial velocity decreasing from ≈ 300 km/s near the tip to ≈ 100 km/s closer to the former host galaxy, are naturally explained as gradual downstream mixing of shocked gas with the circumgalactic medium through turbulent entrainment. The runaway black hole interpretation is further supported by the morphology of the gas at the tip of the wake and an analysis of the [OIII]/Hα, [NII]/Hα, [SII]/Hα, and [SIII]/[SII] line ratios. The line ratios are consistent with fast radiative shocks and rapid cooling, with best-fit shock velocities that are in good agreement with expectations from the black hole velocity and the shock geometry. Energy conservation over the lifetime of the wake suggests a SMBH mass of M_BH ≳ 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. These results confirm that the wake is powered by a supersonic runaway supermassive black hole, a long-predicted consequence of gravitational-wave recoil or multi-body ejection from galactic nuclei.

### 60) [2512.04163](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04163v1): Galactic bars are already mature at Cosmic Noon: bar strength and flatness at z ~ 1.5

<p> Boris S. Kalita, Luis C. Ho, John D. Silverman, Frédéric Bournaud, Miroslava Dessauges-Zavadsky, Emanuele Daddi, Annagrazia Puglisi, Xuheng Ding, Si-Yue Yu </p>
<p>
In this work, we explore the nature of z&gt;1 galactic bars. Once thought to be highly transient, our results demonstrate otherwise. Our sample consists of nine massive (&gt;10^10.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) star-forming barred-spiral galaxies at z<sub>spec</sub> ~ 1.5. Using rest-frame near-IR (F444W) JWST/NIRCam imaging, we apply ellipse fitting along with 1D and 2D morphological modeling to directly measure bar properties. We find that five galaxies host flat surface brightness profiles (bar Sérsic index &lt;0.4), indicative of highly evolved, "mature" bars. By contrast, only two galaxies show exponential profiles, characteristic of young bars, and these are also shorter in absolute length than the flat bars. We therefore conclude that a large fraction of bars at this epoch have already matured, thereby indicating the presence of well-settled disks required to facilitate bar formation and sustained evolution well before z~1.5. To assess the gravitational impact of the bars, we calculate the maximum transverse-to-radial force ratio (Q_b). We find that Q_b values are comparable to, or weaker than, those of bars in the local Universe, Seven of the nine bars show only a marginal increase in strength with maturity (from exponential to flat bars). Contrarily however, the remaining two bars are flat, but have the lowest Q_b values in our sample. We hence propose that the mature bars at z~ 1.5 may experience phases of weakening due to rapid gas inflows and/or minor mergers. In conclusion, our work sheds light on the rapidly evolving nature of high-z bars and paves the way for larger statistical studies.

### 61) [2512.04060](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04060v1): JWST Captures Growth of Aromatic Hydrocarbon Dust Particles in the Extremely Metal-poor Galaxy Sextans A

<p>
The mid-infrared spectrum of star-forming, high metallicity galaxies is dominated by emission features from aromatic and aliphatic bonds in small carbonaceous dust grains, often referred to as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In metal-poor galaxies, the abundance of PAHs relative to the total dust sharply declines, but the origin of this deficit is unknown. We present JWST observations that detect and resolve emission from PAHs in the 7% Solar metallicity galaxy Sextans A, representing the lowest metallicity detection of PAH emission to date. In contrast to higher metallicity galaxies, the clumps of PAH emission are compact (0.5-1.5'' or 3-10 pc), which explains why PAH emission evaded detection by lower resolution instruments like Spitzer. Ratios between the 3.3, 7.7, and 11.3 μm PAH features indicate that the PAH grains in Sextans A are small and neutral, with no evidence of significant processing from the hard radiation fields within the galaxy. These results favor inhibited grain growth over enhanced destruction as the origin of the low PAH abundance in Sextans A. The compact clumps of PAH emission are likely active sites of in-situ PAH growth within a dense, well-shielded phase of the interstellar medium. Our results show that PAHs can form and survive in extremely metal-poor environments common early in the evolution of the Universe.

### 62) [2512.04043](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04043v1): The Nature of Nitrogen Enhanced High Redshift Galaxies

<p> Peixin Zhu, James Trussler, Lisa J. Kewley </p>
<p>
Recent JWST observations have revealed a population of high-redshift galaxies (z≳5) exhibiting unexpectedly bright ultraviolet (UV) nitrogen emission lines. The strong N III] and N IV] features imply nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratios (N/O) as high as -0.8 ≲ log(N/O) ≲ 0.4 in these low-metallicity galaxies (12+log(O/H) ≲ 8.2), compared to the local value of log(N/O)≈-1.5. If confirmed, this level of nitrogen enrichment challenges existing models of nucleosynthesis and galaxy evolution. However, the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can affect spectral diagnostics, and previous studies often excluded AGN contamination using photoionization models based on local N/O ratios. In this work, we compare nitrogen-enhanced AGN and H II region models to observed spectra of eight high-redshift galaxies to constrain their nitrogen abundance, excitation source, gas-phase metallicity, ionization parameter, and gas pressure, simultaneously. We find seven galaxies (GHZ9, GS 3073, GN-z9p4, CEERS-1019, GHZ2, GN-z11, and GS-z9-0) are best described by nitrogen-enhanced AGN models, while RXCJ2248-ID is best reproduced by the nitrogen-enhanced H II model. The presence of AGN does not significantly impact (≲0.1 dex) the derived N/O ratio. We also find that equivalent width (EW)-based diagrams are the most robust UV diagnostic diagrams to distinguish AGNs and star-forming galaxies for situations where the nitrogen abundance is varying. All nitrogen-enhanced galaxies have moderate to high gas pressure (7.0≤log (P/k)≤9.8) and high ionization parameter (log(U)≳-2.0), indicating a dense and compact environment. We suggest that super star clusters containing Wolf-Rayet stars and massive stars are the most likely contributors to the elevated nitrogen abundance in these galaxies.

### 63) [2512.03456](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03456v1): Improving Accretion Diagnostics for Young Stellar Objects with Mid-infrared Hydrogen lines from JWST/MIRI

<p>
We present a comprehensive study of mid-infrared neutral hydrogen (H~sci) emission lines in 79 nearby (d &lt; 200 pc) young stars using JWST/MIRI. We aim to identify mid-infrared H~sci transitions that can serve as reliable accretion diagnostics in young stars, and evaluate their utility in deriving physical conditions of the accreting gas. We identify and measure 22 H~sci transitions in the MIRI wavelength regime (5-28 μm) and perform LTE slab modelling to remove the Hsubscript2O contribution from selected H~sci transitions. We find that mid-IR H~sci line emission is spatially compact, even for sources with spatially extended [Ne~scii] and [Fe~scii] jets, suggesting minimal contamination from extended jet. Although Pfund~α (H~sci~6&ndash;5) and Humphreys~α (H~sci~7&ndash;6) are the strongest lines, they are blended with H<sub>2</sub>O transitions. This blending necessitates additional processing to remove molecular contamination, thereby limiting their use as accretion diagnostics. Instead, we identify the H~sci~(8&ndash;6) at 7.502 μm and H~sci~(10&ndash;7) at 8.760 μm transitions as better alternatives, as they are largely unaffected by molecular contamination and offer a more reliable means of measuring accretion rates from MIRI spectra. We provide updated empirical relations for converting mid-IR H~sci line luminosities into accretion luminosity for 6 different H~sci lines in the MIRI wavelength range. Moreover, comparison of observed line ratios with theoretical models shows that MIR H~sci lines offer robust constraints on the hydrogen gas density in accretion columns, n_H = 10^10.6 to 10^11.2 cm^-3 in most stars, with some stars exhibiting lower densities (&lt;10^10~cm^-3), approaching the optically thin regime.

### 64) [2512.03331](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03331v1): Radio Detection of a Local Little Red Dot

<p> L. F. Rodriguez, I. F. Mirabel </p>
<p>
Context. One of the most important discoveries by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the unexpected existence in the Early Universe (z &gt; 4) of very large quantities of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs), compact luminous red galaxies of intriguing physical properties. Aims. We wish to know if LRDs may host accreting Intermediate/Supermassive Black Holes (IMBHs/SMBHs) that may power LRDs, and compare them with the effect of clusters of massive stars. The spectrum of radio emission (synchrotron vs thermal) can be used to know which between these two types of energy sources is the dominant one. Methods. So far LRDs at high redshifts have not been detected at radio wavelengths and it is not known why. Assuming this could be due to their large distances and/or present limitations of observational capabilities, we analyze here archive Very Large Array radio observations of two analog candidates of LRDs in the Local Universe (LLRDs) at redshifts z = 0.1 - 0.2. Results. The LLRD source J1047+0739 at z = 0.1682 is detected at 6.0 GHz in 2018 with the VLA-A of NRAO as a compact source with radii less than 0.2 arc sec (&lt; 600 pc at d = 700 Mpc). Its flux density was 117±8 μJy and its spectral index was -0.85, which is typical of optically-thin synchrotron emission. It is also detected at 5.0 GHz in 2010 with the VLA-C, showing a flux density of 43±3 μJy. Conclusions. The observed flux densities can be provided by a radio luminous supernova. The increase in flux density over eight years can be explained as the result of two independent supernovae or as the radio re-brightening of a single one. Radio time monitoring of this and other LLRDs could help clarify the mystery of the radio silence of its cosmological counterparts.

### 65) [2512.03281](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03281v1): A Comprehensive JWST/NIRSpec Census of Broad-Line Active Galactic Nuclei: Faint, Tiny, but Highly Accreting Sources in the Remote Universe

<p> Caroline Baccus, Xinfeng Xu </p>
<p>
We present a sample of 252 broad-line Active Galactic Nuclei (BLAGNs), incorporating 171 newly identified sources, spanning a redshift interval from z = 0.8 to 7.2. We have analyzed spectroscopic data from the NIRSpec instrument aboard the James Webb Space Telescope, using the G140H, G140M, G235H, G235M, G395H, and G395M gratings to survey N ~ 80,000 galaxies for BLAGNs. Through emission-line fitting, using a sum of Gaussian models for Hα, Hβ, [N II] λ&lambda;6548, 6584, and [O III] λ&lambda;4959, 5007, we separate AGN broad-line components from narrow-line emission. We find the detection rate of BLAGNs to be relatively consistent across our redshift range. Compared to typical low-z AGNs (z ≲ 1), the high-z BLAGNs are systematically fainter and less massive, yet they accrete more efficiently, with most showing Eddington ratios between 0.1 and 1.0. This confirms the rapid black hole growth during the early cosmic epochs. The detection of faint, low-mass BLAGNs at high redshift also helps bridge the observational gap between local supermassive black holes and remote luminous quasars, providing a more complete view of black hole-galaxy coevolution across cosmic time.

<p> Josephine F. W. Baggen, Pieter van Dokkum, Ivo Labbé, Gabriel Brammer </p>
<p>
We present a luminous Little Red Dot (LRD) at z=6.027, doubly imaged by the galaxy cluster Abell 383 and observed with JWST/NIRCam. The source shows the characteristic "V-shaped" SED and pronounced Balmer break that define the LRD population. Owing to its large magnifications, μ~11 for image S1 and μ~7 for S2, the system is exceptionally bright and highly stretched, providing a rare, spatially resolved view of an LRD. The images reveal a complex morphology with a compact red dot, a spatially offset blue dot, and faint emission bridging and surrounding the two. After correcting for lensing, we find that both dots are extremely small but resolved, with rest-frame UV sizes of ~ 20 pc (red) and ~60 pc (blue). These compact dots are embedded in a more extended, line-dominated cloud traced most clearly in F356W ([OIII]+Hβ), which reaches scales of order ~1 kpc. SED decomposition shows that the blue component has a flat UV continuum consistent with a young stellar population, whereas the red component has a steep red SED that can be interpreted as either an evolved stellar population with high stellar mass (log M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>&gt;10) or a reddened AGN. If this object is representative of the LRD population, our results imply that the V-shaped SEDs of LRDs do not arise from individual compact sources but instead from the superposition of two physically distinct components. Separated by only ~300 pc in the source plane, these components would blend into a single compact source in unlensed observations with the canonical LRD colors. This system therefore provides a rare opportunity to resolve the internal structure of an LRD and to gain direct insight into the physical nature of this population.

JWST has revealed unexpectedly bright galaxies in the first 500 Myr after the Big Bang. Their overabundance suggests that they are preferentially observed during burst phases, where their star formation rates increase dramatically. In cosmological simulations, such bursts transition into short (≈ 40 Myr) periods without star formation or naps. Using JWST/NIRCam medium-band observations, we report the discovery of the galaxy CANUCS-A370-2228423 (z = 5.95 ± 0.06, log(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 9.14 ± 0.09), dubbed The Sleeper. Its star formation history indicates rapid assembly in the first 300 Myr (z ≳ 14), where it formed a log(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 8.7^+0.3_-0.4 M<sub>&odot;</sub> progenitor, comparable in stellar mass to the few spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at those redshifts. Unexpectedly, this is followed by several hundred million years of suppressed star formation, in stark contrast to nappers. This results in a remarkably strong hydrogen Balmer break, exceeding that of any galaxy observed within the first billion years by a factor of ≈ 3. Furthermore, Sleeper-like systems are overabundant in the observed survey volume compared to theory, as the probability of finding such galaxies in simulations is &lt; 0.2&percnt;. The discovery of The Sleeper therefore disrupts the current narrative that all luminous galaxies in the first few hundred million years grow into massive descendants. Instead it presents an alternative evolutionary pathway in which these unusually luminous galaxies fade into inefficient dwarfs after an early starburst, revealing greater diversity in the first stages of galaxy evolution.

### 68) [2512.03150](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03150v1): Joint JWST-DECam Lensing Reveals That the Bullet Cluster Is a Minor Merger

<p> Boseong Young Cho, M. James Jee, Hyungjin Joo, Sangjun Cha, Kim HyeongHan </p>
<p>
We present the first robust virial masses of the Bullet Cluster's three individual components from a joint weak+strong lensing analysis combining JWST/NIRCam and DECam observations. Despite its status as the benchmark system for dark matter and merger studies, inferred mass ratios for the Bullet Cluster have spanned a wide range from ~2:1 to ≳10:1 over more than two decades. We revisit this tension through three key advances: (1) JWST's exceptional data quality enables us to resolve three distinct halos, (2) DECam's wide-field coverage beyond its virial radius eliminates the need for extrapolation, and (3) high-fidelity strong-lensing priors mitigate weak-lensing model bias. We obtain M_200c = 15.11^+2.48_-2.10 × 10^14M<sub>&odot;</sub> for the main cluster and 1.49^+0.32_-0.25 × 10^14M<sub>&odot;</sub> for the subcluster, yielding a mass ratio of 10.14^+3.22_-2.47, definitively classifying the Bullet Cluster as a minor merger. This result reconciles the long-standing tension in the mass ratio and provides updated initial parameters for future modeling of this iconic system.

### 69) [2512.03129](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03129v1): Taming the Tarantula: How Stellar Wind Feedback Shapes Gas and Dust in 30 Doradus

<p>
Observations of massive star-forming regions show that classical stellar wind models over-predict the luminosity of the X-ray emitting gas, indicating a significant fraction of wind energy is lost. In this paper, we present a multi-wavelength analysis of the giant HII region 30 Doradus and its central star cluster R136 using 2 Ms of Chandra X-ray Observatory data, combined with James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope imaging and Spitzer spectral-energy distributions, to investigate how the hot gas energy is lost through turbulent mixing, radiative cooling, and physical leakage. We compare the spatial and spectral properties of the hot gas with those of the warm ionized gas and dust. We find no significant correlation between the dust and hot gas temperatures, suggesting they are not directly coupled and that the dust resides in the swept-up shells where it is heated radiatively. Hα and X-ray surface brightness profiles show that the X-rays peak interior to the Hα shells, demonstrating partial confinement of the hot gas. The fragmented shell structure and bright X-ray interior that declines near the Hα shell reflect efficient cooling from turbulent mixing at the hot-cold interface. We compare against recent simulations of stellar-feedback driven bubbles which have broad agreement with the morphology of the X-ray and Hα emission, but the simulations produce a dip in the interior X-ray surface brightness and a lack of hard X-rays compared to the observations. These differences may suggest thermal conduction is important as mass-loading of the hot bubble could reproduce the X-ray observables.

### 70) [2512.03130](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03130v1): A Critical Evaluation of the Physical Nature of the Little Red Dots

<p> Kohei Inayoshi, Luis C. Ho </p>
<p>
Little Red Dots (LRDs) are a newly identified class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) uncovered by JWST deep surveys. Their enigmatic properties challenge the canonical AGN paradigm and have stimulated ideas on early massive black hole (BH) formation. In this review, we summarize how early BHs shape the characteristic features of LRDs, how their nuclear environments differ from those of normal AGNs, and how future observations can distinguish between competing scenarios. Our main conclusions are as follows: (1) LRDs show broad-line emission consistent with mass accretion onto BHs with M_BH≃ 10^6-7~M<sub>&odot;</sub>, suggesting that AGN activity is a plausible origin of their dominant red optical emission. (2) Stellar components can reproduce the continuum energetics through dusty star formation. However, the required stellar mass would be too large to remain consistent with other LRD properties. Therefore, a purely stellar origin is unlikely to be the dominant power source, although star formation may still contribute to the UV emission. (3) The coexistence of broad-line emission with Balmer absorption and break features on LRD spectra, neither of which can be explained by stellar populations, suggests that nuclear BHs are enshrouded by dense gas with a high covering fraction. (4) Gas-enshrouded AGNs can produce red optical spectra without requiring dust reddening through a combination of gas attenuation and thermal self-emission with an effective temperature of T_eff≃ 5000~K, which also accounts for the flat infrared continuum. (5) From the spectral features and redshift evolution, LRDs are likely a transient phase in early BH growth, possibly the first accretion episodes of newborn BHs. (6) Testing models for LRD spectra and origins through time variability, ionizing sources, post-LRD objects, and low-redshift analogs is particularly promising.

### 71) [2512.03134](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03134v1): The Mass-Metallicity Relation and its Observational Effects at z~3-6

Whitaker, Christina C. Williams </p>
<p>
The correlation between galaxy stellar mass and gas-phase metallicity, known as the mass-metallicity relation (MZR), gives key insights into the processes that govern galaxy evolution. However, unquantified observational and selection biases can result in systematic errors in attempts to recover the intrinsic MZR, particularly at higher redshifts. We characterize the MZR at z~3-6 within a fully Bayesian framework using JWST NIRSpec spectra of 193 galaxies from the RUBIES survey. We forward model the observed mass-metallicity surface using prospector-generated spectra to account for two selection biases: the survey selection function and success in observing high signal-to-noise emission lines. We demonstrate that the RUBIES selection function, based on F444W magnitude and F150W-F444W color, has a negligible effect on our measured MZR. A correct treatment of the non-Gaussian metallicity uncertainties from strong-line calibrations lowers the derived MZR normalization by 0.2 dex and flattens the slope by ~20%; forward-modeling the effect of emission line observability steepens the slope by ~15%. Both of these biases must be taken into account in order to properly measure the intrinsic MZR. This novel forward modeling process motivates careful consideration of selection functions in future surveys, and paves the way for robust, high-redshift chemical enrichment studies that trace the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation across cosmic time.

### 72) [2512.02629](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02629v1): Silicate emission in a type-2 quasar: JWST/MIRI constraints on torus geometry and radiative feedback

<p>
Type-2 quasars (QSO2s) are AGN seen through a significant amount of dust and gas that obscures the central supermassive black hole and the broad line region. Despite this, recent mid-infrared spectra of the central 0.5-1.1 kpc of five QSO2s at z~0.1, obtained with the MRS module of JWST/MIRI, revealed 9.7, 18, and 23 micron silicate features in emission in two of them. This indicates that the high angular resolution of JWST/MIRI now allows us to peer into their nuclear region, exposing some of the directly illuminated dusty clouds that produce silicate emission. To test this, we fitted the nuclear mid-infrared spectrum of the QSO2 with the strongest silicate features, J1010, with two different sets of torus models implemented in an updated version of the Bayesian tool \tt BayesClumpy. These are the CLUMPY and the CAT3D-WIND models. The CAT3D-WIND model is preferred by the observations based on the marginal likelihood and fit residuals, although the two torus models successfully reproduce the spectrum by means of intermediate covering factors (C_T=0.45±^0.26_0.18 and C_T=0.66±^0.16_0.17 for the CLUMPY and CAT3D-WIND models) and low inclinations (i=50&deg;±^8&deg;_9&deg; and i=13&deg;±^7&deg;_6&deg;). Indeed, four of the five QSO2s with JWST/MIRI observations, including J1010, are in the blowout or ''forbidden'' region of the Eddington ratio-column density diagram, indicating that they are actively clearing gas and dust from their nuclear regions, leading to reduced covering factors. This is in contrast with Seyfert 2 galaxies observed with JWST, which are in the ''permitted'' regions of the diagram and show 9.7 micron silicate features in absorption. This supports a scenario where the more luminous the AGN and the higher their Eddington ratio, the lower the torus covering factor, driven by radiation pressure on dusty gas.

### 73) [2512.02440](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02440v2): Evolution and Mass Dependence of UV-to-near-IR Color Gradients up to z=2.5 from HST+JWST

<p> Marco Martorano, Arjen van der Wel, Andrea Gebek, Maarten Baes, Eric F. Bell, Gabriel Brammer, Sharon E. Meidt, Angelos Nersesian, Katherine Whitaker, Stijn Wuyts </p>
<p>
We present the redshift evolution of radial color gradients (in rest-frame itU - itV and itV - itJ) for galaxies in the range 0.5&lt; z &lt;2.5 and investigate their origin and dependence on stellar mass. We select ~ 10,200 galaxies with stellar masses M<sub>&sext;</sub>&gt;10^9.5~M<sub>&odot;</sub> from publicly available JWST/NIRCam-selected catalogs. Using 2D Sérsic profile fits to account for PSF broadening, we perform spatially resolved SED fitting on HST and JWST/NIRCam photometry retrieving accurate rest-frame itU - itV and itV - itJ color gradients within 2R_e, F444W. Star-forming galaxies generally exhibit negative itV - itJ color gradients that are strongly mass and redshift dependent. For massive star-forming galaxies (M<sub>&sext;</sub>&gt;10^10.5~M<sub>&odot;</sub>) at z&gt;1.5 itV - itJ colors are ≈ 0.5 mag redder within the effective radius than outside, on average. We find that, at all redshifts and across the entire stellar mass range, itV - itJ gradients strongly correlate with global attenuation (A_V), suggesting that they predominantly trace dust attenuation gradients. Edge-on galaxies are redder and have stronger gradients at all z, although the correlation weakens at higher z. The itU - itV and itV - itJ color gradients in the quiescent galaxy population, in contrast, are weakly negative (from ≈ -0.1 to ≈- 0.2 mag), though significant, and show little or no dependence on stellar mass, redshift or axis ratio. The implication is that quiescent galaxies must be largely transparent, with low A_V, and color gradients mostly attributable to stellar population gradients.

A complete overview of the stellar, gas and dust contents of galaxies is key to understanding their assembly at early times. However, an estimation of molecular and atomic gas reservoirs at high redshift relies on various indirect tracers, while robust dust mass measurements require multi-band far-infrared continuum observations. We take census of the full baryonic content of the main-sequence star-forming galaxy HZ10 at z=5.65, a unique case study where all necessary tracers are available. We present new ALMA Band 10 (λ_rest=50μm) and Band 4 (300μm) observations towards HZ10, which combined with previously taken ALMA Band 6 through 9 data (70-200μm) constrains its dust properties. We complete the baryonic picture using archival high-resolution [CII] observations that provide both a dynamical mass and molecular and atomic gas mass estimates, a JVLA CO(2-1)-based molecular gas mass, and JWST metallicity and stellar mass measurements. We detect continuum emission from HZ10 in Bands 10 and 4 at the 3.4-4.0σ level, and measure a dust temperature of T_dust = 37_-5^+6K and dust mass log(M_dust/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 8.0 ± 0.1. Leveraging the dynamical constraints, we infer its total gas budget, and find that commonly used [CII]-to-H<sub>2</sub> and [CII]-to-HI conversions overpredict the gas mass relative to the dynamical mass. For this reason, we derive a [CII]-to-total ISM mass (atomic + molecular) conversion factor, which for HZ10 corresponds to α_[CII]^ISM = 39^+50_-25M<sub>&odot;</sub> L<sub>&odot;</sub>^-1. We also find that HZ10 falls below the local scaling relation between dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity, suggesting inefficient ISM dust growth. These results demonstrate a powerful synergy between ALMA and JWST in disentangling the baryonic components of early galaxies, paving the way for future studies of larger samples.

<p> Owen Jessop, Adrian Jenkins, Andrew Pontzen, Joop Schaye, Matthieu Schaller, John C. Helly </p>
<p>
We use the FLAMINGO galaxy formation model to quantify the impact of baryon-CDM isocurvature perturbations on galaxy formation in ΛCDM. In linear theory, these perturbations represent local, compensated variations in the ratio between the baryon and CDM densities; they freeze in amplitude at late times, with an RMS amplitude of 1.5&percnt; on the Lagrangian scale of a 10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub> halo (0.85  Mpc). Although such perturbations arise naturally within ΛCDM, most cosmological simulations and semi-analytic models to date omit them. These perturbations are strongly anti-correlated with the matter overdensity field such that halos form with baryon fractions below the cosmic mean, with earlier-collapsing halos exhibiting stronger baryonic suppression. To isolate the galaxy response, we analyse three hydrodynamical simulations with identical initial matter overdensity fields that: i) include isocurvature modes, ii) omit them, or iii) invert their amplitude. At z=8, isocurvature perturbations reduce the mean baryon fraction and star formation rates of resolved halos by 5&percnt; and 12&percnt;, respectively, relative to the null-isocurvature case. These effects are almost independent of halo mass and diminish steadily with time, reaching 0.1&percnt; and 1&percnt; by z=0. We develop a model based on spherical collapse that accurately reproduces the mean baryon fraction suppression. As high-redshift observations become increasingly routine, incorporating isocurvature perturbations into simulations and semi-analytic models will be important for robust predictions of early galaxy and black hole formation in the JWST era.

We report the discovery of a doubly-imaged Little Red Dot (LRD) candidate behind the galaxy cluster Abell 383, which we dub A383-LRD1. Initially classified as a dropout galaxy in HST imaging with several ground-based emission line detections placing it at z<sub>spec</sub>=6.027, new JWST/NIRCam observations taken as part of the cycle 4 VENUS survey now reveal that the source consists of two underlying components: A red point-source with a V-shaped SED consistent with LRD selection criteria, and a nearby (~ 380 pc) compact blue companion which was the main contributor to the previous rest-frame UV detections. Based on lensing symmetry and its SED, the LRD appears to lie at a similar redshift as well. The magnification of the two images of A383-LRD1 is μ_A=16.2±1.2 and μ_B=9.0±0.6, respectively, and the predicted time delay between them is Δt_grav=5.20±0.14 yr (~0.7 yr in the rest-frame). After correcting for the lensing magnification, we derive an absolute magnitude of M_UV,LRD=-16.8± 0.3 for the LRD, and M_UV,BC=-18.2± 0.2 for the blue companion. We perform SED fits to both components, revealing the LRD to be best fitted with a black hole star (BH*) model and a substantial host galaxy, and the blue companion with an extremely young, emission-line dominated star-forming nebula. A383-LRD1 represents the second known multiply-imaged LRD detected to date, following A2744-QSO1, and to our knowledge, the first LRD system with a confirmed detection of [C _II]&lambda;158  μm emission from ALMA observations. Thanks to lensing magnification, this system opens a unique door to study the relation between a LRD, its host galaxy, and its environment, and represents a prime candidate for deep JWST spectroscopy and high-resolution ALMA follow-up observations.

<p>
We present ClumPyLen, a Python-based simulator designed to produce realistic mock observations of strongly lensed, high-redshift, clumpy star-forming galaxies. The tool models galaxy components such as disks, bulges, and spiral arms using Sérsic profiles, and it populates them with stellar clumps whose properties are sampled from physically motivated distributions. ClumPyLen includes the effects of gravitational lensing through user-provided deflection angle maps and simulates realistic observational conditions by accounting for instrumental effects, Point-Spread-Function convolution, sky background, and photon noise. The simulator can support a wide range of filters and instruments; here we focus on HST/ACS, HST/WFC3-IR, and JWST/NIRCam. We demonstrate the capabilities of the code through two examples, including a detailed simulation of the z = 6.145 source Cosmic Archipelago lensed by MACS J0416.1-2403. The simulated images closely match the morphology and limiting magnitudes of real observations. ClumPyLen is designed to explore the detectability of stellar clumps in terms of mass and size, especially in the low-mass regime, and it allows the study of clump blending effects. Thanks to its modular design, the code is highly adaptable to a wide range of scientific goals, including lensing studies, galaxy evolution, and the generation of synthetic datasets for machine learning or forward modeling applications.

<p>
Interstellar objects (ISOs), particularly those with cometary activity, provide unique insight into the primordial physical and chemical conditions present during the formation of the planetary system in which they originated. Observations in the sub-mm regime allow for direct measurements of several parent molecules released from the comet nucleus into the coma. Here we present observations of the third ISO, 3I/ATLAS, with the `Ū`ū heterodyne receiver on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), which targeted emission from HCN(J = 3 - 2) and CO(J = 2 - 1). Our observations, taken between 16 July 2025 and 21 July 2025 (UT), when 3I/ATLAS was at a heliocentric distance between 4.01 and 3.84 au, provide the earliest sub-mm constraints on its activity. We do not detect HCN or CO in these epochs, with 3σ upper-limits on the production rates of Q(HCN) &lt; 1.7 × 10^24 s<sup>-1</sup> at r_h = 4.01 - 3.97 au and Q(CO) &lt; 1.1 × 10^27 s<sup>-1</sup> at r_h = 3.94 - 3.84 au, respectively. We combine this HCN limit with later JCMT observations of HCN to constrain its temporal evolution. Fitting the HCN detections with a Q(HCN) &prop; r_h^-n model and accounting for the upper-limits yields n = 12.7^+6.9_-2.5. This slope is steeper than those of typical Solar System comets, but consistent with the production rate slopes measured for other species in the coma of 3I/ATLAS.

<p>
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a new population of compact objects that show a unique V-shaped spectral energy distribution (SED) in the UV and optical wavelength range. These so-called "little red dots" (LRDs) often exhibit broad Balmer emission lines, indicative of the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). They generally lack detection of X-ray, radio, and mid-IR radiation, which is fundamentally different from typical AGNs. Various models, including super-Eddington-accreting black holes enshrouded in dense and dust-poor gas, have been proposed to explain these features. However, the nature of LRDs remains debated, and their evolutionary fate is unclear. Here we report two unusual LRDs at redshift z = 2.868 and 2.925 that are in a transitional phase towards typical AGNs. Their V-shaped SEDs, compact optical morphology, and broad emission lines satisfy the defining criteria of LRDs. On the other hand, they exhibit intense X-ray, radio, and mid-IR radiation that is much stronger than previously known LRDs. These hybrid properties suggest that the dense gas envelope around their central black holes is dispersing, allowing high-energy photons and radio emission to escape. Meanwhile, a dust torus is forming. This finding provides a direct insight into the nature of LRDs and indicates that at least some LRDs will evolve into AGNs or quasars at later times.

We report the discovery of two broad-line X-ray AGNs cid_414 and cid_947 at z~3 that exhibit prominent He Iλ10830+ Paγ emission and absorption, identified from the JWST Cycle 3 large GO treasury program COSMOS-3D using NIRCam F444W grism spectroscopy. Additional UV/optical line measurements (e.g., Lyα, Si IV, C IV) come from complementary COSMOS-field spectroscopy. Both sources are robustly detected in the mid-infrared, with detections in MIRI F1000W for both AGNs and an additional detection in MIRI F2100W for cid_414, indicating the presence of hot dust emission. The source cid_947 shows a higher He Iλ10830 absorption column density and X-ray-inferred N_H, and displays strong outflow signatures in He I, Si IV, and C IV with velocity offsets exceeding 5000 km/s. The source cid_414 shows a narrow Lyα emission line with luminosity log L_Lyα=42.49±0.01~erg~s<sup>-1</sup> and a higher intrinsic 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity. Host-galaxy decomposition and multi-component SED fitting indicate that cid_947 hosts a more massive black hole but lower star formation rate than cid_414. From simplified photoionization modeling, we infer that the dense absorbing gas has a characteristic size comparable to the nuclear broad-line region and is likely kinematically coupled to the obscuration associated with the dust torus. He Iλ1083 absorption has also been identified in several compact little red dots at similar redshifts. Together with the two AGNs reported here, these findings suggest that dense circumnuclear gas are plausibly prevalent at high redshift and plays an important role in regulating AGN obscuration and black hole&ndash;host co-evolution.

We present NIRSpec/IFS observations of a rest-frame UV-bright, massive (M_* ~ 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, z_AB=20.5) galaxy highly magnified by gravitational-lensing observed just after the end of the epoch of reionization (z=5.04, \barμ~90). With JWST accessing the restframe UV and optical spectrum of this galaxy with high fidelity, we classify this UV-bright galaxy as post-starburst in nature &ndash; due to weak/absent emission lines and strong absorption features &ndash; making this an example of a new class of UV-bright but significantly quenched galaxies being discovered in this epoch. With a median E(B-V)=0.44±0.14, we identify the presence of stellar absorption across the arc both in Balmer lines and the MgII doublet, indicative of older stellar populations dominated by A stars (and potentially B stars). Using spatially-resolved maps of rest-optical strong emission lines, we find a heterogeneous distribution of nebular metallicities across the arc, potentially hinting at different enrichment processes. With a low median lensing-corrected Hα star formation rate of SFR_Hα = 0.024 ± 0.001 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1, we find in the most "star-forming" clumps indications of lower ionization (log_10U ~ -3.2), lower nebular metallicities (12+log_10O/H ≲ 8.3), and hints of higher densities that suggest a possible recent infall of more pristine (low metallicity) gas onto the galaxy. Investigating the regions with no detectable Hβ emission, we find (for the first time at z&gt;5) signatures of diffuse ionized gas (DIG). Separating DIG from HII regions within a galaxy has predominantly been demonstrated at lower redshifts, where such spatial resolution allows clear separation of such regions &ndash; highlighting the immense power of gravitational lensing to enable studies at the smallest spatial scales at cosmic dawn.

### 82) [2512.01998](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01998v1): Constraining Dark Acoustic Oscillations with the High-Redshift UV Luminosity Function

<p> Jared Barron, David Curtin, Hongwan Liu, Julian Munoz, Sandip Roy </p>
<p>
Dark acoustic oscillations (DAOs) in the matter power spectrum can arise in many different dark sector models, and can imprint on a variety of cosmological observables. In this work we use measurements of the galactic UV luminosity function (UVLF) at high redshifts to constrain the dark acoustic oscillation feature at small scales in a model-agnostic way. We introduce a phenomenological transfer function model for a dark sector with a species undergoing DAOs which can accommodate sub-dominant dark matter abundances, and obtain constraints on its parameters. In order to predict the UVLF, we employ an Extended Press-Schechter formalism which we calibrate using N-body simulations with initial conditions featuring DAOs. Using measurements from the Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, Subaru Telescope, and Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we constrain the wave number of the first DAO peak to be at k ≳ 50 h/Mpc, unless the fraction of dark matter undergoing DAOs is less than 0.07.

<p> Jie Song, Enci Wang, Cheng Jia, Cheqiu Lyu, Yangyao Chen, Jinyang Wang, Fujia Li, Weiyu Ding, Guanwen Fang, Xu Kong </p>
<p>
By combining high-resolution observations from JWST and HST, we have measured the stellar masses, star formation rates (SFRs), and multi-wavelength morphologies of galaxies in the CANDELS fields. Furthermore, based on rest-frame 1 μm morphologies, we have derived spatially resolved stellar mass and SFR surface density (Σ_* and Σ_SFR) profiles for 46,313 galaxies with reliable structural measurements at 0&lt;z&lt;4 and log(M<sub>&ast;</sub> /M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&gt;8, and provide the corresponding catalogue. For star-forming galaxies (SFGs), our results show excellent consistency with previous studies in terms of the star formation main sequence and the size-mass relation, demonstrating the robustness of our stellar mass and SFR measurements. For spatially resolved profiles, we find that at higher redshifts (z&gt;2.5), the median radial profile of Σ_SFR is nearly parallel to but slightly steeper than that of Σ_*. This results in mildly negative gradients in the specific SFR (sSFR) profiles across all stellar mass bins considered. These findings indicate that galaxies at z&gt;2.5 cannot grow in size via only in-situ star formation, challenging the understanding of galaxy size evolution beyond the cosmic noon. In contrast, at z&lt;2.0, the sSFR profiles transition to exhibit more and more positive gradients at lower redshifts, consistent with an inside-out growth scenario where star formation preferentially expands the galactic outskirts.

### 84) [2512.01547](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01547v1): Exploring the ultra-faint dwarf Bootes I using JWST and HST: Metallicity distribution and binaries

<p>
Ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) are among the oldest and most metal-poor stellar systems in the Universe. Their metallicity distribution encodes the fossil record of the earliest star formation, feedback, and chemical enrichment, providing crucial tests of models of the first stars, galaxy assembly, and dark matter halos. However, due to their faint luminosities and the limited number of bright giants, spectroscopic studies of UFDs typically probe only small stellar samples. Here, we present an analysis of multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope observations of the UFD Bootes I. Using deep color-magnitude diagram in the F606W and F322W2 bands, extending from the subgiant branch to the M-dwarfs, and stellar proper motions to identify likely members, we obtained an unprecedentedly clean census of the system. The exquisite quality of the diagram, combined with the sensitivity of M-dwarf colors to metallicity, allowed us to constrain the metallicity distribution in a large stellar sample. As a first step, we derived the binary fraction in Bootes I. This is crucial, since binaries can bias kinematic mass estimates, affect stellar population analyses, and shape the photometric signatures used to infer metallicity. We find that 20±2% of stellar systems in Bootes I are binaries with mass ratios larger than 0.4, corresponding to a total binary fraction of ~30%. This value is comparable to the binary fractions observed in globular clusters of similar stellar mass, suggesting that the presence of dark matter does not significantly affect the binary properties of Bootes I. We then exploited the metallicity sensitivity of M-dwarf colors to derive the metallicity distribution function. We find that most of the stars ~85% have [Fe/H]&lt;-2, and that roughly ~17% have [Fe/H]&lt;-3.

<p>
Our comprehension of the history of star formation at z&gt;3 relies on rest-frame UV observations, yet this selection misses the most dusty and massive sources, yielding an incomplete census at early times. Infrared facilities such as Spitzer and the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed a hidden population at z=3-6 with extreme red colours, named HIEROs (HST-to-IRAC extremely red objects), identified by the criterion H_E-ch2&gt;2.25. Recently, Euclid Early Release Observations (ERO) have made it possible to further study such objects by comparing Euclid data with ancillary Spitzer/IRAC imaging. We investigate a 232 arcmin<sup>2</sup> area in the Perseus field using VIS and NISP photometry, complemented by the four Spitzer channels and ground-based MegaCam bands (u, g, r, Hα, i, z). Applying the colour cut yields 121 HIEROs; after removing globular clusters, brown dwarfs, and unreliable cases through visual inspection of multiband cutouts, we obtain a final sample of 42 robust HIEROs. Photometric redshifts and physical properties are estimated with the SED-fitting code Bagpipes. From the resulting z<sub>phot</sub> and M_* values, we compute the galaxy stellar mass function at 3.5&lt;z&lt;5.5. Even after excluding possible AGN hosts or systems where the stellar mass may be overestimated, the high-mass end remains comparable to previous determinations, suggesting the true abundance could be higher. These results highlight the importance of further study of this obscured population to assess its role in the cosmic star-formation rate density and its consistency with galaxy-formation models, demonstrating Euclid's capability to advance our understanding of dust-hidden star formation across early epochs.

### 86) [2512.00730](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00730v1): Evidence for the Faint-End Suppression in the z = 6 ~ 8 UV Luminosity Function: A Lensing Analysis of Abell 2744

<p> Xuheng Ma </p>
<p>
We determine the z=6-8 ultraviolet (UV) LF in the JWST UNCOVER field behind Abell 2744, through a depth-tied completeness model and source-plane selection taking multiple images into account. We compute the intrinsic M_UV LFs and lens-dependent effective volumes V_eff,&ell;(M_UV) for two of them (CATS, GLAFIC), and construct binned LFs with statistical (Gehrels) errors presented separately from the lens-model spread. When fitting each lens model independently with both the original and turnover-extended form (while keeping M^*=-20.5), we obtain decisive model selection in favour of a faint-end turnover. The peak of the turnover posteriors is at α≃ -1, β≃ 1.6, and drive M_T to the high side of our prior (~ -18) and the difference in normalization between CATS-GLAFIC is absorbed into φ^*. A similar magnification-bias test in the image plane gives a B(μ) trend matching to what is expected, which provides an internal consistency of our selection and volumes. Our results indicate an early suppression of the UV LF at z=6-8, and carry implications for the ionizing contribution of ultra-faint systems during reionization.

<p>
A galaxy's metallicity and its relation to stellar mass encode the history of gas accretion, star formation, and outflows within cosmic ecosystems. We present new constraints on the low-mass end of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) at z~2-3 from ultra-deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of seven continuum-faint galaxies in the Chemical Evolution Constrained using Ionized Lines in Interstellar Aurorae (CECILIA) Faint sample (Raptis et al. 2025). Our sample includes Lyα-selected and other low-luminosity star-forming galaxies with stellar masses log(M<sub>&sext;</sub> / M<sub>&odot;</sub>)~7.2-9.7 and moderately faint rest-UV magnitudes (-20.7 ≲ M_UV ≲ -17.3). Gas-phase oxygen abundances, calculated using empirical calibrations of [O III]/Hβ together with [N II]/Hα constraints, span ~0.04-0.5 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>. We measure a steep MZR slope of γ= 0.48 ± 0.11, suggesting a rapid increase in metal retention efficiency with mass, consistent with energy-driven outflows. Comparison with lower- and higher-redshift studies indicates an evolution in normalization from z~0 to z~2, reflecting less metal enrichment in early galaxies. We find no significant evolution in the MZR between z~2 and the Epoch of Reionization, suggesting that our galaxies may serve as useful analogs of reionization-era systems. Expanded samples and direct T_e-based abundance measurements will be crucial to fully trace the build-up of metals in low-mass galaxies during the peak epoch of cosmic star formation and to test the reliability of strong-line calibrations in these galaxies.

### 88) [2511.23164](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23164v1): Bursty star formation, chemical enrichment, and star cluster formation in numerical analogues of GN-z11

<p> Takayuki R. Saitoh, Yutaka Hirai, Michiko S. Fujii, Yuki Isobe </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope reveals anomalous nitrogen enrichment (high N/O ratios) in compact, star-forming galaxies, such as GN-z11 at z~10. The origin of this chemical signature provides an insight into the early star and galaxy formation processes, yet remains unclear. We performed high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of massive galaxies at high redshift (z~10) in rare density peaks, incorporating various chemical evolution channels including stellar winds, core-collapse, Type Ia supernovae, and asymptotic giant branch stars. Our simulations reproduce several key features of high-redshift galaxies: (1) stars form with high efficiencies (&gt;0.1) at the center of rare peak halos, creating very compact galaxies similar to GN-z11; (2) high N/O ratios emerge during the first 10-20 Myr of intense starburst, before being diluted by CCSNe; (3) multiple star clusters form in and around the galaxy with high efficiency (~20&percnt;), some of which exhibit high N/O ratios and sodium-oxygen anti-correlations similar to those observed in local globular clusters. Although our simulations can reproduce the high log(N/O) values (up to -0.61, exceeding the solar value by 0.25 dex), they remain below the observational lower limits of GN-z11, indicating room for improvement through additional chemical evolution channels, such as supermassive stars.

We use the DAWN JWST Archive to construct and characterise a sample of 116 little red dots (LRDs) across 2.3&lt;z&lt;9.3, selecting all sources with v-shaped UV-optical continua from NIRSpec/PRISM spectra and compact morphologies in NIRCam/F444W imaging. We show that LRD continuum spectra are ubiquitously well described by modified blackbodies across ~0.4-1.0μm, with typical T~5000K or λ_peak~0.65μm across 2 dex in luminosity, and a tail toward T~2000K. LRDs therefore trace a locus in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram that is directly analogous to stars on the Hayashi track, strongly supporting the picture that LRDs are AGN embedded in thermalised dense gas envelopes in approximate hydrostatic equilibrium. Hotter LRDs with λ_peak&lt;0.65μm typically have strong Balmer breaks, redder UV slopes and high optical luminosities; other LRDs show weak or no Balmer breaks, and wide variety in β_UV and L_5100. Crucially, we demonstrate that the UV-optical continuum shapes and luminosities are strongly linked to the Hα, Hβ, [OIII] and OI line properties. There is a tight linear relation between the Hα and optical continuum luminosities, as well as Hα and OI_8446, indicating that Balmer, OI and optical emission must primarily be powered by the same source. The Balmer decrement increases strongly toward higher L_Hα, L_5100 and Balmer break strength, providing key evidence for luminosity-dependent effects of collisional (de-)excitation and resonant scattering in the gaseous envelopes. In contrast, we show that [OIII] emission likely originates from star-forming host galaxies, and that its strong correlation with Balmer break strength arises naturally from variation in the AGN-to-host ratio. Our work presents an empirical description of the nature and structure of LRDs, defining a new benchmark for ongoing LRD model developments.

### 90) [2511.21618](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21618v1): A Super-Eddington, Lensing-Magnified Quasar at z=5.07 observed with JWST

<p> Katherine Panebianco, Minghao Yue, Anna-Christina Eilers, Xiaohui Fan, Feige Wang, Jinyi Yang, Robert A. Simcoe </p>
<p>
We present JWST/NIRCam F070W and F480M imaging for a quasar at z = 5.07, J0025-0145, which is magnified by a foreground lensing galaxy. Existing Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging does not have sufficient spatial resolution to determine whether the background quasar is multiply imaged. Exploiting the sharp PSF of the F070W band, we confirm that the background quasar can be well-described by a single point spread function (PSF), essentially ruling out the existence of multiple lensed images. We do not detect the quasar host galaxy in either the F070W or the F480M band. Using the HST and JWST photometry, we fit the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of the foreground galaxy. The estimated mass (log(M_* / M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 11.15 ± 0.16) and redshift (z<sub>phot</sub> = 3.62_-0.04^+0.06) of the foreground galaxy are consistent with a single-image lensing model. We estimate the maximum possible magnification of the quasar to be μ_max = 3.2, which implies that the intrinsic Eddington ratio of the quasar is at least λ_Edd^intrinsic &gt; 4.9. Therefore, J0025-0145 has one of the highest Eddington ratios among z&gt;5 supermassive black holes known so far, suggesting the viability of super-Eddington growth for supermassive black holes in the early universe.

<p>
We analyze JWST observations of the central region of the globular cluster ω Centauri (NGC 5139, ω Cen hereafter), around the position of the candidate IMBH inferred by Haberle et al. (2024a) from the motion of fast-moving stars in multi-epoch HST observations. We performed PSF-fitting photometry for sources in NIRCam (F200W and F444W) and MIRI (F770W and F1500W) and constructed UV to IR SEDs for sources within the central region of the cluster by using HST photometry from oMEGACat (Haberle et al. 2024b). None of the SEDs of reliably measured sources within this region resembles the SEDs computed from models of Pesce et al. 2021 for IMBHs accreting from intracluster medium at low rates. Our JWST limits place constraints on combinations of IMBH mass and accretion efficiency, either due to the amount of material available to be accreted, or due to the fraction of accreting matter that actually falls into the IMBH. Our non-detection then does not contradict the mass range of the IMBH inferred from the fast moving stars. We discuss these constraints in the context of the model of Pesce et al. 2021. We find that JWST limits are more restrictive than the existing radio limits for IMBH masses ≲ 20,000 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. It is also possible that the faint IMBH emission is dominated by the light of a nearby star. Tighter limits on accretion onto the candidate IMBH can be placed with deeper observations, a more precise localization of the IMBH, and better measurements of the local intracluster medium density and temperature at the center of the cluster.

Dust production is a fundamental aspect of the baryonic cycle of star formation. It is known that dust is injected into the interstellar medium during early star formation by supernovae and later on by evolved stars. From individual objects, these mechanisms are well understood, but the overall dust production in star clusters at different evolutionary stages is still challenging to quantify. We present 22 massive (&gt; 105M<sub>&odot;</sub>) extra galactic star clusters with ages between 3 and 100 Myr exhibiting a compact dust morphology seen with JWST-MIRI. We only find PAH features associated with one star cluster and nineteen have already cleared themselves from their natal dust. Their main characteristic is a significant enhancement at 10μm, which is likely due to silicate emission and cannot be explained by ionized gas. We discuss several possible explanations including dust production from evolved stars such as red super giants, more exotic star types like yellow hypergiants and luminous blue variable stars. Stochastic dust injection from supernovae or a single supernova in dense gas can also create significant silicate emission. However, for this scenario secondary tracers such as a X-ray signal are expected which we only observe in three star clusters. We find the most luminous 10μm emitter to be the three most massive star clusters (&gt; 106M<sub>&odot;</sub>) which is at least a magnitude stronger than any known stellar sources indicating a rare mechanism that only appears at extreme masses and a short lifetime.

We present ECOology for Galaxies using ALMA archive and Legacy surveys (ECOGAL), an ALMA data mining project. Using the footprints of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we query and uniformly reprocess ALMA data to produce continuum images and two complementary source catalogues: (i) a prior-based catalogue anchored to optical/near-infrared detections, and (ii) a blind catalogue based on significant ALMA detections. Detection thresholds are established through peak SNR statistics and analysis of inverted maps. In this paper, we focus on the ALMA-accessible CANDELS fields (COSMOS, GOODS-S, and UDS), covering ~130,000 optical/NIR-selected galaxies spanning 0.0 &lt; z &lt; 15.0. We identify 1288 detections (622 unique) with optical/NIR counterparts across the two methods, of which 832 detections (395 unique) appear in both. Among the 622 unique sources, 307 have spectroscopic redshifts from 0.12 &lt; z &lt; 6.85. ECOGAL expands the parameter space previously explored by A^3COSMOS and A^3GOODS-S by incorporating the UDS field and integrating publicly available JWST datasets from the DAWN JWST Archive (DJA). We also highlight several science cases enabled by ECOGAL, including the evolution of cosmic gas and dust masses, obscured star formation and optically dark systems. ECOGAL provides science-ready data sets for the community and showcases the power of combining over a decade of accumulated public data with other legacy datasets. The data product is made publicly available and accompanies a post demonstrating the usage of the catalogue on the DJA webpage.

JWST observations have revealed rare galaxies with UV spectra exhibiting intense lines of nitrogen, indicative of super-solar N/O abundances at low metallicity. To better understand these enigmatic objects and provide new constraints on proposed scenarios, we have undertaken a systematic search for galaxies with UV emission lines of nitrogen. Using public JWST NIRSpec data, we have identified 45 N-emitters with robust NIII] or NIV] detections, including 4 previously known objects. We find N-emitters from redshift z~ 3-11 among a broad diversity of galaxies, in terms of morphology, UV magnitude, stellar mass, SFR, metallicity, and rest-optical line strengths. The UV nitrogen lines show typical equivalent widths between ~ 5-50 Å. Carbon lines are generally fainter than the N lines. Using strong line calibrations established at high-redshift, we find metallicities 12+log(O/H)~ 7.15-8.5, including thus also high metallicities. The Hβ equivalent width of N-emitters varies strongly, and sources with low EWs show clear signs of a Balmer break, indicative of composite stellar populations combining both young (&lt; 10 Myr) stars responsible of the UV emission lines and an older population contributing to the rest-optical spectrum. Supersolar N/O ratios are found in all N-emitters. C/O abundances are comparable to those of galaxies at the same metallicity, and all N-emitters show high N/C ratios or lower limits (log(N/C) &gt; 0.5), independently of metallicity. The observed abundance ratios are compatible with ejecta from H-burning and do not show signs of Carbon enhancements, even at higher metallicities. Finally, we find that the fraction of N-emitters increases with redshift, and we quantify this evolution. Our study increases the sample of known N-emitters by a factor ~ 3, reveals a diversity of properties among N-emitters, and provides new constraints on their nature.

### 95) [2511.20414](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20414v1): Black Hole merger rates in the first billion years in light of JWST data

<p>
Context. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discoveries have unveiled an abundance of faint and massive Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) at high redshifts (z=4-9), that surpass by 10 to 100 times the extrapolated bolometric (Bol) and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions (LF) from previous AGN campaigns. The two main models that are put forward to explain these observations correspond to light seeds (150 Msol) accreting in episodes of super Eddington, and heavy seeds (10^3 - 10^5 Msol) growing at the Eddington limit. Future gravitational observatories like the Laser Interferometer Satellite Antenna (LISA) will help disentangle these models by reporting the BH-BH merger events from mid to high redshifts. Aims. This work aims to report the predicted merger rates in the heavy seed scenario in light of recent JWST data. In our models we explore (i) instantaneous merging between BHs, (ii) delayed merging after a dynamical timescale, as well as extreme spin configurations (a=0.99, a=-0.99) to bracket BH mass growth. Methods. We use Delphi, a semi-analytical model that tracks baryonic physics over a hierarchical evolution of dark matter halos through cosmic time within the first billion years of the Universe. We calibrate this model for it to simultaneously reproduce galaxy and JWST-AGNs observables. Results. We show reasonable agreement with the Bolometric Luminosity function at z=6, where BHs must accrete 10-100 times more gas than in previous works calibrated to pre-JWST data. However, we underpredict (overpredict) the bright end 10^45.5 erg s<sup>-1</sup> (all luminosity range) at z=7 (z=5) by 1-3.2 dex (0.22-1.6 dex). Regarding BH-BH merger events, the instantaneous (delayed) models predict a total of 28.06 (19.61) yr^-1 for BHs at z≥5, which is within the range of merger rates reported in previous literature.

<p> Christos G. Tsagas </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope has recently detected massive, fully formed, galaxies at redshifts corresponding to few hundred million years after the Big-Bang. However, our current cosmological model cannot produce such massive systems so early in the lifetime of the universe. A number of theoretical solutions have been proposed, but they all appeal to exotic new physics and introduce rather excessive fine-tuning. In this essay, we outline a theoretical answer to the early galaxy-formation question, which operates within standard general relativity and standard cosmology, without appealing to any new physics. Instead, we account for the effect of a well established feature of our universe. This feature, which has so far been kept in the margins of mainstream cosmology, are the peculiar velocities.

We present the mass-metallicity relation for star-forming galaxies in the MUSE Quasar Nebula 01 (MQN01) field, a massive cosmic web node at z ~ 3.245, hosting one of the largest overdensities of galaxies and AGNs found so far at z &gt; 3. Through James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) spectra and images from JWST and Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we identify a sample of 9 star-forming galaxies in the MQN01 field with detection of nebular emission lines (Hβ, [OIII], Hα, [NII]), covering the mass range of 10^7.5M<sub>&odot;</sub> - 10^10.5M<sub>&odot;</sub>. We present the relations of the emission-line flux ratios versus stellar mass for the sample and derive the gas-phase metallicity based on the strong line diagnostics of [OIII]&lambda;5008/Hβ and [NII]&lambda;6585/Hα. Compared to the typical, field galaxies at similar redshifts, MQN01 galaxies show relatively higher [NII]&lambda;6585/Hα and lower [OIII]&lambda;5008/Hβ at the same stellar mass, which implies a higher metallicity by about 0.25± 0.07 dex with respect to the field mass-metallicity relation. These differences are decreased considering the "Fundamental Metallicity Relation'', i.e. if the galaxies' Star Formation Rates (SFR) are also taken into account. We argue that these results are consistent with a scenario in which galaxies in overdense regions assemble their stellar mass more efficiently (or, equivalently, start forming at earlier epochs) compared to field galaxies at similar redshifts.

<p>
JWST has revealed an abundance of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) at high redshifts (z &gt; 3), pushing the limits of black hole (BH) science in the early Universe. Results have claimed that these BHs are significantly more massive than expected from the BH mass-host galaxy stellar mass relation derived from the local Universe. We present a comprehensive census of the BH populations in the early Universe through a detailed stacking analysis of galaxy populations, binned by luminosity and redshift, using JWST spectroscopy from the CEERS, JADES, RUBIES, and GLASS extragalactic deep field surveys. Broad Hα detections in 31&percnt; of the stacked spectra (5/16 bins) imply median BH masses of 10^5.21 - 10^6.13~ M<sub>&odot;</sub> and the stacked SEDs of these bins indicate median stellar masses of 10^7.84 - 10^8.56 ~M<sub>&odot;</sub>. This suggests that the median galaxy hosts a BH that is at most a factor of 10 times over-massive compared to its host galaxy and lies closer to the locally derived M_BH-M_* relation. We investigate the seeding properties of the inferred BHs and find that they can be well-explained by a light stellar remnant seed undergoing moderate Eddington accretion. Our results indicate that individual detections of AGN are more likely to sample the upper envelope of the M_BH-M_* distribution, while stacking on "normal" galaxies and searching for AGN signatures can overcome the selection bias of individual detections.

<p> Ankita Bera, Sultan Hassan, Robert Feldmann, Romeel Davé, Kristian Finlator </p>
<p>
The elevated UV luminosity functions (UVLF) from recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have challenged the viability of existing theoretical models. To address this, we use a semi-analytical framework &ndash; which couples a physically motivated source model derived from radiative-transfer hydrodynamic simulations of reionization with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler &ndash; to perform a joint calibration to JWST galaxy surveys (UVLF, φ_UV and UV luminosity density, ρ_UV) and reionization-era observables (ionizing emissivity, N&#775;<sub>ion</sub>, neutral hydrogen fraction, x_HI, and Thomson optical depth, τ). We find that models with weak feedback and a higher contribution from faint galaxies reproduce the reionization observables but struggle to match the elevated JWST UVLF at z &gt; 9. In contrast, models with stronger feedback (i.e., rapid redshift evolution) and a higher contribution from bright galaxies successfully reproduce JWST UVLF at z ≥ 10, but over-estimate the bright end at z &lt; 9. The strong-feedback model constrained by JWST UVLF predicts a more gradual and extended reionization history, as opposed to the sudden reionization seen in the weak-feedback models. This extended nature of reionization (z~ 16 - 6) yields an optical depth consistent (at 2-σ) with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) constraint, thereby alleviating the photon-budget crisis. In both scenarios, reionization is complete by z ~ 6, consistent with current data. Our analysis highlights the importance of accurately modeling feedback and ionizing emissivities from different source populations during the first billion years after the Big Bang.

<p>
Binaries that host a carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet (WC) star and an OB-type companion can be copious dust producers. Yet the properties of dust, particularly the grain size distribution, in these systems remain uncertain. We present Band 6 observations of WR 112 by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array telescope (ALMA), which are the first millimeter observations of a WC binary system capable of resolving its dust emission. By combining ALMA observations with James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) images, we were able to analyze the spatially resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) of WR 112. We found that the SEDs are consistent with emissions from hydrogen-poor amorphous carbon grains. Notably, our results also suggest that the majority of grains in the system have radii below one micrometer, and the extended dust structures are dominated by nanometer-sized grains. Among four parameterizations of the grain radius distribution that we tested, a bimodal distribution, with abundant nanometer-sized grains and a secondary population of 0.1-micron grains, best reproduces the observed SED. This bimodal distribution helps to reconcile the previously conflicting grain size estimates reported for WR 112 and for other WC systems. We hypothesize that dust destruction mechanisms such as radiative torque disruption and radiative-driven sublimation are responsible for driving the system to the bimodal grain size distribution.

<p> Ruwen Zhou, Liang Dai, Lingyuan Ji, Massimo Pascale, Jose M. Diego, Fengwu Sun, Yoshinobu Fudamoto </p>
<p>
Proximity of lensing critical curves features highly magnified portions of lensed galaxies. Accurate knowledge of the location and shape of the critical curve will be useful for understanding the nature of highly magnified stellar sources near critical curves and for revealing sub-galactic dark matter structures within the lens. In galaxy-cluster lenses, however, prediction of critical curves can be uncertain due to complexity in global mass modeling. We explore and validate a kinematics-based method for locating the critical curve. This method leverages the continuous line-of-sight velocity profile of the lensed galaxy mapped through integral field spectroscopy of emission lines, and combines an agnostic local lens model and a disk rotation model. Applying our method to a highly magnified region of the Dragon Arc in the Abell 370 cluster lensing field using archival VLT/MUSE IFU mapping of the Hβ line, we constrain the critical curve to an uncertainty band with a half-width of 0.23" (1σ). This result reveals locations of recently detected extremely magnified stars biased toward the negative-parity side of the critical curve, as predicted for intracluster microlensing. With future JWST/NIRSpec IFU mapping of the Hα line at SNR ≃ 10 (20), uncertainty could improve to 0.12" (0.08"). A measurement of this type with sufficiently small uncertainty may reveal small-scale wiggles in the shape of the critical curve, which can arise from the lensing perturbation of sub-galactic dark matter substructure. Our approach is generally applicable to caustic-crossing giant arcs and can be incorporated into global lens modeling.

Low surface brightness galaxies (LSBs) are an important class of galaxies that allow us to broaden our understanding of galaxy formation and test various cosmological models. We present a survey of low surface brightness galaxies at 0.4 &lt; z<sub>phot</sub> &lt; 0.8 in the GOODS-S field using JADES data. We model LSB surface brightness profiles, identifying those with \barμ_eff &gt; 24 mag arcsec^-2 in the F200W JWST/NIRCam filter. We study the spatial distribution, number density, Sérsic profile parameters, and rest-frame colours of these LSBs. We compare the photometrically-derived star formation histories, mass-weighted ages, and dust attenuations of these galaxies with a high surface brightness (HSB) sample at similar redshift and a lower redshift (z<sub>phot</sub> &lt; 0.4) LSB sample, all of which have stellar masses ≲ 10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. We find that both the high and the low redshift LSB samples have low star formation (SFR_100 ≲ 0.01 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1) compared with the HSB sample (SFR_100 ≳ 0.01 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1). The star formation histories show that the LSBs and HSBs possibly come from the same progenitors at z ≳ 2, though the histories are not well constrained for the LSB samples. The LSBs appear to have minimal dust, with most of our LSB samples showing A_V &lt; 1 mag. JWST has pushed our understanding of LSBs beyond the local Universe.

<p>
We analyze the H2 emission observed in the HH46 Class I system as part of PROJECT-J (Protostellar Jets Cradle Tested with JWST), to investigate the origin and excitation of the warm molecular outflow. We used NIRSpec and MIRI spectral maps (1.6-27.9 microns) to trace the structure and physical conditions of the outflow. By fitting the H2 rotational diagrams with a multi-temperature gas model, we derived key physical parameters including temperature, extinction, column densities, and the ortho-to-para ratio. This information is combined with a detailed kinematical analysis and comparison with irradiated shock models. We find no evidence of H2 temperature or velocity stratification from the axis to the edge of the outflow, as would be expected in MHD disk-wind models and as observed in other outflows. Instead, the observations suggest that the H2 emission arises from shock interactions between jet bow shocks and/or wide-angle winds with the ambient medium and cavity walls. NIRSpec emission and velocity maps reveal expanding molecular shells, likely driven by the less luminous source in the binary system. We infer an accretion rate of less than 10^-9 solar masses per year for the secondary source, approximately one order of magnitude lower than that of the primary. The H2 emission is consistent with excitation by low-velocity (approximately 10 km/s) J-type shocks, irradiated by an external UV field that may originate from strong dissociative shocks driven by the atomic jet. Future JWST observations will further constrain the evolution of the expanding shell and the mechanisms driving the outflow.

<p> Natalie A. Webb, Vincent Foustoul, Robbie Webbe, Matteo Bachetti, Erwan Quintin, Laurent Michel </p>
<p>
The regions around massive black holes can show X-ray variability on timescales from seconds to decades. Observing many black holes over different timescales can enhance our chances of detecting variability coming from (partial) tidal disruption events, massive black hole binaries, changing state AGN, blazar activity and much more. X-ray catalogues with hundreds of thousands of detections are treasure troves of such sources, which require innovative methods to identify these black holes. We present the current XMM-Newton catalogues available and describe several examples of tidal disruption events (TDEs) and quasi-periodic eruption sources that have been found whilst mining this data. We describe preliminary work on a search for periodic variables in the XMM-Newton EPIC archival data, with the example of finding new massive black hole binaries. We also describe the STONKS pipeline that is now in the XMM-Newton automatic reduction pipeline and the near real-time alert system that allows the follow-up of new and fading transients. We provide examples of fading sources that are newly identified candidate TDEs.

<p> Beryl Hovis-Afflerbach, Allison L. Strom, Alberto Saldana-Lopez, Sophia R. Flury </p>
<p>
Our understanding of massive stars remains incomplete. Many high-z galaxies and nearby analogs exhibit strong He II emission, indicating an abundance of photons with energies &gt;54.4 eV that standard single-star population models cannot explain. Recent studies show that binary evolution and non-solar abundance patterns are required to explain the distinct spectra of high-z galaxies observed by JWST. However, treatments of these properties vary drastically between models. We present the first results from a comparison of models with different treatments of binaries, including BPASS and novel stripped star models, with rest-UV-optical spectra of high-z galaxies' local analogs. This type of investigation can provide insights into which aspects of binary evolution are important to reproduce observations and identify priorities in ongoing efforts to improve models. By constraining the properties of massive stars at high redshift, we can learn about the processes at play in high-z galaxies and massive star evolution more broadly.

### 106) [2511.16256](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16256v1): Accelerating Reionization Constraints: An ANN-Emulator Framework for the SCRIPT Semi-numerical Model

<p> Saptarshi Sarkar, Tirthankar Roy Choudhury </p>
<p>
Constraining the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) with physically motivated simulations is hampered by the high cost of conventional parameter inference. We present an efficient emulator-based framework that dramatically reduces this bottleneck for the photon-conserving semi-numerical code SCRIPT. Our approach combines (i) a reliable coarse-resolution MCMC to locate the high-likelihood region (exploiting the large-scale convergence of SCRIPT) with (ii) an adaptive, targeted sampling strategy to build a compact high-resolution training set for an artificial neural network based emulator of the model likelihood. With only ≈ 10^3 high-resolution simulations, the trained emulators achieve excellent predictive accuracy (R^2 ≈ 0.97&ndash;0.99) and, when embedded within an MCMC framework, reproduce posterior distributions from full high-resolution runs. Compared to conventional MCMC, our pipeline reduces the number of expensive simulations by a factor of ~ 100 and lowers total CPU cost by up to a factor of ~ 70, while retaining statistical fidelity. This computational speedup makes inference in much higher-dimensional models tractable (e.g., those needed to incorporate JWST and upcoming 21 cm datasets) and provides a general strategy for building efficient emulators for next generation of EoR constraints.

### 107) [2511.16119](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16119v1): Chemical evolution of bulges of active galactic nuclei in the early Universe: roles of accreting stars

<p> Shuo Zhai, Jian-Min Wang, Yan-Rong Li, Wei-Jian Guo, Gang Zhao </p>
<p>
JWST/NIRCam observations reveal dense stellar cores in high-redshift galactic bulges, indicative of sustained star formation and potential stellar accretion. We introduce accretion-modified star (AMS) as a new component in the chemical evolution of high-redshift bulges hosting active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The gas-phase chemical evolution of bulge environments containing AMS is modeled within 1 Gyr by combining population evolution and galactic chemical evolution formalisms, and observational signatures are tracked via photoionization modeling on Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagrams. Sustained high accretion onto AMSs leads to rapid gas-phase metal enrichment of the bulge, producing abundance peaks up to five times solar metallicity within 0.1 Gyr and significantly modifying elemental ratios in the gas phase. Atypical gas-phase abundance patterns during early, high-accretion phases and gradually diminish as the accretion rate declines. In BPT diagrams, high-AMS-accretion scenarios shift the modeled emission-line sequence toward the local AGN branch and extend into the high-metallicity regime. Super-solar narrow-line regions observed in AGNs at z&gt;15 may reflect such AMS-driven gas-phase enrichment of host bulge under extreme gas densities. While direct detection of AMSs within AGN bulges remains challenging, the model provides testable predictions for future spectroscopic surveys and motivates further exploration of non-canonical stellar populations in AGN host bulges.

<p>
We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec observations of the starless dark cloud Barnard 68 that reveal the spatially-resolved signature of cosmic-ray excited molecular hydrogen (CRXH<sub>2</sub>) emissions for the first time. Following up on our initial detection of CRXH<sub>2</sub> emissions from B68 (Bialy et al. 2025), we now exploit JWST's sensitivity and spatial multiplexing to map CRXH<sub>2</sub> rovibrational lines across 16 sight lines through the cloud. By disentangling the CRXH<sub>2</sub> and UV-pumped H<sub>2</sub> components, we isolate the para-H<sub>2</sub>-dominated spectrum attributable to cosmic-ray excitation. We find that there are significant spatial variations in the ratio of the CRXH<sub>2</sub> line intensity to the line-of-sight H<sub>2</sub> column density; these cannot be accounted for by dust extinction alone and demonstrate a clear attenuation of the cosmic-ray flux with increasing shielding column. Modeling B68 as a Bonnor-Ebert sphere, we constrain both the unshielded cosmic-ray ionization rate, ζ_H<sub>2</sub>, and how it decreases with shielding column. At a reference depth of N(H<sub>2</sub>) = 3 × 10^21 cm<sup>2</sup>, we infer ζ_H<sub>2</sub> ≈ 1.4 × 10^-16 s<sup>-1</sup>, a factor of ≈ 3 higher than the average value derived from H_3^+ absorption studies. These results provide the most direct probe to date of cosmic-ray penetration into cold, dense gas, offering new constraints on both the microphysics of CR-H<sub>2</sub> interactions and the attenuation of low-energy cosmic rays in molecular clouds. Our findings establish CRXH<sub>2</sub> emission as a powerful new diagnostic of the cosmic-ray environment in interstellar space.

<p> Fabio Fontanot, Roberto Decarli, Gabriella De Lucia, Olga Cucciati, Lizhi Xie, Michaela Hirschmann </p>
<p>
We discuss the properties of a sample of z&gt;6 bright (bolometric luminosity L_bolo&gt;10^46.25 erg/s) Quasars drawn from a realization of the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) model coupled with the Planck Millennium Simulation. We focus on the properties and environment of host galaxies, and their evolution down to z=0, with the aim of assessing how well the bright high redshift QSOs population traces the progenitors of most massive haloes in the local Universe. Our results show that at z&gt;6 bright QSOs live in a variety of environments, and that secular processes like disc instability are responsible for triggering roughly the same number of QSOs as galaxy mergers. Half of cubic (7.5 h^-1 cMpc size) mock fields built around these high-z QSOs include other active galaxies (with L_bolo&gt;10^44 erg/s) in sizeable number, the other host galaxies being relatively isolated. The large field-to-field variance in the the number of companions (both active and non-active) recently reported from JWST observations is fairly well reproduced by GAEA predictions. Descendants of host galaxies at z=0 cover a wide range of physical properties and environments with only a small fraction of the hosts of high-z QSOs ending up in massive galaxy clusters. Viceversa, GAEA predicts that only a small fraction of Bright Central Galaxies have a bright z&gt;6 QSOs among their progenitors. Our results suggest that luminous high-z QSO loosely trace the progenitors of low-z galaxy clusters, and that additional information about the environment of high-z QSOs are required to identify the most promising proto-cluster candidates.

[abridged] The previously inaccessible star formation tracer Paα can now be spatially resolved by JWST NIRCam slitless spectroscopy in distant galaxies up to cosmic noon. In the first study of its kind, we combine JWST NGDEEP NIRISS and FRESCO NIRCam slitless spectroscopy to provide the first direct comparison of spatially resolved dust-obscured (traced by Paα) versus unobscured (traced by Hα) star formation across the main sequence. We stack Paα and Hα emission-line maps, along with stellar continuum images at both wavelengths of 31 galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;1.8 in three bins of stellar mass. Surface brightness profiles are measured and equivalent width (EW) profiles computed. Increasing Paα and Hα EW profiles with galactocentric radius across all stellar masses probed provide direct evidence for the inside-out growth of galaxies both via dust-obscured and unobscured star formation for the first time. For galaxies on the main sequence, a weakly positive (0.1±0.1) Paα/Hα line profile as a function of radius is found at 8.8≤log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;9.9 with a negative (-0.4±0.1) Paα/Hα line profile found at 9.9≤log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;11.0. Low mass galaxies (7.7≤log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;8.8) with high sSFRs are found to have a negative (-0.5±0.1) Paα/Hα line profile gradient. Our results demonstrate that while inside-out growth via star formation is ubiquitous across the main sequence just after cosmic noon, centrally concentrated dust attenuation is not. Along with other recent work in the literature, our findings motivate future studies of resolved SFR profiles in large samples of individual cosmic noon galaxies across the main sequence, to understand the intrinsic scatter in spatially resolved star formation.

<p> Nikolaos Samaras </p>
<p>
Milgromian Dynamics (MOND) has been particularly successful in predicting scaling relations for galactic systems, namely the baryonic Tully-Fisher for spirals, the Faber-Jackson for ellipticals and the Radial Acceleration Relation for late-type galaxies. Its essential tenet is the modification of the gravity law at low accelerations. Nevertheless, despite MOND's passed tests, the puzzle of the missing mass on galaxy clusters' scales still persists. One proposed scenario to complete this deficit and apply it further to cosmology is the so-called νHDM model. It is composed of a sterile neutrino and the MOND gravity. In this Ph.D. thesis, I have put forward this cosmological idea, conducting hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the νHDM structure formation. In the debut attempt, the νHDM model was proven capable of reproducing the ΛCDM cosmology, imitating the same expansion history (Ω_m ≈ 0.3 and H_0 ≈ 67.6 km/s/Mpc), reproducing the CMB phenomenology, while the cosmic web is nicely formed. In the next step, I have optimized the νHDM model using Bayesian statistics, re-branding it to opt-νHDM. I managed to optimally fit the angular power spectrum of the CMB calculated by itPlanck, except its fourth peak, but the opt-νHDM cosmological parameters changed significantly with respect to its precursor, resulting in a much heavier cosmos, with Ω_m ≈ 0.5 and H_0 ≈ 55.6 km/s/Mpc. Next, I explore the opt-νHDM expansion history, its structure formation and the resulting mass function. The appearance of the early-time structures, firstly in the νHDM model, as well as in the opt-νHDM model occurs quiet late, at z≈4 and at z≈ 5.5, respectively. Although the resolution has improved from previous studies, the νHDM variants cannot explain easily the high-redshift galaxies, observed by JWST.

<p>
JWST/MIRI observations can place photometric limits on the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) near the Galactic Centre. The stellar complex IRS 13E, a co-moving conglomerate of young and massive stars, is a prime location to study because it has been speculated to be bound by an IMBH. Assuming a standard radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) and a minimum fractional variability of 10% of intrinsic luminosity, the wavelength of peak emission in the spectral energy distribution for an IMBH would lie in the mid-infrared (~ 5-25 μm), and variability would be detectable in MIRI time-series observations. Monitoring fails to detect such variable emission (other than from Sgr A*) in and around the IRS 13E complex, and upper limits on a putative IMBH's intrinsic variability on timescales of minutes to about 1 hour are ≲1 mJy at 12 μm and ≲2 mJy at 19 μm. These translate to luminosities ≲ 25 × 10^32 erg/s. The resulting limits on the IMBH mass and accretion rate rule out any IMBH with mass ≳ 10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> accreting at ≳ 10^-6 times Eddington rate at the location of IRS 13E. Further, the observations rule out an IMBH anywhere in the central 6" × 6" region that is more massive than ≈ 2 × 10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and accreting at ≳ 10^-6 of the Eddington rate. Assuming Bondi accretion scaled to typical RIAF-accretion efficiencies, albeit somewhat uncertain, also allows us to rule out IMBHs moving with typical velocities of about 200 km/s and masses ≳ 2 × 10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. These methods showcase the effectiveness of photometric variability measurements in constraining the presence of accreting black holes in Galactic centre-like environments.

<p>
S. D. von Fellenberg et al. (2025a, Paper I) reported the first mid-infrared detection of a flare from Sgr A*. The JWST/MIRI/MRS observations were consistent with an orbiting hotspot undergoing electron injection with a spectrum that subsequently breaks from synchrotron cooling. However, mid-infrared extinction measurements appropriate for these data were not yet determined, and therefore the temporal evolution of the absolute spectral index remained unknown. This work applies new Galactic Center extinction measurements to the flare observations. The evolution of the spectral index after the peak is fully consistent with that reported in Paper I with a maximum absolute mid-infrared spectral index α_MIR=0.45±0.01_stat±0.08_sys during the second mid-infrared flare peak, matching the known near-infrared spectral index during bright states (α_NIR≈0.5). There was a near-instantaneous change in the mid-infrared spectral index of Δα_MIR=0.33±0.06_stat±0.11_sys at the flare onset. We propose this as a quantitative definition for this infrared flare's beginning, physically interpreted as the underlying electron distribution's transition into a hard power-law distribution. This paper also reports the SMA millimeter polarization during the flare, which shows a small, distorted, but overall clockwise-oriented Stokes Q&ndash;U loop during the third mid-infrared peak. Extrapolating the mid-infrared flux power law to the millimeter yields a variable flux consistent with the observed 220 GHz emission. These results, together with the Paper I modeling, plausibly suggest a single hotspot produced both the mid-infrared and millimeter variability during this event. However, additional flares are required to make a general statement about the millimeter and mid-infrared connection.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission is widely used to trace the distribution of molecular gas in the interstellar medium (ISM), exhibiting a tight correlation with CO(2-1) emission across nearby galaxies. Using PHANGS-JWST and PHANGS-ALMA data, we identify localized regions where this correlation fails, with CO flux exceeding that predicted from 7.7μm PAH emission by more than an order of magnitude. These outlier regions are found in 20 out of 70 galaxies and are mostly located in galaxy centers and bars, without signs of massive star formation. We explore two scenarios to explain the elevated CO-to-PAH ratios, which can either be due to suppressed PAH emission or enhanced CO emissivity. We examine PAH emission in other bands (3.3μm and 11.3μm) and the dust continuum dominated bands (10μm and 21μm), finding consistently high CO-to-PAH (or CO-to-dust continuum) emission ratios, suggesting that 7.7μm PAH emission is not particularly suppressed. In some outlier regions, PAH size distributions and spectral energy distribution of the illuminating radiation differ slightly compared to nearby control regions with normal CO-to-PAH ratios, though without a consistent trend. We find that the outlier regions generally show higher CO velocity dispersions (Δv_CO). This increase in Δv_CO may lower CO optical depth and raise its emissivity for a given gas mass. Our results favor a scenario where shear along the bar lanes and shocks at the tips of the bar elevate CO emissivity, leading to the breakdown of the CO-PAH correlation.

We present an analysis on the kinematics and physical properties of the ionized gas in the lensed galaxy RXCJ2248-ID at z=6.1 based on high-resolution JWST NIRSpec/IFU data in combination with ALMA observations. Our analysis reveals a high electron temperature (T_e~30000K) in the ionized gas, independent of the ionization level. We measure a wide range in the electron densities derived from [OIII]λ5008/[OIII]88μm and [ArIV]λ4713/[ArIV]λ4742 ratios (log(n_e[cm^-3])~2.7-3.8), and previous values (log(n_e[cm^-3])&gt;4.8) based on high-ionization rest-UV emission lines. The ionized gas appears to be clumpy with a low filling factor ranging from about 10% to 0.2% for the low- and high-density clouds. In addition, we observe a very complex ISM kinematic structure, with the presence of two distinct broad and a very-broad components (FWHM~210 and ~1000 kms<sup>-1</sup>) in addition to the systemic one (FWHM~60 kms<sup>-1</sup>) in [OIII]λ5008 and Hα. These broad components are heavily extinct (A_V~1.5 and 2.5, respectively), based on their Balmer decrements, while the gas associated to the narrow component is consistent with no extinction. The maximal velocities of these outflows (~115-500kms<sup>-1</sup>) are such that a fraction of the total outflowing gas (0.16-2.1×10^7M<sub>&odot;</sub>) could escape into the IGM. The rest of the gas will fall back to the central regions, being available for additional star formation episodes. The presence of dusty outflows and clumpy (i.e., low filling factor) ISM give support to the Attenuation-Free scenario proposed to explain the high-z UV-bright compact galaxies such as RXCJ2248-ID. On the other hand, the high densities in the ISM, together with the high SFR surface brightness, and the amount of returning outflowing mass give support to the Feedback-Free Starburst scenario.

We present the discovery of a strongly lensed galaxy at z~11-12, dubbed the "Misty Moons'', identified in the JWST Treasury Survey, Vast Exploration for Nascent, Unexplored Sources (VENUS). The Misty Moons is gravitationally lensed by the galaxy cluster MACS J0257.1-2325 at z=0.505, and has five multiple images suggested by two independent lensing models. Two of the five images, ID1 and ID2 (μ~ 20-30), are very bright (F200W~26 AB mag) and exhibit blue SEDs with prominent Lyα breaks. In the source plane, the Misty Moons is a sub-L^* galaxy (M_UV~-18.0 mag) resolved into multiple stellar clumps, each of which has effective radius of r_eff~ 10-70 pc and stellar mass of ~10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. These clumps dominate the stellar mass budget of the Misty Moons (≳80&percnt;), similar to other high-z clumps, which suggests a highly clustered mode of star formation in the early Universe, unlike seen in local dwarf galaxies. We convolve the source-plane image with the JWST/NIRCam point-spread function to produce a mock NIRCam image of the Misty Moons without lensing magnification, and find that the intrinsic galaxy has a radial surface-brightness profile comparable to those of z≳10 faint galaxies, such as JADES-GS-z13-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1, indicating that the Misty Moons represents a typical z≳10 faint galaxy. The Misty Moons, a lensed galaxy with resolved internal structures, provides an ideal laboratory for exploring the early stages of galaxy formation at z≳10.

<p>
Our knowledge of the chemical composition of the gas in the inner disc of intermediate-mass young stars is limited, due to the lack of suitable instrumentation. The launch of JWST has provided a significant improvement in our ability to probe gas in these inner discs. We analyse the gas composition and emitting conditions of the disc around HD 35929, a young intermediate-mass Herbig star, using MIRI/MRS data. Our goal is to constrain the chemistry and kinematics of the gas phase molecules detected in the inner disc. We use iSLAT to examine the observed molecular lines and DuCKLiNG to detect, fit, and analyse the molecular emission. We find gas phase H2O, CO, CO2, and OH in the disc, as well as HI recombination lines. Surprisingly, we also detect gas phase SiO in the fundamental v=1-0 vibrational band. We derive column densities and temperature ranges of the detected species, arising from the inner ~0.2 au, hinting towards a compact and very warm disc. The molecular column densities are much higher than found in lower mass T Tauri discs. In general, the molecular composition is consistent with an O-rich gas from which silicate-rich solids condense and the strong gas phase molecular line emission suggests a low dust opacity. The unexpected detection of gas phase SiO at the source velocity points to an incomplete condensation of rock forming elements in the disc, suggesting chemical disequilibrium and/or an underestimate of the gas kinetic temperature.

### 118) [2511.13849](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13849v1): How accurately can obscured galaxy luminosities be measured using spectral energy distribution fitting of near- through far-infrared observations?

<p>
Infrared-luminous galaxies are important sites of stellar and black hole mass assembly at most redshifts. Their luminosities are often estimated by fitting spectral energy distribution (SED) models to near- to far-infrared data, but the dependence of these estimates on the data used is not well-understood. Here, using observations simulated from a well-studied local sample, we compare the effects of wavelength coverage, signal-to-noise (S/N), flux calibration, angular resolution, and redshift on the recovery of starburst, AGN, and host luminosities. We show that the most important factors are wavelength coverage that spans the peak in a SED, with dense wavelength sampling. Such observations recover starburst and AGN infrared luminosities with systematic bias below 20&percnt;. Starburst luminosities are best recovered with far-infrared observations while AGN luminosities are best recovered with near- and mid-infrared observations, though the recovery of both are enhanced with near/mid-infrared, and far-infrared observations, respectively. Host luminosities are best recovered with near/far-infrared observations, but are usually biased low, by ≳20&percnt;. The recovery of starburst and AGN luminosity is enhanced by observing at high angular resolution. Starburst-dominated systems show more biased recovery of luminosities than do AGN-dominated systems. As redshift increases, far-infrared observations become more capable, and mid-infrared observations less capable, at recovering luminosities. Our results highlight the transformative power of a far-infrared instrument with dense wavelength coverage from tens to hundreds of microns for studying infrared-luminous galaxies. We tabulate estimates of systematic bias and random error for use with JWST and other observatories.

### 119) [2511.13823](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13823v1): Robust galaxy image decompositions with Differential Evolution optimisation and the problem of classical bulges in and beyond the nearby Universe

<p> Dimitri A. Gadotti </p>
<p>
Deconstructing galaxies through two-dimensional decompositions has been shown to be a powerful technique to derive the physical properties of stellar structures in galaxies. However, most studies employ fitting algorithms that are prone to be trapped in local minima, or involve subjective choices. Furthermore, when applied on samples beyond the nearby Universe, results on the fraction of classical bulges in disc galaxies do not agree with studies on nearby galaxies. The latter studies point to a small fraction of classical bulges, possibly challenging our merger-driven picture of galaxy formation. Therefore, understanding the discrepancy between observations in and beyond the nearby Universe is of paramount importance. In this paper, I use a sample of 16 nearby galaxies drawn from the TIMER project, which previously have been shown to not host classical bulges, and perform decompositions applying different methodologies and employing the original images as well as artificially redshifted images. I show that the Differential Evolution algorithm is able to provide accurate measurements of structural properties with little subjective intervention, correctly indicating the presence of nuclear discs (not classical bulges). However, I also show that when the physical spatial resolution is not adequate, a systematic overestimation of the photometric bulge Sérsic index leads to the false conclusion of the presence of classical bulges. I discuss how this may be the root cause of the discrepancy mentioned above, and point out how this issue may be a problem even with data from facilities such as Euclid, HST and JWST.

### 120) [2511.13708](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13708v1): The Scatter of the Many Outweighs the Scatter of the Few: Systematic Error Asymmetry in Steeply-Falling Mass Functions for High-Redshift JWST Galaxies

<p> Jay R. Krishnan, Kevork N. Abazajian </p>
<p>
The discovery of massive, high redshift galaxies with JWST has been argued to challenge ΛCDM: such systems would require extremely rare halos and baryon-to-stellar-mass conversion efficiencies unphysically approaching&ndash;or exceeding&ndash;100%. If confirmed at galaxy formation forbidden efficiencies, these galaxies could signal new physics beyond standard cosmological structure formation. We develop a galaxy model framework that ties the linear power spectrum to the inferred efficiencies of galaxy growth in order to test the structure formation models. In addition, we incorporate multiple sources of error, including (i) observational sample variance, (ii) asymmetric scatter induced by the steepness of the high-mass halo tail, and (iii) systematic uncertainties in stellar mass estimates. We find that the inferred efficiency of star formation is dominated by systematic uncertainties on the spectral energy distribution inferred stellar mass of the JWST detected galaxies. The systematic uncertainty augments the asymmetry in scatter that largely brings the inferred efficiencies to be in line with that expected from early galaxy formation models. Our framework can be used to test ΛCDM as errors are reduced and further detections are made.

### 121) [2511.13651](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13651v1): High-resolution radio imaging of TGSSJ1530+1049, a radio galaxy in a dense environment at z=4

<p>
High-redshift radio galaxies can provide insights into the structure formation and galaxy evolution at earlier cosmological epochs. TGSSJ1530+1049 was selected as a candidate high-redshift radio galaxy. Subsequent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) presented in a companion paper (Saxena et al., submitted) have shown that it is located at a redshift z=4.0. The JWST data furthermore showed that the radio source is part of one of the densest structures of galaxies and ionized gas known at these redshifts. The complex system qualitatively resembles a massive (cluster) galaxy forming early through a rapid succession of mergers. TGSSJ1530+1049 is an unresolved source down to ~0.6" scale in multiple radio surveys. To reveal its high-resolution radio structure and allow for a detailed comparison with JWST observations, we studied its morphology at various angular scales with different radio interferometric instruments. We observed TGSSJ1530+1049 at milliarcsecond (mas) scale angular resolution with the European VLBI Network (EVN), and at ~100-mas scale resolution with the enhanced Multi-Element Remotely Linked Interferometer Network (e-MERLIN). We recovered a complex north&ndash;south oriented structure with steep-spectrum radio-emitting features, which are associated with lobes and hot spots of a jetted active galactic nucleus. The centre of the radio galaxy proved to be too faint at cm wavelengths to be unambiguously detected in our observations. Nevertheless, the linear size (~5.5 kpc) and the radio power place it among the so-called medium-sized symmetric objects, a smaller and/or confined version of larger radio galaxies. Comparison between the radio morphology and that of the ionized gas observed by JWST shows that the two are closely aligned. However, the optical emission line gas extends out to ~25 kpc, which is well beyond the detected radio structures. (Abridged)

<p>
We present JWST observations of the radio galaxy TGSSJ1530+1049, spectroscopically confirmed at z=4.0. NIRCam images and NIRSpec/IFU spectroscopy (R=2700) show that TGSSJ1530+1049 is part of one of the densest-known structures of continuum and line-emitting objects found at these redshifts. NIRCam images show a number of distinct continuum objects and evidence of interactions traced by diffuse emission, and the NIRSpec IFU cube reveals further strong line emitting regions. We identify six continuum and four additional strong Halpha emitting sources with weaker or no underlying continuum within the 3''x3'' IFU field. From spatial alignment with high-resolution radio data and emission line profiles, the radio AGN host galaxy is clearly identified. The bright Halpha emission (but not the optical components) is distributed remarkably linearly along the radio axis, suggestive of a biconical illumination zone by a central obscured AGN. The emission line kinematics indicate jet-gas interactions on scales of a few kpc. However, due to large relative velocities and presence of underlying continuum, the alignment with the radio structure appears to be, at least partly, caused by a particular configuration of interacting galaxies. At least four objects within a 10x10 (projected) kpc<sup>2</sup> area which includes the radio source have high stellar masses (log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&gt;10.3) and star formation rates in the range 70-163 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1. Using a stellar mass-based analysis, we predict a total dark matter halo mass of ≈10^13 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Based on the physical separations and velocity differences between the galaxies, it is expected that these galaxies will merge to form a massive galaxy within a few Gyr. The system qualitatively resembles the forming brightest cluster galaxies in cosmological simulations that form early through a rapid succession of mergers.

We present the discovery of extreme nitrogen enrichment by Wolf Rayet nitrogen stars (WN) in the metal-poor (~10&percnt;Z<sub>&odot;</sub>), lensed, compact (R_eff~20 pc) galaxy RXCJ2248 at z=6.1, revealed by unprecedentedly deep JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution spectroscopy from the GLIMPSE-D Survey. The exquisite S/N reveals multiple high-ionization nebular lines and broad Balmer and [OIII] components (FWHM~700-3000 km s<sup>-1</sup>). We detect broadened HeII λ1640 and λ4687 (FWHM~530 km s<sup>-1</sup>) and strong NIII] λ4642 emission consistent with a population of WN stars, making RXCJ2248 the most distant galaxy with confirmed WR features to date. We measure the multi-phase nebular density across five ions, the direct-method metallicity (12+log(O/H)= 7.749±0.023), and a non-uniform elemental enrichment pattern of extreme N/O enhancement (log(N/O)=-0.390±0.035 from N^+, N^+2, and N^+3) and suppressed C/O relative to empirical C/N trends. We show that this abundance pattern can be explained by enrichment from a dual-burst with a low WC/WN ratio, as expected at low metallicities. Crucially, these signatures can only arise during a brief, rare evolutionary window shortly after a burst (~3-6 Myr), when WN stars dominate chemical feedback but before dilution by later yields (e.g., supernovae). The observed frequency of strong N emitters at high-z implies a ~50 Myr burst duty cycle, suggesting that N/O outliers may represent a brief but ubiquitous phase in the evolution of highly star-forming early galaxies. The detection in RXCJ2248, therefore, provides the first direct evidence of WN-driven chemical enrichment in the early Universe and a novel timing argument for the bursty star formation cycles that shaped galaxies at cosmic dawn.

<p>
We have carried out a detailed analysis of the 3.4 micron spectral feature arising from Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH), using JWST archival data. For the first time in an external galaxy (NGC 6240), we have identified two distinct spectral components of the PAH 3.4 micron feature: a shorter wavelength component at 3.395 micron, which we attribute to short aliphatic chains tightly attached to the aromatic rings of the PAH molecules; and a longer wavelength feature at 3.405 microns that arises from longer, more fragile, aliphatic chains that are weakly attached to the parent PAH molecule. These longer chains are more easily destroyed by far-ultraviolet photons (&gt;5eV) and PAH thermal emission only occurs where PAH molecules are shielded from more energetic photons by dense molecular gas. We see a very strong correlation in the morphology of the PAH 3.395 micron feature with the PAH 3.3 micron emission, the latter arising from robust aromatic PAH molecules. We also see an equally strong correlation between the PAH 3.405 micron morphology and the warm molecular gas, as traced by H2 vibrational lines. We show that the flux ratio PAH_3.395/PAH_3.405 &lt; 0.3 corresponds strongly to regions where the PAH molecules are shielded by dense molecular gas, so that only modestly energetic UV photons penetrate to excite the PAHs. Our work shows that PAH 3.405 micron and PAH 3.395 micron emission features can provide robust diagnostics of the physical conditions of the interstellar medium in external galaxies, and can be used to quantify the energies of the photon field penetrating molecular clouds.

We use Stars and MUltiphase Gas in GaLaxiEs (SMUGGLE) to explicitly model the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) and employ sub-grid dynamical friction for massive black holes (BHs). Furthermore, we use a super-Lagrangian refinement scheme to resolve AGN feedback coupling to the ISM at ~10-100 pc scales. By comparison between merging and isolated galaxies, with and without AGN feedback, we identify trends in the complex interplay between dynamics, BH fueling and feedback, and star formation and feedback. We consider three galaxy types: Milky Way analogs, Sbc-type galaxies, and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) analogs. The synergy between AGN feedback and merger dynamics is strongest in the Milky Way-like mergers, where the AGN winds are energetically dominant and entrain more gas when the initially thin disks become thick and amorphous during the merger. In contrast, the merger of thicker, vigorously star-forming Sbc galaxies is not strongly impacted by AGN feedback until star formation declines in the post-merger phase. Finally, while the sub-grid dynamical friction prescription effectively retains BHs in galactic nuclei during more massive mergers, the clumpy multiphase ISM induces significant wandering of low-mass BHs (&lt;10^5M<sub>&odot;</sub>) in the shallow potentials of the SMC-like galaxies. These low-mass BHs wander at distances ≳ 2 kpc from the galactic center, yielding negligible BH accretion and feedback. This has implications for LISA event rates and present a further challenge to understanding the rapid growth of z~7-10 quasars discovered by JWST.

The joint capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and JWST allow for an unparalleled look at the early lives of star clusters at near- and mid-infrared wavelengths. We present here a multiband analysis of embedded young stellar clusters in 11 nearby, star-forming galaxies, using the PHANGS-JWST and PHANGS-HST datasets. We use the Zooniverse citizen science platform to conduct an initial by-eye search for embedded clusters in near-UV/optical/near-infrared images that trace stellar continuum emission, the Paschenα and Hα recombination lines, and the 3.3 μm polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon feature and its underlying continuum. With this approach, we identify 292 embedded cluster candidates for which we characterize their ages, masses, and levels of line-of-sight extinction by comparing the photometric data to predictions from stellar population models. The embedded cluster candidates have a median age of 4.5 Myr and an average line-of-sight extinction ≤ft&lt; A_V &gt; = 6.0 mag. We determine lower limits on source stellar masses, resulting in a median stellar mass of 10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. We use this sample of embedded cluster candidates to train multiple convolutional neural network models to carry out deep transfer learning-based searches for embedded clusters. With the aim of optimizing models for future catalog production, we compare results for four variations of training data using two neural networks. Confusion matrices for all eight model configurations, as well as inter-model identification trends, are presented. With refinement of the training sample, we determine that optimized models could serve as a pathway for future embedded cluster identification beyond our 11 galaxy sample.

<p>
We examine the spatial distribution of star clusters in NGC 628 using the statistical tool INDICATE to quantify clustering tendencies. Our sample, based on HST and JWST observations, is the most complete to date, spanning ages from 1 Myr to &gt;100 Myr. We find cluster spatial behaviour varies with galactic position, age, and mass. Most emerging young clusters are tightly spatially associated with each other, while fully emerged clusters are in ~1.5 times looser spatial associations, irrespective of age. Young Massive Clusters (YMCs ≥ 10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) tend to associate with lower-mass clusters but not strongly with other YMCs, implying that intense star formation regions produce a few YMCs alongside many lower-mass clusters rather than multiple YMCs together. Young concentrated clusters show a wide radial distribution in the galactic disk, which narrows with age; with concentrated clusters &gt;100 Myr mostly residing between 2-6 kpc. This pattern may reflect either faster dispersal of isolated tight cluster spatial "structure" in a lower gas density outer disk or gradual inside-out growth, with the formation of this structure shifting outward over time. We also detect distinct spatial behaviours for clusters within 2 kpc, linked to the inner Lindblad resonance (≤1 kpc), nuclear ring (~0.5-1 kpc), and the start of spiral arms (~1.25-2 kpc), suggesting these regions exhibit strong radial motions that could hinder clusters from forming and remaining in tight concentrations. Our results highlight how spatially-resolved studies of clusters can reveal the influence of galactic dynamics on star formation and cluster evolution.

<p>
Measuring the ionizing photon production efficiency ξ<sub>ion</sub>,0 &ndash; the ratio of ionizing photon output rate Q_H^0 to UV continuum luminosity L_UV &ndash; in galaxies at z &gt; 6 is crucial for constraining their contribution to cosmic reionization. We present integrated and spatially resolved measurements of ξ<sub>ion</sub>,0 for 12 exceptionally bright (M_UV ~ -22 mag) star-forming galaxies at z ~ 7 from the REBELS survey. These measurements are based on JWST NIRSpec/IFU PRISM spectroscopy, probing the rest-frame UV and optical regime. Notably, in 8 of the 12 galaxies, the spectral coverage includes Hα, enabling self-consistent dust attenuation estimates in both the ionized gas and stellar continuum via the Balmer decrement and rest-UV slope, respectively. We find global logξ<sub>ion</sub>,0 values ranging from 25.19±0.11 to 25.61±0.11, with a weighted mean of 25.44±0.15, consistent with the canonical value of ~25.3. Using a sample of 25 star-forming clumps within these galaxies, we explore local variations in LyC production efficiency, finding a broader range, from 24.52±0.21 to 26.18±0.61. We identify strong correlations between ξ<sub>ion</sub>,0 and specific star formation rate, star formation surface density, Hβ equivalent width, and stellar mass. Clumps with the highest ξ<sub>ion</sub>,0 exhibit EW_0(Hβ) ≥ 150 Angstrom, consistent with young stellar ages. From previous Lyα measurements in three galaxies, we estimate a typical Lyα escape fraction of f<sub>esc</sub>, Lyα ~ 2&percnt;, suggesting similar or lower escape fractions for LyC photons. Combining this with our Hα measurements, we infer ionized bubble sizes ~ 1 pMpc, aligned with expectations from Lyα-detected systems and reionization models.

<p>
Reliable star formation rate (SFR) measurements are essential for understanding early galaxy evolution, yet derived values rely on several assumptions. To address this problem, we investigate the SFRs of 12 massive (9≲~log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≲~10) Lyman-break galaxies at z=6.5-7.7, drawn from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Reionization Era Bright Emission Line Survey (REBELS) program. The multi-wavelength data, including JWST NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy and ALMA observations, make this a unique sample for investigating SFR tracers at this epoch. We compare SFRs derived from the rest-UV, Hα, and far-infrared emission, and from spectral energy distribution (SED) fits. We apply robust dust attenuation corrections, which are crucial since between 50-80 per cent of the star formation is obscured, and find a stellar-to-nebular attenuation ratio of f=0.50±0.08, consistent with local star-forming galaxies. The majority of the derived total SFRs (medians 25-120 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1) place the REBELS galaxies systematically above z=7 literature star-forming main-sequence relations, and our best-fit star formation histories (SFHs) rise more steeply than lower-mass galaxies at the same redshift. We show that these rising SFHs mean commonly used luminosity-to-SFR conversion factors, derived assuming a constant SFH over given timescales, overestimate the SFRs averaged over these timescales for our galaxies. We provide updated luminosity-to-SFR calibrations for z≃7 galaxies with rising SFHs, showing that commonly assumed rest-UV conversion factors overestimate the 100 Myr average SFR by a factor of ≃3. Finally, we investigate burstiness indicators in the REBELS-IFU galaxies, finding that the rising SFHs imply that the Hα-to-UV luminosity ratio is an unreliable probe of bursty star formation.

<p>
We present a reconstruction of the large-scale structure using the James Webb Space Telescope's (JWST) COSMOS-Web program to trace environmentally driven galaxy evolution up to z~7. We applied a weighted kernel density estimation method to 160,000 galaxies with robust photometric redshifts. We find that stellar mass has a positive correlation with density at all redshifts, stronger for quiescent galaxies (QGs) at z≲2.5, while at higher redshifts (2.5≲ z≲5.5) this trend is confined to extreme overdense environments, consistent with early mass assembly in proto-clusters. The star-formation rate (SFR) shows a negative trend with density for QGs at z≲1.2, reversing at z≳1.8, while star-forming galaxies (SFGs) show a mild positive correlation up to z~5.5. The specific SFR remains nearly flat for SFGs and declines with density for QGs at z≲1.2. Moreover, mass and environmental quenching efficiencies show that mass-driven processes dominate at z≳2.5, the two processes act with comparable strength between 0.8≲ z≲2.5, and environmental quenching becomes stronger for low-mass galaxies (M<sub>&sext;</sub>≲10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) at z≲0.8. These findings reveal that large-scale structure drives galaxy evolution by enhancing early mass assembly in dense regions and increasingly suppressing star formation in low-mass systems at later times, establishing the environmental role of the cosmic web across cosmic history. COSMOS-Web, the largest JWST survey, provides accurate and deep photometric redshifts, reaching 80% mass completeness at log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)~8.7 at z~7, enabling the first view of how environments shaped galaxy evolution from the epoch of reionization to the present day.

### 131) [2511.10725](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10725v1): Back to basics: Little Red Dots as galaxies and dust-obscured AGNs in a synthetic NIRCam sky simulated with L-GalaxiesBH

<p> Diego Herrero-Carrión, Daniele Spinoso, David Izquierdo-Villalba, Tong Su, Silvia Bonoli, Pablo Renard </p>
<p>
The enigmatic Little Red Dots (LRDs) discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) exhibit properties challenging their interpretation as common galaxies or Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Understanding their nature is key to placing them within our picture of early galaxy and massive black hole (MBH) evolution. To this aim, we build a realistic comparison between LRD observations with photometric properties of galaxies and AGN simulated by the L-GalaxiesBH model in a NIRCam mock sky. We model stellar continua and emission lines, the MBH emission from accretion disk, infrared radiation from dusty torus, and lines from narrow and broad line regions, accounting for dust attenuation and obscuration. Using realistic photometric cuts, we select a population of LRDs including both AGN and galaxies. The LRD fraction peaks at 40% (~10^-4Mpc^-3) at z~4. Our LRDs are central galaxies spanning M_*=10^8-10^10.5M<sub>&odot;</sub>. A population of galaxies with M_*&lt;10^9M<sub>&odot;</sub> appear as LRDs due to older stellar populations. At higher masses, LRDs dominate the halo and stellar mass functions (M_vir &gt; 10^11.5M<sub>&odot;</sub>, M_* &gt; 10^9.5M<sub>&odot;</sub>), and the interplay between AGN and galaxy emission drives the LRD selection. AGN dominate rest-frame UV-optical emission, while dust obscuration is secondary. LRDs host lighter MBHs (~ 10^6.5M<sub>&odot;</sub>) than non-LRDs (~ 10^7.5M<sub>&odot;</sub>), with fainter emission unable to balance their hosts Balmer breaks. We find no evidence for dominant heavy-seed origin of MBHs. LRD Galaxies (97% hosting MBHs) and LRD AGNs are disk-dominated, with LRD AGNs showing larger bulges formed mainly via disk instabilities.

<p>
We introduce Synference, a new, flexible Python framework for galaxy SED fitting using simulation-based inference (SBI). Synference leverages the Synthesizer package for flexible forward-modelling of galaxy SEDs and integrates the LtU-ILI package to ensure best practices in model training and validation. In this work we demonstrate Synference by training a neural posterior estimator on 10^6 simulated galaxies, based on a flexible 8-parameter physical model, to infer galaxy properties from 14-band HST and JWST photometry. We validate this model, demonstrating excellent parameter recovery (e.g. R^2&gt;0.99 for M<sub>&sext;</sub>) and accurate posterior calibration against nested sampling results. We apply our trained model to 3,088 spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies in the JADES GOODS-South field. The amortized inference is exceptionally fast, having nearly fixed cost per posterior evaluation and processing the entire sample in ~3 minutes on a single CPU (18 galaxies/CPU/sec), a ~1700× speedup over traditional nested sampling or MCMC techniques. We demonstrate Synference's ability to simultaneously infer photometric redshifts and physical parameters, and highlight its utility for rapid Bayesian model comparison by demonstrating systematic stellar mass differences between two commonly used stellar population synthesis models. Synference is a powerful, scalable tool poised to maximise the scientific return of next-generation galaxy surveys.

<p> Gijs Vermariën, Tommaso Grassi, Marie Van de Sande, Serena Viti, Stefano Bovino, Alessandro Lupi, Alexander Ruf, Lorenzo Branca, Catherine Walsh </p>
<p>
Since the first observations of interstellar molecules, astrochemical simulations have been employed to model and understand its formation and destruction path- ways. With the advent of high-resolution telescopes such as JWST and ALMA, the number of detected molecules has increased significantly, thereby creating a need for increasingly complex chemical reaction networks. To model such complex systems, we have developed Carbox, a new astrochemical simulation code that leverages the modern high-performance transformation framework Jax. With Jax enabling computational efficiency and differentiability, Carbox can easily utilize GPU acceleration, be used to study sensitivity and uncertainty, and interface with advances in Scientific Machine Learning. All of these features are crucial for modeling the molecules observed by current and next-generation telescopes.

### 134) [2511.10486](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10486v1): Revealing the Connection Between the Filamentary Hierarchy and Star Cluster Formation in a Simulated NGC 628 Galaxy

<p> Tamara Koletic, Rachel Pillsworth, Ralph E. Pudritz </p>
<p>
There is abundant observational evidence for the hierarchical, interconnected nature of filaments in the interstellar medium (ISM) extending from galactic down to sub-parsec scales. New JWST images of NGC 628 in particular, show clusters forming along the two spiral arms of this galaxy. In this paper we investigate filament and cluster properties in an NGC 628-like multi-scale high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulation. We use a filament finding tool to identify filaments and derive the probability density functions (PDFs) for the filament lengths and masses. Using a clustering algorithm we identify star clusters formed between 268 to 278 Myr and follow this population as the galaxy evolves for 60 Myr, calculating their mass PDFs, average radius growth rate, and average mass loss rate. We find a power-law index of alpha_m = -1.35 for the filament masses. Calculating the power-law index from our cluster mass PDF, we find a value of alpha_c,m = -1.35 when the clusters first form, exactly our filament mass power-law index. This shows that properties of young clusters arise from the gravitational fragmentation of their host filaments. We track the post-formation evolution of the clusters as they become unbound, increase in radius and decrease in mass yielding an ever steeper mass power-law index. After 60 Myr, the mass power-law index is alpha_c,m = -1.55, matching other simulations and observations.

<p>
The nearby dwarf starburst NGC 5253 is dominated by a compact radio-infrared supernebula powered by a very young and bright embedded Super Star Cluster (SSC) of ~ 10^9 L<sub>&odot;</sub>. We observed this source and its surroundings over the 5-25μm range with MIRI/MRS on JWST and in Paper I presented the JWST view of the region and its continuum features. We now present the more than 70 emission lines of HI, H<sub>2</sub> and metal ions detected by MIRI/MRS. We derive the extinction by comparing HI recombination to the free-free radio continuum and find that it is very flat, i.e., almost independent of wavelength, over this spectral range. Nebular conditions are consistent with young (≲5×10^6 years) and very massive stars. All regions show high excitation, but the spatial distribution of the high excitation lines suggests that photons with energies close to 50eV are escaping the supernebula core in spite of 35 magnitudes of visual extinction.

### 136) [2511.09910](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09910v1): JWST View of the Supernebula in NGC 5253. I. Overview and Continuum Features

<p> Jean L. Turner, Sara C. Beck, Elm A. Zweig, L. Barcos-Muñoz, John H. Black, Daniel P. Cohen, S. Michelle Consiglio, Nicholas G. Ferraro, Paul T. P. Ho, David S. Meier </p>
<p>
We present imaging spectroscopy of the "supernebula" in the nearby dwarf galaxy NGC 5253 with the MIRI-MRS integral field spectrometer of the JWST. NGC 5253 is host to an luminous (L~ 10^9~L<sub>&odot;</sub>) HII region, powered by a giant young star cluster, a possible local analogue to super star cluster formation at Cosmic Dawn and Noon. In this paper, the first in a series about the mid-infrared line and continuum emission in the center of NGC 5253, we present an overview and continuum spectra. The mid-infrared images reveal four sources of continuum emission from hot dust that we identify as luminous HII regions, which are used to define spectral apertures. The dominant continuum source is the pc-scale supernebula core seen at radio wavelengths. We find that the MIR to radio continuum flux ratio for all regions is identical to that of Galactic HII regions. The 9.7 silicate feature is present and strongest in absorption toward the supernebula. Silicate emission is seen in another HII region. PAH features are present, although weak, particularly in the supernebula; the strongest emission is in an HII region only 15 pc from the supernebula core. PAH features at 6.2μm and 11.3μm are detected in all sources. Comparison of the luminosity implied by the ionization to the observed infrared luminosity suggest that at least 25% ofthe photons are escaping the embedded supernebula core, in spite of its high, A_V≳ 15, extinction.

### 137) [2511.09644](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09644v1): statmorph-lsst: Quantifying and correcting morphological biases in galaxy surveys

<p>
Quantitative morphology provides a key probe of galaxy evolution across cosmic time and environments. However, these metrics can be biased by changes in imaging quality - resolution and depth - either across the survey area or the sample. To prepare for the upcoming Rubin LSST data, we investigate this bias for all metrics measured by statmorph and single-component Sérsic fitting with Galfit. We find that geometrical measurements (ellipticity, axis ratio, Petrosian radius, and effective radius) are fairly robust at most depths and resolutions. Light concentration measurements (C, Gini, M_20) systematically decrease with resolution, leading low-mass or high-redshift bulge-dominated sources to appear indistinguishable from disks. Sérsic index n, while unbiased, suffers from a 20-40% uncertainty due to degeneracies in the Sérsic fit. Disturbance measurements (A, A_S, D) depend on signal-to-noise and are thus affected by noise and surface-brightness dimming. We quantify this dependence for each parameter, offer empirical correction functions, and show that the evolution in C observed in JWST galaxies can be explained purely by observational biases. We propose two new measurements - isophotal asymmetry A_X and substructure St - that aim to resolve some of these biases. Finally, we provide a Python package statmorph-lsst implementing these changes and a full dataset that enables tests of custom functions (see text for links).

### 138) [2511.09640](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09640v1): The SEEDZ Simulations: Methodology and First Results on Massive Black Hole Seeding and Early Galaxy Growth

<p>
Here we introduce the SEEDZ simulations, a suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations exploring the formation and growth of the first massive black holes in the Universe. SEEDZ includes models for Population III star formation, supernovae explosions and the resulting formation of light seed black holes, metal enrichment and subsequent Population II star formation, heavy seed black hole formation, Eddington and super-Eddington accretion schemes as well as black hole feedback. In this paper, we cover the overall methodologies employed and present our current results at z=15. Our main result so far is that black holes initially grow faster than their host galaxy, and hence over-massive black holes are a feature of the high-redshift Universe. The fundamental black hole-galaxy relationships we observe at z = 0 (especially the M_BH - M_* relationship) likely only emerge in more mature galaxies. At high-redshift, that relationship has not yet been established. We find that even at these high redshifts, MBHs can grow from their initial heavy seed mass of ~10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub> up to 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. At the high end of our MBH masses, our simulated galaxy M_BH - M_* relations match the observed high redshift trends i.e. over-massive BHs with M_BH/M_star ~ 10^-2. This initial set of simulations will continue to run down to z=10, where we will perform a comprehensive comparison of simulated MBH number densities and M_BH - M_* relations with JWST observations. Further simulations with higher resolution will then follow.

### 139) [2511.09618](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09618v1): Think inside the box: cosmic variance and large-scale conformity of high-redshift massive galaxies in the FLAMINGO simulations

<p> Seunghwan Lim, Sandro Tacchella, Roberto Maiolino, Christopher C. Lovell, Joop Schaye </p>
<p>
We use the highest-resolution FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulation to quantify cosmic variance and large-scale coherence in the evolution of massive galaxies at high redshift. FLAMINGO combines a (1 cGpc)^3 volume with baryonic resolution sufficient to identify ≳ 10^3 independent JWST-like survey volumes of (100 cMpc)^3, providing unprecedented statistics to characterize the extremes of cosmic variance. At z ≃ 6, the total variance in the number of haloes with M_200 ≃ 10^11.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> (or M<sub>&ast;</sub> ≃ 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) is 2&ndash;3 times the Poisson expectation, while this ratio decreases with redshift. Similarly, at z ≳ 4, the variance in the most massive halo per JWST-like field is twice the Poisson prediction. We find a pronounced large-scale phconformity: in volumes ranked by the stellar mass of their most massive galaxy (M<sub>&ast;</sub>,max), the stellar-to-halo mass relation and star-formation efficiency are coherently elevated or suppressed throughout the full (100 cMpc)^3 volume. When accounting for galaxies outside the volume, this signal persists only to radii ≲ 50 cMpc, demonstrating that the detectable conformity is enhanced by the survey footprint. Moreover, M<sub>&ast;</sub>,max is a better predictor of the volume-wide efficiency of massive galaxies than the total number counts, which mainly trace clustering. Finally, the stellar fraction of the most massive galaxies peaks at f<sub>&ast;</sub> = M<sub>&ast;</sub> / (M_200f_b,cosmic) ≃ 0.2 at z ≃ 5, with a narrower dispersion in f<sub>&ast;</sub> at fixed redshift and stronger redshift evolution than commonly assumed. These results show that both cosmic variance and footprint-confined conformity must be modelled when interpreting early massive galaxy populations in JWST fields.

### 140) [2511.09278](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09278v1): Little red dots as embryos of active galactic nuclei

<p> Jian-Min Wang, Yi-Lin Wang, Yong-Jie Chen, Jun-Rong Liu, Yu-Yang Songsheng, Cheng Cheng, Yan-Rong Li, Pu Du, Hao Zhang, Yu Zhao </p>
<p>
As an unprecedented large population in the early universe, the JWST-discovered little red dots (LRDs) have garnered much attention for formation of massive black holes and galaxies, but their nature remains a mystery. The LRDs appearing as "Chimeras" like both active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and galaxies have stimulated renewed interest in the roadmap of central massive black hole (cMBH) formation in AGNs. In this paper, we suggest that the LRDs contain M<sub>&bull;</sub>≲ 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> cMBHs as demonstrated by the Sołtan argument and there is a large population of stellar-mass black holes (sMBHs with total mass of \mathscrM_m<sub>&bull;</sub>) embedded inside cMBH accretion disks (cMBH-disk) as motivated by anomalous reverberations of broad Hβ line in local AGNs. This embryo structure of LRDs (M<sub>&bull;</sub>&lt;\mathscrM_m<sub>&bull;</sub>) is formed as a consequence of gravitational collapse of primordial clouds. In this Chimera, accretion onto sMBHs powers the rest-frame optical continuum of the LRDs but the UV continuum is jointly contributed by slim parts of the cMBH-disks and nuclear starbursts in the core of collapsing clouds governing the appearance of the observed V-shaped spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Outflowing clumped-envelopes are unavoidably formed by radiation pressure leading to absorption features of the Balmer lines. The present model works very well for LRDs' SEDs and avoids the issues of overly massive cMBHs. Evolution of LRDs is briefly discussed including gravitational waves.

### 141) [2511.09198](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09198v1): Interstellar medium phases and abundances in the central parsec: A JWST MIRI/MRS view of the Galactic center

<p> P. Vermot, A. Ciurlo, D. Rouan, M. R. Morris, E. Bron, J. Le Bourlot, F. Le Petit, J. Qiu, A. Togi, A. Ghez T. Do, J. R. Lu </p>
<p>
We used newly obtained observations from the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) equipped with the Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) aboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to extract spectra covering the entire spectral range from 5 to 27~μm in the CND and in the CC. We used the photoionization code CLOUDY to generate synthetic spectra with the same spectral range and resolution, simulating a wide range of gas phases and abundances. We then determined the contribution of each phase to the spectra. Once the abundances and contribution from each phase of the gas were determined, we identified four dominant phases and performed a spatial analysis to determine their contribution to each spaxel of the datacubes. We find that in both the CND and the CC, the bulk of the emission originates from warm ionized gas with temperatures of between 10^4 and 10^4.8~K. In the CND, molecular gas contributes significantly to the flux and is spatially structured, while the CC shows minimal molecular gas content, as is expected from these regions. Coronal gas is detected in both regions at the interface between molecular and warm ionized gas. The observed abundance pattern (enhanced CNO and α elements with suppressed Fe) indicates a chemically young environment, recently enriched by core-collapse supernovae and stellar winds, with a limited contribution from older Type Ia supernovae. This favors a scenario of massive, recent star formation rather than cumulative long-term enrichment.

### 142) [2511.08685](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08685v3): Kinematic scaling relations of disc galaxies from ionised gas at z~1 and their connection with dark matter haloes

<p> Pavel E. Mancera Piña, Enrico M. Di Teodoro, S. Michael Fall, Antonino Marasco, Mariska Kriek, Marco Martorano </p>
<p>
We derive the Tully-Fisher (TFR, M<sub>&ast;</sub>-V_circ,f) and Fall (FR, j<sub>&ast;</sub>-M<sub>&ast;</sub>) relations at redshift z = 0.9 using a sample of 43 main-sequence disc galaxies with Hα IFU data and JWST/HST imaging. The strength of our analysis lies in the use of state-of-the-art 3D kinematic models to infer galaxy rotation curves, the inclusion and morphological modelling of NIR bands, and the use of SED modelling applied to our photometry measurements to estimate stellar masses. After correcting the inferred Hα velocities for asymmetric drift, we find a TFR of the form log(M<sub>&ast;</sub> / M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = a log(V_circ,f / 150~km s<sup>-1</sup>) + b, with a=3.82^+0.55_-0.40 and b=10.27^+0.06_-0.07, as well as a FR of the form log(j<sub>&ast;</sub> / kpc km s<sup>-1</sup>) = a log(M<sub>&ast;</sub> / 10^10.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) + b, with a=0.44^+0.06_-0.06 and b=2.86^+0.02_-0.02. Compared with their z=0 counterparts, we find moderate evolution in the TFR and strong evolution in the FR over the past 8 Gyr. We interpret our findings in the context of the galaxy-to-halo scaling parameters f_M=M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M_vir and f_j=j<sub>&ast;</sub>/j_vir. We infer that f_j shows little redshift evolution and depends very weakly on M<sub>&ast;</sub>, with typical values around f_j~0.8. As for f_M, we find it to be higher and less dependent on M<sub>&ast;</sub> at z=0.9 than at z=0. Interpreting our observed f_M-M<sub>&ast;</sub> relations within the Cold Dark Matter framework implies necessarily that the galaxy populations at z=0.9 and z=0 are not the progenitor/descendant of one another. The alternative scenario is that the z=0.9 relations are incorrect due to strong selection effects, unidentified systematics, or the possibility that Hα kinematics may not be a reliable dynamical tracer. Such problems would also affect previous studies on the same subject.

### 143) [2511.08683](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08683v1): Bridging scales: Modeling suppressed Bondi accretion on black holes and its impact on galaxy growth

<p> Antonio J. Porras-Valverde, Priyamvada Natarajan, Angelo Ricarte, Kung-Yi Su, Hyerin Cho, Ramesh Narayan, Ben S. Prather </p>
<p>
The accretion and feedback processes governing supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth span an enormous range of spatial scales, from the Event Horizon to the circumgalactic medium. Recent general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations demonstrate that strong magnetic fields can substantially suppress Bondi accretion by creating magnetically arrested disk (MAD) states, reducing inflow rates by up to two orders of magnitude relative to classical Bondi predictions. We incorporate this magnetic suppression prescription from Cho et al. (2023, 2024) into the Dark Sage semi-analytic model (SAM), which tracks SMBH and galaxy co-evolution within hierarchical merger trees derived from the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation. Implementing the suppression across different Eddington-ratio regimes, we explore its impact on black hole mass functions (BHMFs), stellar mass functions (SMFs), and AGN luminosity functions. Restricting suppression to sub-Eddington accretors (f_Edd &lt; 3 × 10^-3) and rescaling AGN feedback efficiencies gives simultaneous agreement with observed z = 0 SMFs and BHMFs, as illustrated by Case D in this work. At z &gt; 6, super-Eddington growth episodes dominate in the SAM, reproducing JWST-inferred luminous AGN number densities. Our results highlight the critical sensitivity of galaxy assembly to the coupling between small-scale accretion physics and large-scale feedback regulation. Magnetic suppression of hot gas accretion can reconcile low-redshift constraints while preserving the rapid black hole growth required at early cosmic epochs, thereby providing a physically motivated bridge between horizon-scale GRMHD simulations and cosmological galaxy-formation models.

### 144) [2511.08671](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08671v1): JWST/NIRSpec Reveals a Small Population of Dominant Dust-Obscured Ionizing Sources in Galaxies at 1 &lt; z &lt; 3

<p> Si-Rui Ge, Nikko J. Cleri, Joel Leja, Antonello Calabro, Vital Fernandez </p>
<p>
Rest-frame optical emission line diagnostics are often used to help classify ionizing sources within galaxies. However, rest-frame optical tracers can miss sources with high dust attenuation, leading to misclassification of the dominant ionizing source. Longer wavelength tracers, such as those in the near-infrared, carry the power to diagnose ionizing sources while being more robust than optical tracers to the presence of dust. The diagnostics used in this work employ the ratios of bright near-infrared emission lines [S III] 9530, [Fe II] 12566 and [Fe II] 16443 to Paschen lines in publicly-available JWST/NIRSpec MSA medium-resolution spectroscopy of 55 galaxies at z &lt; 3. We compare the rest-frame near-infrared and rest-frame optical diagnostics and find that ~90% of our sample have consistent classifications across wavelengths (49/55), while the remaining sources can be explained through ionizing radiation obscured by dust and/or elevated N/Fe abundances. We identify three objects classified as star-forming in the rest frame optical and as active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the rest-frame near-infrared, which we interpret as obscured AGN. We also identify three objects which are classified as AGN in the rest-frame optical and star forming in the rest-frame near-infrared. We interpret two of these objects as AGN with obscured star formation and the other with elevated N/Fe. We discuss how future spatially-resolved and/or mid-infrared spectroscopy can test the relative contributions of AGN and stars to the ionizing photon budgets of these disagreeing sources.

### 145) [2511.08477](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08477v1): Supermassive Dark Stars and their remnants as a possible solution to three recent cosmic dawn puzzles

<p> Cosmin Ilie, Jillian Paulin, Andreea Petric, Katherine Freese </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) begun to revolutionize our view of the Cosmos. The discovery of Blue Monsters (i.e. ultracompact yet very bright high-z galaxies) and the Little Red Dots (i.e. very compact dustless strong Balmer break cosmic dawn sources) pose significant challenges to pre-JWST era models of the assembly of first stars and galaxies. In addition, JWST data further strengthen the problem posed by the origin of the supermassive black holes that power the most distant quasars observed. Stars powered by Dark Matter annihilation (i.e. Dark Stars) can form out of primordial gas clouds during the cosmic dawn era and subsequently might grow via accretion and become supermassive. In this paper we argue that Supermassive Dark Stars (SMDSs) offer natural solutions to the three puzzles mentioned above. Moreover, we present the best evidence so far, for the existence of SMDSs: the identification of a He~IIλ2511~Å absorption feature at S/N~4 in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z13-0.

<p>
We present an Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 9 continuum detection (3.3 σ) of MACS0416_Y1 that confirms the suspected warm dust (91^+62_-35 K) of this Lyman-Break Galaxy (LBG) at z = 8.3 with log_10 M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub> = 9.0 ± 0.1. A modified black-body fit to the ALMA Bands 3 through 9 data of MACS0416_Y1 finds an intrinsic infrared luminosity of 1.0^+1.8_-0.6 × 10^12 L<sub>&odot;</sub>, placing this UV-selected LBG in the regime of Ultra Luminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs). Its luminous but modest dust reservoir (1.4^+1.3_-0.5 × 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) is co-spatial to regions with a UV-continuum slope β_UV ≈ -1.5 as seen by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging. Although this implies some dust obscuration, the JWST photometry implies less obscured star formation than seen in the complete characterization by ALMA, implying some spatial separation of dust and stars on scales below 200 pc, i.e., smaller than those probed by JWST and ALMA. This source is an extreme example of dust-obscured star formation contributing strongly to the cosmic build-up of stellar mass, which can only be revealed through direct and comprehensive observations in the (sub)mm regime.

<p> Isaac Smith, Catherine Cerny, Keren Sharon, Guillaume Mahler, Gourav Khullar, Benjamin Beauchesne, The SLICE Collaboration </p>
<p>
We present the first strong gravitational lensing model for the cluster PSZ2 G118.46+39.32 (z = 0.3967) using new NIRCam imaging from the Strong LensIng and Cluster Evolution (SLICE) JWST program. We leverage the broad coverage of the SLICE ultrawide JWST filters to identify new lensed galaxies, some of which are not visible in HST, to model the cluster's mass distribution. The model was constructed with a total of 11 multiply imaged systems, decomposed into 30 images with 60 clumps used as strong lensing constraints. PSZ2 G118.46+39.32 shows a clear bimodal structure, indicating that it may be undergoing a merger. The predicted mass distribution of the model aligns with the X-ray gas in the cluster, suggesting it is in a pre-merger state.

<p>
We present the full sample of measurements of the warm dust emission of 31 strongly-lensed, multiply imaged quasars, observed with JWST MIRI multiband imaging, which we use to constrain the particle properties of dark matter. The strongly lensed warm dust region of quasars is compact and statistically sensitive to a population of dark matter halos down to masses of 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. The high spatial resolution and infrared sensitivity of MIRI make it uniquely suited to measure multiply imaged warm dust emission from quasars and thus to infer the properties of low-mass dark halos. We use the measured flux ratios to test for a warm dark matter turnover in the halo mass function. To infer the dark matter parameters, we use a forward modeling pipeline which explores dark matter parameters while also accounting for tidal stripping effects on subhalos, globular clusters, and complex deflector macromodels with m=1, m=3,  and  m=4 elliptical multipole moments. Adopting a comparable prior on the projected density of substructure to our previous analyses, the data presented here provide a factor of 2 improvement in sensitivity to a turnover in the halo mass function. Assuming subhalo abundance predicted by the semi-analytic model galacticus we infer with a Bayes factor of 10:1, a half-mode mass m_hm &lt; 10^7.8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> (m&gt;5.6 keV for a thermally produced dark matter particle). If instead we use a prior from N-body simulations, we infer m_hm &lt; 10^7.6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> (m&gt;6.4 keV). This is one of the strongest constraints to date on a turnover on the halo mass function, and the flux ratios and inference methodology presented here can be used to test a broad range of dark matter physics.

We address the origin of the Little Red Dots (LRDs) seen by JWST at cosmic morning (z \!=\! 4 \!-\! 8) as compact stellar systems with over-massive black holes (BHs). We propose that LRDs form naturally after feedback-free starbursts (FFB) in thousands of star clusters and following wet compaction. Analytically, we show how the clusters enable efficient dry migration of stars and BHs to the galaxy center by two-body segregation and dynamical friction against the disk. The clusters merge to form compact central clusters as observed. Mutual tidal stripping does not qualitatively affect the analysis. The young, rotating clusters are natural sites for the formation of BH seeds via rapid core collapse. The migrating clusters carry the BH seeds, which merge into central super-massive BHs (SMBHs). Compactions are required to deepen the potential wells such that the SMBHs are retained after post-merger gravitational-wave recoils, locked to the galaxy centers. Using cosmological simulations at different epochs, with different codes and physical recipes, we evaluate the additional growth of LRD-matching compact central stellar systems by global compaction events. Adding to the dry growth by cluster mergers, the compactions can increase the escape velocities to retain the SMBHs. The LRDs appear at z \!~\! 8, after the formation of FFB clusters, and disappear after z \!~\! 4 when the stellar mass is above 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> by growing post-compaction blue disks around the nuclear LRDs. The LRD abundance is expected to be ~\! 10^-5 \!-\! 10^-4 Mpc^-3, increasing from z \!~\! 4 to z\!~\! 8.

### 150) [2511.07544](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07544v1): Warm and cold molecular gas in the cluster center of MACS 1931-26 with JWST and ALMA

We perform one of the first spatially resolved studies of warm (&gt;100 K) and cold (10-100 K) molecular gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM), focusing on the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) of a cool-core galaxy cluster, MACS1931-26 at z=0.35. This galaxy has a massive H<sub>2</sub> reservoir and a radio-loud active galactic nucleus (AGN) and is undergoing a starburst event. We present new JWST observations of this system, revealing warm H<sub>2</sub> gas that is co-spatial with the cold molecular gas traced by CO, extending over 30 kpc around the BCG in a tail-like structure reaching into the circumgalactic medium of this galaxy. Analysis of the mid-infrared pure H<sub>2</sub> rotational lines H<sub>2</sub>S(1), H<sub>2</sub>S(5), and H<sub>2</sub>S(9) indicate warm gas temperatures of 515.6 ± 0.8 K and 535.2± 1.9 K in the BCG and tail regions, respectively. We compare cold gas, traced by the CO(3-2) observed with ALMA, to the warm gas traced by JWST. The warm-to-cold molecular gas fraction is comparable in the BCG (1.4&percnt;±0.2&percnt;) and the CGM tail (1.9&percnt;±0.3&percnt;). Our analysis suggests that the dissipation of the kinetic energy of the H<sub>2</sub>-emitting gas is sufficient to lead to the formation of the CO gas. This observation provides new insights into the molecular gas distribution and its potential role in the interplay between the central galaxy and its circumgalactic environment.

<p>
We present an overview of the JWST GLIMPSE program, highlighting its survey design, primary science goals, gravitational lensing models, and first results. GLIMPSE provides ultra-deep JWST/NIRCam imaging across seven broadband filters (F090W, F115W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F444W) and two medium-band filters (F410M, F480M), with exposure times ranging from 20 to 40 hours per filter. This yields a 5σ limiting magnitude of 30.9 AB (measured in a 0.2 arcsec diameter aperture). The field is supported by extensive ancillary data, including deep HST imaging from the Hubble Frontier Fields program, VLT/MUSE spectroscopy, and deep JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution multi-object spectroscopy. Exploiting the strong gravitational lensing of the galaxy cluster Abell S1063, GLIMPSE probes intrinsic depths beyond 33 AB magnitudes and covers an effective source-plane area of approximately 4.4 arcmin<sup>2</sup> at z ~ 6. The program's central aim is to constrain the abundance of the faintest galaxies from z ~ 6 up to the highest redshifts, providing crucial benchmarks for galaxy formation models, which have so far been tested primarily on relatively bright systems. We present an initial sample of ~ 540 galaxy candidates identified at 6 &lt; z &lt; 16, with intrinsic UV magnitudes spanning M_ UV = -20 to -12. This enables unprecedented constraints on the extreme faint end of the UV luminosity function at these epochs. In addition, GLIMPSE opens new windows for spatially resolved studies of star clusters in early galaxies and the detection and characterization of faint high-z active galactic nuclei. This paper accompanies the first public data release, which includes reduced JWST and HST mosaics, photometric catalogs, and gravitational lensing models.

The detection of strong Balmer breaks and absorption features in Little Red Dots (LRDs) suggests they host AGN embedded within dense gas envelopes, potentially powered by super-Eddington accretion. We present GLIMPSE-17775, a luminous (L_bol~10^45 erg s<sup>-1</sup>) LRD at z=3.501 behind Abell S1063 (μ~2), observed with deep JWST/NIRCam and a ~20 hr (80 hr de-lensed) NIRSpec/G395M spectrum. The data reveal 40+ emission and absorption features, including a rich forest of low-ionization FeII lines and numerous broad hydrogen recombination transitions. We use this depth to test the dense-gas interpretation through five independent diagnostics. Nearly all permitted lines show exponential wings with consistent FWHM, the signature of Thomson scattering requiring n_e≳10^8 cm^-3. Adopting this width yields M_BH~10^6.7M<sub>&odot;</sub>, a factor of ten lower than Gaussian fits, and λ_Edd~1.8. Additional diagnostics support the same picture: a pronounced Balmer break (f_ν,4050/f_ν,3670=2.0±0.1), enhanced HeI &lambda;7065 and &lambda;10830 with P-Cygni absorption, Bowen-fluorescent OI &lambda;8446-&lambda;11290 emission requiring Lyβ pumping, and 16 FeII lines matching fluorescence models. These features indicate a dense (n~10^8 cm^-3), partially ionized cocoon where scattering and fluorescence dominate line formation, providing strong evidence that at least some LRDs are powered by super-Eddington black-hole growth in the early Universe.

<p>
We present a measurement of the free-streaming length of dark matter (DM) and subhalo abundance around 28 quadruple image strong lenses using observations from JWST MIRI presented in Paper III of this series. We improve on previous inferences on DM properties from lensed quasars by simultaneously reconstructing extended lensed arcs with image positions and relative magnifications (flux ratios). Our forward modeling framework generates full populations of subhalos, line-of-sight halos, and globular clusters, uses an accurate model for subhalo tidal evolution, and accounts for free-streaming effects on halo abundance and concentration. Modeling lensed arcs leads to more-precise model-predicted flux ratios, breaking covariance between subhalo abundance and the free-streaming scale parameterized by the half-mode mass m_hm. Assuming subhalo abundance predicted by the semi-analytic model \ttgalacticus (N-body simulations), we infer (Bayes factor of 10:1) m_hm &lt; 10^7.4 M<sub>&odot;</sub> (m_hm &lt; 10^7.2 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), a 0.4 dex improvement relative to omitting lensed arcs. These bounds correspond to lower limits on thermal relic DM particle masses of 7.4 and 8.4 keV, respectively. Conversely, assuming DM is cold, we infer a projected mass in subhalos (10^6 &lt; m/M<sub>&odot;</sub>&lt;10^10.7) of 1.7_-1.2^+2.6 × 10^7  M<sub>&odot;</sub>  kpc^-2 at 95 &percnt; confidence. This is consistent with \ttgalacticus predictions (0.9 × 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>  kpc^-2), but in mild tension with recent N-body simulations (0.6 × 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>  kpc^-2). Our results are among the strongest bounds on WDM, and the most precise measurement of subhalo abundance around strong lenses. Further improvements will follow from the large sample of lenses to be discovered by Euclid, Rubin, and Roman.

Hands, the PHANGS collaboration </p>
<p>
High-resolution JWST images of nearby spiral galaxies reveal polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission structures that trace molecular gas, including CO-dark regions. We identify ISM cloud structures in PHANGS-JWST 7.7 μm PAH maps for 66 galaxies, smoothed to 30 pc and at native resolution, extracting 108,466 and 146,040 clouds, respectively. Molecular properties were inferred using a linear conversion from PAH to CO. Given the tendency for clouds in galaxy centers to overlap in velocity space, we opted to flag these and omit them from the analysis in this work. The remaining clouds correspond to giant molecular clouds, such as those detected in CO(2-1) emission by ALMA, or lower surface density clouds that either fall below the ALMA detection limits of existing maps or genuinely have no molecular counterpart. Cross-matching with ALMA CO maps at 90 pc in 27 galaxies shows that 41 % of PAH clouds have CO associations. The converted molecular properties vary little across environments, but the most massive clouds are preferentially found in spiral arms. Fitting lognormal mass distributions down to 2×10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> shows that spiral arms host the highest-mass clouds, consistent with enhanced formation in arm gravitational potentials. Cloud molecular surface densities decline by a factor of ~ 1.5-2 toward 2 - 3 R_e. However, the trend largely varies in individual galaxies, with flat, decreasing, and even no trend as a function of galactocentric radius. Factors like large-scale processes and morphologies might influence the observed trends. We publish two catalogs online, one at the common resolution of 30 pc and another at the native resolution. We expect them to have broad utility for future PAH clouds, molecular clouds, and star formation studies.

### 155) [2511.06481](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06481v1): The Calibration of Short Wavelength Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Emission as Star Formation Rate Indicators with JWST

<p>
We use JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging acquired by the Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic Star clusTers (FEAST) program along with archival HST imaging to map ionized gas (Paα, Brα, and Hα) and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission (3.3 and 7.7 μm) across a sample of four nearby galaxies (NGC 5194, 5236, 628, and 4449). These maps are utilized to calibrate the PAH features as star formation rate (SFR) indicators in 40 pc size regions around massive emerging young star clusters (eYSCs). We find a tight, sub-linear (power-law exponent, α  ~  0.8) relation between the PAH luminosities (3.3 and 7.7 μm) and SFR (extinction corrected Paα) in near solar metallicity environments. PAH destruction in more intense ionizing environments and/or variations in the age of our sources may drive the deviation from a linear relation. In the metal-poor environment of NGC 4449 (~1/3 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>), we see substantial deficits in the PAH feature strengths at fixed SFR and significantly higher scatter in the PAH-SFR relations. We determine that the 3.3/7.7 μm PAH luminosity ratio increases towards lower metallicity environments. This is interpreted as a result of a shift in the size distribution towards smaller PAHs at lower metallicities, possibly due to inhibited grain growth. Focusing on the regions in NGC 4449, we observe a decreasing 3.3/7.7 μm ratio towards higher SFR, which could indicate that small PAHs are preferentially destroyed relative to larger PAHs in significantly sub-solar metallicity conditions. We estimate that ~2/3 of the PAH emission in typical local star-forming galaxies is excited by older stars and unrelated to recent (&lt;10 Myr) star formation.

<p>
It remains debatable how billion-solar-mass supermassive black holes (SMBHs) form and evolve within the first billion years. We report results from a James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRSpec integral field unit (IFU) survey of 27 luminous quasars at z ~ 5-6, enabling a systematic investigation of their key physical properties and the associated, extended line emission. Our sample hosts SMBHs with log(M_BH/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ~ 8.6-9.7 and Eddington ratios of ~ 0.1-2.6 based on Hβ, and the Hβ-based and Hα-based BH mass are broadly consistent with each other. Our sample may have a slightly smaller median BH mass and larger median Eddington ratio than lower-redshift quasars within the same luminosity range, although the difference could still be explained by statistical uncertainties. They generally follow the empirical correlations between [O III] λ5007 equivalent width and bolometric luminosities or Eddington ratios formed by lower-redshift quasars. The majority of them fall within the Eigenvector~1 planes formed by lower-redshift quasars. Nevertheless, a subset of the sample shows enhanced, blueshifted [O III] emission associated with fast outflows. Spatially extended [O III] line emission is detected in 6 objects and shows morphologies and kinematics consistent with merging activities and/or turbulent and clumpy interstellar media (ISM). Tentative evidence of quasar radiative feedback shaping the ISM of a merging companion galaxy is seen in the object with the most extended [O III] emission. Our results provide crucial insight into the rapid growth of SMBHs and the gaseous environments they reside in at z~5-6.

### 157) [2511.05647](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05647v1): Not all protoclusters host evolved galaxies: Evidence for reduced environmental effects in a lower halo mass protocluster at z = 7.66

<p> Callum Witten, Pascal A. Oesch, Jake S. Bennett, Romain A. Meyer, Emma Giovinazzo, Alba Covelo-Paz, William M. Baker, Lucy R. Ivey </p>
<p>
The progenitors of present-day galaxy clusters offer crucial insight into how galaxies and large-scale structure co-evolve in the early Universe. We present JWST/NIRCam grism spectroscopy of the photometrically identified z=7.66 protocluster core in the SMACS J0723.3-7327 lensing field, SMACS-PC-z7p7. Six [O III]-emitters and five additional photometric candidates are found within a 0.3 arcmin<sup>2</sup> (1.5 cMpc^2) region, corresponding to an overdensity of δ~ 200. Despite the extreme overdensity, the resident galaxies exhibit star-formation histories, UV-slopes and neutral hydrogen column densities that are consistent with those of field galaxies at similar redshifts. This is in stark contrast with the consistently high neutral hydrogen column densities, old stellar populations and large dust masses of galaxies within a z=7.88 protocluster in the Abell 2744 field. Comparison with the TNG-Cluster and TNG300 simulations indicates a halo mass of log_10(M_200c[M<sub>&odot;</sub>]) = 11.4±0.2, and implies that, on average, SMACS-PC-z7p7 will evolve into a present-day Fornax-like cluster (log_10(M_200c, z=0[M<sub>&odot;</sub>]) = 13.7±0.6). The uniformly young, highly star-forming nature of the galaxy population of SMACS-PC-z7p7 suggests that environmental effects only become significant above halo masses of log_10(M_200c[M<sub>&odot;</sub>]) ≳ 11.5. Comparison to other z≳7 protoclusters reveals that vigorous star formation persists in lower-mass protoclusters, whereas accelerated evolution and suppression of star formation emerge in more massive haloes. SMACS-PC-z7p7 therefore represents an early stage of protocluster assembly, where residence within an overdense environment still enhances star formation, and feedback processes have yet to exert a significant influence.

<p>
We study the stellar mass function (SMF) of quiescent and star-forming galaxies and its dependence on morphology in 10 redshift bins at 0.2&lt;z&lt;5.5 using the COSMOS2025 catalog built from 0.54   deg<sup>2</sup> JWST imaging from COSMOS-Web. Galaxies are selected by type using the NUVrJ rest-frame color diagram and classified morphologically by bulge-to-total light ratio (B/T). The quiescent SMF shows rapid early build-up, with the most massive systems (log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≳11) assembled by z~1 and evolving little since. The star-forming SMF evolves more slowly, following a mass-evolution scenario where galaxies grow via star formation and quench at the characteristic mass log(M^*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)~10.6. Bulge systems (B/T&gt;0.6) dominate the quiescent SMF at log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&gt;10 at all redshifts, while disks (B/T&lt;0.2) dominate at log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;9. However, most bulge-dominated galaxies are star-forming, with their fraction increasing with redshift and decreasing mass, consistent with being progenitors of quiescent bulges. We find evidence for environmental quenching onset at z~3 from the upturn in the quiescent SMF at log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;9.5, contributed by disk-dominated galaxies consistent with satellite quenching that retains disk morphologies. Number densities of log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&gt;10 quiescent galaxies are lower than recent literature by 0.1-0.7 dex, but agree well with simulations at 2&lt;z&lt;3. At z&gt;3, simulations increasingly underpredict observations. Finally, we build an empirical model describing galaxy number density evolution by parametrizing quenching rates, baryon conversion efficiency, and bulge formation. Our model supports a scenario where star-forming galaxies grow central bulges before quenching in massive halos.

### 160) [2511.05113](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05113v1): Spatially-resolved PAH_3.3 emission and stellar ages in ram pressure stripped clumps at z~0.3

Ram pressure stripping (RPS) plays a crucial role in shaping galaxy evolution in dense environments, yet its impact on the molecular and dusty phases of the interstellar medium remains poorly understood. We present JWST/NIRCam 3.3 micrometres PAH emission maps for the nine most striking RPS galaxies in the Abell 2744 cluster at redshift z_cl = 0.306, tracing the effects of environmental processes on small dust grains. Exploiting multi-band JWST/NIRCam and HST photometry, we perform spatially-resolved UV to mid-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, characterising stellar populations in both galactic disks and clumps detected in the stripped tails. We detect PAH_3.3 mission in eight of the nine galaxies at 5 sigma, with morphologies revealing disk truncation and elongation along the RPS direction. In three galaxies, PAH_3.3 emission is also found in star-forming clumps embedded in the stripped tails up to a distance of 40 kpc. Star formation rates inferred from PAH_3.3 emission agree with those derived from SED fitting averaged over the past 100 Myr within an intrinsic scatter of 0.4 dex, but the relation appears to be age dependent. The spatial correlation between PAH strength, stellar age, and SFR - consistent across disks and tails - demonstrates that PAH-carrying molecules can survive and be stripped by ram pressure. Finally, age gradients revealed by the SED fitting provide the first observational evidence outside the Local Universe for the fireball model of star formation in stripped clumps. This work represents the first detailed study of PAH emission in cluster galaxies, offering new insights into the fate of dust and star formation in extreme environments.

### 161) [2511.04843](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04843v2): JWST provides a new view of cosmic dawn: latest developments in studies of early galaxies

<p> Jorryt Matthee </p>
<p>
Studies of the distant Universe are providing key insights into our understanding of the formation of galaxies. The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has significantly enhanced our observational capabilities, leading to an expanded redshift frontier, providing unprecedented detail in the characterization of early galaxies and enabling the discovery of new populations of accreting black holes. This review aims to provide an introduction to the basic processes and components that shape the observed spectra of galaxies, with a focus on their relevance to techniques with which high-redshift galaxies are selected. The review further introduces specific topics that have attracted significant attention in recent literature, including the discovery of highly efficient galaxy formation in the early Universe, the relation between galaxies and the process of reionization, new insights into the formation of the first stars and the enrichment of interstellar gas with heavy elements, and breakthroughs in our understanding of the origins of supermassive black holes.

<p> Alejandro Guzmán-Ortega, Gustavo Bruzual, Vicente Rodriguez-Gomez, Lars Hernquist </p>
<p>
We use the TNG50 cosmological simulation and three-dimensional radiative transfer post-processing to generate dust-aware synthetic observations of galaxies at 3 ≤ z ≤ 6 and log_10(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 8.5 , tailored to match the depth and resolution of current deep JWST surveys (NGDEEP and JADES). We analyse the performance of spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting on the simulated sample, focusing on the recovery of photometric redshift and stellar mass. At z ≤ 5 , we find that 90 per cent of redshifts are recovered within ±0.2 , but performance declines at z = 6 . Stellar masses are generally well-recovered within a factor of 2, but are systematically underestimated regardless of redshift, a trend that is more pronounced at the high-mass end ( log_10(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 10 ) . In addition, we study the observer-frame colours of galaxies in this redshift range as well as the SED-inferred UVJ diagram. We find that TNG50 galaxies broadly follow the tendencies marked by observations, but tend to be slightly redder at lower masses and bluer at higher masses, regardless of redshift. Finally, using a colour-based definition of quiescence, we determine the fraction of quiescent galaxies as a function of stellar mass at 3 ≤ z ≤ 6 , which we find to be broadly consistent with observations.

<p> Derek Perera, Daniel Gilman, Liliya L. R. Williams, Liang Dai, Xiaolong Du, Gregor Rihtarsic, Joaquin Becerra-Espinoza, Allison Keen </p>
<p>
Astrometric perturbations of lensed arcs behind galaxy clusters have been recently suggested as promising probes of small-scale (≲10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) dark matter substructure. Populations of cold dark matter (CDM) subhalos, predicted in hierarchical structure formation theory, can break the symmetry of arcs near the critical curve, leading to positional shifts in the observed images. We present a novel statistical method to constrain the average subhalo mass fraction (f_sub) in clusters that takes advantage of this induced positional asymmetry. Focusing on CDM, we extend a recent semi-analytic model of subhalo tidal evolution to accurately simulate realistic subhalos within a cluster-scale host. We simulate the asymmetry of lensed arcs from these subhalo populations using Approximate Bayesian Computation. Using mock data, we demonstrate that our method can reliably recover the simulated f_sub to within 68&percnt; CI in 73&percnt; of cases, regardless of the lens model, astrometric precision, and image morphology. We show that the constraining power of our method is optimized for larger samples of well observed arcs, ideal for recent JWST observations of cluster lenses. As a preliminary test, we apply our method to the MACSJ0416 Warhol arc and AS1063 System 1. For Warhol we constrain the upper limit on log f_sub &lt; -3.40^+1.06_-0.97, while for AS1063 System 1 we constrain log f_sub = -2.36^+0.56_-0.89 (both at 68&percnt; CI), consistent with CDM predictions. We elaborate on our method's limitations and its future potential to place stringent constraints on dark matter properties in cluster environments.

Recent observations from JWST have revealed unexpectedly luminous galaxies, exhibiting stellar masses and luminosities significantly higher than predicted by theoretical models at Cosmic Dawn. In this study, we present a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations targeting high-redshift (z ≥ 10) galaxies with dark matter halo masses in the range 10^10 - 10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z=10, using state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulation codes (Enzo, Ramses, Changa, Gadget-3, Gadget-4, and Gizmo). This study aims to evaluate the convergence of the participating codes and their reproducibility of high-redshift galaxies with the galaxy formation model calibrated at relatively low redshift, without additional physics for high-redshift environments. The subgrid physics follows the AGORA CosmoRun framework, with adjustments to resolution and initial conditions to emulate similar physical environments in the early universe. The participating codes show consistent results for key galaxy properties (e.g., stellar mass), but also reveal notable differences (e.g., metallicity), indicating that galaxy properties at high redshifts are highly sensitive to the feedback implementation of the simulation. Massive halos (M_halo≥5×10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z=10) succeed in reproducing observed stellar masses, metallicities, and UV luminosities at 10≤ z≤12 without requiring additional subgrid physics, but tend to underpredict those properties at higher redshift. We also find that varying the dust-to-metal ratio modestly affects UV luminosity of simulated galaxies, whereas the absence of dust significantly enhances it. In future work, higher-resolution simulations will be conducted to better understand the formation and evolution of galaxies at Cosmic Dawn.

### 165) [2511.04122](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04122v1): Neural Network identification of Dark Star Candidates. II. Spectroscopy

<p> Adiba Amira Siddiqa, Sayed Shafaat Mahmud, Cosmin Ilie </p>
<p>
Some of the first stars in the Universe might be powered by Dark Matter (DM) annihilations, rather than nuclear fusion. Those objects, i.e. Dark stars (DS), offer a unique window into understanding DM via the observational study of the formation and evolution of the first stars and their Black Hole (BH) remnants. In \citeNNSMDSPhot (Paper~I) we introduced a feedforward neural network (FFNN) trained on synthetic DS photometry in order to detect and characterize dark star  photometric candidates in the early universe based on data taken with the NIRCam instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). In this work we develop a FFNN trained on synthetic DS spectra in order to identify  spectroscopic dark star candidates in the data taken with JWST's NIRSpec instrument. In order to validate our FFNN model we apply it to real data for the four spectroscopic Supermassive Dark Star (SMDS) candidates recently identified in \citeilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar and reconfirm that indeed \JADESeleven, \JADESzthirteen, \JADESfz, and \JADESfo have spectra that are consistent with those of Supermassive Dark Stars. The main advantage of our FFNN model, in comparison to the Nedleaer-Mead Monte Carlo parameter estimator used in \citeilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar, is that the approach introduced here predicts parameters in milliseconds, over 10,000 times faster than the traditional method used in \citeilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar. With this in mind, the FFNN model we developed and validated in this work will be adapted for Bayesian uncertainty analyses and automatic analyses of NIRSpec publicly available data for high redshift objects. This study establishes a robust and efficient tool for probing Dark Stars and understanding their role in cosmic evolution.

### 166) [2511.04121](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04121v1): Neural Network identification of Dark Star Candidates. I. Photometry

<p> Sayed Shafaat Mahmud, Adiba Amira Siddiqa, Cosmin Ilie </p>
<p>
The formation of the first stars in the universe could be significantly impacted by the effects of Dark Matter (DM). Namely, if DM is in the form of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), it could lead to the formation (at z~ 25-10) of stars that are powered by DM annihilations alone, i.e. Dark Stars (DSs). Those objects can grow to become supermassive (M~ 10^6 \M<sub>&odot;</sub>) and shine as bright as a galaxy (L~ 10^8 \M<sub>&odot;</sub>). Using a simple χ^2 minimization, the first three DSs photometric candidates (i.e. \JADESeleven, \JADEStwelve, and \JADESzthirteen) were identified by \citeIlie:2023JADES. Our goal is to develop tools to streamline the identification of such candidates within the rather large publicly available high redshift JWST data sets. We present here the key first step in achieving this goal: the development and implementation of a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) search for Dark Star candidates, using data from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) photometric catalog. Our method reconfirms JADES-GS-z13 and JADES-GS-z11 as dark star candidates, based on the chi-squared goodness of fit test, yet they are ~10^4 times faster than the Neadler-Mead χ^2 minimization method used in \citeIlie:2023JADES. We further identify six  new photometric Dark Star candidates across redshifts z ~ 9 to z ~ 14. These findings underscore the power of neural networks in modeling non-linear relationships and efficiently analyzing large-scale photometric surveys, advancing the search for Dark Stars.

### 167) [2511.03802](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03802v1): Making the most of pure parallels: Machine learning augmented photometric redshifts for sparse JWST filter sets

<p> Kenneth J. Duncan </p>
<p>
Photometric redshifts (photo-zs) are an essential tool for galaxy evolution science with JWST. However, for deep surveys with more limited filter sets (i.e. N_filt ~6) such as large pure parallel surveys, the most commonly used template-fitting based photo-z approaches can yield highly confident but spurious results for high-z populations of interest. The utility and legacy value of these datasets could therefore be negatively impacted. To address this challenge, we present an application of machine learning (ML) based photo-z techniques to deep JWST photometric datasets. We employ two different ML algorithms, using Gaussian processes and nearest-neighbour estimates, alongside a more standard template fitting approach. We show that simple nearest-neighbour based estimates can provide more accurate photo-zs than template fitting out to z~8, as well as reducing the fraction of catastrophic outliers by a factor of ~2-3. Additionally, `hybrid' estimates combining template and ML can yield further improvements in overall accuracy and reliability while retaining some ability to predict photo-z out to z &gt; 10. The nearest-neighbour only or hybrid estimates can achieve photo-zs with robust scatter of σ_NMAD~0.03-0.04 and outlier fractions of ~3-10&percnt; between 0 &lt; z ≲ 8 from just 6 NIRCam bands, with negligible additional computational costs compared to standard template fitting. Our methodology is easily adaptable to alternative datasets, filter combinations or training samples. Overall, our results highlight the potential for even simple ML techniques to enhance the scientific return of JWST pure parallel and wide-area surveys.

### 168) [2511.03787](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03787v1): Probing the dawn of galaxies: star formation and feedback in the JWST era through the GAEA model

<p> Sebastiano Cantarella, Gabriella De Lucia, Fabio Fontanot, Michaela Hirschmann, Lizhi Xie, Maximilien Franco, Adèle Plat </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telecope (JWST) opened a new window for the study of the highest redshift (z&gt;7) Universe. This work presents a theoretical investigation of the very-high redshift Universe using the state-of-the-art GALaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) model, run on merger trees from the Planck-Millennium N-body simulation. We show that GAEA successfully reproduces a wide range of high-z observational estimates including: the galaxy stellar mass function up to z~13 and the total (galaxies and AGN) UV luminosity function (LF) up to z~10. We find that the AGN UV emission represents an important contribution at the bright end of the UVLF up to z~8, but it is negligible at higher redshift. Our model reproduces well the observed mass-metallicity relation at z≤4, while it slightly overestimates the normalization of the relation at earlier cosmic epochs. At z≥11, current UVLF estimates are at least one order of magnitude larger than model predictions. We investigate the impact of different physical mechanisms, such as an enhanced star formation efficiency coupled with a reduced stellar feedback or a negligible stellar feedback at z&gt;10. In the framework of our model, both the galaxy stellar mass and UV luminosity functions at z≥10 can be explained by assuming feedback-free starbursts in high-density molecular clouds. However, we show that this model variant leads to a slight increase of the normalization of the z≥10 mass-metallicity relation, strengthening the tension with available data. A model with negligible stellar feedback at z&gt;10 also predicts larger numbers of massive and bright galaxies aligning well with observations, but it also overestimates the metallicity of the interstellar medium. We show that these model variants can in principle be discriminated using the relation between the star formation rate and galaxy stellar mass.

### 169) [2511.03681](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03681v1): Only Nitrogen-Enhanced Galaxies Have Detectable UV Nitrogen Emission Lines at High Redshift

<p> Peixin Zhu, Lisa J. Kewley, Tiger Yu-Yang Hsiao, James Trussler </p>
<p>
The detections of bright UV nitrogen emission lines in some high-redshift galaxies suggest unexpectedly high nitrogen-to-oxygen ratios (log(N/O)≳-1.0) compared to local values (log(N/O)≳-1.5) at similar metallicities (12+log(O/H)≲8.0). Although the presence of these `N-enhanced' galaxies indicates signatures of atypical chemical enrichment processes in the early universe, the prevalence of nitrogen enhancement in high-z galaxies is unclear. So far, only ~10 z&gt;5 galaxies have nitrogen abundance measurements, and they all suggest elevated N/O ratios. Do all high-redshift galaxies exhibit elevated N/O ratios, or are we simply missing `N-normal' galaxies whose nitrogen abundances follow the local N/O scaling relation? To tackle these questions, we calculate the detection limits of UV NIII] or NIV] lines in current JWST surveys CEERS and JADES, and compare them to predictions from both `N-enhanced' and `N-normal' AGN narrow-line region and H II region photoionization models. We find that CEERS can only detect galaxies with significant nitrogen enhancement (log(N/O)≳-0.4), while JADES can only detect galaxies with moderately elevated N/O ratios compared to local values (log(N/O)≳-1.0). Even for the deepest exposure in JADES, UV nitrogen lines produced by `N-normal' galaxies at z&gt;5 are too faint and thus not detectable, making their nitrogen abundance unmeasurable. Our results suggest that the existing sample of galaxies with measurable nitrogen abundances at z≳5 is incomplete and biased toward galaxies with significantly elevated N/O ratios. Deep (t_exp~40-500 hours) spectroscopic surveys will be crucial for building a complete sample to study nitrogen enrichment mechanisms in the early universe.

<p> Aurora Wilde, Marcel Neeleman, Romain Meyer, Roberto Decarli, Fabian Walter, Brenda Frye, Xiaohui Fan </p>
<p>
We present a study determining the spatial offset between the position of the supermassive black hole (as traced through their broad line regions) and the host galaxy in six z &gt; 6 quasars. We determined the host galaxy's position from ≲0.1^&Prime; (≲ 600 pc) resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) [CII] 158 μm and corresponding dust continuum imaging. We determined the quasar's position from ≲ 400 pc resolution James Webb Space Telescope Near-Infrared Camera (JWST NIRCam) imaging. We estimated the observational uncertainties on the quasar's position using astrometric data from the Global Astrometric Interferometer for Astrophysics (GAIA) of field stars within the NIRCam images. We find that all six quasars are found within the central ~ 400 pc of their host galaxy dust continuum and [CII] emission. Apparent offsets seen in rest-frame optical JWST observations are not detected in our ALMA data, suggesting they likely result from dust obscuration rather than a true physical separation between the SMBH and its host galaxy. Kinematic modeling of these data further reveals that none of the galaxies show evidence for recent merger activity, and most of the galaxies can be accurately modeled using a simple disk model. The lack of an offset supports theoretical models that predict that positional offset within these galaxies are either short-lived or intrinsically rare.

### 171) [2511.02906](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02906v1): Dark Secrets of Baryons: Illuminating Dark Matter-Baryon Interactions with JWST

<p> Souradeep Das, Ranjini Mondol, Abhijeet Singh, Ranjan Laha </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered numerous bright galaxies at high redshifts (z≈ 10 &ndash; 14). Many astrophysical models and beyond the Standard Model physics scenarios have been proposed to explain these observations. We investigate, for the first time, the implications of dark matter (DM) scattering with baryons (protons and electrons) in light of the JWST UV luminosity function (UVLF) observations. These interactions suppress structure formation on galactic scales, which may have an observable effect on the UVLF measurements at high redshifts. Using a recent galaxy formation model designed to explain high-redshift observations, we obtain strong upper limits on DM-baryon scattering cross-sections and explore new regions of the parameter space. For DM-proton scattering with cross-section &prop; v^-2 velocity dependence, we obtain the strongest limit for DM masses of ~ 1 &ndash; 500 MeV. For other cases that we study (DM-proton scattering cross-section &prop; v^0, v^-4, and DM-electron scattering cross-section &prop; v^0, v^-2, v^-4), our limits are competitive with those obtained from other cosmological observables. Our study highlights the potential of JWST observations as a novel and powerful probe of non-gravitational interactions of DM.

<p>
The presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs, M_BH~10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) at z&gt;7 remains a puzzle. While their existence appears to require exotic formation or growth processes, it is possible that BH mass estimates are incorrect due to differences from the low-z quasars where BH mass scaling relations are calibrated. In this work, we employ JWST MIRI-MRS spectroscopy to measure the rest-frame optical/IR properties of the four highest-redshift known luminous type-1 quasars at 7.08≤ z&lt;7.64. We use three new broad lines to measure updated BH masses, Hα, Paα and Paβ, finding them to be in the range (4-15)\cdot10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Our black hole mass estimates from all tracers agree with each other and with previous, less accurate, ground-based measurements based on MgII. The flux ratios of the H lines deviate from expectations for case A and B recombination in the same way as in z&lt;3 quasars, indicating similar physical conditions in the Broad Line Region. Rest-frame near-IR continuum emission from a hot dusty torus surrounding the accretion disc is unambiguously detected in all four objects. We model the emission with SKIRTOR and constrain the inclination (face-on) and the opening angle (θ=40-60&deg;) of the tori. These constraints are consistent for the four objects and with expectations from luminous quasars. We estimate a total dust mass (1-4)\cdot10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> in the tori, corresponding to (0.2-7)&percnt; of the total dust in the quasar host galaxies. Given observed accretion rates, these SMBHs will deplete their tori in only ~5 Myr. Overall, we confirm that z&gt;7 SMBHs in quasars could not have grown from stellar-remnant BHs if the radiative efficiency of accretion is 10&percnt;. We also find no evidence that inferred BH masses and accretion processes in z&gt;7 quasars differ significantly from their near-identical counterparts at z&lt;3.

<p>
We present an analysis of the gas-phase mass-metallicity relationship (MZR) and fundamental metallicity relationship (FMR) for 65 star-forming galaxies at 2 &lt; z &lt; 8 from the JWST/EXCELS survey. We calculate gas-phase metallicities (12 + log(O/H)) using strong-line calibrations explicitly tested against the EXCELS sample, and report direct-method metallicities for 25 galaxies. Our sample spans 8.1&lt;log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;10.3 in stellar mass and 0&lt;log(SFR/M<sub>&odot;</sub>   yr^-1)&lt;2 in star-formation rate, consistent with typical main-sequence star-forming galaxies at the same redshifts. We find a clear MZR at both 2&lt;z&lt;4 (&langle; z &rangle; = 3.2) and 4&lt;z&lt;8 (&langle; z &rangle; = 5.5), with consistent slopes and mild evolution in normalization of ≃ 0.1   dex, matching trends from simulations and recent observations. Our results demonstrate rapid gas-phase enrichment in the early Universe, with galaxies at fixed mass reaching ≃ 50 per cent of their present-day metallicity by z ≃ 3 (within the first ≃ 15 per cent of cosmic time). We find tentative evidence for SFR-dependence in the MZR scatter, though the results remain inconclusive and highlight the need for larger high-redshift samples. Comparison with locally derived FMRs reveals a clear offset consistent with other z &gt; 3 studies. We discuss potential drivers of this offset, noting that high-redshift samples have significantly different physical properties compared to local samples used to define the z=0 FMR. Our results confirm that low-mass, high specific star-formation rate galaxies common at high redshift are inconsistent with the equilibrium conditions underlying the local FMR, and highlight the rapid chemical enrichment at early cosmic epochs.

The AXIS Community Science Book represents the collective effort of more than 500 scientists worldwide to define the transformative science enabled by the Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), a next-generation X-ray mission selected by NASA's Astrophysics Probe Program for Phase A study. AXIS will advance the legacy of high-angular-resolution X-ray astronomy with ~1.5'' imaging over a wide 24' field of view and an order of magnitude greater collecting area than Chandra in the 0.3-12 keV band. Combining sharp imaging, high throughput, and rapid response capabilities, AXIS will open new windows on virtually every aspect of modern astrophysics, exploring the birth and growth of supermassive black holes, the feedback processes that shape galaxies, the life cycles of stars and exoplanet environments, and the nature of compact stellar remnants, supernova remnants, and explosive transients. This book compiles over 140 community-contributed science cases developed by five Science Working Groups focused on AGN and supermassive black holes, galaxy evolution and feedback, compact objects and supernova remnants, stellar physics and exoplanets, and time-domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. Together, these studies establish the scientific foundation for next-generation X-ray exploration in the 2030s and highlight strong synergies with facilities of the 2030s, such as JWST, Roman, Rubin/LSST, SKA, ALMA, ngVLA, and next-generation gravitational-wave and neutrino networks.

### 175) [2510.27332](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27332v1): Jacobi capture as a pathway to off-center massive black hole binaries in dwarf galaxies

<p> Thibaut L. François </p>
<p>
The recent detection of high-redshift supermassive black holes with JWST has renewed interest in the processes driving black hole growth. At the same time, both simulations and observations point to a widespread population of off-center intermediate-mass black holes in dwarf galaxies. Their ability to merge outside galactic centers may play a key role in shaping black hole mass assembly. Here, we investigate the dynamics of off-center black holes in dwarf galaxies hosting cored dark matter haloes, where long dynamical friction timescales and core stalling naturally arise. By embedding off-center black holes into an idealized galactic potential and scanning a wide range of orbital configurations, we assess the likelihood of close interactions through Jacobi capture. We find that captures occur in about 13% of cases. Such captures, possibly sustained within compact stellar systems like stripped nuclei or globular clusters, represent a crucial first step toward assembling massive black hole binaries beyond galactic centers.

### 176) [2510.27300](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27300v1): Fluorine Evolution in the Galactic Halo

<p> Valeria Grisoni, Federico Rizzuti, Gabriele Cescutti </p>
<p>
The chemical evolution of fluorine is still a matter of debate in Galactic archaeology, especially at low metallicities, where it is particularly challenging to obtain the corresponding chemical abundances from observations. We present here the first detailed theoretical study of the chemical evolution of fluorine at low metallicity by means of a stochastic chemical evolution model for the Galactic halo, in light of the most recent data for fluorine, which further pushed observations to lower metallicities down to [Fe/H]~-4 dex, more than a factor of 10 lower in metallicity than previous detections. We employ a state-of-the-art stochastic chemical evolution model to follow the evolution in the Galactic halo, which has been shown to reproduce well the main observables in this Galactic component and the abundance patterns of CNO and neutron-capture elements, and we implement nucleosynthesis prescriptions for fluorine, focusing on the chemical evolution of this element. By comparing recent observations with model predictions, we confirm the importance of rotating massive stars at low metallicities to explain both the [F/Fe] vs [Fe/H] and [F/O] vs [O/H] diagrams. In particular, we showed that we can reach high [F/Fe]~2 dex at [Fe/H]~-4 dex, in agreement with recent observations at the lowest metallicity. With a stochastic chemical evolution model for the Galactic halo, we confirm the importance of rotating massive stars as fluorine producers, as hinted by previous studies using chemical evolution models for the Galactic disc. We also expect an important production of F at high redshift, in agreement with recent detections of supersolar N by JWST. Further data for fluorine at low metallicities and also at high redshift would be needed to put further constraints on the chemical evolution of fluorine and be compared to our theoretical predictions.

### 177) [2510.27214](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27214v1): AGN&ndash;Host Galaxy Image Decomposition with JWST

<p> Callum Dewsnap, Pauline Barmby, Sarah C. Gallagher </p>
<p>
The ability to disentangle the light of an AGN from its host galaxy is strongly dependent on the spatial resolution and depth of the imaging. As the capabilities of imaging systems improve with time, confirming that our standard techniques adequately model the increasingly complex structures unveiled is essential. With JWST providing unprecedented image quality, we can test how measurements of galaxy morphology vary with the choice of point-spread function (PSF) and fitting software. We perform two-component Sérsic+PSF fits of the surface brightness profiles of 87 X-ray AGNs (0.1 &lt; z &lt; 4) from the CEERS survey. We create model PSFs for NIRCam F115W imaging using both photutils and PSFEx. We find that PSFEx models consistently fail to match the radial profile of typical point sources within our sample. We then perform AGN&ndash;host decompositions on each source by creating Sérsic+PSF models using both Galfit and AstroPhot. We find that Galfit and AstroPhot converge to different regions of the parameter space, providing consistently differing host galaxy properties. While we can measure the AGN and host magnitudes accurately, we find that the host galaxy morphological parameters are not well-determined &ndash; the Sérsic index and effective radius are strongly covariant. Significant changes in the host galaxy parameters do not correspond to changes in the statistical quality of fit, nor to significant changes in the model's radial profile. These results indicate that the Sérsic profile does not uniquely well-represent typical AGN host galaxies in extragalactic survey fields. We also provide recommendations for studies of AGN hosts comparable to ours.

<p> Nicolò Dalmasso, Peter J. Watson, Tommaso Treu, Michele Trenti, Benedetta Vulcani, Themiya Nanayakkara, Maruša Bradač, Tucker Jones, Kristan Boyett, Xin Wang, Sara Mascia, Laura Pentericci </p>
<p>
We analyze JWST NIRISS and NIRSpec spectroscopic observations in the Abell 2744 galaxy cluster field. From approximately 120 candidates, we identify 12 objects with at least a prominent emission lines among \Oii, \Hb, \Oiiia, \Oiiib, and \Ha that are spectroscopically confirmed by both instruments. Our key findings reveal systematic differences between the two spectrographs based on source morphology and shutter aperture placement. Compact objects show comparable or higher integrated flux in NIRSpec relative to NIRISS (within 1σ uncertainties), while extended sources consistently display higher flux in NIRISS measurements. This pattern reflects NIRSpec's optimal coverage for compact objects while potentially undersampling extended sources. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that NIRSpec recovers at least 63&percnt; of NIRISS-measured flux when the slit covers &gt;15&percnt; of the source or when R_e&lt;1kpc. For lower coverage or larger effective radii, the recovered flux varies from 24&percnt; to 63&percnt;. When studying the \Ha/\Oiiib emission line ratio, we observe that measurements from these different spectrographs can vary by up to ~0.3 dex, with significant implications for metallicity and star formation rate characterizations for individual galaxies. These results highlight the importance of considering instrumental effects when combining multi-instrument spectroscopic data and demonstrate that source morphology critically influences flux recovery between slit-based and slitless spectroscopic modes in JWST observations.

<p> Mainak Singha, Sangeeta Malhotra, James Ely Rhoads </p>
<p>
The origin of the ionizing photons that completed hydrogen reionization remains debated. Using recent JWST and ground-based surveys at 4.5 ≤ z ≤ 6.5, we construct a unified rest-UV AGN luminosity function that separates unobscured Type I and obscured Type II populations, and show that "little red dots" and X-ray selected sources are magnitude-filtered subsets of Type I with a mixture fraction eta = 0.10 +/- 0.02. We anchor the Lyman-continuum (LyC) escape fraction to outflow incidence and geometric clearing rather than assuming quasar-like values for all classes, and propagate uncertainties through a joint fit. Integrating over -27 &lt; M_UV &lt; -17, AGN inject Ndot<sub>ion</sub>,AGN = (3.77 +1.08/-0.95) x 10^51 s<sup>-1</sup> Mpc^-3, nearly twice earlier estimates and comparable to the Ly-alpha inferred requirement at z ~ 6. When combined with the JWST galaxy UV luminosity function and a harder stellar ionizing efficiency of log10(xi<sub>ion</sub>) = 25.7, AGN contribute 31-75% of the total ionizing photons for representative galaxy escape fractions f<sub>esc</sub>,gal = 0.03-0.20. The resulting hydrogen photoionization rate, Gamma_HI ~ (0.5-2) x 10^-12 s<sup>-1</sup> at z ~ 5-6, lies squarely within the Ly-alpha forest constraints once mean free paths and IGM clumpiness are accounted for, remaining consistent for combined AGN-galaxy models up to f<sub>esc</sub>,gal ≤ 5%. These results suggest that AGN and galaxies jointly sustained the ionizing background during the final stages of reionization, with AGN remaining a major but not exclusive contributor.

### 180) [2510.26970](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26970v1): A Critical Examination of the PAH Hypothesis

<p> Alan T. Tokunaga, Lawrence S. Bernstein, Takashi Onaka </p>
<p>
The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) hypothesis proposes that the aromatic infrared bands (AIBs) observed at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3, and 12.7 mic originate from gas-phase PAH molecules. These bands exhibit consistent peak wavelengths and profiles in diverse sources, and ISO SWS and JWST spectra show a nearly identical red wing of the 3.3 mic AIB and blue wing of the 11.2 mic AIB in the dominant Class A sources. This spectral uniformity suggests that the AIBs arise from a small, well-defined set of gas phase PAH species, regardless of the excitation conditions or the nature of the source such as HII regions, reflection nebulae, planetary nebula, young stellar objects, or the diffuse interstellar medium. However, a small number of gas phase PAH species is inconsistent with current modeling of the AIBs that require a wide range of PAH types and sizes. It is also inconsistent with the lack of observed UV and optical absorption bands from gas phase PAH molecules. Furthermore, there is no plausible formation pathway to produce only a small number of specific PAH molecules in the interstellar medium. These issues require quantitative investigation in order to definitively establish gas-phase PAH molecules as the carrier of the AIBs.

### 181) [2510.26884](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26884v1): Constraining the AGN tori at cosmic noon using high-resolution JWST imaging and simultaneous SED fitting

<p> Devang H. Liya, David J. Rosario, Matthaios Charidis </p>
<p>
There is evidence for significant evolution in the gaseous and dust properties of galaxies since the era of cosmic noon (1≲ z≲ 2.5). The well known co-evolution of supermassive black holes with their host galaxies suggests a constant connection between the small-scale (nuclear) and large-scale regions of galaxies. A fundamental component of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is the "torus", a dense, dusty structure that acts as the interface between the accretion disc and the ISM of the host galaxy. The transitional nature of the torus makes it a prime subject to search for evolution since cosmic noon. We use high-resolution near- and mid-IR imaging from the JWST CEERS program to disentangle the emission from the torus in unprecedented detail for 88 X-ray selected AGN at z~2. We employ a novel SED fitting technique that combines archival low-resolution multi-band photometry at UV to FIR wavelengths with the new high-resolution JWST photometry to constrain essential AGN and torus parameters, such as accretion disc luminosity, torus opening angle, and inclination angle. We demonstrate that this SED fitting approach leads to better AGN characterisation and tighter constraints on AGN parameters. The population-level analysis finds that the Covering Fraction (CF) distribution peaks at ≈0.25 with a long tail towards higher CF. Despite the well-known evolution of the ISM and structural properties of AGN hosts to these redshifts, the CF distribution of our sample does not show any strong statistical difference with that found in local AGN of equivalent luminosity, or with those at intermediate redshifts.

<p>
We present combined JWST NIRSpec and MIRI/MRS integral field spectroscopy data of the nuclear and circumnuclear regions of the highly dust obscured Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 7582, which is part of the sample of AGN in the Galaxy Activity, Torus and Outflow Survey (GATOS). Spatially resolved analysis of the pure rotational H<sub>2</sub> lines (S(1)-S(7)) reveals a characteristic power-law temperature distribution in different apertures, with the two prominent southern star-forming regions exhibiting unexpectedly high molecular gas temperatures, comparable to those in the AGN powered nuclear region. We investigate potential heating mechanisms including direct AGN photoionisation, UV fluorescent excitation from young star clusters, and shock excitation. We find that shock heating gives the most plausible explanation, consistent with multiple near- and mid-IR tracers and diagnostics. Using photoionisation models from the PhotoDissociation Region Toolbox, we quantify the ISM conditions in the different regions, determining that the southern star-forming regions have a high density (n_H ~ 10^5 cm^-3) and are irradiated by a moderate UV radiation field (G_0 ~ 10^3 Habing). Fitting a suite of Paris-Durham shock models to the rotational H<sub>2</sub> lines, as well as rovibrational 1-0 S(1), 1-0 S(2), and 2-1 S(1) H<sub>2</sub> emission lines, we find that a slow (v_s ~ 10 km/s) C-type shock is likely responsible for the elevated temperatures. Our analysis loosely favours local starburst activity as the driver of the shocks and circumnuclear gas dynamics in NGC 7582, though the possibility of an AGN jet contribution cannot be excluded.

### 183) [2510.26308](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26308v1): Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS: Evidence for Galactic Cosmic Ray Processing

<p> R. Maggiolo, F. Dhooghe, G. Gronoff, J. de Keyser, G. Cessateur </p>
<p>
Spectral observations of 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) with JWST/NIRSpec and SPHEREx reveal an extreme CO2 enrichment (CO2/H2O = 7.6+-0.3) that is 4.5 sigma above solar system comet trends and among the highest ever recorded. This unprecedented composition, combined with substantial absolute CO levels (CO/H2O = 1.65+-0.09) and red spectral slopes, provides direct evidence for galactic cosmic ray (GCR) processing of the outer layers of the interstellar comet nucleus. Laboratory experiments demonstrate that GCR irradiation efficiently converts CO to CO2 while synthesizing organic-rich crusts, suggesting that the outer layers of 3I/ATLAS consist of irradiated material which properties are consistent with the observed composition of 3I/ATLAS coma and with its observed spectral reddening. Estimates of the erosion rate of 3I/ATLAS indicate that current outgassing samples the GCR-processed zone only (depth ~15-20 m), never reaching pristine interior material. Outgassing of pristine material after perihelion remains possible, though it is considered unlikely. This represents a paradigm shift: long-residence interstellar objects primarily reveal GCR-processed material rather than pristine material representative of their primordial formation environments. With 3I/ATLAS approaching perihelion in October 2025, immediate follow-up observations are critical to confirm this interpretation and establish GCR processing as a fundamental evolutionary pathway for interstellar objects.

### 184) [2510.25950](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25950v1): Lyman-α radiation pressure regulates star formation efficiency

<p> D. Manzoni, A. Ferrara </p>
<p>
Order-unity star formation efficiencies (SFE) in early galaxies may explain the overabundance of bright galaxies observed by JWST at high redshift. Here we show that Lyman-α (Lyα) radiation pressure limits the gas mass converted into stars, particularly in primordial environments. We develop a shell model including Lyα feedback, and validate it with one-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. To account for Lyα resonant scattering, we adopt the most recent force multiplier fits, including the effect of Lyα photon destruction by dust grains. We find that, independently of their gas surface density Σ_g, clouds are disrupted on a timescale shorter than a free-fall time, and even before supernova explosions if Σ_g ≳ 10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> pc^-2. At log(Z/Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) = -2, relevant for high-redshift galaxies, the SFE is 0.01 ≲ \hatε_* ≲ 0.66 for 10^3 ≲Σ_g [M<sub>&odot;</sub> pc^-2] ≲ 10^5. The SFE is even lower for decreasing metallicity. Near-unity SFEs are possible only for extreme surface densities, Σ_g ≳ 10^5M<sub>&odot;</sub> pc^-2, and near-solar metallicities. We conclude that Lyα radiation pressure severely limits a possible extremely efficient, feedback-free phase of star formation in dense, metal-poor clouds.

### 185) [2510.25848](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25848v1): Spiral Structure Diversity in Milky Way Analogs from TNG50: The Role of Gas and Disk Dynamics

<p> Soumavo Ghosh, Elena D'Onghia </p>
<p>
The generation of spiral arms and the mechanisms controlling their properties within a realistic cosmological framework - the complete understanding is still beyond our grasp. Using a statistically significant sample of Milky Way- and Andromeda-like (MW/M31) analogs from the high-resolution TNG50 cosmological simulation, we carry out the first systematic investigation of spiral-arm formation, their observable properties, and the underlying physical drivers. The selected analogs predominantly exhibit two-armed (m = 2) spirals in both stars and gas, while the gaseous disks often display stronger, more tightly wound, and multi-armed patterns (m&gt;2). Spiral features appear across stellar populations of different ages, confirming their density-wave nature and producing coherent spirals in both metallicity and mean stellar age distributions-consistent with recent Gaia observations of the Milky Way. Our analysis reveals a diverse dynamical scenario for spiral generation: gas content, disk coldness, and shear jointly regulate the growth and morphology of spiral perturbations. We find that the gas content and the dynamical coldness of the disk jointly regulate spiral growth: galaxies with higher gas fractions and colder disks develop more prominent spirals. The measured relation between spiral pitch angle and disk shear shows significant scatter around the analytic prediction, likely due to the combined influence of bars, gas inflows, and feedback. These results demonstrate that spiral density waves can persist in fully cosmological disks, linking internal dynamical processes to galaxy assembly and offering testable predictions for present and future surveys such as JWST and Roman.

Silverman, Takumi S. Tanaka, Bei You, Hassen M. Yesuf, Jorge A. Zavala </p>
<p>
Recent JWST observations have revealed a population of red, compact, high-redshift objects called 'Little Red Dots'(LRD), whose host components have remained largely unconstrained, possibly due to their extreme compactness. Current morphological studies have been limited by small samples, as well as by insufficient imaging depth, which may not allow reliable separation between point-like and extended components, leaving the existence and properties of extended components in LRD largely unconstrained. Here, we perform the image stacking analysis of 217 LRDs in four NIRCam bands, representing the largest and homogeneous sample observed from COSMOS-Web survey to date. Our results reveal an unambiguous detection of faint extended emission in the F444W band, with a typical size of ~200 parsecs and magnitude of ~27.7 AB at z~6.5. We perform four-band photometric SED fitting based on galaxy templates and derive a stellar mass of 8.91+-~0.1 logM_sun. Given this stellar mass, the host galaxy is compact, i.e., ~2.5 times smaller than star-forming populations at similar mass, and the typical black hole mass of LRDs is elevated by ~1.5 dex above the local MBH-M<sub>&sext;</sub> relation. This work provides direct observational evidence for the existence of LRD host galaxies and offers crucial insights into the growth of the host galaxy and the co-evolution of galaxies and their black holes within the first billion years after the Big Bang.

<p>
We present analysis of JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec observations of the galaxy SXDF-NB1006-2 at z = 7.212, as part of the Reionization and the ISM/Stellar Origins with JWST and ALMA (RIOJA) project. We derive the physical properties by conducting spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, revealing that our target is a young (age ~2 Myr) starburst galaxy with intense radiation field. We detect multiple nebular emission lines from NIRSpec IFS data. We identify a robust broad component of [O III]&lambda;5008 emission, indicating the presence of ionized gas outflows. The derived gas depletion time of a few hundred Myr implies that our target could be one of the progenitors of massive quiescent galaxies at z~4-5 identified by recent JWST observations. The spatial distribution of optical and far-infrared (FIR) [O III] emission lines differs in morphology, likely resulting from different critical densities and inhomogeneous density distributions within the galaxy. Potential old stellar populations may be necessary to account for the derived metallicity of ~0.2 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>, and their presence can be confirmed by future MIRI observations. Including our target, star-forming galaxies at z&gt;6 detected by ALMA are generally very young but more massive and brighter in UV than galaxies identified by only JWST. The ALMA-detected galaxies may also have a steeper mass-metallicity relation. These findings suggest that the ALMA-detected galaxies may have experienced more efficient mass assembly processes in their evolutionary pathways.

<p>
We investigate the properties of extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) at z=4-9 and their role in reionization. Compact, low-mass galaxies with intense optical emission lines are linked to elevated specific star formation rates (sSFRs) and recent bursts of star formation. Feedback in these systems may enable the leakage of ionizing radiation into the intergalactic medium. Using JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy from the CAPERS, CEERS, and RUBIES surveys, we compile 160 NIRCam-selected EELGs in the EGS field. These galaxies show extreme rest-frame equivalent widths (EWs), with a median EW([O III]+Hβ)=1616Å and EW(Hα)=763Å. They are low-mass (median log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=8.26) with high sSFRs (median 43 Gyr^-1), above the z~6 main sequence. UV slopes are diverse, with a mean β=-2.0, and only 7% have extremely blue continua (β&lt;-2.6). Emission-line diagnostics suggest stellar populations as the primary ionizing source, although an AGN fraction of 14% is found. These galaxies are efficient ionizing photon producers, with mean log(ξ<sub>ion</sub> [Hz erg^-1])=25.34, exceeding typical values at similar redshifts. Escape fractions, however, are heterogeneous: 9% of EELGs show escape fractions &gt;10% for both Lyα and LyC photons, while 82% lack detectable Lyα emission. The median inferred LyC escape fraction is modest (4.4%) but enhanced in super-Eddington systems with sSFR &gt;25 Gyr^-1. The galaxies are extremely compact, with a median effective radius of 0.49 kpc, and exhibit a recent star-formation burst. Our analysis indicates that sSFR and star-formation rate surface density are the primary drivers of their extreme emission line strengths.

### 189) [2510.25383](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25383v1): Rapid bulge assembly in young galaxy disks at Cosmic Dawn

<p> Anshuman Borgohain, Kanak Saha </p>
<p>
Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have begun to reveal a surprising morphological diversity in galaxies within the first billion years after the Big Bang, including indications of structural maturity previously thought to arise much later. These findings raise fundamental questions about when and how well-known structural components of galaxy morphology, such as bulges and disks, first emerged. However, directly identifying and resolving such structures at z &gt; 6 remains challenging due to limited spatial resolution and sensitivity. In this work, we present a clear and robust morphological analysis of a sample of 190 galaxies at z ≥ 6, demonstrating that distinct bulge and disk components were already beginning to emerge during this early epoch. Using multi-component light profile fitting, we model the radial brightness distributions of a subset (20) of galaxies with an inner spheroidal (Sersic) component and an underlying exponential disk. These systems exhibit high bulge-to-total (B/T) light ratios (~ 0.47) and central stellar mass surface densities (~ 2.82*10^8 M_sun kpc^-2 ) - values close to those of nearby quiescent galaxies. Combined with their intense central star formation rate surface densities (~ 1.26*10^1 M_sun yr^-1 kpc^-2 ), our results indicate a rapid building of inner stellar mass and bulge assembly within these young systems. We propose that these early bulge-disk galaxies represent progenitors of massive star-forming and quiescent systems observed at lower redshifts. Their subsequent evolution may proceed through physical processes such as disk growth, compaction, quenching, or bulge-disk co-evolution, driven by both internal dynamics and external interactions.

At low redshift, massive quiescent galaxies (MQGs) are most frequently found in massive, rich galaxy clusters, but at high redshift the trend is less clear. Here, we present spectroscopic evidence of the effects of environment on the formation and assembly of high-redshift MQGs. We identify 25 (5) log (M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>≥10.5 (10.0≤log (M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>&lt;10.5) spectroscopically-confirmed quiescent galaxies in the UDS and EGS fields at 3&lt;z&lt;5 with NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy from RUBIES and other public JWST NIRSpec programs. We measure the density contrast in these fields by applying a Monte Carlo Voronoi Tesselation density mapping technique to photometric and spectroscopic redshifts of m_F444W&lt;27.5 sources. We robustly detect 12 massive overdense peaks with log (M_Peak/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≥13 and six extended massive protoclusters (log (M_Struct/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≥13.85). We observe that MQGs are preferentially found in these massive peaks and within these massive structures: ≈50&percnt; of MQGs are found in massive peaks, compared to ≈20&percnt; of massive star forming galaxies (MSFGs) and ≈15&percnt; of the overall spectroscopically-confirmed population. We also find an apparent dependence on both quiescent galaxy mass and environment, with 75&percnt; of the most massive (log (M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>≥10.75) residing inside overdense peaks. We compare the star formation histories (SFHs) of the MQGs with the high-redshift galaxy stellar mass function from observations and simulated quiescent galaxies at z&gt;5, finding that the masses from the inferred MQG SFHs regularly exceed either observed or simulated high-redshift galaxies, which suggests indicates that mergers and ex-situ star formation play a key role in the mass assembly of MQGs in overdense environments.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) Time-Domain Field (TDF) has been monitored by NuSTAR and XMM-Newton with a regular cadence for five years starting in 2019. The survey has accumulated 3.5Ms of NuSTAR exposure and 228 ks quasi-simultaneous XMM-Newton observations covering 0.31 deg<sup>2</sup>. This paper presents the results from the most recent two-years' 2Ms NuSTAR and 166 ks XMM observations in NuSTAR cycles 8 and 9. These observations reached a 20%-area flux of 2.20 x 10^-14 erg cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> in the 8-24 keV band. 75 NuSTAR sources and 274 XMM-Newton sources are detected at 99% reliability level. The logN-logS measured in cycles 8+9 are consistent with those measured in the previous cycle 5+6 NuSTAR NEP survey, but in a larger area (0.3 deg<sup>2</sup> compared with 0.19 deg<sup>2</sup>). The slope of the cycles 8+9 8-24 keV logN-logS curve is flatter than other works (α89 = 1.13 +/- 0.46), but is consistent with the Euclidean value of α = 1.50. In addition, we found ~36% of the NuSTAR sources to be heavily obscured (NH ≥ 10^23 cm<sup>2</sup>). The Compton-thick (NH ≥ 10^24 cm<sup>2</sup>) (CT-) AGN fraction is 9+18-8% in the NEP-TDF, which is consistent with the measurements in previous surveys.

Carbonaceous nano-grains are a significant component of interstellar dust and dominate the mid-infrared emission of photodissociation regions (PDRs). We study the evolution of nano-grains across the illuminated edge of the Horsehead PDR, especially their abundance and size properties. This work is part of the Physics and Chemistry of PDR Fronts program studying dust and gas in PDRs with JWST. We use NIRCam+MIRI photometric bands and NIRSpec+MRS spectroscopy to map the illuminated edge. We model dust emission using the THEMIS dust model with the SOC radiative transfer code. Detailed modeling of high angular resolution JWST data allows us to obtain constraints on nano-grain properties. We find that diffuse ISM dust cannot account for the observed data, requiring evolved grains. A sharp density increase is observed at the illuminated edge, consistent with ALMA observations revealing a sharp transition between molecular and ionized gas. Although the PDR length could not be directly determined, we estimate an upper limit of approximately 0.015 pc. This implies a lower limit on small grain abundance (greater than 0.003), showing small grains are not depleted at the Horsehead edge, unlike in the Orion Bar. Our findings indicate a high-density environment and less steep size distribution for nano-grains at the illuminated edge versus the diffuse ISM. This implies nano-grain destruction mechanisms might be less efficient in the Horsehead's moderate-UV field than in more intense PDRs. These results support a model where nano-grain population recovery is slower in moderate-UV environments, leading to a unique dust size distribution at the edge of the Horsehead Nebula.

We aim to characterise the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and the 3D correlation between stellar mass, metallicity and star-formation rate (SFR) known as the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) for galaxies at 5&lt;z&lt;7. Using ~800 [O III] selected galaxies from deep NIRCam grism surveys, we present our stacked measurements of direct-T_e metallicities, which we use to test recent strong-line metallicity calibrations. Our measured direct-T_e metallicities (0.1-0.2 Z<sub>&odot;</sub> for M<sub>&sext;</sub> ≈5×10^7-9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, respectively) match recent JWST/NIRSpec-based results. However, there are significant inconsistencies between observations and hydrodynamical simulations. We observe a flatter MZR slope than the SPHINX^20 and FLARES simulations, which cannot be attributed to selection effects. With simple models, we show that the effect of an [O III] flux-limited sample on the observed shape of the MZR is strongly dependent on the FMR. If the FMR is similar to the one in the local Universe, the intrinsic high-redshift MZR should be even flatter than observed. In turn, a 3D relation where SFR correlates positively with metallicity at fixed mass would imply an intrinsically steeper MZR. Our measurements indicate that metallicity variations at fixed mass show little dependence on the SFR, suggesting a flat intrinsic MZR. This could indicate that the low-mass galaxies at these redshifts are out of equilibrium and that metal enrichment occurs rapidly in low-mass galaxies. However, being limited by our stacking analysis, we are yet to probe the scatter in the MZR and its dependence on SFR. Large carefully selected samples of galaxies with robust metallicity measurements can put tight constraints on the high-redshift FMR and, help to understand the interplay between gas flows, star formation and feedback in early galaxies.

Characterizing dust attenuation is crucial for revealing the intrinsic physical properties of galaxies. We present an analysis of dust attenuation in 18 spectroscopically confirmed star-forming main-sequence galaxies at z = 4.4-5.7 observed with JWST/NIRSpec IFU and NIRCam, selected from the ALPINE and CRISTAL ALMA large programs. We fit the emission line fluxes from NIRSpec and the broad-band photometry from NIRCam with Prospector, using both spatially integrated emission and ~0.6 kpc pixel-by-pixel measurements. We derive the stellar-to-nebular dust attenuation ratio (f=E(B-V)_star/E(B-V)_neb) from the SED fits and the Balmer decrement with Hα and Hβ. Although individual galaxies show large scatter, the best-fit value is f = 0.51^+0.04_-0.03, slightly higher than that measured for local starburst galaxies. We find weak correlations of f with galaxy properties, increasing with higher specific star-formation rates, younger stellar ages, and more recent star-formation. For the range of E(B-V)_star = 0.009-0.15 mag for in our sample, assuming f = 1 (often adopted in high-redshift studies) instead of f = 0.51 underestimate line luminosities and ionizing photon production efficiency ξ<sub>ion</sub> by ~3-36&percnt; and ~4-46&percnt;, respectively. We also find that the total stellar masses estimated from spatially-integrated SED fits with a delayed-τ star-formation histories are systematically smaller than the sum of pixel-by-pixel SED fits, with a median offset of ~ 0.26 dex, likely because the integrated fits are biased toward luminous young stellar populations.

We investigate the stellar shape and size-mass relationship of X-ray selected Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) host galaxies using the high-angular resolution and deep sensitivity in the near-infrared of the COSMOS-Web JWST survey field. We present the rest-frame 1-μm size, stellar mass, Sersic index, axis-ratio, Gini-M_20 parameters of 690 moderate luminosity AGNs between redshift 0-3 and with stellar mass log M_s~ 10.75. We find that AGN host galaxies have an effective radius of 1-5 kpc, which is between star-forming (SFG) and quiescent galaxies (QGs) of the same stellar mass. AGN hosts have similar size-mass trends as SFG and QGs, being smaller at higher redshift for the same stellar mass. The slope of the size-mass relationship of AGN host galaxies is steeper than that of star-forming galaxies. Their rest-frame 1μm stellar morphology indicates a significant spheroidal component. We observed a low merger fraction (6%) in our sample as well as substructures similar to disks, bars, and spiral arms in the residual images, which are in tension with evolutionary pathways that require major mergers. However, it may also be due to the different timescales between mergers and AGN activity.

<p>
Since the launch of JWST, the sample size of reionization-era Lyman-alpha-emitters (LAEs) has been steadily growing; yet inferences about the neutral hydrogen fraction in the intergalactic medium exhibit increasing variance at redshift z ~ 7, possibly indicating significant field-to-field fluctuations in the progression of cosmic reionization. In this paper, we present new JWST/NIRSpec and Keck/LRIS spectra of nine LAEs in the redshift z ~ 7 protocluster, LAGER-z7OD1. Measurements of Lyman-alpha-transmission and Lyman-alpha velocity offset along multiple sightlines map the Lyman-alpha damping wing optical depth across the galaxy overdensity. In the standard context of inside-out ionization, we estimate radii of ionized bubbles (R(min) = 0.07 - 0.69 Mpc) based on the distance from each LAE to the first neutral patch along the sightline. The resulting 3D topology reveals three distinct sub-clusters where the ionized bubbles are approaching overlap. Five of the nine LAEs plausibly ionized their bubbles, a few bursts of star formation and a modest escape fraction are sufficient. We demonstrate, however, that the actual ionized volumes are likely larger, at least R(ism) = 0.42 - 1.29 Mpc, based on an empirical model for interstellar attenuation of Lyman-alpha. Modeling galactic attenuation of Lyman-alpha significantly increases the inferred intergalactic transmission (thus enlarging the ionized pathlength). The errorbars on the reddening correction allow fully overlapping bubbles, and our results are consistent with accelerated reionization in the protocluster.

<p>
At present, the best opportunity for detailed Lyman Continuum escape studies is in gravitationally lensed galaxies at z &gt;~ 2. Only one such galaxy currently exists in the literature with sufficient spatial magnification: The Sunburst Arc at redshift z = 2.37. Here, we present rest-frame optical JWST NIRSpec integral field observations of the Sunburst Arc that cover a large fraction of the source plane. From this dataset, we generate precise maps of ISM kinematics, dust geometry, ionization, and chemical enrichment. We extract a stacked spectrum of five gravitationally lensed images of the Lyman-Continuum leaking cluster, as well as an magnification-corrected, integrated spectrum of most of the galaxy, enabling a direct comparison to other LyC leakers in the literature. We find that the galaxy rotates but also shows strong, possibly dominant, signatures of turbulence, which are indicative of recent or ongoing major interaction. The cluster that leaks ionizing photons shows little variation in kinematics or dust coverage, but dramatically elevated ionization, indicating that photoionization is the predominant mechanism that creates paths for LyC escape. We conjecture that tidal stripping of H I gas due to an interaction could have removed a large portion of the neutral ISM around the LyC emitting cluster, making it easier for the cluster to completely ionize the rest.

<p> Greta Zucchi, Xihan Ji, Piero Madau, Roberto Maiolino, Ignas Juodžbalis, Francesco D'Eugenio, Sophia Geris, Yuki Isobe </p>
<p>
Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered a substantial population of high-redshift, broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs), whose properties challenge standard models of black hole growth and AGN emission. We analyze a spectroscopic sample of 34 Type 1 AGNs from the JWST Advanced Deep Survey (JADES) survey, spanning redshifts 1.7 &lt; z &lt; 9, to constrain the physical nature of the accretion flows powering these sources with broad-line diagnostics statistically for the first time. At z &gt; 5, we find a marked suppression of high-ionization emission lines (HeII, CIV, NV) relative to prominent broad Halpha and narrow [OIII] features. This contrast places strong constraints on the shape of the ionizing spectral energy distribution (SED) and on the physical conditions in the broad-line region (BLR). By comparing the observations to photoionization models based on SEDs of black holes accreting at sub-Eddington ratios, we show that standard AGN continua struggle to reproduce the observed broad line ratios and equivalent widths across a wide ionization parameter range. These results suggest the need for modified SEDs &ndash; either intrinsically softened due to super-Eddington accretion or radiative inefficiencies in the innermost disk, or externally filtered by intervening optically thick gas that absorbs or scatters the highest-energy photons before they reach the BLR.

<p>
Determining the infrared extinction curve towards the Galactic centre is crucial for accurately correcting observed data and deriving the underlying stellar populations. However, extinction curves reported in the literature often show discrepancies. We aim to derive the infrared extinction curve towards the Galactic centre based on JWST-NIRCam data for the first time, using observations of the Sagittarius C region in the 1-5 μm range. We determined extinction ratios using two different methods, both based on measuring the reddening vector using the slope of red clump stars, whose intrinsic properties are well known, in observed colour-magnitude diagrams. The extinction curve derived in this work is in good agreement with previous results in the literature. We obtained the following extinction ratios relative to F162M: A_F115W : A_F162M : A_F182M : A_F212N : A_F360M : A_F405N : A_F470N : A_F480M = 1.84 ± 0.03 : 1.00 : 0.789 ± 0.005 : 0.607 ± 0.014 : 0.306 ± 0.011 : 0.248 ± 0.017 : 0.240 ± 0.019 : 0.21 ± 0.03. Besides, we found different values of the extinction index for the short- (λ~ 1-2.5 μm, α~ 2) and long-wavelength (λ~ 2.5-5 μm, α~ 1.4) regimes, with the extinction curve flattening at longer wavelengths. Comparison with extinction curves derived both inside and outside the Galactic centre suggests that the infrared extinction curve does not significantly vary in the central regions, and shows no significant evidence for variations between different lines of sight beyond the inner Galaxy within the uncertainties.

### 200) [2510.09972](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09972v2): PAH Spectral Diversity in NGC 7027 and the Evolution of Aromatic Carriers

<p> Charlotte Smith-Perez, Aidan Hembruff, Els Peeters, Alexander G. G. M. Tielens, Alessandra Ricca </p>
<p>
Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) constitute a significant fraction of the Universe's carbon budget, playing a key role in the cosmic carbon cycle and dominating the mid-infrared spectra of astrophysical environments in which they reside. Although PAHs are known to form in the circumstellar envelopes of post-AGB stars, their formation and evolution are still not well-understood. We aim to understand how pristine complex hydrocarbons and PAHs in circumstellar environments transition to the PAHs observed in the ISM. The mid-infrared PAH spectra (5-18 micron) of the planetary nebula, NGC 7027, are investigated using spectral cubes from JWST MIRI-MRS. We report the first detection of spatially-resolved variations of the PAH spectral profiles across class A, AB, and B in all major PAH bands (6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.2 micron) within a single source, NGC 7027. These variations are linked to morphological structures within NGC 7027. Clear correlations are revealed between the 6.2, 7.7, and 8.6 micron features, where the red components (6.26, 7.8, 8.65 micron) exhibit a strong correlation and the same is found for the blue components of the 6.2 and 7.7 (6.205 and 7.6 micron). The blue component of the 8.6 (8.56 micron) appears to be independent of the other components. We link this behaviour to differences in molecular structure of their PAH subpopulations. Decomposition of the 11.2 micron band confirms two previously identified components, with the broader 11.25 micron component attributed to emission from very small grains of PAH clusters rather than PAH emission. We show that PAH profile classes generally vary with proximity to the central star's UV radiation field, suggesting class B PAHs represent more processed species while class A PAHs remain relatively pristine, challenging current notions on the spectral evolution of PAHs.

<p>
We investigate the evolution of the bar fraction and length using an extended JWST NIRCam imaging dataset of galaxies at 1 ≤ z ≤ 4. We assess the wavelength dependence of the bar fraction and bar length evolution by selecting a nearly mass-complete CEERS disc sample and performing visual classifications on the short (F200W) and long (F356W+F444W) wavelength channels. A similar bar fraction is observed for both samples, and combined, we find a declining bar fraction from 0.16^+0.03_-0.03 to 0.07^+0.03_-0.01 over the redshift range. No evolution in the F356W+F444W bar length is measured, with a mean of 3.6 kpc. A slight increase of ~ 1 kpc towards z = 1 is measured in the F200W sample, with a mean of 2.9 kpc. We find that the correlation between bar length and galaxy mass, for massive galaxies at z &lt; 1, is unseen at z &gt; 1. By incorporating barred galaxies at z&lt;1, we show that there is a modest increase in the bar length (≈ 2 kpc) towards z=0, but bars longer than ≈8 kpc are only found at z&lt;1. We show that bars and discs grow in tandem, for the bar length normalised by disc size does not evolve. Not only is a significant population of bars forming beyond z = 1, but our results also show that some of these bars are as long and strong as the average bar at z≈0.

<p>
Active galactic nuclei (AGN), star formation (SF), and galaxy interactions can drive turbulence in the gas of the ISM, which in turn plays a role in the SF within galaxies. The impact on molecular gas is of particular importance, as it serves as the primary fuel for SF. Our goal is to investigate the origin of turbulence and the emission of molecular gas, as well as low- and intermediate-ionization gas, in the inner few kpc of both AGN hosts and SF galaxies. We use JWST MIRI/MRS observations of a sample consisting of 54 galaxies at z&lt;0.1. We present fluxes of the H2 S(5)6.9091, [Ar II]6.9853, [FeII]5.3403, and [Ar III]8.9914 lines, along with velocity dispersion from W80. For galaxies with coronal emission, [Mg V]5.6098 is also included. Line ratios are compared to photoionization and shock models to explore the origin of the gas emission. AGNs exhibit broader emission lines than SFGs, with the largest velocity dispersions observed in radio-strong (RS) AGNs. H2 gas is less turbulent compared to ionized gas, while coronal gas presents higher velocity dispersions. The W80 values for the ionized gas exhibits a decrease from the nucleus out to radii of approximately 0.5&ndash;1 kpc, followed by an outward increase up to 2-3 kpc. In contrast, the H2 line widths generally display increasing profiles with distance from the center. Correlations W80 and line ratios such as H2 S(5)/[ArII] and [FeII]/[ArII] indicate that the most turbulent gas is associated with shocks, enhancing H2 and [FeII] emissions. We speculate that these shocked gas regions are produced by AGN outflows and jet-cloud interactions in AGN-dominated sources, while in SFGs, they may be created by stellar winds and mergers. This shock-induced gas heating may be an important mechanism of AGN (or stellar) feedback, preventing the gas from cooling and forming new stars.

<p>
The population of the Little Red Dots (LRDs) may represent a key phase of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. A cocoon of dense excited gas is emerging as key component to explain the most striking properties of LRDs, such as strong Balmer breaks and Balmer absorption, as well as the weak IR emission. To dissect the structure of LRDs, we analyze new deep JWST/NIRSpec PRISM and G395H spectra of FRESCO-GN-9771, one of the most luminous known LRDs at z=5.5. These reveal a strong Balmer break, broad Balmer lines and very narrow [O III] emission. We unveil a forest of optical [Fe II] lines, which we argue is emerging from a dense (n_H=10^9-10 cm^-3) warm layer with electron temperature T_e≈7000 K. The broad wings of Hα and Hβ have an exponential profile due to electron scattering in this same layer. The high Hα:Hβ:Hγ flux ratio of ≈10.4:1:0.14 is an indicator of collisional excitation and resonant scattering dominating the Balmer line emission. A narrow Hγ component, unseen in the other two Balmer lines due to outshining by the broad components, could trace the ISM of a normal host galaxy with a star formation rate ~5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1. The warm layer is mostly opaque to Balmer transitions, producing a characteristic P-Cygni profile in the line centers suggesting outflowing motions. This same layer is responsible for shaping the Balmer break. The broad-band spectrum can be reasonably matched by a simple photoionized slab model that dominates the λ&gt;1500 Å continuum and a low mass (~10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) galaxy that could explain the narrow [O III], with only subdominant contribution to the UV continuum. Our findings indicate that Balmer lines are not directly tracing gas kinematics near the SMBH and that the BH mass scale is likely much lower than virial indicators suggest.

Charting the Epoch of Reionization demands robust assessments of what drives the production of ionizing photons in high-redshift star-forming galaxies (SFGs), and requires better predictive capabilities from current observations. Using a sample of N=159 SFGs at 1&lt;z&lt;8, observed with deep medium-resolution spectroscopy from the JWST/NIRSpec EXCELS survey, we perform a statistical analysis of their ionizing photon production efficiencies (ξ<sub>ion</sub>). We consider ξ<sub>ion</sub>, measured with Balmer line measurements, in relation to a number of key galaxy properties including; nebular emission line strengths (W_λ(Hα) and W_λ( [OIII])), UV luminosity (M_UV) and UV slope (β_UV), as well as dust attenuation (E(B-V)_neb) and redshift. Implementing a Bayesian linear regression methodology, we fit ξ<sub>ion</sub> against the principal observables while fully marginalising over all measurement uncertainties, mitigating against the impact of outliers and determining the intrinsic scatter. Significant relations between ξ<sub>ion</sub> and W_λ(Hα), W_λ([OIII]) and β_UV are recovered. Moreover, the weak trends with M_UV and redshift can be fully explained by the remaining property dependencies. Expanding our analysis to multivariate regression, we determine that W_λ(Hα) or W_λ([OIII]), along with β_UV and E(B-V)_neb, are the most important observables for accurately predicting ξ<sub>ion</sub>,0. The latter identifies the most common outliers as SFGs with relatively high E(B-V)_neb≳0.5, possibly indicative of obscured star-formation or strong differential attenuation. Combining these properties enable ξ<sub>ion</sub>,0 to be inferred with an accuracy of ~0.15 dex, with a population intrinsic scatter of σ_int~0.035 dex.

We present JWST NIRSpec and MIRI MRS observations of the central kiloparsec of M58 (NGC 4579), a nearby LINER galaxy hosting a low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN; L_bol ~ 10^42 erg s<sup>-1</sup>) with a low-power jet. These data provide an unprecedented view of the warm molecular gas phase and reveal clear signatures of feedback. We detect 44 H<sub>2</sub> lines, including bright pure rotational lines (S(1)-S(18)) and rovibrational lines up to ν=2, probing a wide range of excitation conditions. Excitation diagrams show that rotational lines follow a power-law temperature distribution with an exponential cutoff, consistent with heating by low-velocity shocks. H<sub>2</sub> rovibrational lines deviate from thermal models primarily because of sub-thermal excitation at low density. Additionally, there may be a 10% contribution powered by AGN X-ray photons in the nucleus. The dust lanes associated with the spiral inflow appear dynamically undisturbed but show signs of shock heating, while the inner ~200 pc exhibits turbulent kinematics produced by outflowing molecular gas. These results reveal the subtle yet measurable impact of LLAGN feedback on the interstellar medium, demonstrating that even weak, vertically oriented jets and low radiative accretion rates can perturb molecular gas and regulate nuclear reservoirs. This study highlights JWST's transformative ability to uncover hidden modes of AGN feedback.

We present measurements of stellar population properties of a newly discovered spectroscopically confirmed z=11.10^+0.11_-0.26, gravitationally lensed galaxy, using JWST NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy and NIRCam imaging. The arc is highly magnified by the Bullet Cluster (magnification factor μ=14.0^+6.2_-0.3. It contains three star-forming components of which one is barely resolved and two are unresolved, giving intrinsic sizes of ≲ 10pc. The clumps also contain ~50% of the total stellar mass. The galaxy formed the majority of its stars ~150Myr ago (by z~14). The spectrum shows a pronounced damping wing, typical for galaxies deep in the reionisation era and indicating a neutral IGM at this line of sight. The intrinsic luminosity of the galaxy is 0.086^+0.008_-0.030 L^* (with L^* being the characteristic luminosity for this redshift), making it the lowest luminosity spectroscopically confirmed galaxy at z&gt;10 discovered to date.

<p>
Galaxies at Cosmic Noon (z~2-3) are characterized by rapid star formation that will lead to significant metal enrichment in the interstellar medium (ISM). While much observational evidence suggests that these galaxies are chemically distinct from those in the local Universe, directly measuring the ISM chemistry in large samples of high-z galaxies is only now possible with the observational capabilities of JWST. In this first key paper of the CECILIA program, we present the direct-method physical conditions and multi-element abundances in twenty galaxies at Cosmic Noon. Using a combination of archival Keck/MOSFIRE and new ~30-hr NIRSpec spectroscopy, we measure multiple electron gas densities and the temperature structure from the O^+ and S^2+ ions. We find that n_e[O II] and n_e[S II] are comparable but elevated with respect to n_e in local star-forming galaxies, and the simultaneous T_e[O II] and T_e[S III] generally agree with photoionization model T_e scaling relations. The O abundances in the CECILIA galaxies range from 12+log(O/H)=7.76-8.81 (12-131% solar O/H), representing some of the highest direct-method metallicities and lowest T_e (T_e[O II]≈6500 K) measured with JWST to date. The CECILIA galaxies exhibit significantly sub-solar S/O and Ar/O a signature of predominant enrichment from core collapse supernovae. The N/O-O/H trends in the CECILIA galaxies generally agree with the abundance trends in local nebulae, but the large scatter in N/O could be sensitive to the star-formation history. The CECILIA observations demonstrate that exceptionally deep JWST spectroscopy can unveil the multi-element ISM abundance patterns in typical high-z galaxies.

### 208) [2509.12308](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12308v2): Death by Impact: Evidence for Merger-Driven Quenching in a Collisional Ring Galaxy at Cosmic Noon

<p> Amir H. Khoram, Sirio Belli, Carlo Nipoti, Raffaele Pascale, Andrew B. Newman, Federico Marinacci, Richard S. Ellis, Letizia Bugiani, Matteo Sapori, Eric Giunchi </p>
<p>
The role of interactions and mergers in the rapid quenching of massive galaxies in the early Universe remains uncertain, largely due to the difficulty of directly linking mergers to quenching. Collisional ring galaxies provide a unique opportunity, as their morphology allows precise dating of the interaction, which can then be compared to quenching timescales inferred from star formation histories. We study a gravitationally bound system at z=1.61 in the UDS field, composed of a Host galaxy (M<sub>&sext;</sub> = 10^11.4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) with a collisional ring and an X-ray AGN, and the Bullet galaxy (M<sub>&sext;</sub> = 10^11.2 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), located at a projected distance of ~ 8 kpc. Combining JWST and HST imaging with Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy, we find compelling evidence for an ongoing starburst in the Host concurrent with rapid quenching in the Bullet. The ring, ~ 20 kpc in diameter, is expanding at 127^+72_-29 km s<sup>-1</sup>, implying the galaxies first collided 47&ndash;96 Myr ago. This timeline is consistent with the Host's current starburst and the Bullet's sudden quenching, strongly suggesting both phenomena were triggered by the interaction. Crucially, the Bullet shows no evidence of a preceding starburst, ruling out rapid gas consumption as the primary quenching channel. Instead, we suggest that merger-driven processes &ndash; such as enhanced turbulence and disk instabilities &ndash; may have suppressed star formation. An additional possibility, which we term the "Dragon Effect,'' is that AGN-driven outflows from the Host disrupted the Bullet's low-density molecular gas, thereby preventing efficient star formation and accelerating quenching.

<p> Sheng-Han Zhou, Tian-Nuo Li, Guo-Hong Du, Jun-Qian Jiang, Jing-Fei Zhang, Xin Zhang </p>
<p>
Early JWST observations reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of high-redshift candidate massive galaxies at z ≳ 7, and recent DESI measurements show a preference for dynamical dark energy, which together present a significant challenge to the standard ΛCDM cosmology. In this work, we jointly analyze high-redshift galaxy data from JWST, baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI DR2, and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and ACT, measuring the total neutrino mass \sum m_ν. We consider three dark energy models (ΛCDM, wCDM, and w_0w_aCDM) and three mass hierarchies. Our results indicate that in the w_0w_aCDM model, adding JWST data to CMB+DESI tightens the upper limit of \sum m_ν by about 5.8&percnt;-10.2&percnt;, and we obtain \sum m_ν &lt; 0.167~eV (2σ) in the normal hierarchy (NH) case. Furthermore, JWST also offers indicative lower limits on star formation efficiency parameter of f_*,10 ≳ 0.146-0.161. Bayesian evidence weakly favors the w_0w_aCDM+\sum m_ν(NH) model relative to the ΛCDM+\sum m_ν(NH) model using CMB+DESI+JWST data. These results suggest that the joint analysis of high-redshift JWST data and low-redshift DESI data provides compelling constraints on neutrino mass and merits further investigation.

<p> Yuting Liu, Masamune Oguri </p>
<p>
Time-delay cosmology offers an alternative approach to measuring the Hubble constant (H_0), which is distinct from the cosmic distance ladder and cosmic microwave background radiation methods. In this study, we present an improved strong lens mass modeling analysis of the cluster-lensed supernova Refsdal, incorporating the latest spectroscopic redshift data from the MUSE on the Very Large Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope CANUCS/Technicolor. The robustness of our lens models is confirmed using the Jackknife method. From our analysis that considers four lens mass models with different assumptions on profiles of dark matter halos and external perturbations, we derive a constraint on the Hubble constant of H_0=66.0±4.3\Mpc after combining best-fitted values of the four lens models.

[Shortened for arXiv] We conduct a systematic search for log(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 9.5 quiescent galaxies at z &gt; 3 in six extragalactic deep fields observed with NIRCam, with the goal of extracting their physical and statistical features in a uniform and self-consistent manner. We exploit the ASTRODEEP-JWST photometric catalogs to single out robust candidates, including sources quenched only a few tens of Myr before the observation. We apply a SED-fitting procedure which explores three functional forms of star formation history and the χ^2 probabilities of the solutions, with additional checks to minimise the contamination from interlopers, tuning our selection criteria against available spectroscopic data from the DAWN archive and simulated catalogs. We select 633 candidates, which we rank by a reliability parameter based on the probabilities of the quiescent and alternative star-forming solutions, with 291 candidates tagged as "gold". According to the best-fit models, 79&percnt; of the massive (log(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 10.5) quiescent galaxies at 3 &lt; z &lt; 5 stopped forming stars at least 150 Myr before the time of observation, while 89&percnt; of low-mass sources have been quenched for less than 150 Myr. The abundance of low-mass old quiescent systems does not increase significantly with time from z = 5 to 3: low-mass objects seem to be experiencing a short episode of quenching followed by rejuvenation ("breathing''), consistent with a downsizing scenario of galaxy formation. We also find an abrupt drop in the density of massive quiescent candidates at z &gt; 5. We derive estimates for the number density of early passive galaxies up to z = 10 and compare them against various models: tensions with data remain in the modeling of the observed bimodality of time passed since quenching as a function of mass.

### 212) [2509.09761](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09761v2): Double Trouble: Two spectroscopically confirmed low-mass quiescent galaxies at z&gt;5 in overdensities

<p> William M. Baker, Kei Ito, Francesco Valentino, Pengpei Zhu, Gianluca Scarpe, Rashmi Gottumukkala, Jens Hjorth, Laia Barrufet, Danial Langeroodi </p>
<p>
We present the discovery of two low-mass, high-redshift, quiescent galaxies, GS-z5-Q1 and COS-z5-Q1, using JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy alongside NIRCam and MIRI photometry. Observed at a redshift of z=5.39 and z=5.11 respectively, and with stellar masses of 10^9.6M<sub>&odot;</sub> and 10^9.5M<sub>&odot;</sub>, GS-z5-Q1 and COS-z5-Q1 are two of the most distant quiescent galaxies spectroscopically confirmed to-date, and are by far the least massive (~10× lower mass). Full spectrophotometric modelling reveals that COS-z5-Q1 appears to have quenched more than 300Myr prior to observation (z~ 7) and has a formation redshift of around z~11, whilst GS-z5-Q1 formed and quenched in a single burst around 150Myr prior to observation (z~6). GS-z5-Q1 is found to lie near the centre of a known high-z overdensity in GOODS-S, as would be expected by galaxy formation models, while COS-z5-Q1 lies towards the outskirts of an overdense region. This highlights the role that environment could play in accelerating galaxy evolutionary processes and could possibly be linked to the galaxies' quiescent nature. By modelling their stellar populations, we show that these types of low-mass quiescent galaxies could potentially be descendants of the higher-z "mini-quenched" galaxies. The discovery of these two low-mass z&gt;5 quiescent galaxies illuminates a previously undiscovered galaxy population and motivates dedicated follow-up surveys to investigate the overall population.

### 213) [2509.07913](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07913v3): Disclosing Submillimeter Galaxy Formation: Mergers or Secular Evolution?

<p> Siu-Wang Chan, Yiping Ao, Qinghua Tan </p>
<p>
We analyze the morphology of 125 submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) in the PRIMER-COSMOS field using double Sersic modeling on JWST NIRCam images across six bands (F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M and F444W), with SMGs being classified by bulge Sersic index (n_bulge) and bulge-to-total luminosity ratio (B/T). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test between the bright (SFR &gt; 175 M_sun yr^-1) and the faint group (SFR &lt; 175 M_sun yr^-1) reveals no significant statistical differences in morphology across bands. However, we notice that SMGs skew towards higher B/T ratios and lower n_bulge from shorter to longer wavelengths. In F444W, bright SMGs exhibit higher B/T and lower n_bulge, indicating flatter, disturbed bulges, while faint SMGs show lower B/T and higher n_bulge. Notably, SMGs with higher B/T tend to have low Sersic index, challenging the local universe dichotomy of classical bulges (B/T &gt; 0.5, n &gt; 4) versus pseudo-bulges (B/T &lt; 0.35, n &lt; 2). In the F277W band, non-parametric measurements indicate predominantly disk-dominated patterns, with only 24 percent of SMGs demonstrating merger signatures. After the removal of SMGs with disturbed morphology, the bulge classification scheme in F277W shows pseudo-bulges (21 percent) and clump migration bulges (16 percent) from secular evolution, compared to 4 percent merger-built bulges. Surprisingly, 48 percent of SMGs defy the classification scheme, showing high B/T (approximately 0.7) but low Sersic index (n_bulge ≤ 1). Bars are confirmed in 7 percent of SMGs. This work suggests that secular evolution takes precedence over major mergers, supporting the idea that isolated evolution fueled by filamentary gas inflow plays a non-negligible role in the SMG bulge formation.

### 214) [2509.07695](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07695v2): Beyond No Tension: JWST z &gt; 10 Galaxies Push Simulations to the Limit

<p> Joe McCaffrey, Samantha Hardin, John H. Wise, John A. Regan </p>
<p>
JWST has identified some of the Universe's earliest galaxies, repeatedly pushing the frontier to ever higher redshifts and stellar masses. The presence of such extreme galaxies at such early times, with large stellar populations and high star-formation rates, naturally results in a tension between observation and theory. This tension between numerical models and observations can be either due to our underlying cosmological models or due to a gap in our understanding of early Universe astrophysics. In a prelude to this letter, we showed how the Renaissance simulations, which focused on high redshift galaxy formation were able to reconstruct similar stellar masses to the earliest and highest mass galaxies that had been discovered by JWST at the time of its publication (McCaffrey et al.2023). Since then many more galaxies have been discovered by JWST, in particular the "Mirage-or-Miracle" (MoM) survey broke the record recently with the highest redshift galaxy MoM-z14, which has a spectroscopically confirmed redshift of z ~ 14.44 followed closely by GS-z14 with a spectroscopically confirmed redshift of z ~ 14.3. We investigate in this letter whether these newly discovered galaxies are in conflict with the Renaissance simulations and thus whether they are causing tension with our established models of cosmology and/or high-redshift astrophysics. We discover that MoM-z14's high mass at early redshift can be explained by the Renaissance simulation suite, whereas the extremely high stellar mass of GS-z14 remains an outlier when compared to previous measurements of high-redshift galaxies detected by JWST and our numerical models (even after accounting for cosmic variance).

<p>
Little Red Dots (LRDs) are a puzzling population of extragalactic sources whose origin is highly debated. In this work, we perform a comprehensive stacking analysis of NIRCam, MIRI and ALMA images of a large and homogeneously-selected sample of LRDs from multiple JWST Legacy fields. We report clear evidence for hot-dust emission in the median stacked spectral energy distribution (SED), featuring a rising near-infrared continuum up to rest-frame λ_rest~~3μm, which is best explained by a standard dusty AGN structure. Although LRDs are likely a heterogeneous population, our findings suggest that most (≳50&percnt;) LRDs show AGN-heated dust emission, regardless of whether the Optical/Ultraviolet (UV) continuum is stellar or AGN-dominated. In either case, the best-fit dusty-AGN SED, combined with the lack of X-ray detection in the deep Chandra stacks, suggests that Compton-thick (N_H&gt;3×10^24 cm<sup>2</sup>) gas obscuration is common, and likely confined within the dust sublimation radius (R_sub~0.1 pc). Therefore, we argue that AGN-heated dust does not directly obscure either the Optical/UV continuum or the broad-line region emission, in order to explain the observed blue UV slopes and prominent Balmer features. While a gas-dust displacement is in line with several models, the formation scenario (in-situ or ex-situ) of this pre-enriched hot dust remains unclear.

We select a mass-complete sample of 225 quiescent galaxies at z&gt;2 with M_* &gt; 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> from PRIMER and JADES photometry spanning a total area of ≃320 sq. arcmin. We restrict our analysis to only area with optical coverage in three HST ACS filters, and provide evidence that this is important for selecting the most complete and clean samples of z&gt;2 massive quiescent galaxy candidates. We investigate the contamination in our sample via JWST NIRSpec spectroscopic validation, Chandra X-ray imaging, and ALMA interferometry, calculating a modest total contamination fraction of 12.9_-3.1^+4.0 per cent. The removal of HST data increases star-forming galaxy contamination by ≃10 per cent and results in a ≃20 per cent loss of candidates recovered from HST+JWST data combined. We calculate massive quiescent galaxy number densities at 2&lt;z&lt;5, finding values three times larger than pre-JWST estimates, but generally in agreement with more-recent and larger-area JWST studies. In comparison with galaxy evolution simulations, we find that most can now reproduce the observed massive quiescent galaxy number density at 2&lt;z&lt;3, however they still increasingly fall short at z&gt;3, with discrepancies of up to ≃ 1 dex. We place 14 of our z&gt;3 massive quiescent galaxies on the BPT and WHaN diagrams using medium-resolution spectroscopic data from the EXCELS survey. We find a very high incidence of faint AGN in our sample, at a level of ≃50 per cent, consistent with recent results at cosmic noon. This is interesting in the context of maintenance-mode feedback, which is invoked in many simulations to prevent quenched galaxies from re-igniting star formation. To properly characterise the evolution of early massive quiescent galaxies, greater coverage in optical filters and significantly larger spectroscopic samples will be required.

### 217) [2509.06622](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06622v2): MARTA: The connection between chemical enrichment, feedback, and dust in a Wolf-Rayet galaxy at z~2

<p>
We present the analysis of the stellar and interstellar medium (ISM) properties of MARTA-4327, a star-forming galaxy at z=2.224 observed by means of deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy in both medium- and high-resolution gratings as part of the "Measuring Abundances at high Redshift with the Te Approach" (MARTA) programme. We report one of the highest-redshift detections of the Wolf-Rayet (WR) blue and red bumps in a non-lensed system. The broad He iiλ4686 feature is consistent with a young (~ 5-6 Myr) burst dominated by WN stars, although both SSP models and empirical templates struggle to reproduce the nitrogen stellar features at ≈ 4640 A. Based on the relative strength of the available optical stellar features, we disfavor the presence of very massive stars (VMS) in this system. Elemental abundance ratios such as Ne/O, N/O, and Ar/O align with observations of local star-forming galaxies (including WR galaxies), suggesting that any impact of the WR population on the chemical enrichment of the ISM is strongly localized. However, the gas-phase Fe/O ratio appears enhanced compared to local galaxies of similar metallicity, which we interpret as evidence for reduced Fe depletion onto dust grains, possibly linked to localized destruction in WR-driven wind environments. In addition, we detect a broad and blueshifted (~70 km/s) Hα component, revealing the presence of an ionized outflow with a mass loading factor η~ 0.2. Finally, we report the robust detection of O Iλ8446 emission (among the firsts at high redshift), which we interpret as originating from Lyβ fluorescence and/or collisional excitation in dense clumps. Overall, MARTA-4327 represents a unique system for studying the role of massive stars in shaping the ISM in galaxies at Cosmic Noon.

### 218) [2509.00153](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00153v2): Quasar Radiative Feedback May Suppress Galaxy Growth on Intergalactic Scales at z = 6.3

<p>
We present observational evidence that intense ionizing radiation from a luminous quasar suppresses nebular emission in nearby galaxies on intergalactic scales at z=6.3. Using JWST/NIRCam grism spectroscopy from the SAPPHIRES and EIGER programs, we identify a moderate but statistically significant decline in [O sciii] &lambda;5008 luminosity relative to the UV continuum (L_5008/L_1500) among galaxies within ~ 7 comoving Mpc (cMpc) of the quasar J0100+2802, the most UV-luminous quasar known at this epoch (M_1450=-29.26). While L_1500 remains roughly constant with transverse distance, L_5008 increases significantly, suggesting suppression of very recent star formation toward the quasar. The effect persists after controlling for completeness, local density, and UV luminosity, and correlates with the projected photoionization-rate profile Γ_qso. A weaker but directionally consistent suppression in L_5008/L_1500 is also observed along the line of sight. The transverse suppression radius (~ 7 cMpc) implies a recent radiative episode with a cumulative duration ~ 3.1 Myr, shorter than required for thermal photoheating to dominate and thus more naturally explained by rapid H<sub>2</sub> photodissociation and related radiative processes. Environmental effects alone appear insufficient to explain the signal. Our results provide direct, geometry-based constraints on large-scale quasar radiative feedback and recent quasar lifetimes.

### 219) [2508.13761](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13761v2): Narrowing the discovery space of the cosmological 21-cm signal using multi-wavelength constraints

<p>
The cosmic 21-cm signal is a promising probe of the early Universe, owing to its sensitivity to the thermal state of the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) and properties of the first luminous sources. Here, we constrain the 21-cm signal and infer IGM properties using the Population II galaxy parameters derived in a previous study through multi-wavelength synergies. This includes high-redshift UV luminosity functions (UVLFs) from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), cosmic X-ray and radio backgrounds (CXB and CRB), the SARAS 3 global 21-cm signal non-detection, and HERA 21-cm power spectrum upper limits. From CXB and HERA data, we infer the IGM kinetic temperature to be T_K(z=15)≲ 7.7~K, 2.5~K ≲ T_K(z=10) ≲ 66~K, and 20~K≲ T_K(z=6) ≲ 2078~K at 95% credible interval (C.I.). Similarly, CRB and HERA data limit the radio emission efficiency of galaxies, giving T_rad(z=15) ≲ 47~K, T_rad(z=10)≲ 51~K, and T_rad(z=6)≲ 101~K. These constraints, strengthened by UVLFs from HST and JWST, enable the first itlower bound on the cosmic 21-cm signal. We infer an absorption trough of depth -201~mK≲ T_21,min ≲ -68~mK at z_min≈10-16, and a power spectrum of 8.7~mK^2 &lt; Δ_21^2(z=15) &lt; 197~mK^2 at k=0.35~hMpc^-1. Our results highlight the power of multi-wavelength synergies in constraining the early Universe. While promising for upcoming 21-cm experiments, the results depend on our assumption of a redshift-independent X-ray and radio efficiency of galaxies, and the exclusion of a flexible model for Population III stars.

We present the second data release of the Systematic Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES), focusing on JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution spectroscopy of galaxies across cosmic time. This release includes spectroscopic observations of 166 galaxies spanning 0 &lt; z &lt; 7.5, sampling star-forming galaxies, quiescent systems, and active galactic nuclei (AGN), with an emphasis on galaxies at cosmic noon (z ~ 1-3). We describe the target selection strategy, the observational setup with the G140M/F100LP and G235M/F170LP gratings, and the data calibration process. The final data products include the reduced spectra, redshift catalog, emission-line catalogs produced with ttGELATO for emission-line galaxies and ttpPXF fits for quiescent systems, and ancillary spectral energy distribution (SED) fit results derived from multi-band photometry. The SMILES NIRSpec dataset enables investigations of obscured AGN, multi-phase outflows, ionizing properties, and the role of environment in galaxy evolution.

### 221) [2508.08768](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08768v2): Impact of Resonance, Raman, and Thomson Scattering on Hydrogen Line Formation in Little Red Dots

<p> Seok-Jun Chang, Max Gronke, Jorryt Matthee, Charlotte Mason </p>
<p>
Little Red Dots (LRDs) are compact sources at z&gt;5 discovered through JWST spectroscopy. Their spectra exhibit broad Balmer emission lines (≳1000~km~s<sup>-1</sup>), alongside absorption features and a pronounced Balmer break &ndash; evidence for a dense, neutral hydrogen medium with the n=2 state. When interpreted as arising from AGN broad-line regions, inferred black hole masses from local scaling relations exceed expectations given their stellar masses, challenging models of early black hole-galaxy co-evolution. However, radiative transfer effects in dense media may also impact the formation of hydrogen emission lines. We model three scattering processes shaping hydrogen line profiles: resonance scattering by hydrogen in the n=2 state, Raman scattering of UV radiation by ground-state hydrogen, and Thomson scattering by free electrons. Using 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations with multi-branching resonance transitions, we examine their imprint on line shapes and ratios. Resonance scattering produces strong deviations from Case B flux ratios, clear differences between Hα and Hβ, and encodes gas kinematics in line profiles but cannot broaden Hβ due to conversion to Paα. While Raman scattering can yield broad wings, scattering of UV continuum is disfavored given the absence of strong FWHM variations across transitions. Raman scattering of higher Lyman-series emission can produce Hα/Hβ wing width ratios of ≳1.28, agreeing with observations. Thomson scattering can reproduce the observed ≳1000~km  s<sup>-1</sup> wings under plausible conditions, e.g., T_e ~ 10^4  K and N_e~10^24~cm<sup>2</sup> &ndash; and lead to black hole mass overestimates by factors ≳10. Our results provide a framework for interpreting hydrogen lines in LRDs and similar systems.

Casey, Andrea Grazian, Anton M. Koekemoer, Mario Radovich, Giulia Rodighiero </p>
<p>
Spatially resolved gas-phase metallicity maps are a crucial element in understanding the chemical evolution of galaxies. We present spatially resolved metallicity maps obtained from NIRISS/WFSS observations. This is the first such work presenting multiple individual galaxies. We investigate the source of ionisation, metallicity and its relation to star-formation in a spatially-resolved sense for a sample of eight galaxies &ndash; four from JWST-PASSAGE and four from GLASS-JWST ERS. All but one galaxy are in the redshift range 1.9 ≤ z ≤ 2, the outlier being at z = 3.1. Our sample covers a range of 8.0 &lt; logM &lt; 9.5 in stellar mass, 0.2 &lt; log(SFR/\M<sub>&odot;</sub>pyr) &lt; 1.1 in star-formation rate (SFR) and 7.8 &lt; logOH &lt; 9.0 in global metallicity. As a solution to the challenge of SF-AGN demarcation in absence of resolved \halpha, we present a new SF-demarcation line in the itOHNO parameter space based on MAPPINGS v5.1 publicly available \hii region model grids. We present the mass-metallicity gradient relation for our sample, which showed no clear trend with stellar mass, perhaps hinting at the fact that the high-z galaxies have not yet started their accretion dominated phase. By interpreting the correlation between spatially resolved metallicity and SFR maps as a proxy for effective timescales of metal-transport in galaxies, we find a weak trend such that this timescale increases with stellar mass, implying a more effective feedback in lower mass galaxies.

### 223) [2508.05052](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05052v2): The Size Evolution and the Size-Mass Relation of Lyman-Alpha Emitters across 3 ≲ z &lt; 7 as Observed by JWST

<p>
Understanding the morphological structures of Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) is crucial for unveiling their formation pathways and the physical origins of Lyα emission. However, the evolution of their sizes and structural scaling relations remains debated. In this study, we analyze a large sample of 876 spectroscopically confirmed LAEs at 3 ≲ z &lt; 7, selected from the MUSE, VANDELS, and CANDELSz7 surveys in the GOODS-S, UDS, and COSMOS fields. Utilizing James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam imaging data, we measure their rest-frame UV and optical V-band effective radii (R_e) through two-dimensional Sérsic profile fitting. Our results show that these LAEs are generally compact, with a median R_e,UV of 0.50^+0.30_-0.24 kpc and a median R_e,V of 0.57^+0.33_-0.24 kpc. The size evolution follows R_e,UV &prop; (1 + z)^-0.91 ± 0.10 and R_e,V &prop; (1 + z)^-0.93 ± 0.18, respectively. Their UV and optical sizes are statistically comparable, indicating negligible UV-to-optical color gradients. For the first time, we establish the rest-frame optical size-mass relation for LAEs at z&gt;3, finding slopes comparable to typical star-forming galaxies (SFGs), but with slightly smaller sizes at a given stellar mass. These results provide important clues for understanding structural evolution of LAEs in the early universe.

We present a photometric analysis of globular clusters (GCs) in the massive galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1-2403 (z = 0.397) using deep JWST/NIRCam imaging from the PEARLS program. PSF photometry was performed in the short wavelength filters F090W, F115W, F150W, and F200W, yielding a catalog of approximately 3 x 10^3 unresolved, point-like sources consistent with a GC population. Artificial star tests indicate 80% completeness at F200W = 30.36 mag. The color-magnitude diagrams show a narrow GC sequence well reproduced by PARSEC single-stellar-population models spanning ages of 5-9 Gyr and metallicities from [M/H] = -2.0 to +0.2, consistent with evolved GC systems at this redshift. The globular cluster luminosity function (GCLF) follows a log-normal form truncated by incompleteness at the faint end. The brightest sources extend slightly beyond the locus of classical GCs, suggesting a small number of UCD-like systems or stripped nuclei, while the bulk of the population exhibits the luminosities and colors expected for mature globular clusters at z ~ 0.4.

<p>
Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed a puzzling population of optically red and compact galaxies with peculiar "V"-shaped spectra at high redshift, known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). Until now, most spectroscopically confirmed LRDs are found at z&gt;4 and it has been speculated that LRDs are tracing the early stages of black hole evolution. We report an independent rediscovery of a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN), SDSS J102530.29+140207.3, at z=0.1, which shows spectral features matching those of LRDs seen in the early Universe, including the V-shaped spectrum, broad Balmer lines (with widths of 1000-2000 km/s), and deep Balmer absorption. We present a new GTC observation of this LRD, which reveals an optical continuum similar to those of G-to-K giant stars including an unambiguous G-band absorption originating from the CH molecule. In addition, this local LRD shows a series of absorption lines potentially related to low-ionization ions or atoms but are deeper than what is observed in empirical stellar templates. We further identify a series of [FeII] emission lines indicative of low-ionization gas, which we find also present in a JWST-selected LRD at z=2.26. We find small but statistically significant variability in the Hα of SDSS J102530.29+140207.3 consistent with previous findings. Finally, we report new observations with NuSTAR. We confirm the extreme X-ray weakness of this LRD, which might imply Compton-thick gas obscuration with N_H&gt;10^24~cm<sup>2</sup>. All evidence suggests SDSS J102530.29+140207.3 has a complex gaseous environment and the strong ionic, atomic, and molecular absorptions are hard to explain with typical stellar and AGN models.

<p>
The relation between the masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies encodes information on their mode of growth, especially at the earliest epochs. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has opened such investigations by detecting the host galaxies of AGN and more luminous quasars within the first billion years of the universe (z &gt; 6). Here, we evaluate the relation between the mass of SMBHs and the total stellar mass of their host galaxies using a sample of nine quasars at 6.18 &lt; z &lt; 6.4 from the Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) survey with NIRCam and NIRSpec observations. We find that the observed location of these quasars in the SMBH-galaxy mass plane (log M_BH/M<sub>&odot;</sub> ~ 8-9; log M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub> ~ 9.5-11) is consistent with a non-evolving intrinsic mass relation with dispersion (0.80_-0.28^+0.23 dex) higher than the local value (~0.3-0.4 dex) of their more massive descendants. Our analysis is based on a forward model of systematics and includes a consideration of the impact of selection effects and measurement uncertainties with an assumption on the slope of the mass relation. While degeneracies between parameters persist, the best-fit solution has a reasonable AGN fraction (2.3%) of galaxies at z ~ 6 with an actively growing UV-unobscured black hole. In particular, models with a substantially higher normalisation in M_BH would require an unrealistically low intrinsic dispersion (~0.22 dex). Consequently, our results predict a large population of AGNs at lower black hole masses, as are now just starting to be discovered in focused efforts with JWST.

The unexpectedly high abundance of galaxies at z &gt; 11 revealed by JWST has sparked a debate on the nature of early galaxies and the physical mechanisms regulating their formation. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has begun to provide vital insights on their gas and dust content, but so far only for extreme 'blue monsters'. Here we present new, deep ALMA observations of JADES-GS-z11-0, a more typical (sub-L^*) z &gt; 11 galaxy that bridges the discovery space of JWST and the Hubble Space Telescope. These data confirm the presence of the [O III] 88 μm line at 4.5σ significance, precisely at the redshift of several faint emission lines previously seen with JWST/NIRSpec, while the underlying dust continuum remains undetected (F_ν&lt; 9.0   μJy), implying an obscured star formation rate (SFR) of SFR_IR ≲ 6   M<sub>&odot;</sub>   yr^-1 and dust mass of M_dust ≲ 1.0 × 10^6   M<sub>&odot;</sub> (all 3σ). The accurate ALMA redshift of z_[O III] = 11.1221 ± 0.0006 (≳ \! 5× refined over NIRSpec) helps confirm that redshifts measured purely from the Lyman-α break, even spectroscopically, should properly take into account the effects of potential damped Lyman-α absorption (DLA) systems to avoid systematic overestimates of up to Δz ≈ 0.5. The [O III] 88 μm luminosity of L_[O III] = (1.1 ± 0.3) × 10^8   L<sub>&odot;</sub>, meanwhile, agrees well with the scaling relation for local metal-poor dwarfs given the SFR measured by NIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI. The spatially resolved MIRI and ALMA emission also underscores that JADES-GS-z11-0 is likely to consist of two low-mass components that are undergoing strong bursts of star formation yet are already pre-enriched in oxygen (~20-30% solar), only 400 Myr after the Big Bang.

### 228) [2507.22812](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22812v2): Biased Domain Walls and the Origin of Early Massive Structures

<p> Clara Winckler, Pedro P. Avelino, Lara Sousa </p>
<p>
Discrete symmetry-breaking phase transitions in the early universe may have caused the formation of networks of sheet-like topological defects, usually referred to as domain walls, which separate regions that have settled into different vacuum states. Field theory simulations predict the successive collapse of increasingly larger domains, which could potentially leave observable imprints in present-day large-scale structures. We use a non-parametric analytical model to provide an estimate of the final decay energy of these walls and their associated collapse rate, as a function of redshift. The energy released by collapsing walls can act as a seed for density perturbations in the background matter field, influencing structure formation. We estimate the dependence of the current mass of the resulting non-linear objects on the collapse redshift and wall tension, showing that domain walls can contribute to the formation of objects as massive as present-day galaxy clusters. Still, we confirm that the contribution of standard domain walls to structure formation is subdominant. In contrast, biased domain walls - originating in models with an approximate (or biased) discrete symmetry breaking - generally face much less stringent constraints on their tension, which allows for significantly higher collapse energies. Based on our analysis, we are able to show that the collapse of such biased wall networks can provide a significant contribution to structure formation, and, in particular, a mass excess at z ≳ 7 as suggested by JWST data.

<p>
We present a spectroscopic analysis of a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN) selected as little red dot at z = 5.3 behind the Bullet cluster (Bz5.3), based on JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec data. The detection of strong FeII, OI, and CaII triplet emission lines, along with the evidence of broad Balmer lines, provides strong evidence of a broad-line region (BLR) and an accreting supermassive black hole. Notably, we report the first detection of the &lambda;1304 bump (i.e., blend of OIλ1304 and SiII) at high redshift, a feature commonly seen in local AGNs but not yet reported in the early Universe. The OIλ1304/&lambda;8446 photon ratio provides an independent measurement of dust attenuation in galaxies. In Bz5.3, this ratio is highly suppressed (0.1&ndash;0.3), implying significant internal dust extinction, with estimated dust attenuation A_V ~ 0.4&ndash;1.0. We identify Lyβ fluorescence as the dominant excitation mechanism of the low-ionization lines, with additional contributions from collisional excitation. High OIλ8446 equivalent width and weak OIλ7774 support this interpretation. The detection of iron emission, whether from broad permitted or narrow forbidden lines, supports the presence of a stratified BLR, as also recently proposed in local LRDs. Photoionization modeling of OIλ8446 and CaII further suggests the coexistence of multiple gas phases with distinct densities and ionization states, highlighting the complexity of the BLR. Bz5.3 thus offers a rare window into early AGN activity and BLR physics at early times.

### 230) [2507.20606](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20606v2): Beyond Extreme Burstiness: Evolving Star Formation Efficiency as the Key to Early Galaxy Abundance

<p> Abhijnan Kar, Shadab Alam, Joseph Silk </p>
<p>
JWST observations have revealed an overabundance of bright galaxies at z ≥ 9, creating apparent tensions with theoretical predictions within standard ΛCDM cosmology. We address this challenge using a semi-empirical approach that connects dark matter halos to observed UV luminosity through physically motivated double power-law star formation efficiency (SFE) model as a function of halo mass, redshift and perform joint Bayesian analysis of luminosity functions spanning z = 4 - 16 using combined HST and JWST data. Through systematic model comparison using information criteria (AIC, BIC, DIC), we identify the optimal framework requiring redshift evolution only in the low-mass slope parameter α(z) while maintaining other SFE parameters constant. Our best-fitting model achieves excellent agreement with observations using modest, constant UV scatter σ_UV = 0.32 dex, significantly lower than the ≳ 1.3 dex values suggested by previous studies for z &gt; 13. This reduced scatter requirement is compensated by strongly evolving star formation efficiency, with α increasing toward higher redshifts, indicating enhanced star formation in low-mass halos during cosmic dawn. The model also successfully reproduces another important observational diagnostic such as effective galaxy bias and cosmic Star Formation Density (SFRD) consistently across the full redshift range. Furthermore, model predictions are consistent up to a redshift of z~ 20. Our results demonstrate that JWST's early galaxy observations can be reconciled with standard cosmology through the interplay of modest stochasticity and evolving star formation physics, without invoking extreme burstiness or exotic mechanisms.

<p> A. A. Raikov, V. V. Tsymbal, N. Yu. Lovyagin </p>
<p>
This study is devoted to the cosmological "angular size - redshift" test. An analysis is performed of the angular and linear sizes of galaxies from the new ASTRODEEP-JWST catalogue, which contains over 500,000 objects at high redshifts (up to ~20 photometrically determined and up to ~14 spectroscopically determined). For the calculations, 6 860 galaxies with reliably determined spectroscopic redshifts and 319,771 galaxies with known photometric redshifts were used. The linear sizes of galaxies were computed within the framework of two cosmological models - the standard (ΛCDM) model and one of the static models (the so-called "tired light" model). We have shown that within the framework of the ΛCDM model, a significant evolution of the linear sizes of galaxies is observed, with the rate of the evolution closely matching the rate of the cosmic expansion. In contrast, in the static model, the characteristic linear sizes of galaxies exhibit almost no evolution with increasing z.

Zanella, A. Zitrin </p>
<p>
We present JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy of the Cosmic Gems arc, strongly magnified by the galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0615-5746. Six-hour integration using NIRSpec prism spectroscopy (resolution R≃ 30-300), covering the spectral range 0.8-5.3~μm, reveals a pronounced Lyα-continuum break at λ≃ 1.3~μm, as well as weak optical Hβ and [OIII]&lambda;4959 emission lines at z=9.625±0.002, located in the reddest part of the spectrum (λ&gt; 5.1~μm). No additional ultraviolet or optical emission lines are reliably detected. A weak Balmer break is measured alongside a very blue ultraviolet slope (β≤-2.5, F_λ ~ λ^β). Spectral fitting with \tt Bagpipes suggests that the Cosmic Gems galaxy is in a post-starburst phase, making it the highest-redshift system currently observed in a mini-quenched state. Spatially resolved spectroscopy at tens of parsecs shows relatively uniform features across subcomponents of the arc. These findings align well with the physical properties previously derived from JWST/NIRCam photometry of the stellar clusters, now corroborated by spectroscopic evidence. In particular, five observed star clusters exhibit ages of 7-30~Myr. An updated lens model constrains the intrinsic sizes and masses of these clusters, confirming they are extremely compact and denser than typical star clusters in local star-forming galaxies. Additionally, four compact stellar systems consistent with star clusters (≲10 pc) are identified along the extended tail of the arc. A sub-parsec line-emitting HII region straddling the critical line, lacking a NIRCam counterpart, is also serendipitously detected.

<p>
The combination of the z=0-13.5 cosmic star formation history and active galactic nuclei (AGN) luminosity history as inferred by the James Webb Space Telescope is connected to the cosmic spectral energy distribution (CSED) to explore the sources of reionisation. We compute the redshift evolution of the corresponding cosmic ionising photon emissivity, the neutral fraction and the cosmic microwave background optical depth. We use the generative SED modelling code ProSpect to bracket the ionising emissivity between escape fractions of f<sub>esc</sub> = 1 - 100&percnt; for both the stars and AGN. Stars alone could have achieved reionisation by z≈ 6 with f<sub>esc</sub> ≳ 30&percnt; for solar metallicity (Z=0.02) stars or f<sub>esc</sub> ≳ 10&percnt; for metal-poor (Z=10^-4) stars. On the other hand, AGN by themselves would have struggled to produce sufficiently many ionising photons even with f<sub>esc</sub> = 100&percnt;. A hybrid model containing both stars and AGN is explored where we find best fit (median± 1σ) f<sub>esc</sub>= 12&percnt; (14^+9_-7&percnt;) for the stars and f<sub>esc</sub>= 63&percnt; (60^+28_-32&percnt;) for the AGN, maintained at all redshifts. In essence, the joint growth of stellar mass and supermassive black holes produces neither more nor fewer ionising photons than needed to reionise ≳ 99&percnt; of the intergalactic medium by z≈ 6.

### 234) [2507.15436](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15436v2): Semi-empirical Framework of Supermassive Black Hole Evolution: Highlighting a possible tension between Demographics and Gravitational Wave Background

<p> Andrea Lapi, Francesco Shankar, Michele Bosi, Daniel Roberts, Hao Fu, Karthik M. Varadarajan, Lumen Boco </p>
<p>
The evolution of the supermassive Black Hole (BH) population across cosmic times remains a central unresolved issue in modern astrophysics, due to the many noticeable uncertainties in the involved physical processes that span a huge range of spatial, temporal and energy scales. Here we tackle the problem via a semi-empirical approach with minimal assumptions and data-driven inputs. This is based on a continuity plus Smoluchowski equation framework that allows to unitarily describe the two primary modes of BH growth: gas accretion and binary mergers. Key quantities related to the latter processes are incorporated through educated parameterizations, and then constrained in a Bayesian setup from joint observational estimates of the local BH mass function, of the large-scale BH clustering, and of the nano-Hz stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background measured from Pulsar Timimg Array (PTA) experiments. We find that the BH accretion-related parameters are strongly dependent on the local BH mass function determination: higher normalizations and flatter high-mass slopes in the latter imply lower radiative efficiencies and mean Eddington ratios with a stronger redshift evolution. Additionally, the binary BH merger rate is estimated to be a fraction ≲ 10^-1 of the galaxy merger rate derived from galaxy pairs counts by ttJWST, and constrained not to exceed the latter at ≳ 2σ. Relatedly, we highlight hints of a possible tension between current constraints on BH demographics and the interpretation of the nano-Hz GW background as predominantly caused by binary BH mergers. Specifically, we bound the latter's contribution to ≲ 30-50&percnt; at ~ 3σ, suggesting that additional astrophysical/cosmological sources are needed to explain the residual part of the signal measured by PTA experiments.

<p>
A majority of JWST/NIRSpec/IFU studies at high redshifts to date have focused on UV-bright or massive objects, while our understanding of low-mass galaxies at early cosmic times remains limited. In this work, we present NIRSpec/IFS high-resolution observations of two low-mass (M_* &lt; 10^9  M<sub>&odot;</sub>), low-metallicity ([12 + log(O/H)] &lt; 8) galaxies at z ~ 7.66, one of which we identify as hosting a Type-II AGN. We measure flat strong-line metallicity gradients, suggestive of ISM redistribution by outflows or past merging, but also identify tension with the direct-T_e metallicity gradient in one galaxy. We measure v_rot/σ&lt; 1 in both galaxies, consistent with observations of lower rotational support at early cosmic times. We identify broad kinematical components decoupled from galactic rotation with velocities of ~ 250 - 500  km  s<sup>-1</sup> and argue these components trace outflows, for which we infer outflow rates of ~ 8 - 14  M<sub>&odot;</sub>  yr^-1 with v_out/v<sub>esc</sub> ~ 1. We compare our findings to results from the new large-volume AESOPICA simulations, which fully incorporate different models of black hole growth and AGN feedback. We find that our observational results of v_out/v<sub>esc</sub> are consistent with the simulated dwarf AGN population, hinting AGN-driven feedback may contribute to quenching both in our systems and in a wider population of low-mass galaxies in the early Universe. This novel study illustrates the necessity of deep IFU observations to decompose the complex kinematics and morphology of high-z galaxies, trace outflows, and constrain the effect of feedback in the early Universe.

<p> Yinuo Han, Ryan M. T. White, Joseph R. Callingham, Ryan M. Lau, Benjamin J. S. Pope, Noel D. Richardson, Peter G. Tuthill </p>
<p>
Carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are significant contributors of carbonaceous dust to the galactic environment, however the mechanisms and conditions for formation and subsequent evolution of dust around these stars remain open questions. Here we present JWST observations of the WR+WR colliding-wind binary Apep which reveal an intricate series of nested concentric dust shells that are abundant in detailed substructure. The striking regularity in these substructures between successive shells suggests an exactly repeating formation mechanism combined with a highly stable outflow that maintains a consistent morphology even after reaching 0.6 pc (assuming a distance of 2.4 kpc) into the interstellar medium. The concentric dust shells show subtle deviations from spherical outflow, which could reflect orbital modulation along the eccentric binary orbit or non-sphericity in the stellar wind. Tracking the evolution of dust across the multi-tiered structure, we measure the dust temperature evolution that can broadly be described assuming an amorphous carbon composition in radiative thermal equilibrium with the central stars. The temperature profile and orbital period place new distance constraints that support Apep being at a greater distance than previously estimated, reducing the line-of-sight and sky-plane wind speed discrepancy previously thought to characterise the system.

<p>
JWST observations have revealed a population of high-redshift "little red dots" (LRDs) that challenge conventional AGN models. We report the discovery of three local LRDs at z = 0.1-0.2, initially selected from the SDSS database, with follow-up optical/near-IR spectroscopy and photometry. They exhibit properties fully consistent with those of high-redshift LRDs, including broad hydrogen and helium emission lines, compact morphologies, V-shaped UV-optical SED, declining near-IR continua, and no significant variability. Two sources were targeted but not detected in X-rays with statistical significance. All three sources show blue-shifted He I absorption, while two exhibit Hα and Na D absorption lines. We detect full Balmer and Paschen line series in all three objects, along with abundant narrow [Fe II] emission in two. The emission line analyses suggest narrow lines originate from AGN-powered, metal-poor regions with minimal dust; broad lines come from inner regions with exceptionally high density or atypical dust properties; and [Fe II] emission arises from dense gas between broad and narrow-line regions. One of our objects, J1025+1402 (nicknamed The~Egg), shows extremely high equivalent width Na D, K I, and Ca II triplet absorption lines, along with other potential low-ionization absorption features, suggesting the presence of a cool (~5000 K), metal-enriched gas envelope. The optical/near-IR continua of these LRDs are also consistent with theoretical models featuring an atmosphere around black holes. The WISE-detected IR emission is consistent with weak dust emission of T ~ 10^2-10^3 K. We propose a conceptual model consisting of a largely thermalized cool-gas envelope surrounding the central black hole and an extended emission line region with high-density outflowing gas to explain the observed properties of these local LRDs.

### 238) [2507.09085](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09085v2): Little Red Dots As Late-stage Quasi-stars

<p> Mitchell C. Begelman, Jason Dexter </p>
<p>
We argue that the "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) discovered with the James Webb Space Telescope are quasi-stars in their late stages of evolution. Quasi-stars are hypothetical objects predicted to form following the core collapse of supermassive stars, and consist of black holes accreting from massive envelopes at a super-Eddington rate. We show that models of late-stage quasi-stars, with black hole masses exceeding ~ 10&percnt; of the total, predict thermal and radiative properties that are insensitive to both black hole and envelope mass, and spectrally resemble LRDs. Specifically, we show that they are likely to exhibit reddish colors, a strong Balmer break, and possess conditions favorable to the production of Balmer lines that are broadened by electron scattering. Their huge electron column densities suppress any X-rays. Late-stage quasi-stars, with black hole masses ≳ 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, should dominate the overall quasi-star population. Their short predicted lifetimes (tens of Myr), coupled with the high observed comoving density of LRDs, suggest that most or all supermassive black holes go through a quasi-star/LRD phase during their formation and growth.

We present 0.3-21mic observations at ~275d and ~400d for Type II supernova (SN) 2024ggi, combining ground-based optical and near-infrared data from the Keck I/II telescopes and space-based infrared data from the James Webb Space Telescope. Although the optical regions dominate the observed flux, SN2024ggi is bright at infrared wavelengths (65%/35% falls each side of 1mic). SN2024ggi exhibits a plethora of emission lines from H, He, intermediate-mass elements (O, Na, Mg, S, Ar, Ca), and iron-group elements (IGEs; Fe, Co, and Ni) &ndash; all lines have essentially the same width, suggesting efficient macroscopic chemical mixing of the inner ejecta at &lt;~2000km/s and little mixing of 56Ni at larger velocities. Molecular emission in the infrared range is dominated by the CO fundamental, which radiates about 5% of the total SN luminosity. A molecule-free radiative-transfer model based on a standard red-supergiant star explosion (i.e., ~1e51erg, 0.06M<sub>&odot;</sub> of 56Ni from a 15.2M<sub>&odot;</sub> progenitor) yields a satisfactory match throughout the optical and infrared at both epochs. The SN2024ggi CO luminosity is comparable to the fractional decay-power absorbed in the model C/O-rich shell &ndash; accounting for CO cooling would likely resolve the model overestimate of the [OI]0.632mic flux. The relative weakness of the molecular emission in SN2024ggi and the good overall match obtained with our molecule-free model suggests negligible microscopic mixing &ndash; about 95% of the SN luminosity is radiated by atoms and ions. Lines from IGEs, which form from explosion ashes at such late times, are ideal diagnostics of the magnitude of 56Ni mixing in core-collapse SN ejecta. Stable Ni, clearly identified in SN2024ggi (e.g., [NiII]6.634mic), is probably a common product of massive-star explosions.

One of JWST's most remarkable discoveries is a population of compact red galaxies known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Their existence raises many questions about their nature, origin, and evolution. These galaxies show a steep decline in number density-nearly two orders of magnitude-from z=6 to z=3. In this study, we explore their potential evolution by identifying candidate descendants in CEERS, assuming a single evolutionary path: the development of a blue star-forming outskirt around the red compact core. Our color-magnitude selection identifies galaxies as red as LRDs at z&lt;4, surrounded by young, blue stellar outskirts. Morphological parameters were derived from single Sérsic profile fits; physical properties were obtained from SED fitting using a stellar-only model. These "post-LRD" candidates show LRD-like features with M<sub>&ast;</sub> ~ 10^10  M<sub>&odot;</sub> , central densities ( Σ<sub>&ast;</sub> ~ 10^11  M<sub>&odot;</sub>  kpc^-2 ), compact sizes, and red rest-frame colors, but with an added extended component. Their number density at z = 3 ± 0.5 ( ~ 10^-4.15   Mpc^-3 ) matches that of LRDs at 5 &lt; z &lt; 7 , supporting a possible evolutionary link. We observe a redshift-dependent increase in outskirts mass fraction and galaxy size-from ~ 250 pc at z = 5 to ~ 600 pc at z = 3 -suggesting global stellar growth. Meanwhile, the core remains red and compact, but the V-shaped SED fades as the outskirts grow. These findings support an evolutionary scenario in which LRDs gradually acquire an extended stellar component over cosmic time by cold accretion. This may explain the apparent decline in their observed number density at lower redshift.

<p>
We present a sample of z<sub>phot</sub>~10-16 galaxies by exploiting one of the richest JWST NIRCam imaging data, taken in the CANUCS survey in Cycle 1 and the Technicolor (TEC) survey in Cycle 2. The combination of the CANUCS+TEC provides multi-epoch, deep NIRCam images in all medium bands (MBs) and broad bands (BBs) onboard NIRCam (22 filters in total), over ~23 arcmin<sup>2</sup> in three independent lines of sight. We select high-z galaxy candidates based on photometric redshifts, and obtain eight candidates at z~10-16, including a very robust candidate at z~15.4. The ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function (LF) from our sample is consistent with previous JWST studies showing a scatter of ~0.6 dex across the literature, marking the significance of the field-to-field variance in interpreting galaxy abundance measurements at z&gt;10. We find that the UV LF moderately evolves at z&gt;10, and the LF normalization and the luminosity density decline by a factor of ~7 from z~11 to z~15, indicating less steep evolution than z&lt;11. We highlight the importance of MB filters, not only to minimize the contamination by low-z interlopers but also to maximize the completeness. In particular, faint and less blue galaxies could be missed when the sample is built solely on BB data. The contamination and incompleteness of BB-only selected samples can bias our views of earliest galaxy evolution at z&gt;10, including the UV LF by ~0.6 dex, the size-magnitude relation by ~0.6 dex, and the UV slope-magnitude relation by Δβ_UV~-0.3.

We present a sample of 53 galaxy spectra at z<sub>spec</sub> ~ 5-12 from the JWST CEERS and RUBIES surveys, combining NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy with NIRCam photometry. We aim to use these data to establish best practices for measuring the UV spectral slope (β) in the era of JWST. We adopt power-law fits to the rest-frame UV continuum from the spectroscopic data as our fiducial, or `true', β values, and compare them to photometric estimates derived through four methods: (1) photometric power-law fitting, (2) power-law fitting to an SED model fitted to the photometry, (3) single-color fitting near the Lyman break, and (4) single-color fitting at fixed rest-frame wavelengths. We find that photometric power-law fitting most closely recovers the spectroscopic slopes, with minimal bias and scatter. SED fitting performs moderately well, and can be preferable in cases of low signal-to-noise where photometric power-law fitting may become unreliable. Single-color estimates, while commonly used in past studies, show the most significant deviations and are not recommended when more than a single color is available. Our results highlight the limitations and strengths of each approach and provide practical guidance for measuring β from photometry when spectra are unavailable or are of insufficient quality.

<p>
Massive stars at cosmological distances can be individually detected during transient microlensing events, when gravitational lensing magnifications may exceed ~1000. Nine such sources were identified in JWST NIRCam imaging of a single galaxy at redshift z=0.94 known as the "Warhol arc,'' which is mirror-imaged by the galaxy cluster MACSJ0416.1-2403. Here we present the discovery of two coincident and well-characterized microlensing events at the same location followed by a third event observed in a single filter approximately 18 months later. The events can be explained by microlensing of a binary star system consisting of a red supergiant (T ~ 4000 K) and a B-type (T ~ 13,000 K) companion star. The timescale of the coincident microlensing events constrains the estimated projected source-plane size to tens of AU. The most likely binary configurations consistent with the observational constraints on the temperature and luminosity of each star are stars with initial masses M1=23.6+5.3-4.3 Msol and an initial mass ratio between the two stars close to unity. A kinematic model that reproduces the observed light curve in all filters gives a relatively small transverse velocity of 50 km/s. This requires the dominant velocity component of several hundreds of km/s to be roughly parallel to the microcaustic. An alternative possibility would be that the three microlensing events correspond to unrelated stars crossing distinct microcaustics, but this would imply a highly elevated rate of events at their common position, even though no underlying knot is present at the location.

We present stellar atmosphere modeling of JWST NIRCam photometry of nine highly magnified individual stars in a single galaxy at redshift z=0.94 known as the Warhol arc, which is strongly lensed by the galaxy cluster MACSJ0416. Seven of these transients were identified by Yan et al. (2023). The nine sources are all likely red supergiants with temperatures of T~4000K. We present new longslit spectroscopy of the Warhol arc acquired with Keck-I and the Large Binocular Telescope, and use these data to constrain the arc's oxygen abundance to be 12+log(O/H)=8.45+-0.08. We perform a microlensing simulation on synthetic stellar populations using a range of stellar metallicities and initial mass function slopes. The temperature distribution of the simulated detectable stars is sensitive to the choice of stellar metallicity, and setting the stellar metallicity equal to the arc's nebular metallicity (log(Z*/Zsun)=-0.24) produces a simulated temperature distribution that is consistent with the observations, while lower stellar metallicities (log(Z*/Zsun)&lt;-0.75) produce simulated temperatures that are inconsistent with the observations. The expected detection rate is strongly anticorrelated with the IMF slope for alpha&gt;1.2. For the canonical IMF slope alpha=2.35, the simulation yields expected transient detection rates that agree with the observed detection rates in the HST Flashlights filters, but over predicts the detection rate by a factor of ~3-12 (&lt;2sigma tension) in the JWST filters. The simulated detection rate is sensitive to the choice of stellar metallicity, with lower metallicities (log(Z*/Zsun)&lt;-0.75) yielding a significantly lower simulated detection rate that further reduces the modest tension with the observations.

Spatially resolved multi-wavelength analysis is essential to study galaxy formation and evolution. A UV-bright galaxy COS-2987030247 at z = 6.81 is one of the Rosetta Stones in the epoch of reionization for which JWST NIRSpec Integral Field Spectroscopy, NIRCam imaging, and ALMA data are available thanks to the RIOJA program. We identified the rest-frame optical emission lines from the ionized hydrogen, oxygen, and neon gas. The \OIII 5008Å line emission and the NIRCam images show a complex kinematical and morphological structure where two bright main and three faint clumps are identified in a 10 kpc extent. The system is not classified as a purely rotation-dominated disk. The multiple clumps are instead consistent with a merger-related origin, including either distinct galaxies in interaction or star-forming clumps formed through tidal gas compression during a merger. The spatially resolved emission line fluxes show that dust attenuation, metal enrichment, and ionization parameter are preferentially enhanced in the star formation peaks. Our SED fitting suggests that the main clumps are in a moderately dust-attenuated star forming phase (A_V = 0.2&ndash;0.3 and SFR(Hα) ~ 10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1) with almost zero escape fraction of ionizing photons. In contrast, the sub-clumps are dust-free and lying on or below the main sequence of star-forming galaxies. These sub-clumps may work as a perturber that triggers the clumpy starburst in the surrounding gas through the merger event.

Light reprocessed by dust grains emitting in the infrared allows the study of the physics at play in dusty, embedded regions, where ultraviolet and optical wavelengths are attenuated. Infrared telescopes such as JWST have made it possible to study the earliest feedback phases, when stars are shielded by cocoons of gas and dust. This phase is crucial for unravelling the effects of feedback from young stars, leading to their emergence and the dispersal of their host molecular clouds. Here we show that the transition from the embedded to the exposed phase of star formation is short (&lt; 4 Myr) and sometimes almost absent (&lt; 1 Myr), across a sample of 37 nearby star-forming galaxies, covering a wide range of morphologies from massive barred spirals to irregular dwarfs. The short duration of the dust-clearing timescales suggests a predominant role of pre-supernova feedback mechanisms in revealing newborn stars, confirming previous results on smaller samples and allowing, for the first time, a statistical analysis of their dependencies. We find that the timescales associated with mid-infrared emission at 21 μm, tracing a dust-embedded feedback phase, are controlled by a complex interplay between giant molecular cloud properties (masses and velocity dispersions) and galaxy morphology. We report relatively longer durations of the embedded phase of star formation in barred spiral galaxies, while this phase is significantly reduced in low-mass irregular dwarf galaxies. We discuss tentative trends with gas-phase metallicity, which may favor faster cloud dispersal at low metallicities.

### 247) [2506.22540](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22540v2): A systematic search for dormant galaxies at z~5-7 from the JWST NIRSpec archive

JWST has revealed a population of "dormant'' galaxies at z&gt;5 that have recently halted their star formation and are characterized by weak emission lines and significant Balmer breaks. Until now, only four such galaxies have been reported at z&gt;5, three with low stellar masses, M_*&lt;10^9M<sub>&odot;</sub> (so-called mini-quenched galaxies), and one massive quiescent galaxy with M_*=10^10.2M<sub>&odot;</sub>; no such galaxy had been reported at intermediate masses. Here, we present a systematic search for dormant galaxies at 5&lt;z&lt;7.4 that halted star formation at least 10 Myr before the time of observation. To do this, we made use of all the publicly available NIRSpec prism data in the DAWN JWST Archive (DJA) and selected galaxies with low Hα equivalent widths (EW_0&lt;50Å) and strong Balmer breaks (F_ν,4200/F_ν,3500&gt;1.4). We find 14 dormant galaxies with stellar masses ranging from 10^7.6-10^10.5, revealing an intermediate-mass population. By construction, these 14 sources are located about 1 dex below the star-forming main sequence. Their star formation histories suggest that they halted star formation between 10 and 25 Myr before the time of observation which, according to models, is comparable with the timescales of internally regulated bursts driving a "breathing'' mode of star formation. Our results show that ~1&percnt; of the galaxies in the DJA are in a dormant phase of their star formation histories, and they span a wide stellar mass range. These galaxies can be empirically selected using only their spectral features in NIRSpec prism data.

<p>
Chemically homogeneously evolving stars have been proposed to account for several exotic phenomena, including gravitational-wave emissions and gamma-ray bursts. Here we study whether these stars can explain the metal-poor dwarf galaxy I Zwicky 18. We apply our synthetic spectral models from Paper II to (i) establish a classification sequence for these hot stars, (ii) predict the photonionizing flux and the strength of emission lines from a IZw18-like stellar population, and (iii) compare our predictions to available observations of this galaxy. Adding two new models computed with PoWR, we report (i) these stars to follow a unique sequence of classes: O-&gt;WN-&gt;WO (i.e. without ever being WC). From our population synthesis with standard assumptions, we predict that (ii) the source of the UV C-IV and other emission bumps is a couple dozen WO-type Wolf-Rayet stars (not WC as previously assumed) which are the result of chem. hom. evolution, while these, combined with the rest of the O-star population, account for the He-II ionizing flux and spectral hardness. Contrasting our results against published optical and UV data and accounting for different aperture sizes and spatial regions probed by the observations, we find that (iii) our models are highly consistent with them. Since our "massive Pop II stars" might just as well exist in early star-forming regions, our findings have implications for upcoming JWST surveys; and given that our results apply for binary populations too as long as the same fraction (10%) of the systems evolves chem. homogeneously, we conclude that the stellar progenitors of gravitational waves may very well exist today in IZw18.

We use JWST/NIRSpec observations of the radio galaxy 3C 293 to map the emission, extinction, and kinematics of hot molecular and ionized gas, as well as stellar kinematics, within the inner ~ 2 kpc. The stellar velocity field is well described by a rotating disk model, with its kinematical center offset by ~ 0.5 arcsec from the continuum peak. The hot molecular gas is traced by the H<sub>2</sub>2.12μm emission line, and the ionized gas by [Fe II]1.64μm and Paα. The gas presents three main kinematic components: a rotating disk seen as a narrow component (σ ~ 100 kms<sup>-1</sup>); a blueshifted broad outflow (σ ~ 250 kms<sup>-1</sup>); and a fast ionized outflow as a very broad component (σ ~ 640 kms<sup>-1</sup>). Extinction maps reveal high A_V values, up to ~ 35, spatially coincident with dust lanes seen in optical images. In addition to the disk and outflows components, inflows along the dust lanes are detected in H<sub>2</sub> gas, with a mass inflow rate of M&#775;_in ~ 4 x 10^-4 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1, which is lower than the AGN accretion rate. For the outflows, we derive peak mass-outflow rates of 0.08 ± 0.02 M<sub>&odot;</sub>yr^-1 (molecular) and 6.5 ± 1.7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>yr^-1 (ionized). The outflow, driven by the radio jet, has a kinetic power of 5.7% of the jet power - enough to suppress star formation. Our results highlight 3C 293's turbulent post-merger history and JWST's unique capability to probe dust-obscured AGN.

[Abridged] We analyse the dark matter (DM) halo properties of 127 0.3&lt;z&lt;1.5 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) down to low stellar masses (8&lt;log(Mstar/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;11), using data from the MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field Survey and photometry from HST and JWST. We employ a 3D forward modelling approach to analyse the morpho-kinematics of our sample, enabling measurement of individual rotation curves out to 2-3 times the effective radius. We perform a disk-halo decomposition with a 3D parametric model that includes stellar, gas, and DM components, with pressure support corrections. We validate our methodology on mock data cubes generated from idealised disk simulations. We select the best-fitting DM model among six density profiles, including the Navarro-Frenk-White and the generalised alpha-beta-gamma profile of Di Cintio et al. (2014, DC14). Our Bayesian analysis shows that DC14 performs as well as or better than the other profiles in &gt;80% of the sample. We find that the kinematically inferred stellar masses agree with values from SED fitting. We find that 89% of galaxies have DM fractions &gt;50%. For 66% of SFGs, we infer a DM inner slope, gamma &lt; 0.5, indicating cored DM profiles, but no correlation is found between gamma and star formation rate of the sample. The stellar- and concentration-mass relations agree with theoretical expectations, but with larger scatter. We confirm the anticorrelation between halo scale radius and DM density. The halo scale radii and DM surface densities increase with Mstar, while DM densities stay constant. We find tentative evidence of an evolution of the DM density with z, which suggests that the DM halos of intermediate-z systems are denser than those of local galaxies. In contrast, the halo scale radii are z-invariant.

<p>
As part of the N2CLS Survey, we have identified a remarkable overdensity of eight bright dusty star-forming galaxies at z~5.2 in the GOODS-N field. Three of these galaxies, N2GN_1_01, 06, and 23 (known as GN10, HDF850.1, and S3, respectively), had previously been spectroscopically confirmed as members of the exceptional large-scale structure at z~5.1-5.3, which is notably elongated along the line of sight, spanning 30 cMpc. We present the spectroscopic confirmation of N2GN_1_13 at z<sub>spec</sub>=5.182, a massive dusty star-forming galaxy identified through targeted NOEMA observations, and N2GN_1_61 at z<sub>spec</sub>=5.201, revealed using JWST/FRESCO data. In addition to these five spectroscopically confirmed members, we identify three further candidates with photometric redshifts consistent with the overdense structure. These galaxies are massive (with a median stellar mass of 9x 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) and highly obscured (with a median A_V of 3.3), caught in a short-lived yet extreme starburst phase at z~5.2. Their high SFRs (with a median of 590 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1), efficient baryon to stellar mass conversion (ε<sub>&sext;</sub>&gt;20%), substantial gas reservoir and dust content, suggest rapid evolution and imminent quenching. Six of these galaxies reside in overdense filaments; the remaining two may trace new distinct structures which will have to be spectroscopically confirmed. These few dusty galaxies dominate the star formation within the overdensity, contributing more than the numerous H_α emitters, and surpassing the cosmic average star formation rate density for this epoch. Their properties suggest an accelerated evolution that current models and simulations have difficulty reproducing.

<p> Francesco D'Eramo, Alessandro Lenoci, Ariane Dekker </p>
<p>
The suppression of cosmological structure at small scales is a key signature of dark matter (DM) produced via freeze-in in the low-mass regime. We present a comprehensive analysis of its impact, incorporating recent constraints from Milky Way satellite counts, strong gravitational lensing with JWST data, and the Lyman-α forest. We adopt a general strategy to translate existing warm dark matter (WDM) bounds into lower mass limits for a broad class of DM candidates characterized by quasi-thermal phase space distributions. The benefits of this approach include computational efficiency and the ability to explore a wide range of models. We derive model-independent bounds for DM produced via two-body decays, scatterings, and three-body decays, and apply the framework to concrete scenarios such as the Higgs portal, sterile neutrinos, axion-like particles, and the dark photon portal. Results from specific models confirm the validity of the model-independent analysis.

### 253) [2506.08116](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08116v2): The properties of primordially-seeded black holes and their hosts in the first billion years: implications for JWST

<p> Pratika Dayal, Roberto maiolino </p>
<p>
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have opened a tantalising new window onto possible black holes as early as redshifts of z ~ 10.4. These show a number of puzzling properties including unexpectedly massive black holes in place by z ~ 10 and inexplicably high black hole-to-stellar mass ratios of M_BH/M_*≥ 0.1. These pose a serious challenge for "astrophysical" seeding and growth models that we aim to explain with "cosmological" primordial black holes (PBHs) in this work. We present PHANES, an analytic framework that follows the evolution of dark matter halos, and their baryons in the first billion years, seeded by a population of PBHs with seed masses between 10^0.5-10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. PBH seeded models yield a black hole mass function that extends between 10^1.25-11.25 ~(10^0.75-7.25)M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z ~ 5 (15) for the different models considered in this work. Interestingly, PBH-seeded models (with spin s=0 or -1) naturally result in extremely high values of M_BH/M_*≥ 0.25 at z ~ 5-15. For a typical stellar mass of M_* =10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, we find an average value of M_BH/M_* ~ 0.4~ (1.6) for s=0~(-1) at z=5, providing a smoking gun for PBH-seeded models. Another particularity of PBH-seeded models is their ability of producing systems with high black hole-to-stellar mass ratios that are extremely metal poor (Z ≤ 10^-2~Z<sub>&odot;</sub>). Yielding a PBH-to-dark matter fraction ≤ 10^-9 and a stellar mass function that lies four orders of magnitude below observations, our model is in accord with all current cosmological and astrophysical bounds.

### 254) [2506.04336](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04336v3): Simulation-based inference of galaxy properties from JWST pixels

<p>
We present an efficient Bayesian SED-fitting framework tailored to multiwavelength pixel photometry from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). Our method employs simulation-based inference to enable rapid posterior sampling across galaxy pixels, leveraging the unprecedented spatial resolution, wavelength coverage, and depth provided by the survey. It is trained on synthetic photometry generated from MILES stellar population models, incorporating both parametric and non-parametric SFHs, realistic noise, and JADES-like filter sensitivity thresholds. We validate this amortised inference approach on mock datasets, achieving robust and well-calibrated posterior distributions, with an R^2 score of 0.99 for stellar mass. Applying our pipeline to real observations, we derive spatially resolved maps of stellar population properties down to S/N_pixel=5 (averaged over F277W, F356W, F444W) for 1083 JADES galaxies and ~2 million pixels with spectroscopic redshifts. These maps enable the identification of dusty or starburst regions and offer insights into mass growth and the structural assembly. We assess the outshining phenomenon by comparing pixel-based and integrated stellar mass estimates, finding limited impact only in low-mass galaxies (&lt;10^8M<sub>&odot;</sub>) but systematic differences of ~0.20 dex linked to SFH priors. With an average posterior sampling speed of 10^-4 seconds per pixel and a total inference time of ~1 CPU-day for the full dataset, our model offers a scalable solution for extracting high-fidelity stellar population properties from HST+JWST datasets, opening the way for statistical studies at sub-galactic scales.

<p>
The COSMOS-Web survey, with its unparalleled combination of multiband data, notably, near-infrared imaging from JWST's NIRCam (F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W), provides a transformative dataset down to ~28 mag (F444W) for studying galaxy evolution. In this work, we employ Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), an unsupervised machine learning method, to estimate key physical parameters of galaxies &ndash; redshift, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), specific SFR (sSFR), and age &ndash; directly from photometric data out to z=3.5. SOMs efficiently project high-dimensional galaxy color information onto 2D maps, showing how physical properties vary among galaxies with similar spectral energy distributions. We first validate our approach using mock galaxy catalogs from the HORIZON-AGN simulation, where the SOM accurately recovers the true parameters, demonstrating its robustness. Applying the method to COSMOS-Web observations, we find that the SOM delivers robust estimates despite the increased complexity of real galaxy populations. Performance metrics (σ_NMAD typically between 0.1&ndash;0.3, and Pearson correlation between 0.7 and 0.9) confirm the precision of the method, with ~ 70&percnt; of predictions within 1σ dex of reference values. Although redshift estimation in COSMOS-Web remains challenging (median σ_NMAD = 0.04), the overall success of the highlights its potential as a powerful and interpretable tool for galaxy parameter estimation.

<p>
Dwarf galaxies provide powerful laboratories for studying galaxy formation physics. Their early assembly, shallow gravitational potentials, and bursty, clustered star formation histories make them especially sensitive to the processes that regulate baryons through multi-phase outflows. Using high-resolution, cosmological zoom-in simulations of a dwarf galaxy from itthe Pandora suite, we explore the impact of stellar radiation, magnetic fields, and cosmic ray feedback on star formation, outflows, and metal retention. We find that our purely hydrodynamical model without non-thermal physics - in which supernova feedback is boosted to reproduce realistic stellar mass assembly - drives violent, overly enriched outflows that suppress the metal content of the host galaxy. Including radiation reduces the clustering of star formation and weakens feedback. However, the additional incorporation of cosmic rays produces fast, mass-loaded, multi-phase outflows consisting of both ionized and neutral gas components, in better agreement with observations. These outflows, which entrain a denser, more temperate ISM, exhibit broad metallicity distributions while preserving metals within the galaxy. Furthermore, the star formation history becomes more bursty, in agreement with recent JWST findings. These results highlight the essential role of non-thermal physics in galaxy evolution and the need to incorporate it in future galaxy formation models.

### 257) [2505.22600](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22600v2): Dust Budget Crisis in Little Red Dots

<p> Kejian Chen, Zhengrong Li, Kohei Inayoshi, Luis C. Ho </p>
<p>
Little red dots (LRDs), a population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) recently identified by JWST, are characterized by their compact morphology and red optical continuum emission, which is often interpreted as evidence for significant dust extinction of A_V ≳ 3 mag. However, the dust-reddened AGN scenario is increasingly challenged by their faint near-to-far infrared emission and a potential "dust budget crisis" in cases when the host galaxy is either undetectably low-mass or absent. In this study, we re-evaluate the dust extinction level in LRDs by modeling the UV-to-infrared spectra for various extinction laws and a broad range of dusty distribution parameters. Comparing the predicted infrared fluxes with observational data from the JWST MIRI, Herschel, and ALMA, our analysis finds that the visual extinction is tightly and consistently constrained to A_V ≲ 1.0-1.5 mag for A2744-45924, RUBIES-BLAGN-1, and stacked SEDs from a large sample of LRDs under the SMC extinction law, with slightly weaker constraints for those with gray extinction in the UV range. The revised A_V values yield radiative efficiencies of ~ 10&percnt; for the LRD population, easing the tension with the Sołtan argument for the bulk AGN population at lower redshifts. Moreover, this moderate extinction (or dust-free) scenario, with reprocessed emission spectra testable by future far-infrared observatories, provides a paradigm shift in understanding their natures, environments, and evolutionary pathways of massive black holes in the early universe.

<p> Patrick LaChance, Rupert A. C. Croft, Tiziana Di Matteo, Yihao Zhou, Fabio Pacucci, Yueying Ni, Nianyi Chen, Simeon Bird </p>
<p>
We present simulated counterparts of the "Little Red Dot'' (LRD) galaxies observed with JWST, using the large cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, ASTRID. We create mock observations of the galaxies (5 ≤ z ≤ 8) in ASTRID, and find seventeen which fit the color and size criteria of LRDs. These LRDs are galaxies with high stellar masses (log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 9.7), and massive black holes (log(M_BH/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 6.8). The host galaxies are dense, with stellar half mass radii (325 pc ≤ r_half,* ≤ 620 pc), and dust attenuation in the F444W band above 1.25. Their star formation has been recently quenched. They host relatively bright AGN that are dust-obscured and contribute significantly to the rest-frame optical red slope and have relatively low luminosity in the rest-frame ultraviolet, where the host galaxy's stars are more dominant. These LRDs are in an evolutionary phase of miniquenching that is the result of AGN feedback from their massive black holes. The LRDs in ASTRID are bright with F444W magnitudes of 23.5-25.5. The less massive and fainter galaxies in ASTRID lack the dust concentration necessary to produce the red slope of an LRD, though this could be an effect of limited resolution. Most of the highest Eddington black holes are not LRDs due to insufficient dust attenuation from their host galaxies, which are also experiencing relatively high star formation rates. This results in their spectra being too flat, despite their highly accreting black holes.

### 259) [2505.12505](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12505v2): Connecting JWST discovered N/O-enhanced galaxies to globular clusters: Evidence from chemical imprints

<p> Xihan Ji, Vasily Belokurov, Roberto Maiolino, Stephanie Monty, Yuki Isobe, Andrey Kravtsov, William McClymont, Hannah Übler </p>
<p>
Recent JWST observations have revealed a growing population of galaxies at z&gt;4 with elevated nitrogen-to-oxygen ratios. These "N/O-enhanced" galaxies (NOEGs) exhibit near- to super-solar N/O at sub-solar O/H, clearly deviating from the well-established scaling relation between N/O and O/H observed in local galaxies. The origin of this abundance anomaly is unclear. Interestingly, local globular clusters also exhibit anomalous light-element abundances, whose origin remains debated. In this work, we compare the chemical abundance patterns of 22 known NOEGs at 0≲ z≲ 12 &ndash; primarily discovered with JWST &ndash; to those observed in local globular clusters. We find similarities in the abundances of C, N, O, Fe, and He between the two populations. The similar abundance patterns support the scenario in which globular cluster stars formed within proto-cluster environments &ndash; similar to those traced by NOEGs &ndash; that were self-enriched. Indeed, the enhancement in N/O in early galaxies appears to be only found in dense stellar environments with Σ<sub>&sext;</sub>≳ 10^2.5~M<sub>&odot;</sub>~pc^-2, as expected for the progenitors of globular clusters in the Milky Way, and similar to those of star clusters identified in strongly lensed high-redshift galaxies. Furthermore, we find a tentative positive correlation between N/O ratios and stellar mass among NOEGs. The apparent high occurrence rate of NOEGs at high redshift is consistent with the picture of cluster-dominated star formation during the early stages of galaxy evolution. Measuring chemical abundances across diverse stellar environments in high-redshift galaxies will be crucial for elucidating the connection between NOEGs and globular clusters.

### 260) [2505.12397](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12397v3): Unveiling the Ionized and Neutral ISM at z &gt; 10 : The Origin of [O III] /[C II] Ratios from a Sub-parsec Resolution Radiative Transfer Simulation

<p> Yurina Nakazato, Kazuyuki Sugimura, Akio K. Inoue, Massimo Ricotti </p>
<p>
Recent multi-wavelength observations by JWST and ALMA are unveiling both ionized and neutral ISM components in high-redshift (z&gt;6) galaxies. In this work, we investigate the origin of rest-frame far-infrared [OIII]88 μm and [CII]158 μm emission by performing zoom-in cosmological simulations of dwarf-galaxy progenitors at z=9-13. Our simulations incorporate on-the-fly radiative transfer at sub-pc (~ 0.1 pc) resolution, allowing us to resolve the multi-phase ISM. We compute emission lines on a cell-by-cell basis, taking into account local temperature, density, metallicity, radiation field strength, column density, and spectral hardness of radiation bins. We find that [OIII] predominantly arises from centrally located ionizing bubbles with temperatures of ~ (1-5)× 10^4 K and high ionization parameters of log U<sub>ion</sub> ≃ -1.5. In contrast, [CII] is produced in the surrounding dense neutral regions at ~ 5× 10^3 K, which are heated by strong FUV radiation (G/G_0 ~ 10^3-5) from the central stellar clusters. This spatial arrangement leads to large local variations in [OIII]/[CII], ranging from ~ 100 to 0.01. Our galaxy reproduces the global ratio [OIII]/[CII]~5-30, consistent with recent ALMA detections at z&gt;6 without invoking enhanced O/C abundance ratios. We further derive that [OIII]/[CII] linearly scales with the mass and density ratios of ionized to neutral gas, M_HII/M_HI and n_HII/n_HI and show that the [OIII]/[CII] ratio typically changes from 5.7 to 0.3 from high-z to low-z. For future synergies of JWST and ALMA, we derived M_HII/M_HI for observed z &gt;6 galaxies using Hβ and [CII] and show the validity of our scaling relations.

<p>
The abundant population of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs)-compact objects with red UV to optical colors and broad Balmer lines at high redshift-is unveiling new insights into the properties of early active galactic nuclei (AGN). Perhaps the most surprising features of this population are the presence of Balmer absorption and ubiquitous strong Balmer breaks. Recent models link these features to an active supermassive black hole (SMBH) cocooned in very dense gas (N_H~10^24 cm<sup>2</sup>). We present a stringent test of such models using VLT/MUSE observations of A2744-45924, the most luminous LRD known to date (L_Hα≈10^44~erg s<sup>-1</sup>), located behind the Abell-2744 lensing cluster at z=4.464 (μ=1.8). We detect a moderately extended Lyα nebula (h≈5.7 pkpc), spatially offset from the point-like Hα seen by JWST. The Lyα emission is narrow (FWHM=270± 15~km s<sup>-1</sup>), spatially offset to Hα, and faint (Lyα=0.07Hα) compared to Lyα nebulae typically observed around quasars of similar luminosity. We detect compact N IV]λ1486 emission, spatially aligned with Hα, and a spatial shift in the far-UV continuum matching the Lyα offset. We discuss that Hα and Lyα have distinct physical origins: Hα originates from the AGN, while Lyα is powered by star formation. In the environment of A2744-45924, we identify four extended Lyα halos (Δz&lt;0.02, Δr&lt;100 pkpc). Their Lyα luminosities match expectations based on Hα emission, indicating no evidence for radiation from A2744-45924 affecting its surroundings. The lack of strong, compact, and broad Lyα and the absence of a luminous extended halo, suggest that the UV AGN light is obscured by dense gas cloaking the SMBH with covering factor close to unity.

Context. We present simulations of a massive young star cluster using scNbody6++GPU and scMOCCA. The cluster is initially more compact than previously published models, with one million stars, a total mass of 5.86 × 10^5~M<sub>&odot;</sub>, and a half-mass radius of 0.1~pc. Aims. We analyse the formation and growth of a very massive star (VMS) through successive stellar collisions and investigate the subsequent formation of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the core of a dense star cluster. Methods. We use both direct itN-body and Monte Carlo simulations, incorporating updated stellar evolution prescriptions (SSE/BSE) tailored to massive stars and VMSs. These include revised treatments of stellar radii, rejuvenation, and mass loss during collisions. While the prescriptions represent reasonable extrapolations into the VMS regime, the internal structure and thermal state of VMSs formed through stellar collisions remain uncertain, and future work may require further refinement. Results. We find that runaway stellar collisions in the cluster core produce a VMS exceeding 5 × 10^4~M<sub>&odot;</sub> within 5 Myr, which subsequently collapses into an IMBH. Conclusions. Our model suggests that dense stellar environments may enable the formation of very massive stars and massive black hole seeds through runaway stellar collisions. These results provide a potential pathway for early black hole growth in star clusters and offer theoretical context for interpreting recent JWST observations of young, compact clusters at high redshift.

### 263) [2505.06965](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06965v2): Black Hole Envelopes in Little Red Dots

<p> Daisaburo Kido, Kunihito Ioka, Kenta Hotokezaka, Kohei Inayoshi, Christopher M. Irwin </p>
<p>
Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope have uncovered a population of compact, red object (z~ 4&ndash;7) known as little red dots (LRDs). The presence of broad Balmer emission lines indicates active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes (BHs), while LRDs exhibit unusually weak X-ray and radio emission and low variability, suggesting super-Eddington accretion that obscures the central engine. We suggest that such an extreme accretion disc inevitably drives strong outflows, which would disrupt the LRDs themselves unless confined within the nuclear region &ndash; posing a general feedback problem for overmassive BHs. To resolve this, we propose that the BH is embedded in a massive, optically thick envelope that gravitationally confines the outflow, making any outflow a no-go. This envelope, powered by accretion on to the BH, radiates at nearly the Eddington limit, and is sustained by an infall of the interstellar medium at a rate on the order of ~ 1 M<sub>&odot;</sub>~yr^-1. A photosphere emerges either within the envelope or in the infalling medium, with a characteristic temperature of 5000 - 7000 K, near the Hayashi limit. The resulting blackbody emission naturally explains the red optical continuum of the distinct V-shaped spectrum observed in most LRDs. Furthermore, the dynamical time-scale at the photosphere, ~ 0.01~pc, is consistent with the observed year-scale variabilities. The nuclear structure and spectral features of LRDs are shaped by this envelope, which not only regulates feedback but also acts as a gas reservoir that sustains rapid BH growth in the early universe.

### 264) [2505.05556](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05556v2): Super-Eddington accretion in high-redshift quasar hosts: Black-hole driven outflows, galaxy quenching, and the nature of little red dots

<p>
The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope has revolutionised our understanding of the high-redshift Universe through its detection of bright, massive galaxies up to z≳ 10 and its identification of peculiar sources called `little red dots' (LRDs). The origin of both classes of objects remains uncertain but is likely linked to the formation and early growth of the first massive black holes (MBHs), which may be more easily explained by invoking phases of super-Eddington accretion. In this study, we used a state-of-the-art zoom-in cosmological simulation of a quasar host to investigate whether these objects could resemble any of the peculiar sources observed with JWST during their assembly. We find that the impact of MBH feedback on star formation is typically moderate, with outflows preferentially escaping perpendicular to the galactic disc. However, for approximately ten percent of the galaxy's lifetime, the system enters a distinct quenched phase following rapid MBH growth driven by super-Eddington accretion. This phase culminates in a powerful feedback event, during which the MBH jet and disc-driven winds interact directly with the galactic disc and carve out a central cavity. We also find that, during the history of the quasar host progenitor, the spectral properties of the system can resemble both LRDs and quenched galaxies, depending on the specific evolutionary stage considered. These findings suggest that both conditions may represent transient phases in the life cycle of high-redshift galaxies.

<p>
The unprecedented sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a surprisingly abundant population of mildly obscured, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the epoch of reionization (EoR). However, the link between these objects and classical unobscured quasars remains a mystery. Here we report the discovery of obscured quasars hosted by the most luminous galaxies at z &gt; 6, possibly bridging the gap between the two AGN populations. The 13 objects presented here were originally selected from a rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) imaging survey over &gt;1000 deg2, and were known to have luminous (&gt;10^43 erg/s) narrow Ly-alpha emission. With JWST/NIRSpec follow-up observations, we found that 7 out of 11 objects with narrow Ly-alpha exhibit a broad component in H I Balmer lines and He I lines, but not in [O III] and other forbidden lines. Mild dust obscuration (0 &lt; Av &lt; 3) is inferred from the Balmer decrements. The estimated intrinsic luminosities suggest that our broad line (BL) objects are the long-sought UV-obscured counterparts of luminous quasars in the EoR. They host supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses 10^(7.8-9.1) M<sub>&odot;</sub>, undergoing sub-Eddington to Eddington accretion. Most of the BL objects are spatially unresolved, and are close to "little red dots" with their blue rest-UV and red rest-optical colors. We estimate the AGN number density among similarly luminous Ly-alpha emitters to be larger than 2 x 10^(-8) /Mpc3. This density is comparable to that of classical quasars with similar continuum luminosities, suggesting that a substantial fraction of active SMBHs are obscured in the EoR and have been overlooked in past rest-UV surveys.

The advent of JWST has opened new horizons in the study of quasar host galaxies during the reionization epoch (z&gt;6). Building upon our previous initial measurements of stellar light from two quasar host galaxies at these redshifts, we now report the detection of the stellar light from the full Cycle 1 sample of 12 distant moderate-luminosity quasar (M1450&gt;-24 mag) host galaxies at z&gt;6 from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). Using JWST/NIRCam observations at 1.5 and 3.6 um combined with 2D image decomposition analysis, we successfully detect the host galaxies in 11 of the 12 targets, underscoring the high detection rates achievable with moderate-luminosity quasars. Based on two-band photometry and SED fitting, we find that our host galaxies are massive, with logM<sub>&sext;</sub>/M_sun = 9.5-11.0. The effective radii range from 0.6 to 3.2 kpc, comparable to the sizes of inactive galaxies with similar masses at z~6 as measured with imaging from COSMOS-Web.Intriguingly, the two quasar hosts with post-starburst features, which reside at the high-mass end of our sample and exhibit relatively compact morphologies, have similar size and stellar mass surface densities to quiescent galaxies at z~4-5. These findings suggest that the so-called galaxy compaction scenario is already in place at the reionization epoch, in which gas inflows during starburst phases drive centrally concentrated star formation followed by rapid quenching, bridging the structural transition of massive galaxies from relatively extended star-forming disks to compact quiescent systems.

<p>
We study the large-scale environments and clustering properties of 28 low-luminosity AGNs at z=3.9-6 in the GOODS-N field. Our sample, identified from the JWST NIRCam Imaging and WFSS data in CONGRESS and FRESCO surveys with either broad Hα emission lines or V-shape continua, are compared to 782 Hα emitters (HAEs) selected from the same data. These AGNs are located in diverse large-scale environments and do not preferentially reside in denser environments compared to HAEs. Their overdensity field, δ, averaged over (15 h^-1cMpc)^3, ranges from -0.56 to 10.56, and shows no clear correlation with broad-line luminosity, black hole (BH) masses, or the AGN fraction. It suggests that &gt; 10 cMpc structures do not significantly influence BH growth. We measure the two-point cross-correlation function of AGNs with HAEs, finding a comparable amplitude to that of the HAE auto-correlation. This indicates similar bias parameters and host dark matter halo masses for AGNs and HAEs. The correlation length of field AGNs is 4.26 h^-1cMpc, and 7.66 h^-1cMpc at 3.9 &lt; z &lt; 5 and 5 &lt; z &lt; 6, respectively. We infer a median host dark matter halo mass of log (M_h/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≈ 11.0-11.2 and host stellar masses of log (M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≈ 8.4-8.6 by comparing with the UniverseMachine simulation. Our clustering analysis suggests that low-luminosity AGNs at high redshift reside in normal star-forming galaxies with overmassive BHs. They represent an intrinsically distinct population from luminous quasars and could be a common phase in galaxy evolution.

Brink, WeiKang Zheng, Geoffrey C. Clayton, Jennifer Andrews </p>
<p>
The evolution of dust in core-collapse supernovae (SNe), in general, is poorly constrained owing to a lack of infrared observations after a few years from explosion. Most theories of dust formation in SNe heavily rely only on SN 1987A. In the last two years, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled us to probe the dust evolution in decades-old SNe, such as SN 2004et, SN 2005ip, and SN 1980K. In this paper, we present two decades of dust evolution in SN 2005af, combining early-time infrared observations with Spitzer Space Telescope and recent detections by JWST. We have used a chemical kinetic model of dust synthesis in SN ejecta to develop a template of dust evolution in SN 2005af. Moreover, using this approach, for the first time, we have separately quantified the dust formed in the pre-explosion wind that survived after the explosion, and the dust formed in the metal-rich SN ejecta post-explosion. We report that in SN 2005af, predominantly carbon-rich dust formed in the ejecta, with a total mass of at least 0.02 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. In the circumstellar medium, the surviving oxygen-rich dust amounts to about 0.003-0.006 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, yielding a total dust mass of at least 0.025 M<sub>&odot;</sub>.

<p> John Ellis, Malcolm Fairbairn, Juan Urrutia, Ville Vaskonen </p>
<p>
We confront the star formation rate in different dark matter (DM) models with UV luminosity data from JWST up to z≃25 and legacy data from HST. We find that a transition from a Salpeter population to top-heavy Pop-III stars is likely at z≃10 and that beyond z=10-15 the feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei is progressively reduced, so that at z≃25 the production of stars is almost free from any feedback. We compare fuzzy and warm DM models that suppress small-scale structures with the CDM paradigm, finding that the fuzzy DM mass &gt; 5.6 × 10^-22 eV and the warm DM mass &gt; 1.5  keV at the 95% CL. The fits of the star formation rate parametrisation do not depend strongly on the DM properties within the allowed range. We find no preference over CDM for enhanced matter perturbations associated with axion miniclusters or primordial black holes. The scale of the enhancement of the power spectrum should be &gt; 25 Mpc^-1 at the 95% CL, excluding axion miniclusters produced for m_a &lt; 6.6 × 10^-17 eV or heavy primordial black holes that constitute a fraction f_PBH &gt; \max[105 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/m_PBH, 10^-4 (m_PBH/10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>)^-0.09] of DM.

### 270) [2504.14682](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14682v3): Extreme Neutral Outflow in a non-AGN Quiescent Galaxy at z~1.3

<p>
We report the discovery of a substantial sodium doublet (Na D λλ5890, 5896Å)-traced neutral outflow in the quiescent galaxy JADES-GS-206183 at z=1.317. Its JWST/NIRSpec-MSA spectrum shows a deep, blueshifted Na D absorption, revealing a neutral outflow with v_out=828^+79_-49 km s<sup>-1</sup> and a mass outflow rate of log(M&#775;_out/M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1)=2.40^+0.11_-0.16. This outflow rate exceeds that of any neutral outflows identified beyond z~1 by the same line and is comparable with those in local galaxies with intensive star formation or luminous AGN. JADES-GS-206183 is also a peculiar quiescent galaxy with a spiral+bar morphology, high dust attenuation (A_V=2.27±0.23 mag). Paschen α (Paα) emission from the FRESCO NIRCam grism confirms its low star formation rate (SFR_Paα=10.78± 0.55 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1), placing it 0.5 dex below the main-sequence (log(sSFR/yr^-1)=-10.2). Despite the systematics introduced by different star formation history (SFH) priors, the SED modeling, combining HST-to-NIRCam photometry with the VLT/MUSE spectrum, suggests that JADES-GS-206183 experienced an older episode of star formation 0.5-2 Gyr ago and a possible rejuvenation within recent ~10 Myr. Moreover, rest-frame optical lines indicate that the current AGN activity of JADES-GS-206183, if present, is also weak. Even though we tentatively detect a broad component of the Hα line, it likely traces an ionized outflow rather than an AGN. The results demonstrate that the Na D outflow in JADES-GS-206183 is highly unlikely to be driven by current star formation or nuclear activity. Instead, it may represent a long-lasting fossil outflow from past AGN activity, potentially co-triggered with the early phase of rejuvenation.

### 271) [2504.14592](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14592v2): The fate of the progenitors of luminous red novae: Infrared detection of LRNe years after the outburst

<p> A. Reguitti, A. Pastorello, G. Valerin </p>
<p>
We present late-time optical and infrared (IR) observations of a sample of nine extragalactic luminous red novae (LRNe) discovered in the past three decades. In all of these cases, the LRN survivors fade below the pre-outburst luminosity of the progenitors in the optical region. However, they remain visible in the near-IR (NIR) and bright in the mid-IR (MIR) domains for years. We recover AT 1997bs in Spitzer images from 2004, and a residual source is visible in HST and JWST NIR images 27 years after the outburst. The spectral energy distribution (SED) of AT 1997bs is consistent with that of an orange giant star with a photospheric temperature of 3750-4250 K and a radius of 120-150 R<sub>&odot;</sub>, without a significant circumstellar dust attenuation. Similarly, the SED of AT 2019zhd after three years is compatible with a red supergiant star with T_ph=3100±100 K and R=350±50 R<sub>&odot;</sub>. Another LRN, AT 2011kp, is detected by JWST 12.5 years after the outburst. Its SED, with two excesses at 1.8 and 7.7 μm, can be explained by a cold (T~450 K) dusty shell composed of amorphous carbon surrounding a cold expanded source, plus emission from the Paα line. We constructed the [3.6]-[4.5] colour curves extending up to more than 7 years for six LRNe, which show a similar evolution: The MIR colour is ~-0.5 mag before the optical maximum light, it becomes bluer after around one year, and then it gradually turns to redder colours before reaching ~+1.0 mag after 7 years. We also estimated the masses and the temperatures of newly formed dust years after the LRN onset. We find that LRNe produce dust masses of the order of (1-5)x10^-4 (and up to 2x10^-3) M<sub>&odot;</sub> between 7 and 13 years after the outbursts. Finally, we find that the remnants of LRNe detected years or decades after the merger are expanded and cool objects, similar to red supergiant stars.

### 272) [2504.11531](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11531v2): Oxyster: A Circumgalactic Low-ionization Oxygen Nebula next to a Starburst Galaxy at z~1

<p> Pengjun Lu, Mingyu Li, Dalya Baron, Minghao Yue, Song Huang, Zheng Cai </p>
<p>
Extended emission line nebulae around galaxies or active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide a unique window to investigate the galactic ecosystem through the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Using Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam narrow-band imaging and spectroscopic follow-up, we serendipitously discover "Oxyster" - a large ionized nebula next to an interacting starburst galaxy at z=0.924. The nebula is traced by extended [OII]3726,3729 (~ 30 kpc) and [OIII]5007 (~ 20 kpc) emission lines. On the nebula luminosity-size plane, Oxyster surpasses the extended narrow-line regions around low-z AGNs, resembling a higher-z analog of "Hanny's Voorwerp". However, its uniformly low [OIII]/[OII] ratio (O32) sets it apart from typical AGN light echoes. For the host galaxy, HST and JWST images reveal a disturbed red disk galaxy with a single blue spiral "arm". Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting suggests the 2-6× 10^10 ~M<sub>&odot;</sub> host galaxy sits above the star-forming main sequence with an ongoing starburst, especially in the "arm", and have &lt;5&percnt; luminosity contribution from AGN, consistent with X-ray non-detection and radio continuum. Standard photoionization and shock models struggle to explain simultaneously Oxyster's emission line luminosities, low O32 ratio, and the non-detection of Hβ line. A plausible explanation could involve the combination of a recent (&lt;10^8 yrs) starburst and a low-luminosity AGN (L_bol ~ 1×10^42 erg/s). While Oxyster's nature awaits future investigation, its discovery highlights the potential of ground-based narrow-band imaging to uncover extended emission line nebulae around non-AGN systems, opening new avenues for studying the CGM of normal galaxies in the early Universe.

2MASS J04381486+2611399 (or J0438) is one of the few young brown dwarfs (BD) with a highly inclined (i\!~\!70&deg;) disk. Here we report results from JWST-MIRI MRS, HST-ACS and ALMA Band 7 observations. Despite its late spectral type (M7.25), the spectrum of J0438 resembles those of inner disks around earlier-type stars (K1-M5, T Tauri stars), with a volatile reservoir lacking hydrocarbons (except for acetylene, C_2H<sub>2</sub>) and dominated by water. Other identified species are H<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, HCN, [Ar^+], and [Ne^+]. The dominance of water over hydrocarbons is driven by multiple factors such as disk dynamics, young disk age, low accretion rate and possible inner disk clearing. J0438 appears highly dynamic, showing a seesaw-like variability and extended emission in H<sub>2</sub>     S(1), S(3), S(5), [Ne^+] and CO (J=3-2). Interestingly, the CO emission reaches up to 400 au from the brown dwarf, suggesting ongoing infalling/outflowing activity impacting the disk chemistry. These observations underscore the combined power of MIRI, HST and ALMA in characterizing the chemical diversity and dynamics of brown dwarf disks.

We report the discovery of 13 broad-line AGNs at z = 5 - 8 from the first 10% data of the JWST Cycle 3 Treasury Program COSMOS-3D. These AGNs are identified by their broad Hα or Hβ emission lines through the NIRCam grism wide-field slitless spectroscopy. One object at z = 7.646 with broad Hβ emission has an F444W magnitude of 23.6 mag, making it one of the brightest z &gt; 7.5 broad-line AGNs yet known. Among the 13 AGNs, 10 objects have reddened optical continua with slopes β_opt&gt;0. The remaining three objects have their overall SEDs that resemble those of UV-luminous quasars at similar redshifts, but their β_opt, though negative, are not as blue as those of unobscured quasars. We also obtain MIRI photometry at 7.7-18 μm for two AGNs and place strong constraints on their rest-frame near-IR SED. We find no significant variability in the rest-frame UV by comparing the COSMOS-3D and COSMOS-Web F115W images taken apart by 60 days in the rest-frame. We compute the Hα luminosity functions (LFs) for the broad Hα emitters at z ≈ 5-6 and find a potential redshift evolution when compared with that of the z ≈ 4-5 sample. We also derive the Hβ LF at z~8 for AGNs and galaxies by combining our sample with those from the literature. The broad Hβ emitters in this work suggest a number density two orders of magnitude higher than that predicted by the quasar LF based on rest-frame UV-selected samples. As a preview, our work showcases the ability of the COSMOS-3D grism survey to provide a complete view of the properties, growth, and evolution of bright broad-line AGNs at z&gt;5.

### 275) [2504.08028](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08028v2): The Luminosity Function and Clustering of Hα Emitting Galaxies at z≈4-6 from a Complete NIRCam Grism Redshift Survey

Jaffe, Zhiyuan Ji, Xiangyu Jin, Maria Anne Pudoka, Sandro Tacchella, Wei Leong Tee, Pierluigi Rinaldi, Brant Robertson, Yang Sun, Christopher N. A. Willmer, Chris Willott, Junyu Zhang, Yongda Zhu </p>
<p>
We study the luminosity function (LF) and clustering properties of 888 Hα emitters (HAEs) at 3.75 &lt; z &lt; 6 in the GOODS-N field. The sample, built from JWST CONGRESS and FRESCO NIRCam grism surveys using a novel redshift assignment algorithm, spans ~62 arcmin<sup>2</sup> and reaches L_Hα ~ 10^41.2 erg s<sup>-1</sup>. We identify two prominent filamentary protoclusters at z ≈ 4.41 and z ≈ 5.19, hosting 98 and 144 HAEs, respectively. The observed Hα LFs show similar shallow faint-end slopes for both protocluster and field galaxies at z=3.75-5, and for the protocluster at z=5-6 (α≈ 1.2 to -1.3). In contrast, the field LF at z=5-6 is much steeper (α=-1.87_-0.23^+0.30), suggesting that protocluster galaxies at z &gt; 5 are more evolved, resembling those at z=3.75-5. The observed star formation rate density from Hα, integrated down to 0.45 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1, is 0.050^+0.002_-0.003 and 0.046^+0.006_-0.004 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1 Mpc^-3 at z=3.75-5 and z=5-6, with protoclusters contributing ~25% and 55%, respectively. This implies that a large fraction of star formation at z &gt; 4 occurs in protoclusters. We conduct the first star-formation-rate-limited 3D clustering analysis at z &gt; 4. We find the filamentary protocluster geometry flattens the power-law shape of the HAE auto-correlation functions, with slopes much shallower than typically assumed. The auto-correlation function of field HAEs have correlation lengths of r_0 = 4.61^+1.00_-0.68 h^-1 Mpc at z ≈ 4-5 and r_0 = 6.23^+1.68_-1.13 h^-1 Mpc at z=5-6. Comparing the observed correlation functions with the UniverseMachine simulation, we infer the dark matter (sub-)halo masses of HAEs to be log (M_h/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=11.0-11.2 at z≈ 4-6, with a scatter of 0.4 dex.

### 276) [2504.03384](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03384v2): Capturing Small-Scale Reionization Physics: A Sub-Grid Model for Photon Sinks with SCRIPT

<p> Tirthankar Roy Choudhury, Anirban Chakraborty </p>
<p>
The epoch of reionization represents a major phase transition in cosmic history, during which the first luminous sources ionized the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, the small-scale physics governing ionizing photon sinks - particularly the interplay between recombinations, photon propagation, and self-shielded regions - remains poorly understood. Accurately modeling these processes requires a framework that self-consistently links ionizing emissivity, the clumping factor, mean free path, and photoionization rate. In this work, we extend the photon-conserving semi-numerical framework, SCRIPT, by introducing a self-consistent sub-grid model that dynamically connects these quantities to the underlying density field, enabling a more realistic treatment of inhomogeneous recombinations and photon sinks. We validate our model against a comprehensive set of observational constraints, including the UV luminosity function from HST and JWST, CMB optical depth from Planck, and Lyman-α forest measurements of the IGM temperature, photoionization rate, and mean free path. Our fiducial model also successfully reproduces Lyman-α opacity fluctuations, reinforcing its ability to capture large-scale inhomogeneities in the reionization process. Notably, we demonstrate that traditionally independent parameters, such as the clumping factor and mean free path, are strongly correlated, with implications for the timing, morphology, and thermal evolution of reionization. Looking ahead, we will extend this framework to include machine learning-based parameter inference. With upcoming 21cm experiments poised to provide unprecedented insights, SCRIPT offers a powerful computational tool for interpreting high-redshift observations and refining our understanding of the last major phase transition in the universe.

### 277) [2504.03156](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03156v2): Comprehensive JWST+ALMA Study on the Extended Lyα Emitters, Himiko and CR7 at z~ 7: Blue Major Merger Systems in Stark Contrast to Submillimeter Galaxies

<p>
We present various properties of two bright extended Lyα objects, Himiko and CR7, at z=6.6 thoroughly investigated with JWST/NIRCam photometry, NIRSpec-IFU spectroscopy, and ALMA data, uncovering their physical origins. Himiko (CR7) shows at least five (four) clumps with small separations of 2.4&ndash;7.3 kpc and velocity offsets of Δv&lt;220~km~s<sup>-1</sup> in the [OIII]λ&lambda;4959,5007 line maps, three of which exhibit stellar components with comparable stellar masses ranging in log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=8.4&ndash;9.0 (8.3&ndash;8.8), indicative of major merger systems that are consistent with our numerical simulations. The [CII]158μm and Lyα lines are found in the middle of two clumps (the brightest clump) in Himiko (CR7), suggesting that the distribution of neutral gas does not always coincide with that of ionized gas or stars in merging processes. We find that some of the clumps have broad [OIII] components (250&ndash;400~km~s<sup>-1</sup>) in Himiko and CR7, likely tracing outflow and tidal features, while the central clump in Himiko presents a broad Hα (~1000~km~s<sup>-1</sup>) line explained by an AGN with a low mass black hole of M_BH=10^6.6~M<sub>&odot;</sub>, which contribute to the extended and bright nature of Himiko and CR7. We find low metallicities of 12+log(O/H)=7.9&ndash;8.1 in Himiko and CR7 based on auroral [OIII]&lambda;4363 and strong lines that are consistent with no 1-mm continuum detection corresponding to the dust mass limits of M_dust≲ 9× 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Himiko and CR7 are metal- and dust-poor blue merger systems with stellar and dust masses ≳2 orders of magnitude smaller than the massive dust-rich merger systems represented by submillimeter galaxies.

### 278) [2503.23202](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23202v2): Using Wavelet Decomposition to Determine the Dimension of Structures from Projected Images

<p> Svitlana Mayboroda, David N Spergel </p>
<p>
Mesoscale structures can often be described as fractional dimensional across a wide range of scales. We consider a γ dimensional measure embedded in an N dimensional space and discuss how to determine its dimension, both in N dimensions and projected into D dimensions. It is a highly non-trivial problem to decode the original geometry from lower dimensional projection of a high-dimensional measure. The projections are space-feeling, the popular box-counting techniques do not apply, and the Fourier methods are contaminated by aliasing effects. In the present paper we demonstrate that under the "Copernican hypothesis'' that we are not observing objects from a special direction, projection in a wavelet basis is remarkably simple: the wavelet power spectrum of a projected γ dimensional measure is P_j &prop; 2^-jγ. This holds regardless of the embedded dimension, N, and the projected dimension, D. This approach could have potentially broad applications in data sciences where a typically sparse matrix encodes lower dimensional information embedded in an extremely high dimensional field and often measured in projection to a low dimensional space. Here, we apply this method to JWST and Chandra observations of the nearby supernova Cas A. We find that the emissions can be represented by projections of mesoscale substructures with fractal dimensions varying from γ= 1.7 for the warm CO layer observed by JWST, up to γ= 2.5 for the hot X-ray emitting gas layer in the supernova remnant. The resulting power law indicates that the emission is coming from a fractal dimensional mesoscale structure likely produced by magneto-hydrodynamical instabilities in the expanding supernova shell.

Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have revealed a population of sources with a compact morphology and a characteristic `v-shaped' continuum, namely blue at rest-frame λ&lt;4000A and red at longer wavelengths. The nature of these sources, called `little red dots' (LRDs), is still debated, as it is unclear if they host active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their number seems to drastically drop at z&lt;4. We take advantage of the 63 °^2 covered by the quick Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) to extend the search for LRDs to brighter magnitudes and to lower redshifts than what has been possible with JWST. The selection is performed by fitting the available photometric data (Euclid, the Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC), and ground-based griz data) with two power laws, to retrieve both the rest-frame optical and UV slopes consistently over a large redshift range (i.e, z&lt;7.6). We exclude extended objects and possible line emitters, and perform a careful visual inspection to remove any imaging artefacts. The final selection includes 3341 LRD candidates at z=0.33-3.6, with 29 detected also in IRAC. The resulting rest-frame UV luminosity function, in contrast with previous JWST studies, shows that the number density of LRD candidates increases from high-z down to z=1.5-2.5 and decreases at lower z. However, less evolution is apparent focusing on the subsample of more robust LRD candidates having IRAC detections, which however has low statistics and limited by the IRAC resolution. The comparison with previous quasar (QSO) UV luminosity functions shows that LRDs are not the dominant AGN population at z&lt;4 and M_UV&lt;-21. Follow-up studies of these LRD candidates are pivotal to confirm their nature, probe their physical properties and check for their compatibility with JWST sources, given the different spatial resolution and wavelength coverage of Euclid and JWST.

### 280) [2503.09971](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09971v2): Tantalizing Evidence of Reionization Relics in the eBOSS DR16 Ly\boldsymbolα Forest Correlations: a Preference for Early Reionization

<p> Yifan Zheng, Paulo Montero-Camacho, Zheng Cai, Yi Mao </p>
<p>
Cosmic reionization of HI leaves enduring relics in the post-reionization intergalactic medium, potentially influencing the Lyman-α (Lyα) forest down to redshifts as low as z ≈ 2, which is the so-called ''memory of reionization'' effect. Here, we re-analyze the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from Lyα absorption and quasar correlations using data from the extended Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) Data Release 16 (DR16), incorporating for the first time the memory of reionization in the Lyα forest. Three distinct scenarios of reionization timeline are considered in our analyses. We find that the recovered BAO parameters (α_\parallel, α_\perp) remain consistent with the original eBOSS DR16 analysis. However, models incorporating reionization relics provide a better fit to the data, with a tantalizing preference for early reionization, consistent with recent findings from the James Webb Space Telescope. Furthermore, the inclusion of reionization relics significantly impacts the non-BAO parameters. For instance, we report deviations of up to 3σ in the Lyα redshift-space distortion parameter and ~7σ in the linear Lyα bias for the late reionization scenario. Our findings suggest that the eBOSS Lyα data is more accurately described by models that incorporate a broadband enhancement to the Lyα forest power spectrum, highlighting the importance of accounting for reionization relics in cosmological analyses.

<p>
The strongly lensed Supernova (SN) Encore at a redshift of z = 1.949, discovered behind the galaxy cluster MACS J0138-2155 at z=0.336, provides a rare opportunity for time-delay cosmography and studies of the SN host galaxy, where previously another SN, called SN Requiem, had appeared. To enable these studies, we combine new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging, archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, and new Very Large Telescope (VLT) spectroscopic data to construct state-of-the-art lens mass models that are composed of cluster dark-matter (DM) halos and galaxies. We determine the photometric and structural parameters of the galaxies across six JWST and five HST filters. We use the color-magnitude and color-color relations of spectroscopically-confirmed cluster members to select additional cluster members, identifying a total of 84 galaxies belonging to the galaxy cluster. We construct seven different mass models using a variety of DM halo mass profiles, and explore both multi-plane and approximate single-plane lens models. As constraints, we use the observed positions of 23 multiple images from eight multiply lensed sources at four distinct spectroscopic redshifts. In addition, we use stellar velocity dispersion measurements to obtain priors on the galaxy mass distributions. We find that six of the seven models fit well to the observed image positions. Mass models with cored-isothermal DM profiles fit well to the observations, whereas the mass model with a Navarro-Frenk-White cluster DM profile has an image-position χ^2 value that is four times higher. We build our ultimate model by combining four multi-lens-plane mass models and predict the image positions and magnifications of SN Encore and SN Requiem. Our work lays the foundation for building state-of-the-art mass models of the cluster for future cosmological analysis and SN host galaxy studies.

We use the deep NIRCam and MIRI imaging from the JWST PRIMER survey to study the properties of (sub)mm sources detected by ALMA in the centre of the COSMOS field, with the aim of better constraining the history of dust-enshrouded star formation. The wealth of ALMA data in this field enabled us to isolate a robust sample of 128 (sub)mm sources within the 175 sq. arcmin of the PRIMER COSMOS survey footprint, spanning two decades in (sub)mm flux density. The JWST imaging is deep/red enough to reveal secure galaxy counterparts for all of these sources. Moreover, 52% of the galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts, enabling us to refine the photo-zs for the remaining galaxies. Armed with this robust redshift information, we calculate the star-formation rates (SFR) and stellar masses of all 128 ALMA-detected galaxies, and place them in the context of other galaxies in the field. We find that the vast majority of star formation is dust-enshrouded in the ALMA-detected galaxies, with SFR ranging from ~1000 down to ~20 solar masses per year. We also find that virtually all (126/128) have high stellar masses, at all redshifts, with log(M/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &gt; 10. The unusually high quality of our sample enables us to make a robust estimate of the contribution of the ALMA-detected galaxies to cosmic star-formation rate density from z = 2 out to z = 7. Finally, to correct for the fact that the deep ALMA pointings cover &lt; 20% of the PRIMER COSMOS area, we use our knowledge of all other massive galaxies in the field to produce a completeness-corrected estimate of dust-enshrouded star-formation rate density over cosmic time. This confirms that UV-visible star formation dominates at z &gt; 4, but also indicates that dust-enshrouded star formation likely still made a significant contribution at higher redshifts: extrapolation of our results suggest a ~20% contribution at z = 8, and potentially still ~5% at z = 10.

### 283) [2503.07590](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07590v2): Probing Reionization-Era Galaxies with JWST UV Luminosity Functions and Large-Scale Clustering

<p> Anirban Chakraborty, Tirthankar Roy Choudhury </p>
<p>
JWST has transformed our understanding of early galaxy formation, providing an unprecedented view of the first billion years of cosmic history. In this work, we build upon our previously developed semi-analytical framework that self-consistently models the evolving UVLF of galaxies and the global reionization history while incorporating the effects of radiative feedback. Comparing our predictions with JWST and HST data, we identify a fundamental tension: models that match the UVLF fail to reproduce the observed evolution of galaxy clustering (bias) with redshift, and vice versa. To resolve this, we introduce a redshift- and mass-dependent duty cycle linked to the duration of star formation. This duty cycle increases towards higher redshifts, requiring either an enhanced production of UV radiation or increased star formation efficiency at z&gt;10 to match the JWST UVLFs, but declines at lower redshifts (5&lt;z≤9) and towards low-mass halos to remain consistent with the bias and HST UVLF measurements. Reconciling theory with observations requires the characteristic star formation timescale to be longer in massive halos, and to decrease with redshift at fixed halo mass, evolving from ~ 85 Myr at z=6 to ~ 45 Myr at z=14 for 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> halos. Finally, our extended model, assuming a halo mass-dependent escaping ionizing efficiency (\varepsilon<sub>esc</sub> &equiv; f<sub>esc</sub> × ξ<sub>ion</sub>), whose population-averaged value gradually increases with redshift and corresponds to &langle; f<sub>esc</sub> &rangle; ~ 15% at z=5 for a fixed value of ξ<sub>ion</sub> = 10^25.23 erg^-1 Hz across all galaxies, produces a reionization history consistent with current constraints. These findings underscore the importance of jointly constraining high-redshift galaxy models using both UVLF and bias statistics to accurately interpret JWST data and refine our understanding of early cosmic evolution.

Gravitational time delays offer unique, independent measurements of the Hubble constant, H_0. Precise measurements of H_0 stand as one of the most pressing challenges in modern cosmology, and to do so with time delays requires precise lens models. While much work has focused on streamlining the modeling process to keep pace with the erumpent discovery of strongly-lensed systems, a critical step toward reducing uncertainty in H_0 comes from increasing the precision of individual lens models themselves. In this work, we demonstrate that the unprecedented imaging capabilities of JWST make this goal attainable. We present the first lens model for time-delay cosmography derived from JWST data, applied to the quadruply-imaged quasar WFI2033&ndash;4723. While the primary source of systematic uncertainty in time-delay cosmography is currently the mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD), the sensitivity of models to this MSD varies on how the point spread function (PSF) errors are mitigated. As the PSF is also the primary source of uncertainty in lens modeling, we focus on a comparison of different PSF modeling methods. Within the context of power-law models, we recover results in agreement with previous Hubble Space Telescope (HST)-based models, but with better precision of key lensing parameters through implementation of new PSF modeling techniques. Despite the record-holding precision of this system's HST modeling, we achieve an additional 22% increase in precision of the Fermat potential difference, directly reducing uncertainties of cosmological inference. These results would produce a 3% (1σ of the modeling error) shift of H_0 towards a higher value for this lens, keeping all else constant. This work substantiates the groundbreaking potential of JWST for time-delay cosmography and lays the groundwork for modeling systems previously too faint to provide meaningful constraints on H_0.

<p> Devesh Nandal, Daniel J. Whalen, Muhammad A. Latif, Alexander Heger </p>
<p>
The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope has revealed a wealth of new galaxies just a few hundred Myr after the Big Bang. Some of these galaxies exhibit unusual N/O ratios that are difficult to explain with stellar populations today. While Wolf-Rayet stars in multiple-burst populations, very massive or rapidly-rotating primordial stars, general relativistic explosions of metal-enriched supermassive stars, or the precursors of globular clusters can in principle account for the nitrogen excess in the galaxies GN-z11 and CEERS 1019, no known stars or supernovae can explain the far higher N/O ratio of 0.46 in GS 3073 at redshift z = 5.55. Here we show that the extreme nitrogen abundances in GS 3073 can be produced by 1000 - 10,000 M<sub>&odot;</sub> primordial (Pop III) stars. We find that these are the only candidates that can account for its large N/O ratios and its C/O and Ne/O ratios. GS 3073 is thus the first conclusive evidence in the fossil abundance record of the existence of supermassive Pop III stars at cosmic Dawn.

### 286) [2501.18559](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18559v2): Variability of the UV luminosity function with SPICE

<p> Arghyadeep Basu, Aniket Bhagwat, Benedetta Ciardi, Tiago Costa </p>
<p>
We investigate the variability of the UV luminosity function (UVLF) at z &gt; 5 using the SPICE suite of cosmological, radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, which include three distinct supernova (SN) feedback models: bursty-sn, smooth-sn, and hyper-sn. The bursty-sn model, driven by intense and episodic SN explosions, produces the highest fluctuations in the star formation rate (SFR). Conversely, the smooth-sn model, characterized by gentler SN feedback, results in minimal SFR variability. The hyper-sn model, featuring a more realistic prescription that incorporates hypernova (HN) explosions, exhibits intermediate variability, closely aligning with the smooth-sn trend at lower redshifts. These fluctuations in SFR significantly affect the M_UV - M_halo relation, a proxy for UVLF variability. Among the models, bursty-sn produces the highest UVLF variability, with a maximum value of 2.5. In contrast, the smooth-sn and hyper-sn models show substantially lower variability, with maximum values of 1.3 and 1.5, respectively. However, in all cases, UVLF variability strongly correlates with host halo mass, with lower-mass halos showing greater variability due to more effective SN feedback in their shallower gravitational wells. The bursty-sn model, though, results in higher amplitudes. Variability decreases in lower mass haloes with decreasing redshift for all feedback models. This study underscores the critical role of SN feedback in shaping the UVLF, and highlights the mass and redshift dependence of its variability, suggesting that UVLF variability may alleviate the bright galaxy tension observed by JWST at high redshifts.

Stellar feedback is an essential step in the baryon cycle of galaxies, but it remains unconstrained beyond Cosmic Noon. We study the ionized gas kinematics, dynamical mass and gas-flow properties of a sample of 16 sub-L^&sext; star-forming galaxies at 4≤ z≤7.6, using high-resolution JWST/NIRSpec observations. The emission lines are resolved, with velocity dispersions (σ_gas ~(km~s<sup>-1</sup>)≃38-96) comparable to more massive galaxies at Cosmic Noon. From σ_gas and the galaxy size (r_e=400-960~pc), we estimate the dynamical mass to be log M_dyn/M<sub>&odot;</sub>=9.25-10.25. Stellar-to-dynamical mass ratios are low (log M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M_dyn\in[-0.5,-2]) and decrease with increasing SFR surface density (Σ_SFR). We estimate the gas surface densities assuming a star-formation law, but the gas masses do not balance the baryon-to-dynamical mass ratios, which would require a decrease in the star-formation efficiency. We find evidence of ionized outflows in five out of the sixteen galaxies, based on the need of broad components to reproduce the emission-line wings. We only observe outflows from galaxies undergoing recent bursts of star formation SFR_10/SFR_100≥1, with elevated Σ_SFR and low M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M_dyn. This links high gas surface densities to increased outflow incidence and lower M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M_dyn. With moderate outflow velocities (v_flow ~(km~s<sup>-1</sup>)=150-250) and mass outflow rates (M&#775;_flow/M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1=0.2-5), these high-redshift galaxies appear more efficient at removing baryons than low-redshift galaxies with similar M<sub>&sext;</sub>, showing mass loading-factors of M&#775;_flow/SFR=0.04-0.4. For their given dynamical mass, the outflow velocities exceed the escape velocities, meaning that they may eventually enrich the Circumgalactic Medium.

<p>
Recent observations from JWST have revealed an abundant population of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and so-called "Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) at 2≲ z ≲ 11, many of which are characterized by V-shaped UV-to-optical continua with turnovers around the Balmer limit. The physical nature of these LRDs is unclear, and it remains debated whether the peculiar spectral shape originates from AGN, compact galaxies, or both. We present the analysis of new NIRSpec-IFU data from the BlackTHUNDER JWST Large Programme and archival NIRSpec-MSA data of a lensed LRD at z=7.04. The spectra confirm the presence of a smooth Balmer break and a broad Hβ tracing the Broad Line Region (BLR) of an AGN. The small velocity dispersion of the Hβ narrow component indicates a small dynamical mass of the host galaxy of M_dyn&lt;4 × 10^8~M<sub>&odot;</sub>, which implies that the stellar population cannot contribute more than 10% to the optical continuum. We show that the Balmer break can be well described by an AGN continuum absorbed by very dense (n_H~ 10^10~cm^-3) and nearly dust-free gas along our line-of-sight (possibly gas in the BLR or its surrounding). The same gas is expected to produce Hβ absorption, at a level consistent with a tentative detection (3σ) in the high-resolution spectrum. Such a non-stellar origin of the Balmer break may apply to other LRDs, and would alleviate the issue of extremely high stellar mass surface densities inferred in the case of a stellar interpretation of the Balmer break. We note that this is a rare case of a black hole that is overmassive relative to both the host galaxy stellar and dynamical masses. We finally report indications of variability and the first attempt of AGN reverberation mapping at such an early epoch.

### 289) [2501.11702](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11702v2): Constraints on the z~6-13 intergalactic medium from JWST spectroscopy of Lyman-alpha damping wings in galaxies

<p> Charlotte A. Mason, Zuyi Chen, Daniel P. Stark, Ting-Yi Lu, Michael Topping, Mengtao Tang </p>
<p>
JWST provides a unique dataset to study reionization's earliest stages, promising insights into the first galaxies. Many JWST/NIRSpec prism spectra reveal smooth Lyman-alpha breaks in z&gt;5 galaxies, implying damping wing scattering by neutral hydrogen. We investigate what current prism spectra imply about the intergalactic medium (IGM), and how best to use NIRSpec spectra to recover IGM properties. We use a sample of 99 z~5.5-13 galaxies with high S/N prism spectra in the public archive, including 12 at z&gt;10. We analyse these spectra using damping wing sightlines from inhomogeneous reionizing IGM simulations, mapping between the distance of a source from neutral IGM and the mean IGM neutral fraction. We marginalise over absorption by local HI around galaxies, and Lyman-alpha emission. We observe a decline in the median and variance of flux around the Lyman-alpha break with increasing redshift, consistent with an increasingly neutral IGM, as ionized regions become smaller and rarer. At z≳9 the spectra become consistent with an almost fully neutral IGM. We find S/N&gt;15 per pixel is required to robustly estimate IGM properties from prism spectra. We fit a sub-sample of high S/N spectra and infer mean neutral fractions x_HI=0.33^+0.18_-0.27, 0.64^+0.17_-0.23 (&gt;0.70 excluding GNz11) at z ≈ 6.5, 9.3. We also investigate local HI absorption, finding median column density log_10N_HI≈10^20.8 cm<sup>2</sup>, comparable to z~3 Lyman-break galaxies, with no significant redshift evolution. We find galaxies showing the strongest absorption are more likely to be in close associations (&lt;500 pkpc), implying enhanced absorption in massive dark matter halos. Future deep prism and grating spectroscopy of z&gt;9 sources will provide tighter constraints on the earliest stages of reionization, key for understanding the onset of star formation.

<p>
In recent years, observations with the JWST have started to map out the rapid metal enrichment of the early Universe, while (sub)millimeter observations have simultaneously begun to reveal the ubiquity of dust beyond z≳6. However, the pathways that led to the assembly of early dust reservoirs remain poorly quantified, and require pushing our understanding of key scaling relations between dust, gas and metals into the early Universe. We investigate the dust build-up in twelve 6.5 ≲ z ≲ 7.7 galaxies drawn from the REBELS survey that benefit from (i) JWST/NIRSpec strong-line metallicity measurements, (ii) ALMA [CII]-based redshifts and gas masses, and (iii) dust masses from single- or multi-band ALMA continuum observations. Combining these measurements, we investigate the dust-to-gas (DtG), dust-to-metal (DtM), and dust-to-stellar mass (DtS) ratios of our sample as a function of metallicity. While our analysis is limited by systematic uncertainties related to the [CII]-to-H<sub>2</sub> conversion factor and dust temperature, we explore a wide range of possible values, and carefully assess their impact on our results. Under a fiducial set of assumptions, we find an average log(DtG) = -3.02 ± 0.23, only slightly below that of local metal-rich galaxies. On the other hand, at fixed metallicity our average log(DtS) = -2.15 ± 0.42 is significantly larger than that of low-redshift galaxies. Finally, through a comparison to various theoretical models of high-redshift dust production, we find that assembling the dust reservoirs in massive galaxies at z≈7 likely requires the combination of rapid supernova enrichment and efficient ISM dust growth.

### 291) [2412.07598](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07598v4): Radiation-driven dusty outflows from early galaxies

<p> Yurina Nakazato, Andrea Ferrara </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered an overabundance of UV-bright (M_UV ≲ -20), massive galaxies at z ≳ 10 in comparison to pre-JWST theoretical predictions. Among the proposed interpretations, such excess has been explained by negligible dust attenuation conditions following radiation-driven outflows launched by young stars when a galaxy goes through a super-Eddington phase. Dust opacity decreases the classical Eddington luminosity by a (boost) factor A, thus favoring the driving of outflows by stellar radiation in compact, initially dusty galaxies. Here, we compute A as a function of the galaxy stellar mass, gas fraction, galaxy size, and metallicity (a total of 8 parameters). We find that the main dependence is on metallicity and, for the fiducial model, A ~ 1800(Z/Z<sub>&odot;</sub>)/(1+N_H/10^23.5  cm<sup>2</sup>). We apply such results to 20 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at z ≳ 10 and evaluate their modified Eddington ratio. We predict that three galaxies are in the outflow phase. Their outflows have relatively low velocities (60 -100  km s<sup>-1</sup>), implying that they are unlikely to escape from the system. For the remaining 17 galaxies that are not currently in the outflow phase, we calculate the past evolution of the modified Eddington ratio from their star formation history. We find that 15 of them experienced an outflow phase prior to observation during which they effectively displaced their dust to larger radii. Thus, dusty outflows driven by stellar radiation appear to contribute to the observed bright UV galaxies at z &gt; 10.

We explore the radio emission of JWST-selected Broad Line AGN (BLAGN, or type 1) in the GOODS-N field. We use deep radio data at different frequencies (144 MHz, 1.5 GHz, 3 GHz, 5.5 GHz, 10 GHz), and we find that none of the 37 sources investigated is detected at any of the aforementioned frequencies. Similarly, the radio stacking analysis does not reveal any detection down to an rms of ~ 0.15μJy beam^-1, corresponding to a 3σ upper limit at rest frame 5 GHz of L_5GHz=2×10^39 erg s<sup>-1</sup> at the mean redshift of the sample z~ 5.1. We compared this and individual sources upper limits with expected radio luminosities estimated assuming different AGN scaling relations, to check whether these are consistent with the standard BLAGN spectral energy distribution. For most of the sources the radio luminosity upper limits are still compatible with expectations for radio-quiet (RQ) AGN; nevertheless, the more stringent stacking upper limits and the fact that no detection is found might suggest that JWST-selected BLAGN are weaker than standard AGN even at radio frequencies. Indeed, the probability of having none of the BLAGN detected in none of the investigated radio images is expected to be on average very low (P&lt;10^-4). We discuss some scenarios that could explain the possible radio weakness, such as free-free absorption from a dense medium, or the lack of either magnetic field or a corona, possibly as a consequence of super-Eddington accretion. These scenarios would also explain the observed X-ray weakness. We also conclude that ~1 dex more sensitive radio observations are needed to better constrain the level of radio emission (or lack thereof) for the bulk of these sources. The Square Kilometer Array Observatory (SKAO) will likely play a crucial role in assessing the properties of this AGN population.

### 293) [2410.01437](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01437v3): AGN &ndash; host galaxy photometric decomposition using a fast, accurate and precise deep learning approach

<p> Berta Margalef-Bentabol, Lingyu Wang, Antonio La Marca, Vicente Rodriguez-Gomez </p>
<p>
Identifying active galactic nuclei (AGN) is extremely important for understanding galaxy evolution and its connection with the assembly of supermassive black holes (SMBH). With the advent of deep and high angular resolution imaging surveys such as those conducted with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), it is now possible to identify galaxies with a central point source out to the very early Universe. In this study, we develop a fast, accurate and precise method to identify galaxies which host AGNs and recover the intrinsic AGN contribution to the observed total light (f_AGN). We trained a deep learning (DL) based method Zoobot to estimate the fractional contribution of a central point source to the total light. Our training sample comprises realistic mock JWST images of simulated galaxies from the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We injected different amounts of the real JWST point spread function (PSF) models to represent galaxies with different levels of f_AGN. We analyse the performance of our method and compare it with results obtained from the traditional light profile fitting tool GALFIT. We find excellent performance of our DL method in recovering the injected AGN fraction f_AGN, both in terms of precision and accuracy. The mean difference between the predicted and true injected f_AGN is -0.002 and the overall root mean square error (RMSE) is 0.013. The relative absolute error (RAE) is 0.076 and the outlier (defined as predictions with RAE &gt;20%) fraction is 6.5%. In comparison, using GALFIT on the same dataset, we achieve a mean difference of -0.02, RMSE of 0.12, RAE of 0.19 and outlier fraction of 19%. We applied our trained DL model to real JWST observations and found that 33% of X-ray-selected AGN and 15% of MIR-selected AGN are also identified as AGN using a cut at f_AGN &gt; 0.1.

### 294) [2408.15615](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15615v3): Narrow line AGN selection in CEERS: spectroscopic selection, physical properties, X-ray and radio analysis

<p>
In this work, we spectroscopically select narrow-line AGNs (NLAGNs) among the ~300 publicly available medium-resolution spectra of the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS). Using both traditional and newly identified emission line NLAGN diagnostics diagrams, we identified 52 NLAGNs at 2&lt;z&lt;9, on which we performed a detailed multiwavelength analysis. We also identified four new z&lt;2 broad-line AGNs (BLAGNs), in addition to the eight previously reported z&gt;4.5 BLAGNs. We found that most of the high-z NLAGN were selected using the recently proposed AGN diagnostic diagrams based on the [Oiii] λ4363 auroral line or high-ionization emission lines. We compared the emission line velocity dispersion and the obscuration levels of the sample of NLAGNs with those of the parent sample without finding significant differences between the two distributions, suggesting a population of AGNs heavily buried and not significantly impacting the host galaxies physical properties, as was further confirmed by spectral energy distribution fitting. The bolometric luminosities of the high-z NLAGNs selected in this work are ~1.5dex below the ones sampled by surveys before JWST, potentially explaining the weak impact of these AGNs. Finally, we investigated the X-ray properties of the selected NLAGNs and of the sample of high-z BLAGNs. We found that all but four NLAGNs are undetected in the deep X-ray image of the field, as well as all the high-z BLAGNs. We did not obtain a detection even by stacking the undetected sources, resulting in an X-ray weakness of ~1-2 dex from what was expected based on their bolometric luminosities. To discriminate between a heavily obscured AGN scenario or an intrinsic X-ray weakness of these sources, we performed a radio (1.4GHz) stacking analysis, which did not reveal any detection and left open the questions about the origin of the X-ray weakness.

### 295) [2408.15194](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15194v3): Halo mass functions at high redshift

<p> Hannah O'Brennan, John A. Regan, Chris Power, Saoirse Ward, John Brennan, Joe McCaffrey </p>
<p>
Recent JWST observations of very early galaxies, at z ≳ 10, have led to claims that tension exists between the sizes and luminosities of high-redshift galaxies and what is predicted by standard ΛCDM models. Here we use the adaptive mesh refinement code ttEnzo and the N-body smoothed particle hydrodynamics code ttSWIFT to compare (semi-)analytic halo mass functions against the results of direct N-body models at high redshift. In particular, our goal is to investigate the variance between standard halo mass functions derived from (semi-)analytic formulations and N-body calculations and to determine what role any discrepancy may play in driving tensions between observations and theory. We find that the difference between direct N-body calculations and (semi-) analytic halo mass function fits is less than a factor of 2 (at z ~ 10) within the mass range of galaxies currently being observed by JWST, and is therefore not a dominant source of error when comparing theory and observation at high redshift.

<p> Shin'ichiro Ando, Shyam Balaji, Malcolm Fairbairn, Nagisa Hiroshima, Koji Ishiwata </p>
<p>
Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations of high-redshift massive galaxy candidates have initiated renewed interest in the important mystery around the formation and evolution of our Universe's largest supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We consider the possibility that some of them were seeded by the direct collapse of primordial density perturbations from inflation into primordial black holes and analyze the consequences of this on current dark matter substructures assuming non-Gaussian primordial curvature perturbation distributions. We derive bounds on the enhanced curvature perturbation amplitude from the number of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in our Galaxy, observations of stellar streams and gravitational lensing. We find this bound region significantly overlaps with that required for SMBH seed formation and enables us to probe Gaussian and non-Gaussian curvature perturbations corresponding to the SMBH seeds in the range  O(10^5&ndash;10^12) M<sub>&odot;</sub>.

### 297) [2407.19481](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19481v2): What can we learn about Reionization astrophysical parameters using Gaussian Process Regression?

<p> Purba Mukherjee, Antara Dey, Supratik Pal </p>
<p>
Reionization is one of the least understood processes in the evolution history of the Universe, mostly because of the numerous astrophysical processes occurring simultaneously about which we do not have a very clear idea so far. In this article, we use the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) method to learn the reionization history and infer the astrophysical parameters. We reconstruct the UV luminosity density function using the HFF and early JWST data. From the reconstructed history of reionization, the global differential brightness temperature fluctuation during this epoch has been computed. We perform MCMC analysis of the global 21-cm signal using the instrumental specifications of SARAS, in combination with Lyman-α ionization fraction data, Planck optical depth measurements and UV luminosity data. Our analysis reveals that GPR can help infer the astrophysical parameters in a model-agnostic way than conventional methods. Additionally, we analyze the 21-cm power spectrum using the reconstructed history of reionization and demonstrate how the future 21-cm mission SKA, in combination with Planck and Lyman-α forest data, improves the bounds on the reionization astrophysical parameters by doing a joint MCMC analysis for the astrophysical parameters plus 6 cosmological parameters for ΛCDM model. The results make the GPR-based reconstruction technique a robust learning process and the inferences on the astrophysical parameters obtained therefrom are quite reliable that can be used for future analysis.

### 298) [2407.04777](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04777v3): Challenging the AGN scenario for JWST/NIRSpec LRD and non-LRD broad Hα emitters in light of non-detection of NIRCam photometric variability and X-ray

<p> Mitsuru Kokubo, Yuichi Harikane </p>
<p>
JWST has uncovered a substantial population of high-z (z ≳ 4) galaxies exhibiting broad Hα emission line with a Full Width at Half Maximum exceeding 1,000 km/s. This population consists of a well-known subset called Little Red Dots (LRDs) and the remaining non-LRDs. If all of these broad Hα emitters were attributed to type 1-1.9 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), it would imply a significantly higher number density of low-luminosity AGNs than extrapolated from that of more luminous AGNs. Here, we have examined the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV)-optical flux variability of three LRD and two non-LRD broad Hα emitters using multi-epoch, multi-band JWST/NIRCam imaging data. The rest-frame temporal sampling interval of the NIRCam data (~ 400-500~days/(1+z)) is comparable to typical variability timescales of AGNs with black hole (BH) masses of M_BH ~ 10^7~M<sub>&odot;</sub>; thus, the flux variations should be detectable if AGNs were present. However, no measurable flux variation over the rest-frame wavelength range of λ_rest ~ 1,500-9,000Å has been detected, placing stringent upper limits on the variability amplitudes. This result, combined with the X-ray faintness confirmed by the ultra-deep Chandra data, indicates that, under the AGN scenario, we need to postulate peculiar Compton-thick broad-line AGNs with either (a) an intrinsically non-variable AGN disk continuum, (b) a host galaxy-dominated continuum, or (c) scattering-dominated AGN emission. Alternatively, (d) they could be non-AGNs where the broad-line emission originates from unusually fast and dense/low-metallicity star-formation-driven outflows or inelastic Raman scattering of stellar UV continua by neutral hydrogen atoms.

### 299) [2405.18930](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18930v3): A short review on joint weak and strong cluster lens-mass reconstruction

<p> Ben David Normann, Kenny Solevåg-Hoti, Hans Georg Schaathun </p>
<p>
The distinction between weak and strong lensing is somewhat arbitrary, and both regimes are manifestations of the same physical phenomenon: gravity bending the path of light. Nevertheless, these two regimes have to a large extent been treated separately, since they require different approaches. This review traces the development of methods combining weak-lensing and strong-lensing data for joint lens-mass reconstruction, with a particular emphasis on cluster lenses, where both effects occur. We conclude that so-called inverse methods have been successful in merging the two regimes insofar data analysis is concerned. However, a number of improvements seem to be in place. First, not many studies include weak lensing data beyond shear. In light of the unprecedented quality of the data of JWST and future surveys, this is a clear point of improvement. Especially so since flexion terms have proven useful in determining sub-structures. Second, considering the amount of data available, and the complexity of non-parametric lenses, automating the processes of lens-mass reconstruction would be beneficial. Towards this end, invoking machine learning seems like a promising way forward.

<p>
We present an overview of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), an ambitious program of infrared imaging and spectroscopy in the GOODS-S and GOODS-N deep fields, designed to study galaxy evolution from high redshift to cosmic noon. JADES uses about 770 hours of Cycle 1 guaranteed time largely from the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) instrument teams. In GOODS-S, in and around the Hubble Ultra Deep Field and Chandra Deep Field South, JADES produces a deep imaging region of ~42 arcmin<sup>2</sup> with over 100 hrs of exposure time spread over 9 NIRCam filters, including two medium-band filters. This is extended at medium depth in GOODS-S and GOODS-N with NIRCam imaging of ~167 arcmin<sup>2</sup>, averaging 25 hrs of exposure over 8-10 filters. In both fields, we conduct extensive NIRSpec multi-object spectroscopy, including 2 deep pointings of 55 hrs exposure time, 14 medium pointings of ~12 hrs, and 15 shallower pointings of ~4 hrs, targeting over 5000 HST and JWST-detected faint sources with 5 low, medium, and high-resolution dispersers covering 0.6-5.3 um. Finally, JADES extends redward via coordinated parallels with the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), featuring ~10 arcmin<sup>2</sup> with 43 hours of exposure at 7.7 um and thrice that area with 1.4-6.8 hours of exposure at 12.8 um and 15 um. For nearly 30 years, the GOODS-S and GOODS-N fields have been developed as the premier deep fields on the sky; JADES is now providing a compelling start on the JWST legacy in these fields.
