### 1) [2410.24224](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24224v1): What is the origin of the JWST SMBHs?

<p> John Ellis, Malcolm Fairbairn, Juan Urrutia, Ville Vaskonen </p>
<p>
We present a new semi-analytical model for the evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that is based on the extended Press-Schechter formalism and phenomenological modelling of star formation. The model yields BH mass-stellar mass relations that reproduce both the JWST and pre-JWST observations. If the efficiency for BH mergers is high the JWST data prefer light seeds while the pre-JWST data prefers heavy seeds. The fit improves for a smaller merger efficiency, O(0.1), for which both data prefer heavy seeds, while also accommodating the PTA GW background data.

We investigate the coevolution of metals and dust for 173 galaxies at 4.0&lt;z&lt;11.4 observed with JWST/NIRSpec. We use the code CIGALE that integrates photometric and spectroscopic data. Our analysis reveals a critical transition at Mstar = 10^8.5 MSun, from galaxies dominated by supernovae and AGB stardust, to those dominated by grain growth. This implies a two-mode building of dust mass, supported by model predictions. The detection of stardust galaxies provides a natural and inherent explanation to the excess of UV-bright galaxies at z&gt;10 by JWST. Besides, we observe that the metallicity of galaxies at z&gt;8 presents a metal-to-stellar mass ratio larger than a few 10^-3, above a floor. This suggests a very fast rise of metals at high redshift, impacting the tentative detections of population III objects.

### 3) [2410.23606](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23606v1): A model for the emission line galaxy luminosity function and flux ratios at high-redshifts

<p> Aadarsh Pathak, J. Stuart B. Wyithe, Ralph S. Sutherland, L. J Kewley </p>
<p>
We present [OIII]/H_{\rm \beta} emision line flux ratio predictions for galaxies at z ~ 7-9 using the MAPPINGS V v5.2.0 photoionization modelling code combined with an analytic galaxy formation model. Properties such as pressure and ionization parameter that determine emission line properties are thought to evolve towards high redshift. In order to determine the range of expected interstellar conditions we extend previous modelling of the Star Formation Rate Density (SFRD) function to calculate the metallicity and ionization parameter, and incorporate the potential impact of turbulence on the density of the ISM. To validate our emission line predictions we calculate the [OIII] line luminosity and its dependence on UV luminosity, as well as the flux ratio [OIII]/H_{\rm \beta} and its variation with the line luminosity, finding that both reproduce recent JWST observations from the FRESCO survey. We also use our model to predict the number counts of emission line galaxies across a range of redshift as well as the dependence of [OIII]/H_{\rm \beta} on ionization parameter and metallicity. Finally, we show that the dependence of flux ratio on luminosity may provide a diagnostic of turbulent motion in galactic discs.

Pérez-González, Barry Rothberg, Raymond C. Simons, Brittany N. Vanderhoof, L. Y. Aaron Yung </p>
<p>
We use JWST/NIRISS slitless spectroscopy from the Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public (NGDEEP) Survey to investigate the physical condition of star-forming galaxies at 1.7 &lt; z &lt; 3.4. At these redshifts, the deep NGDEEP NIRISS slitless spectroscopy covers the [O II]\lambda\lambda3726,3729, [O III]\lambda\lambda4959,5007, H\beta and H\alpha emission features for galaxies with stellar masses \log(\mathrm{M_\ast/M_\odot}) \gtrsim 7, nearly a factor of a hundred lower than previous studies. We focus on the [O III]/[O II] (O_{32}) ratio which is primarily sensitive to the ionization state and with a secondary dependence on the gas-phase metallicity of the interstellar medium. We find significant (\gtrsim5\sigma) correlations between the O_{32} ratio and galaxy properties as O_{32} increases with decreasing stellar mass, decreasing star formation rate (SFR), increasing specific SFR (sSFR\equiv \mathrm{SFR}/M_*), and increasing equivalent width (EW) of H\beta and H\alpha. These trends suggest a tight connection between the ionization parameter and these galaxy properties. Galaxies at z~2-3 exhibit a higher O_{32} than local normal galaxies with the same stellar masses and SFRs, indicating that they have a higher ionization parameter and lower metallicity than local normal galaxies. In addition, we observe an evolutionary trend in the O_{32} -- EW(H\beta) relation from z~0 and z\gtrsim5, such that higher redshift galaxies have higher EW(H\beta) and higher O_{32} at fixed EW. We argue that both the enhanced recent star formation activity and the higher star formation surface density may contribute to the increase in O_{32} and the ionization parameter.

<p> R. Navarro-Carrera, P. Rinaldi, K. I. Caputi, E. Iani, V. Kokorev, J. Kerutt, R. Cooper </p>
<p>
We analyze a sample of 4500 photometrically-selected Ha emitter galaxies at redshifts z~2 and z~4-6 selected from James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) medium-band images in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey South (GOODS-S). The bulk (80%) of the galaxies in our sample have stellar masses lower than 10^8 Msun, with a median stellar mass of ~10^7.3 Msun. We derive Ha rest-frame equivalent widths ( EW0(Ha) ), line fluxes, and star formation rates using a robust photometric excess technique tested against spectroscopic measurements, being sensitive to EW0(Ha) &gt; 75 A. Both EW0(Ha) and sSFR(Ha) anti-correlate with stellar mass, and at fixed stellar mass, show a steep increasing trend with redshift sSFR(Ha) ~ (1+z)^2.55. By comparing the Ha and rest-frame UV-derived SFRs, we probe the star formation histories (SFHs) of our galaxies in the past 100 Myr. The fraction of low-mass galaxies (M &lt; 10^8 Msun) with signs of bursty star formation from their SFR(Ha)/SFR(UV) is ~ 50 %. It quickly drops to ~ 25 % for M &gt; 10^8 Msun. This is consistent with the results from sSFR(Ha), showing 80% and 17%, respectively. SFR(Ha)/SFR(UV) is a stricter criterion than those based on the galaxy sSFR(Ha), as it only identifies the strongest starbursts, the ones at the initial phases of a bursty star-formation episode.

### 6) [2410.23235](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23235v1): Protoplanetary disk chemistry and structure

<p> Merel L. R. van 't Hoff, Jennifer B. Bergner </p>
<p>
Knowledge of the composition of material that will form planets is crucial to understand planetary diversity and the occurrence of potentially habitable planets. Ultimately, it is the chemistry in circumstellar disks that determines the global make up of planetary systems, as the dust in these disks grows into giant planet cores and rocky planets, the gas becomes incorporated in giant planet atmospheres, and the ices can be delivered to rocky planets by comets and meteorites. With the advent of ALMA a decade ago and the recent launch of JWST, the composition of the disk gas and ice can now be studied in great detail. This review will provide an overview of our current knowledge of the disk chemical structure, focusing on the six elements essential to life on Earth: carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S).

### 7) [2410.23171](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23171v1): Dust extinction-curve variation in the translucent interstellar medium is driven by PAH growth

<p> Xiangyu Zhang, Brandon S. Hensley, Gregory M. Green </p>
<p>
The first all-sky, high-resolution, 3D map of the optical extinction curve of the Milky Way (Zhang & Green 2024) revealed an unexpected steepening of the extinction curve in the moderate-density, "translucent" interstellar medium (ISM). We argue that this trend is driven by growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) through gas-phase accretion. We find a strong anti-correlation between the slope of the optical extinction curve -- parameterized by R(V) -- and maps of PAH abundance -- parameterized by q_{\rm PAH} -- derived from infrared emission. The range of observed q_{\rm PAH} indicates PAH growth by a factor of ~2 between A_V ~eq 1 and 3. This implies a factor-of-two stronger 2175 Angstrom feature, which is sufficient to lower R(V) by the observed amount. This level of PAH growth is possible given rapid accretion timescales and the depletion of carbon in the translucent ISM. Spectral observations by JWST would provide a definitive test of this proposed explanation of R(V) variation.

### 8) [2410.22940](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22940v1): The Excess of JWST Bright Galaxies: a Possible Origin in the Ground State of Dynamical Dark Energy in the light of DESI 2024 Data

<p> Nicola Menci, Anjan Ananda Sen, Marco Castellano </p>
<p>
Recent observations by JWST yield a large abundance of luminous galaxies at z\gtrsim 10 compared to that expected in the CDM scenario based on extrapolations of the star formation efficiency measured at lower redshifts. While several astrophysical processes can be responsible for such observations, here we explore to what extent such an effect can be rooted in the assumed Dark Energy (DE) sector of the current cosmological model. This is motivated by recent results from different cosmological probes combined with the last data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), which indicate a tension in the DE sector of the concordance {\Lambda} CDM model. We have considered the effect of assuming a DE characterized by a negative {\Lambda} as the ground state of a quintessence field on the galaxy luminosity function (LF) at high redshifts. We find that such models naturally affect the galaxy UV luminosities in the redshift range 10 \lesssim z\lesssim 15 needed to match the JWST observations, and with the value of {\Omega}_{\Lambda}=[-0.6,-0.3] remarkably consistent with that required by independent cosmological probes. A sharp prediction of such models is the steep decline of the abundance of bright galaxies in the redshift range 15 \lesssim z\lesssim 16.

<p>
Red quasars, often associated with potent [OIII] outflows on both galactic and circumgalactic scales, may play a pivotal role in galactic evolution and black hole feedback. In this work, we explore the [FeII] emission in one such quasar at redshift z = 0.4352, F2M J110648.32+480712.3, using the integral field unit (IFU) mode of the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) aboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Our observations reveal clumpy [FeII] gas located to the south of the quasar. By comparing the kinematics of [FeII] and [OIII], we find that the clumpy [FeII] gas in the southeast and southwest aligns with the outflow, exhibiting similar median velocities up to v_50 ~ 1200 km/s and high velocity widths W_80 &gt; 1000 km/s. In contrast, the [FeII] gas to the south shows kinematics inconsistent with the outflow, with W_80 ~ 500 km/s, significantly smaller than the [OIII] at the same location, suggesting that the [FeII] may be confined within the host galaxy. Utilizing standard emission-line diagnostic ratios, we map the ionization sources of the gas. According to the MAPPINGS III shock models for [FeII]/Pabeta, the regions to the southwest and southeast of the quasar are primarily photoionized. Conversely, the [FeII] emission to the south is likely excited by shocks generated by the back-pressure of the outflow on the galaxy disk, a direct signature of the impact of the quasar on its host.

### 10) [2410.22466](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22466v1): Globular clusters as cosmic clocks: new cosmological hints from their integrated light

<p> Elena Tomasetti, Michele Moresco, Carmela Lardo, Andrea Cimatti, Raul Jimenez </p>
<p>
We explore the reliability and robustness in measuring the age, metallicity and mass of a sample of old Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) from their integrated light, setting the stage for using GCs as cosmic clocks at high redshift. We analyse 77 GCs from the WAGGS project, first by measuring Lick indices and spectroscopic breaks with PyLick, then performing full-spectral-fitting (FSF) with BAGPIPES. The analysis of Lick indices offers an estimate of the GCs' age and [Z/H], generally aligning with literature values, but highlights a subset of old GCs for which we estimate younger ages. This discrepancy is attributed to the presence of blue horizontal branches (HB), which are not accounted for in the stellar population models. With FSF we measure the GCs' ages, [Z/H], and masses, also testing the cosmological prior's impact on ages. Compared to isochrone fitting estimates, ages are best recovered when the cosmological prior is removed, with a 20% increase in GCs' ages compatible with literature values (within \pm1.5 Gyr). The derived [Z/H] and mass agree with the reference values, regardless of HB morphology or fit setting, with average discrepancies across the entire sample of \Delta[Z/H]=-0.02\pm0.24 dex and \Delta log(M/M_{\odot})=0.04\pm 0.28 dex. Ages are best recovered for metal-rich GCs ([Z/H]\geq-0.4) showing a red HB (HBR&gt;0), with 70% of the results compatible with literature values. Using a Gaussian Mixture Model, we identify a tail of 24 old GCs with age=13.4\pm1.1 Gyr. Being a natural lower limit to the age of the Universe, we use this value to constrain H_0, obtaining H_0 = 70.5^{+7.7}_{-6.3} km/s/Mpc (stat+syst) when a flat \LambdaCDM with \Omega_m =0.30 \pm 0.02 is assumed. Validating the study of GCs based on integrated light lays the foundation to extend this type of study to high-z, where lensed GCs have begun to appear, thanks to JWST. (abridged)

### 11) [2410.22138](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22138v2): On the Ubiquity of Extreme Baryon Concentrations in the Early Universe

<p> Alvio Renzini </p>
<p>
Early JWST observations have revealed the ubiquitous presence in the early Universe, up to z about 16, of extreme baryon concentrations, namely forming globular clusters, extremely dense galaxies that may or may not be UV bright, and supermassive black holes in relatively low-mass galaxies. This paper is trying to pinpoint which physical conditions may have favored the formation of such concentrations, that appear to be very common at high redshifts while their formation being progressively more and more rare at lower redshifts. Building on local globular cluster evidence, it is argued that such conditions can consist in a combination of a 10 Myr extended feedback free time, coupled to low angular-momentum densities in deep local minima of the ISM vorticity field, where baryon concentrations are more likely to form. It is argued that the former condition would follow from more massive stars failing to explode as supernovae, and the latter one from low vorticity prevailing in the early Universe, in contrast to later times with their secular increase of the angular momentum density due to the cumulative effect of tidal interactions.

### 12) [2410.21867](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21867v1): The missing FeII bump in faint JWST AGN: possible evidence for metal-poor broad-line regions at early cosmic times

<p> Bartolomeo Trefoloni, Xihan Ji, Roberto Maiolino, Francesco D'Eugenio, Hannah Übler, Jan Scholtz, Alesandro Marconi, Cosimo Marconcini, Giovanni Mazzolari </p>
<p>
Recent JWST observations have revealed a large population of intermediate/low-luminosity AGN at early times with peculiar properties, different from local AGN or luminous quasars. To better understand the physical conditions in the BLRs of these early AGN, we used the optical FeII (4434--4684 &#8491;) and the broad \rm H \beta emission, and the ratio between their equivalent widths R_{Fe}, as a probe on a purposefully assembled sample. Specifically, we gathered a sample of 26 high redshift (\langle z \rangle=6.4) AGN, observed by JWST, with broad \rm H\beta detection both in the high and low luminosity regimes (respectively 14 faint AGN and 12 quasars), to investigate their optical FeII emission properties. In addition, we carefully selected control samples at lower z. We found that the population of faint AGN (\rm \log(L_{H \beta} / (erg \, s^{-1}))\lesssim 44) exhibits a significantly lower FeII emission than their local counterparts (R_{Fe}&lt;0.24 versus R_{Fe}~eq0.85 in the control sample), while the quasars at the epoch of reionisation observed by JWST present a FeII emission profile that closely resembles that observed at z&lt;3. We argue that the weakness of the FeII bump in the faint JWST AGN might be due to the reduced metallicity of their broad line region (\lesssim 0.5~Z_{\odot}), while luminous quasars have already reached chemical maturity (~ Z{_\odot} or higher). Lastly, we highlight an intriguing similarity between the spectral properties of the high redshift population of faint AGN with those harboured in local metal poor dwarf galaxies.

### 13) [2410.21788](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21788v1): Tracing Outflows from Stellar Feedback in the Early Universe with Lyman-α

<p> James Nianias, Jeremy Lim, Yik Lok Wong, Gordon Wong, Ishika Kaur, Wenjun Chen </p>
<p>
Blind spectroscopy of massive lensing galaxy clusters with MUSE has revealed large numbers of gravitationally-lensed Lyman- \alpha emitters exhibiting asymmetric profiles at 2.9 \leq z \leq 6.7 , suggesting abundant outflows from low-mass star-forming galaxies in the early universe. Are these primaeval galaxies experiencing their first bursts of star formation, or established galaxies experiencing rejuvenation? With JWST rest-frame optical/NIR continuum imaging now available for many of these objects, we can search for older stellar populations. Here, we search for spectroscopic confirmation of outflows from these galaxies, finding a few high-signal-to-noise cases in which blueshifted interstellar absorption lines are detected. Next, we analyse the star formation histories with combined HST + JWST photometry. We find most them to be well characterised by very young, low metallicity stellar populations. However, despite the rest-frame optical/NIR coverage of JWST, we cannot place strict upper bounds on the mass in old stars (age &gt; 100\,\text{Myr} ).

### 14) [2410.21543](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21543v1): Improving photometric redshifts of Epoch of Reionization galaxies: a new transmission curve with the neutral hydrogen damped Lyα absorption

<p>
We present a new analytical model for the attenuation to Epoch of Reionization (EoR) galaxies by proximate neutral hydrogen gas. Many galaxy spectra in the EoR taken by JWST have shown a flux deficit at wavelengths just redward of the Lyman break, and this has been regarded as resulting from Ly\alpha damping wing absorption by the increasing amount of neutral hydrogen in the line-of-sight. However, previous attenuation models for the intergalactic medium (IGM) commonly used in photometric redshift template-fitting codes assume that the Lyman break is rather sharp, which leads to systematic overestimation of photometric redshifts at z&gt;7. In this letter, we build and empirically calibrate a new attenuation model that takes the increased Ly\alpha damping wing absorption into account. Our model consists of the canonical IGM absorption and an additional absorption component due to dense neutral hydrogen gas clouds proximate to the galaxy, and we derive the redshift evolution of HI column density of the proximate clouds by calibrating the model using CANUCS JWST observations. The resulting total transmission curve resolves the photometric redshift bias at z&gt;7, an improvement that is robust to choice of template-fitting code, template set, and photometric catalog used. The new attenuation model can be easily implemented in existing template-fitting codes, and significantly improves the photometric redshift performance in the EoR.

### 15) [2410.21409](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21409v1): Constraining bursty star formation histories with galaxy UV and Hα luminosity functions and clustering

<p> Guochao Sun, Julian B. Muñoz, Jordan Mirocha, Claude-André Faucher-Giguère </p>
<p>
The observed prevalence of galaxies exhibiting bursty star formation histories (SFHs) at z\gtrsim6 has created new challenges and opportunities for understanding their formation pathways. The degenerate effects of the efficiency and burstiness of star formation on the observed UV luminosity function are separable by galaxy clustering. However, quantifying the timescales of burstiness requires more than just the continuum UV measurements. Here we develop a flexible semi-analytic framework for modeling both the amplitude of star formation rate (SFR) variations and their temporal correlation, from which the luminosity function and clustering can be derived for SFR indicators tracing different characteristic timescales (e.g., UV continuum and H\alpha luminosities). Based on this framework, we study the prospect of using galaxy summary statistics to distinguish models where SFR fluctuations are prescribed by different power spectral density (PSD) forms. Using the Fisher matrix approach, we forecast the constraints on parameters in our PSD-based model that can be extracted from mock JWST observations of the UV and H\alpha luminosity functions and clustering bias factors at z~6. These constraints demonstrate the feasibility of constraining the burstiness of high-z galaxies solely from their one-point and two-point statistics and underscore the importance of combining tracers of both long-term and short-term SFR variations. Our flexible framework can be readily extended to characterize the SFH of high-redshift galaxies with a wider range of observational diagnostics.

### 16) [2410.21379](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21379v1): A Survey of Dynamical and Gravitational Lensing Tests in Scale Invariance: The Fall of Dark Matter?

<p> Andre Maeder, Frederic Courbin </p>
<p>
We first briefly review the adventure of scale invariance in physics, from Galileo Galilei, Weyl, Einstein, and Feynman to the revival by Dirac (1973) and Canuto et al. (1977). We then gather concrete observational evidence that scale-invariant effects are present and measurable in astronomical objects spanning a vast range of masses (0.5 M_{\odot} &lt; M &lt; 10^{14} M_{\odot}) and an equally impressive range of spatial scales (0.01 pc &lt; r &lt; 1 Gpc). Scale invariance accounts for the observed excess in velocity in galaxy clusters with respect to the visible mass, the relatively flat/small slope of rotation curves in local galaxies, the observed steep rotation curves of high-redshift galaxies, and the excess of velocity in wide binary stars with separations above 3000 kau found in Gaia DR3. Last but not least, we investigate the effect of scale invariance on gravitational lensing. We show that scale invariance does not affect the geodesics of light rays as they pass in the vicinity of a massive galaxy. However, scale-invariant effects do change the inferred mass-to-light ratio of lens galaxies as compared to GR. As a result, the discrepancies seen in GR between the total lensing mass of galaxies and their stellar mass from photometry may be accounted for. This holds true both for lenses at high redshift like JWST-ER1 and at low redshift like in the SLACS sample. Of note is that none of the above observational tests require dark matter or any adjustable parameter to tweak the theory at any given mass or spatial scale.

### 17) [2410.21368](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21368v1): Molecular Hydrogen in the Extremely Metal-Poor, Star-Forming Galaxy Leo P

<p> O. Grace Telford, Karin M. Sandstrom, Kristen B. W. McQuinn, Simon C. O. Glover, Elizabeth J. Tarantino, Alberto D. Bolatto, Ryan J. Rickards Vaught </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed unexpectedly rapid galaxy assembly in the early universe, in tension with models of star and galaxy formation. In the gas conditions typical of early galaxies, particularly their low abundances of heavy elements (metals) and dust, the star-formation process is poorly understood. Some models predict that stars form in atomic gas at low metallicity, in contrast to forming in molecular gas as observed in higher-metallicity galaxies. To understand the very high star-formation rates at early epochs, it is necessary to determine whether molecular gas formation represents a bottleneck to star formation, or if it is plentiful even at extremely low metallicity. Despite repeated searches, star-forming molecular gas has not yet been observed in any galaxy below 7% of the Solar metallicity, leaving the question of how stars form at lower metallicities unresolved. Here, we report the detection of rotationally excited emission from molecular hydrogen in the star-forming region of the nearby, 3% Solar metallicity galaxy Leo P with the MIRI-MRS instrument onboard JWST. These observations place a lower limit on the molecular gas content of Leo P and, combined with our upper limit on carbon monoxide emission from a deep search of this galaxy, demonstrate that MIRI-MRS is sensitive to much smaller molecular gas masses at extremely low metallicity compared to the traditional observational tracer. This discovery pushes the maximum metallicity at which purely atomic gas may fuel star formation a factor of two lower, providing crucial empirical guidance for models of star formation in the early universe.

<p> Zhaoran Liu, Tadayuki Kodama, Takahiro Morishita, Kianhong Lee, Fengwu Sun, Mariko Kubo, Zheng Cai, Yunjing Wu, Zihao Li </p>
<p>
We present a joint analysis of high-resolution CO(2-1) and Paschen-\alpha emission lines to trace gas dynamics and spatially resolved star formation in ASPECS-LP.3mm.06, a z=1.1 main sequence galaxy. Utilizing data from the ALMA and JWST NIRCam Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS), we explore both ionized gas and molecular gas within this galaxy. With a substantial molecular gas fraction (f_\mathrm{mol} = 0.44 \pm 0.02), ASPECS-LP.3mm.06 remains on the star-forming main sequence and adheres to the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, indicating typical gas-to-star conversion efficiency. Our analysis reveals extended structures across multiple wavelengths, suggesting regulated star formation within a stable disk. The spatially resolved star formation efficiency (SFE) and kinematic analysis indicate that ASPECS-LP.3mm.06 features a smooth mass assembly process across bulge and disk. Additionally, the galaxy exhibits modest dust extinction (A_\mathrm{V} = 0.8), potentially linked to self-regulation during bulge formation. These findings position ASPECS-LP.3mm.06 as a prototypical galaxy, offering valuable insights into the mechanisms governing normal disk galaxy growth at z~1.

### 19) [2410.20663](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20663v1): Sub-Eddington accreting supermassive primordial black holes explain Little Red Dots

<p> Hai-Long Huang, Jun-Qian Jiang, Jibin He, Yu-Tong Wang, Yun-Song Piao </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered an abundant population of compact, extremely red, and X-ray weak objects at z\gtrsim4, knows as ``Little Red Dots" (LRDs). These objects exhibit spectral energy distributions that resemble both active galactic nuclei (AGN) and stellar population templates. However, whether dominated by AGN activity or compact star formation, the high redshifts and masses/luminosities of LRDs, coupled with their significant abundance, present potential challenges to the standard \LambdaCDM model. In this work, we proposes a novel cosmic interpretation of this anomaly, suggesting that these LRDs are likely massive galaxies seeded by supermassive primordial black holes (SMPBHs) came into being in the very early universe. We analyze 434 known LRDs from the 0.54 {\rm deg}^2 COSMOS-Web survey and test the hypothesis that they originated from SMPBHs assuming sub-Eddington accretion. According to our result, SMPBHs actually could lead to the existence of more LRDs, even at higher redshifts (z&gt;8).

### 20) [2410.19900](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19900v1): The cooler past of the intracluster medium in TNG-Cluster

<p> Eric Rohr, Annalisa Pillepich, Dylan Nelson, Mohammadreza Ayromlou, Céline Péroux, Elad Zinger </p>
<p>
The intracluster medium (ICM) today is comprised largely of hot gas with clouds of cooler gas of unknown origin and lifespan. We analyze the evolution of cool gas (temperatures \lesssim10^{4.5} K) in the ICM of 352 galaxy clusters from the TNG-Cluster simulations, with present-day mass ~10^{14.3-15.4}\,{\rm M_\odot}. We follow the main progenitors of these clusters over the past ~13 billion years (since z\lesssim7) and find that, according to TNG-Cluster, the cool ICM mass increases with redshift at fixed cluster mass, implying that this cooler past of the ICM is due to more than just halo growth. The cool cluster gas at z\lesssim0.5 is mostly located in and around satellite galaxies, while at z\gtrsim2 cool gas can also accrete via filaments from the intergalactic medium. Lower-mass and higher-redshift clusters are more susceptible to cooling. The cool ICM mass correlates with the number of gaseous satellites and inversely with the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass. The average number of gaseous satellites decreases since z=2, correlating with the decline in the cool ICM mass over cosmic time, suggesting a link between the two. Concurrently, kinetic SMBH feedback shifts the ICM temperature distribution, decreasing the cool ICM mass inside-out. At z\approx0.5, the predicted MgII column densities are in the ballpark of recent observations, where satellites and other halos contribute significantly to the total MgII column density. Suggestively, a non-negligible amount of the ICM cool gas forms stars in-situ at early times, reaching ~10^{2}\,{\rm M_\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}} and an H\alpha surface brightness of ~10^{-17}\,{\rm~erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,arcsec^{-2}} at z\approx2, detectable with Euclid and JWST.

### 21) [2410.19042](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19042v1): Blue Monsters at z&gt;10. Where has all their dust gone?

<p> A. Ferrara, A. Pallottini, L. Sommovigo </p>
<p>
The properties of luminous, blue (a.k.a. Blue Monsters), super-early galaxies at redshift z&gt;10 have been successfully explained by the attenuation-free model (AFM) in which dust is pushed to kpc-scales by radiation-driven outflows. As an alternative to AFM, here we assess whether *attenuation-free* conditions can be replaced by a *dust-free* scenario in which dust is produced in very limited amounts and/or later destroyed in the interstellar medium. To this aim we compare the predicted values of the dust-to-stellar mass ratio, \xi_d, with those measured in 15 galaxies at z&gt;10 from JWST spectra, when outflows are not included. Our model constrains \xi_d as a function of several parameters by allowing wide variations in the IMF, dust/metal production, and dust destruction for a set of SN progenitor models and explosion energies. We find \log \xi_d \approx -2.2 for all systems, indicative of the dominant role of SN dust production over destruction in these early galaxies. Such value is strikingly different from the data, which instead indicate \log \xi_d &lt; -4. We conclude that dust destruction alone can hardly explain the transparency of Blue Monsters. Other mechanisms, such as outflows, might be required.

### 22) [2410.18980](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18980v1): Very massive stars and Nitrogen-emitting galaxies

<p> Jorick S. Vink </p>
<p>
Recent studies of high-redshift galaxies using JWST, such as GN-z11 revealed highly elevated levels of nitrogen (N). This phenomenon extends to gravitationally-lensed galaxies like the Sunburst Arc at z = 2.37, as well as to globular clusters (GCs). We propose that this originates from the presence of very massive stars (VMSs) with masses ranging from 100 to 1000\,\Msun. The He {\sc ii} observed in the Sunburst Arc could also stem from the disproportionately large contribution of VMSs. We build an entirely new Framework for massive star evolution which is no longer set by Dutch or other mass-loss "recipes" but which take the physics of \Gamma or L/M-dependent winds into account. We discuss the mass-loss kink and the transition mass-loss rate between optically thin and thick winds, before we study the evaporative mass-loss history of VMSs. Our novel evolution models exhibit vertical evolution in the HR-diagram from the zero-age main sequence due to a self-regulatory effect driven by their wind-dominated nature, and we discuss what wind physics sets the stellar upper-mass limit. Our estimate for the Sunburst Arc in Vink (2023) suggests that the significant amounts of N found in star-forming galaxies likely arise from VMSs. We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of previous hypotheses, including fast rotating massive stars and supermassive stars (SMSs), and we conclude that only our VMS model satisfies the relevant criteria. Finally, we advocate for the inclusion of VMSs in population synthesis and chemical evolution models, emphasizing the need for a self-consistent wind approach, which currently does not exist. Even minor inaccuracies in mass-loss rates dramatically impact the stellar evolution of VMS, as well as their ionizing and chemical feedback.

### 23) [2410.18909](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18909v1): A Study of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Emission in 30 Dor as seen by JWST

<p> Congcong Zhang, Joelene Hales, Els Peeters, Jan Cami, Ameek Sidhu, Junfeng Zhen </p>
<p>
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are responsible for strong mid-IR emission features near star-forming regions. It is well known that low-metallicity environments exhibit weaker PAH emission, but it is not clear how the metallicity affects the properties of the emitting PAH population. We present a detailed study of the PAH emission in the low-metallicity regime represented by 30 Dor in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and we compare it to the PAH emission in the Orion Bar to investigate the characteristics of the PAH population and how the environments affects the resulting IR emission. We analyze JWST observations of 30 Dor that include imaging (NIRCam, MIRI) and spectroscopy (NIRSpec/IFU, MIRI/MRS). We extracted NIRSpec/IFU and MIRI/MRS spectra from 18 apertures that cover the morphological structures of 30 Dor. We characterize the profiles and relative intensities of PAH emission in these apertures. The detailed profiles of the PAH emission bands in 30 Dor are all very similar, and compare well to those from one of the dissociation fronts (DF2) in the Orion Bar. The relative band ratios on the other hand show a much larger range than in the Orion Bar. The PAH emission in 30 Dor originates from a population with a higher ionization fraction than in the Orion Bar, and a size distribution that has more smaller PAHs. Since smaller PAHs typically photo-fragment before larger PAHs, our findings support the hypothesis that the lower PAH emission for lower metallicities is the result of inhibition of growth toward larger PAHs rather than photo-fragmentation.

Zavala </p>
<p>
We present JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopic characterization of GHZ9 at z= 10.145 \pm 0.010, currently the most distant source detected by the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The spectrum reveals several UV high-ionization lines, including CII, SiIV, [NIV], CIV, HeII, OIII], NIII], and CIII]. The prominent rest-frame equivalent widths (EW(CIV)~eq65A, EW(HeII)~eq18A, EW(CIII])~eq48A) show the presence of a hard radiation field, while the analysis of line ratio diagnostics suggest this galaxy hosts both AGN and star-formation activity. GHZ9 is nitrogen-enriched (6--9.5 times solar), carbon-poor (0.2--0.65 times solar), metal-poor (Z = 0.01--0.1 Z_{\odot}), and compact (&lt; 106 pc), similarly to GNz11, GHZ2, and recently discovered N-enhanced high redshift objects. We exploited the newly available JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam dataset to perform an independent analysis of the Chandra data confirming that GHZ9 is the most likely JWST source associated to X-ray emission at 0.5-7 keV. Assuming a spectral index \Gamma = 2.3 (1.8), we estimate a black hole (BH) mass of 1.60 \pm 0.31 (0.48 \pm 0.09) \times 10^8M_{\odot}, which is consistent either with Eddington-accretion onto heavy (\geq 10^6 M_{\odot}) BH seeds formed at z=18, or super-Eddington accretion onto a light seed of ~ 10^2-10^4 M_{\odot} at z = 25. The corresponding BH-to-stellar mass ratio M_{BH}/M_{star}= 0.33\pm0.22 (0.10\pm0.07), with a stringent limit &gt;0.02, implies an accelerated growth of the BH mass with respect to the stellar mass. GHZ9 is the ideal target to constrain the early phases of AGN-galaxy coevolution with future multi-frequency observations.

<p>
[Abridged] The [OIII]_{88&mu; m}/[CII]_{158&mu; m} and [OIII]_{88&mu; m}/[NII]_{122&mu; m} luminosity ratios have shown to be promising tracers of the ionisation state and gas-phase metallicity of the ISM. Observations of galaxies at redshift z &gt; 6 show peculiarly higher [OIII]_{88&mu; m}/[CII]_{158&mu; m} luminosity ratios compared to local sources. No model has so far successfully managed to match the observed emission from both [OIII]_{88&mu; m} and [CII]_{158&mu; m} as well as their ratio. We use Cloudy to model the [CII]_{158&mu; m}, [OIII]_{88&mu; m}, [NII]_{122&mu; m} and [NIII]_{57&mu; m} emission lines of Ponos: a high-resolution (m_{\mathrm{gas}} = 883.4\, M_{\odot}) cosmological zoom-in simulation of a galaxy at redshift z = 6.5, which is post-processed using kramses-rt. We modify Carbon, Nitrogen and Oxygen abundances in our Cloudy models to obtain C/O and N/O abundance ratios respectively lower and higher than Solar, more in line with recent high-z observational constraints. We find [OIII]_{88&mu; m}/[CII]_{158&mu; m} luminosity ratios that are a factor of ~ 5 higher compared to models assuming solar abundances. Additionally, we find an overall better agreement of the simulation with high-z observational constraints of the [CII]_{158&mu; m}-SFR and [OIII]_{88&mu; m}-SFR relations. This shows that a lower C/O abundance ratio is essential to reproduce the enhanced [OIII]_{88&mu; m}/[CII]_{158&mu; m} luminosity ratios observed at z &gt; 6. By assuming a super-solar N/O ratio, motivated by recent z &gt; 6 JWST observations, our models yield an [OIII]_{88&mu; m}/[NII]_{122&mu; m} ratio of 1.3, which, according to current theoretical models, would be more appropriate for a galaxy with a lower ionisation parameter than the one we estimated for Ponos.

<p>
The presence of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in low mass (Mstar \lesssim 10^{9} Msun) galaxies at high redshift has been established, and it is important to characterise these objects and the impact of their feedback on the host galaxies. In this paper we apply the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting code BEAGLE-AGN to SMACS S06355, a z ~ 7.66 Type-II AGN candidate from the JWST NIRSpec Early Release Observations. This object's spectrum includes a detection of the [NeIV]2426 line, indicating an obscured AGN due to its high ionization potential energy (~ 63eV). We use BEAGLE-AGN to simultaneously model the Narrow Line Region (NLR) AGN and star-forming galaxy contributions to the observed line fluxes and photometry. Having a high-ionization emission line allows the contribution of the NLR to the remaining lines to be probabilistically disentangled. The HII region metallicity is derived to be 12+log(O/H)^{\mathrm{HII}} = 7.74^{+0.18}_{-0.19}. Assuming that the Neon-to-Oxygen abundance is similar to solar we derive a high NLR metallicity of 12+log(O/H)^\mathrm{{NLR}} = 8.77^{+0.14}_{-0.16}, with the 2\sigma lower-limit extending to 12+log(O/H)^{\mathrm{NLR}} ~ 8.00, showing the derivation is uncertain. We discuss this result with respect to non-solar Neon abundances that might boost the inferred NLR metallicity. The NLR metallicity places SMACS S06355 in a comparable region of the mass-metallicity plane to intermediate (1.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 3.0) redshift obscured AGN. Our derived accretion disc luminosity, log(L_{acc} / erg s^{-1}) = 45.19^{+0.12}_{-0.11}, is moderately high yet still uncertain. We highlight that deviations between bolometric luminosity calibrations and model grid tracks become enhanced at low metallicities.

### 27) [2410.18187](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18187v1): JWST/MIRI detection of a carbon-rich chemistry in a solar nebula analog

It has been proposed, and confirmed by multiple observations, that disks around low mass stars display a molecule-rich emission and carbon-rich disk chemistry as compared to their hotter, more massive solar counterparts. In this work, we present JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey (JDISCS) MIRI-MRS observations of the solar-mass star DoAr 33, a low-accretion rate T Tauri star showing an exceptional carbon-rich inner disk. We report detections of H_2O, OH, and CO_2, as well as the more complex hydrocarbons, C_2H_2 and C_4H_2. Through the use of thermochemical models, we explore different spatial distributions of carbon and oxygen across the inner disk and compare the column densities and temperatures obtained from LTE slab model retrievals. We find a best match to the observed column densities with models that have carbon enrichment, and the retrieved emitting temperature and area of C_2H_2 with models that have C/O = 2-4 inside the 500 K carbon-rich dust sublimation line. This suggests that the origin of the carbon-rich chemistry is likely due to the sublimation of carbon rich grains near the soot line. This would be consistent with the presence of dust processing as indicated by the detection of crystalline silicates. We propose that this long-lived hydrocarbon rich chemistry observed around a solar-mass star is a consequence of the unusually low M-star-like accretion rate of the central star, which lengthens the radial mixing timescale of the inner disk allowing the chemistry powered by carbon grain destruction to linger.

We develop a parametrised model to describe the formation and evolution of massive black holes, designed for comparisons with both electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations. Using an extended Press-Schechter formalism, we generate dark matter halo merger trees. We then seed and evolve massive black holes through parameterised prescriptions. This approach, which avoids solving differential equations, is computationally efficient, enabling us to analyse observational data and infer the parameters of our model in a fully Bayesian framework. We find that observations of the black hole luminosity function are compatible with the nHz gravitational wave signal (likely) measured by PTAs, provided we allow for an increased luminosity function at high redshift (4-7), as recently suggested by JWST observations. Our model can simultaneously reproduce the bulk of the M_*-M_{\rm BH} relation at z-0, as well as its outliers, something cosmological simulations struggle to do. The inferred model parameters are consistent with expectations from observations and more complex simulations: They favour heavier black hole seeds and short delays between halo and black hole mergers, while requiring supper-Edington accretion episodes lasting a few tens of million years, which in our model are linked to galaxy mergers. We find accretion to be suppressed in the most massive black holes below z~eq 2.5, consistently with the anti-hierarchical growth hypothesis. Finally, our predictions for LISA, although fairly broad, are in agreement with previous models. Our model offers a new perspective on the apparent tensions between the black hole luminosity function and the latest JWST and PTA results. Its flexibility makes it ideal to fully exploit the potential of future gravitational wave observations of massive black hole binaries with LISA.

<p>
We present spectroscopic properties of 22 Lyman-alpha emitters(LAEs) at z=5.5-6.6 with Lyman-alpha(Lya) luminosity log(L_{Lya}[ergs^{-1}])=42.4-43.5, obtained using VLT/MUSE as part of the Middle Ages Galaxy Properties with Integral Field Spectroscopy(MAGPI) survey. Additionally, we incorporate broad-band photometric data from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam(HSC) for 17 LAEs in our sample. The HSC-y band magnitudes show that our LAEs are UV-bright, with rest-frame absolute UV magnitudes -19.7 &lt; M_{UV} &lt; -23.3. We find that the Lya line width increases with luminosity, and this trend becomes more prominent at z &gt; 6 where Lya lines become significantly broadened (&gt; 260 kms^{-1}) at luminosities log(L_{Lya}[ergs^{-1}]) &gt; 43. This broadening is consistent with previous studies, suggesting that these sources are located inside larger ionized bubbles. We observe a slightly elevated ionizing photon production efficiency estimated for LAEs at z &gt; 6, indicating that younger galaxies could be producing more ionizing photons per UV luminosity. A tentative anti-correlation between ionizing photon production efficiency and Lya rest-frame equivalent width is noticed, which could indicate a time delay between production and escape of ionizing photon primarily due to supernovae activity. Furthermore, we find a positive correlation between bubble radius and Lya line width, which again suggests that large ionized bubbles are created around these LAEs, allowing them to self-shield from the scattering effects of the intergalactic medium (IGM). We also detect two closely separated LAEs at z=6.046 (projected spatial separation is 15.92 kpc). The size of their respective bubbles suggests that they likely sit inside a common large ionized region. Such a closely-separated LAE pair increases the size of ionized bubble, potentially allowing a boosted transmission of Lya through neutral IGM. (Abridged)

<p>
We present archival HST and JWST ultraviolet through near infrared time series photometric observations of a massive minimal-contact binary candidate in the metal-poor galaxy WLM (Z = 0.14 Z_{\odot}). This discovery marks the lowest metallicity contact binary candidate observed to date. We determine the nature of the two stars in the binary by using the eclipsing binary modeling software (PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs; PHOEBE) to train a neural network to fit our observed panchromatic multi-epoch photometry. The best fit model consists of two hot MS stars (T_1=29800^{+2300}_{-1700} K, M_1=16^{+2}_{-3}~M_{\odot}, and T_2=18000^{+5000}_{-5000} K, M_2=7^{+5}_{-3}~M_{\odot}). We discuss plausible evolutionary paths for the system, and suggest the system is likely to be currently in a contact phase before ultimately ending in a merger. Future spectroscopy will help to further narrow down evolutionary pathways. This work showcases a novel use of data of JWST and HST imaging originally taken to characterize RR Lyrae. We expect time series imaging from LSST, BlackGEM, etc. to uncover similar types of objects in nearby galaxies.

### 31) [2410.16389](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16389v1): A systematic analysis of star cluster disruption by tidal shocks -- II. Predicting star cluster dissolution rates from a time-series analysis of their tidal histories

<p> Jeremy J. Webb, Marta Reina-Campos, J. M. Diederik Kruijssen </p>
<p>
Most of the dynamical mass loss from star clusters is thought to be caused by the time-variability of the tidal field (``tidal shocks''). Systematic studies of tidal shocks have been hampered by the fact that each tidal history is unique, implying both a reproducibility and a generalisation problem. Here we address these issues by investigating how star cluster evolution depends on the statistical properties of its tidal history. We run a large suite of direct N-body simulations of clusters with tidal histories generated from power spectra of a given slope and with different normalisations, which determine the time-scales and amplitudes of the shocks, respectively. At fixed normalisation (i.e. the same median tidal field strength), the dissolution time-scale is nearly independent of the power spectrum slope. However, the dispersion in dissolution time-scales, obtained by repeating simulations for different realisations of statistically identical tidal histories, increases with the power spectrum slope. This result means that clusters experiencing high-frequency shocks have more similar mass loss histories than clusters experiencing low-frequency shocks. The density-mass relationship of the simulated clusters follows a power-law with slope between 1.08 and 1.45, except for the lowest normalisations (for which clusters effectively evolve in a static tidal field). Our findings suggest that star cluster evolution can be described statistically from a time-series analysis of its tidal history, which is an important simplification for describing the evolution of the star cluster population during galaxy formation and evolution.

### 32) [2410.16354](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16354v1): Galaxy Size and Mass Build-up in the First 2 Gyrs of Cosmic History from Multi-Wavelength JWST NIRCam Imaging

<p>
The evolution of galaxy sizes in different wavelengths provides unique insights on galaxy build-up across cosmic epochs. Such measurements can now finally be done at z&gt;3 thanks to the exquisite spatial resolution and multi-wavelength capability of the JWST. With the public data from the CEERS, PRIMER-UDS, and PRIMER-COSMOS surveys, we measure the sizes of ~ 3500 star-forming galaxies at 3 \leqslant z&lt;9, in 7 NIRCam bands using the multi-wavelength model fitting code GalfitM. The size-mass relation is measured in four redshift bins, across all NIRCam bands. We find that, the slope and intrinsic scatter of the rest-optical size-mass relation are constant across this redshift range and consistent with previous HST-based studies at low-z. When comparing the relations across different wavelengths, the average rest-optical and rest-UV relations are consistent with each other up to z=6, but the intrinsic scatter is largest in rest-UV wavelengths compared to rest-optical and redder bands. This behaviour is independent of redshift and we speculate that it is driven by bursty star-formation in z&gt;4 galaxies. Additionally, for 3\leqslant z&lt;4 star-forming galaxies at \rm M_* &gt; 10^{10} M_{\odot}, we find smaller rest-\rm 1\rm\,&mu; m sizes in comparison to rest-optical (and rest-UV) sizes, suggestive of colour gradients. When comparing to simulations, we find agreement over \rm M_* \approx 10^{9} - 10^{10} M_{\odot} but beyond this mass, the observed size-mass relation is significantly steeper. Our results show the power of JWST/NIRCam to provide new constraints on galaxy formation models.

### 33) [2410.15269](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15269v1): Asymmetry in galaxy spin directions: a fully reproducible experiment using HSC data

<p> Lior Shamir </p>
<p>
The asymmetry in the large-scale distribution of the directions towards spiral galaxies rotate has been observed by multiple telescopes, all show a consistent asymmetry in the distribution of galaxy spin directions as observed from Earth. Here, galaxies with redshift from HSC DR3 are annotated by their direction of rotation, and their distribution is analyzed. The results show that galaxies that rotate in the opposite direction relative to the Milky Way as observed from Earth are significantly more prevalent compared to galaxies that rotate in the same direction relative to the Milky Way. The asymmetry also forms a dipole axis that becomes stronger when the redshift gets higher. These results are aligned with observations from virtually all premier digital sky surveys, as well as space telescopes such as HST and JWST. That shows that the distribution of galaxy spin directions as observed from Earth is not symmetric, and has a possible link to the rotational velocity of the Milky Way. The experiment is provided with data, code, and a full protocol that allows to easily reproduce the results in a transparent manner. That practice is used to overcome the ``reproducibility crisis" in science.

### 34) [2410.14846](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14846v1): Early Bright Galaxies from Helium Enhancements in High-Redshift Star Clusters

<p> Harley Katz, Alexander P. Ji, O. Grace Telford, Peter Senchyna </p>
<p>
The first few cycles of JWST have identified an overabundance of UV-bright galaxies and a general excess of UV luminosity density at z\gtrsim10 compared to expectations from most (pre-JWST) theoretical models. Moreover, some of the brightest high-redshift spectroscopically confirmed galaxies exhibit peculiar chemical abundance patterns, most notably extremely high N/O ratios. Since N/O has been empirically shown to scale strongly with He/H, as expected for hot hydrogen burning, these same bright high-redshift galaxies are likely also helium-enhanced. Under simplistic assumptions for stellar evolution, the bolometric luminosity of a star scales as L\propto (4-\frac{9}{2}Y+\frac{5}{4}Y^{2})^{-1} -- hence a higher He/H leads to brighter stars. In this Letter, we evolve a series of MESA models to the zero-age main-sequence and highlight that the helium enhancements at the levels measured and inferred for high-redshift galaxies can boost the 1500 \mathring{\rm A} UV luminosity by up to ~50&percnt;, while simultaneously increasing the stellar effective temperature. The combination of helium enhancements with nebular continuum emission expected for intense bursts of star formation have the potential to help reduce the tension between JWST observations and certain galaxy formation models.

<p>
The topology of reionization and the environments where galaxies efficiently produce ionizing photons are key open questions. For the first time, we investigate the correlation between ionizing photon production efficiency, \xi_{\rm ion}, and galaxy overdensity, \log(1+\delta). We analyze the ionizing properties of 93 galaxies between 0.7 &lt; z &lt; 6.9 using JWST NIRSpec medium-resolution spectra from the Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument (MIRI) Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES) program. Among these, 67 galaxies have H\alpha coverage, spanning 0.7 &lt; z &lt; 3.7. The galaxy overdensity, \log(1+\delta), is measured using the JADES photometric catalog, which covers the SMILES footprint. For the subset with H\alpha coverage, we find that \log\xi_{\rm ion} is positively correlated with \log(1+\delta), with a slope of 0.94_{-0.46}^{+0.46}. Additionally, the mean \xi_{\rm ion} for galaxies in overdense regions (\log(1+\delta) &gt; 0.1) is 2.43 times that of galaxies in lower density regions (\log(1+\delta) &lt; 0.1). This strong correlation is found to be independent of redshift evolution. Furthermore, our results confirm the robust correlations between \xi_{\rm ion} and the rest-frame equivalent widths of the [O III] or H\alpha emission lines. Our results suggest that galaxies in high-density regions are efficient producers of ionizing photons.

<p>
In this Letter, we investigate the turbulence and energy injection in the extended nebulae surrounding two luminous obscured quasars, WISEA J100211.29+013706.7 (z=1.5933) and SDSS J165202.64+172852.3 (z=2.9489). Utilizing high-resolution data from the NIRSpec IFU onboard the James Webb Space Telescope, we analyze the velocity fields of line-emitting gas in and around these quasars and construct the second-order velocity structure functions (VSFs) to quantify turbulent motions across different spatial scales. Our findings reveal a notable flattening in the VSFs from \approx\!3 kpc up to a scale of 10--20 kpc, suggesting that energy injection predominantly occurs at a scale \lesssim10 kpc, likely powered by quasar outflows and jet-driven bubbles. The extended spatial range of flat VSFs may also indicate the presence of multiple energy injection sources at these scales. For J1652, the turbulent energy in the host interstellar medium (ISM) is significantly higher than in tidally stripped gas, consistent with the expectation of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activities stirring up the host ISM. Compared to the VSFs observed on spatial scales of 10--50 kpc around lower-redshift UV-bright quasars, these obscured quasars exhibit higher turbulent energies in their immediate surroundings, implying different turbulence drivers between the ISM and halo-scale gas. Future studies with an expanded sample are essential to elucidate further the extent and the pivotal role of AGNs in shaping the gas kinematics of host galaxies and beyond.

### 37) [2410.14671](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14671v1): Rapid Dust Formation in the Early Universe

<p> Danial Langeroodi, Jens Hjorth, Andrea Ferrara, Christa Gall </p>
<p>
Interstellar dust links the formation of the first stars to the rocky planet we inhabit by playing a pivotal role in the cooling and fragmentation of molecular clouds, and catalyzing the formation of water and organic molecules. Despite its central role, the origin of dust and its formation timescale remain unknown. Some models favor rapid production in supernova ejecta as the primary origin of dust, while others invoke slower production by evolved asymptotic giant branch stars or grain growth in the interstellar medium (ISM). The dust content of young early-universe galaxies is highly sensitive to the dust formation timescales. Here, we evaluate the dust content of 631 galaxies at 3 &lt; z_{\rm spec} &lt; 14 based on rest-UV to optical spectroscopy obtained with JWST NIRSpec. We find that dust appears rapidly. Attenuation immediately follows star formation on timescales shorter than ~ 30 Myr, favoring dust production by supernovae. The degree of attenuation is ~ 30 times lower than expected if the entire supernova dust yield were preserved in the ISM, and had Milky Way-like grain properties. This can be reconciled if the early-universe dust is composed mostly of silicate or grains much larger than those in the Milky Way, and if significant dust destruction or ejection by outflows takes place.

Quasar feedback may play a key role in the evolution of massive galaxies. The dust-reddened quasar, F2M110648.35+480712 at z = 0.4352 is one of the few cases at its redshift that exhibits powerful quasar feedback through bipolar outflows. Our new observation with the integral field unit mode of Near-infrared Spectrograph onboard JWST opens a new window to examine this spectacular outflow through Pa\alpha emission line with ~3\times better spatial resolution than previous work. The morphology and kinematics of the Pa\alpha nebula confirm the existence of a bipolar outflow extending on a scale of ~17\times14 kpc and with a velocity reaching ~1100 km s^{-1}. The higher spatial resolution of our new observation leads to more reliable measurements of outflow kinematics. Considering only the spatially resolved outflow and assuming an electron density of 100 cm^{-2}, the mass, momentum and kinetic energy outflow rates are ~50-210 M_{\odot} yr^{-1}, ~0.3-1.7\times10^{36} dynes (~14-78&percnt; of the quasar photon momentum flux) and ~0.16-1.27\times10^{44} erg s^{-1} (~0.02-0.20&percnt; of the quasar bolometric luminosity), respectively. The local instantaneous outflow rates generally decrease radially. We infer that the quasar is powerful enough to drive the outflow, while stellar processes cannot be overlooked as a contributing energy source. The mass outflow rate is ~0.4-1.5 times the star formation rate, and the ratio of kinetic energy outflow rate to the quasar bolometric luminosity is comparable to the minimum value required for negative quasar feedback in simulations. This outflow may help regulate the star formation activity within the system to some extent.

The latest ALMA and JWST observations provide new information on the birth and evolution of galaxies in the early Universe, at the epoch of reionization. Of particular importance are measurements at redshift z &gt; 5 of their cold-gas budget, which is known to be the main fuel for star formation. A powerful tool for probing the physics characterising galaxies at high redshift is the \CII\ 158\,\rm &mu; m emission line. Due to its low excitation potential, \CII\ emission can be produced in photodissociation regions, neutral atomic gas and molecular clouds. To properly capture the cold-gas processes taking place in such environments (molecule formation, self-shielding, dust grain catalysis, photoelectric and cosmic-ray heating), we make use of a new set of state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations (\coldsim) including time-dependent non-equilibrium chemistry, star formation, stellar evolution, metal spreading and feedback mechanisms. We are able to accurately track the evolution of \HI, \HII\ and H_2 in a cosmological context and predict the contribution of each gas phase to \CII\ luminosity. We provide formulas that can be used to estimate the mass of molecular and atomic gas from \CII\ detections. Furthermore, we analyse how conversion factors evolve with galactic properties, such as stellar metallicity, star formation rate and stellar mass. We demonstrate that \CII\ emission is dominated by \HI\ gas and most of the \CII\ luminosity is generated in warm, dense star-forming regions. Importantly, we conclude that, despite \CII\ tracing predominantly atomic rather than molecular gas, the \CII\ luminosity remains a robust indicator of the H_2 mass.

### 40) [2410.14186](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14186v1): An automated method to detect and characterise semi-resolved star clusters

<p>
We present a novel method for automatically detecting and characterising semi-resolved star clusters: clusters where the observational point-spread function (PSF) is smaller than the cluster's radius, but larger than the separations between individual stars. We apply our method to a 1.77 deg^2 field located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using the VISTA survey of the Magellanic Clouds (VMC), which surveyed the LMC in the YJK_\text{s} bands. Our approach first models the position-dependent PSF to detect and remove point sources from deep K_\text{s} images; this leaves behind extended objects such as star clusters and background galaxies. We then analyse the isophotes of these extended objects to characterise their properties, perform integrated photometry, and finally remove any spurious objects this procedure identifies. We demonstrate our approach in practice on a deep VMC K_\text{s} tile that contains the most active star-forming regions in the LMC: 30 Doradus, N158, N159, and N160. We select this tile because it is the most challenging for automated techniques due both to crowding and nebular emission. We detect 682 candidate star clusters, with an estimated contamination rate of 13% from background galaxies and chance blends of physically unrelated stars. We compare our candidates to publicly available James Webb Space Telescope data and find that at least 80% of our detections appear to be star clusters.

### 41) [2410.13958](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13958v1): The redshift evolution of the M_{\rm BH}-M_* scaling relation: new insights from cosmological simulations and semi-analytic models

<p> Shashank Dattathri, Priyamvada Natarajan, Antonio J. Porras-Valverde, Colin J. Burke, Nianyi Chen, Tiziana Di Matteo, Yueying Ni </p>
<p>
We study the co-evolution of black holes (BHs) and their host galaxies in the ASTRID and Illustris-TNG300 cosmological simulations and the Dark Sage Semi-Analytic Model (SAM), focusing on the evolution of the BH mass - stellar mass (M_{\rm BH}-M_*) relation. Due to differences in the adopted sub-grid modeling of BH seeding, dynamics, and feedback, the models differ in their predicted redshift evolution of the M_{\rm BH}-M_* relation. We find that it is the interplay between the star formation rate (SFR) and the black hole accretion rate (BHAR) which drives the evolution of the mean relation. We define a quantity \mathcal{R}, the ratio between the specific BHAR and SFR (i.e. \mathcal{R} \equiv\ sBHAR/sSFR), and demonstrate that it is \mathcal{R} that governs the evolution of individual sources in the M_{\rm BH}-M_* plane. The efficiency of BH growth versus stellar mass growth in the sSFR-sBHAR plane reflects the partitioning of gas between fueling star formation versus BH accretion. This partitioning depends on the implementation of BH dynamics and the nature of how AGN feedback quenches galaxies. In the cosmological simulations (ASTRID and Illustris-TNG300), the BHAR and SFR are intrinsically linked, resulting in a tight M_{\rm BH}-M_* correlation, while the Dark Sage SAM produces a significantly larger scatter. We discuss these results in the context of recently discovered over-massive BHs and massive quenched galaxies at high redshift by the James Webb Space Telescope.

### 42) [2410.13254](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13254v1): Lyman Continuum leakage from massive leaky starbursts: A different class of emitters?

<p>
The origin of Lyman Continuum (LyC) photons responsible for reionizing the universe remains a mystery, with the fraction of escaping LyC photons from galaxies at z~ 6 to 12 being highly uncertain. While direct detection of LyC photons from this epoch is hindered by absorption from the intergalactic medium, lower redshift analogs offer a promising avenue to study LyC leakage. We present Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (HST COS) observations of five low redshift (z~ 0.3) massive starburst galaxies, selected for their high stellar mass and weak [SII] nebular emission - an indirect tracer of LyC escape. Three of the five galaxies show LyC leakage, highlighting the reliability of weak [SII] as a tracer, especially in light of recent JWST discoveries of z &gt; 5 galaxies with similarly weak [SII] emission. The dust corrected LyC escape fractions, which represent the LyC photons that would escape in the absence of dust, range from 33% to 84%. However, the absolute escape fractions, which show the LyC photons escaping after passing through both neutral hydrogen absorption and dust attenuation, are significantly lower, ranging between 1% and 3%. This suggests that while the galaxies are nearly optically thin to HI, their high dust content significantly suppresses LyC photon escape. These [SII] weak, massive leakers are distinct from typical low-redshift LyC emitters, showing higher metallicity, lower ionization states, more dust extinction and higher star formation surface densities. This suggests that these galaxies constitute a distinct population, likely governed by a different mechanism facilitating LyC photon escape. We propose that the feedback-driven winds in these compact starbursts create ionized channels through which LyC photons escape, aligning with a picket-fence model.

### 43) [2410.12987](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12987v1): Galaxy Mass Modelling from Multi-Wavelength JWST Strong Lens Analysis: Dark Matter Substructure, Angular Mass Complexity, or Both?

<p> Samuel C. Lange, Aristeidis Amvrosiadis, James W. Nightingale, Qiuhan He, Carlos S. Frenk, Andrew Robertson, Shaun Cole, Richard Massey, Xiaoyue Cao, Ran Li, Kaihao Wang </p>
<p>
We analyze two galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses, SPT0418-47 and SPT2147-50, using JWST NIRCam imaging across multiple filters. To account for angular complexity in the lens mass distribution, we introduce multipole perturbations with orders m=1, 3, 4. Our results show strong evidence for angular mass complexity in SPT2147, with multipole strengths of 0.3-1.7 &percnt; for m=3, 4 and 2.4-9.5 &percnt; for m=1, while SPT0418 shows no such preference. We also test lens models that include a dark matter substructure, finding a strong preference for a substructure in SPT2147-50 with a Bayes factor (log-evidence change) of ~ 60 when multipoles are not included. Including multipoles reduces the Bayes factor to ~ 11, still corresponding to a 5\sigma detection of a subhalo with an NFW mass of \log_{10}(M_{200}/M_{\odot}) = 10.87\substack{+0.53\\ -0.71}. While SPT2147-50 may represent the fourth detection of a dark matter substructure in a strong lens, further analysis is needed to confirm that the signal is not due to systematics associated with the lens mass model.

### 44) [2410.12235](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12235v1): Infrared Spectra of Solid-State Ethanolamine: Laboratory Data in Support of JWST Observations

<p> T. Suhasaria, S. M. Wee, R. Basalgète, S. A. Krasnokutski, C. Jäger, G. Perotti, Th. Henning </p>
<p>
Ethanolamine (NH_2CH_2CH_2OH, EA) has been identified in the gas phase of the ISM within molecular clouds. Although EA has not been directly observed in the molecular ice phase, a solid state formation mechanism has been proposed. However, the current literature lacks an estimation of the infrared band strengths of EA ices. We conducted an experimental investigation of solid EA ice at low temperatures to ascertain its infrared band strengths, phase transition temperature, and multilayer binding energy. The commonly used laser interferometry method was not applied. Infrared band strengths were determined using three distinct methods. The obtained lab spectrum of EA was compared with the publicly available MIRI MRS James Webb Space Telescope observations toward a low mass protostar. The phase transition temperature for EA ice falls within the range of 175 to 185 K. Among the discussed methods, the simple pressure gauge method provides a reasonable estimate of band strength. We derive a band strength value of about 1\times10^{-17} cm molecule^{-1} for the NH_2 bending mode in the EA molecules. Additionally, temperature-programmed desorption analysis yielded a multilayer desorption energy of 0.61\pm0.01 eV. By comparing the laboratory data documented in this study with the JWST spectrum of the low mass protostar IRAS 2A, an upper-limit for the EA ice abundances was derived.

### 45) [2410.12198](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12198v1): The Physical Origin of Extreme Emission Line Galaxies at High redshifts: Strong {\sc [Oiii]} Emission Lines Produced by Obscured AGNs

<p>
We present deep Subaru/FOCAS spectra for two extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) at z~ 1 with strong {\sc[Oiii]}\lambda5007 emission lines, exhibiting equivalent widths (EWs) of 2905^{+946}_{-578} &#8491;\ and 2000^{+188}_{-159} &#8491;, comparable to those of EELGs at high redshifts that are now routinely identified with JWST spectroscopy. Adding a similarly large {\sc [Oiii]} EW (2508^{+1487}_{-689} &#8491;) EELG found at z~ 2 in the JWST CEERS survey to our sample, we explore for the physical origins of the large {\sc [Oiii]} EWs of these three galaxies with the Subaru spectra and various public data including JWST/NIRSpec, NIRCam, and MIRI data. While there are no clear signatures of AGN identified by the optical line diagnostics, we find that two out of two galaxies covered by the MIRI data show strong near-infrared excess in the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) indicating obscured AGN. Because none of the three galaxies show clear broad H\beta lines, the upper limits on the flux ratios of broad-H\beta to {\sc [Oiii]} lines are small, \lesssim 0.15 that are comparable with Seyfert 1.8-2.0 galaxies. We conduct \texttt{Cloudy} modeling with the stellar and AGN incident spectra, allowing a wide range of parameters including metallicities and ionization parameters. We find that the large {\sc [Oiii]} EWs are not self-consistently reproduced by the spectra of stars or unobscured AGN, but obscured AGN that efficiently produces O^{++} ionizing photons with weak nuclear and stellar continua that are consistent with the SED shapes.

### 46) [2410.12103](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12103v1): Discovery of a 25 parsec-long precessing jet emanating from the old nova GK Persei

<p> Michael M. Shara, Kenneth M. Lanzetta, James T. Garland, David Valls-Gabaud, Stefan Gromoll, Mikita Misiura, Frederick M. Walter, John K. Webb, Barrett Martin </p>
<p>
Classical nova eruptions result from thermonuclear-powered runaways in, and ejection of, the hydrogen-rich envelopes of white dwarf stars accreted from their close binary companions. Novae brighten to up to 1,000,000 solar luminosities, and recur thousands of times over their lifetimes spanning several billion years. Between eruptions, mass transfer from the donor star to the white dwarf proceeds via an accretion disk unless the white dwarf possesses a strong magnetic field which can partially or totally disrupt the disk. In that case, accretion is focussed by the white dwarf's magnetic field towards its magnetic poles. Optical spectroscopy and interferometric radio maps demonstrate the presence of bipolar jets, typically arcsec in angular size, and orders of magnitude smaller than one parsec in linear size, during the days to months after nova eruptions. These jets expel collimated matter from the white dwarfs in nova binary stars, but well-resolved images of them are lacking. Here we report the Condor telescope's detection of a hitherto unknown, highly resolved and braided jet, three degrees (at least 25 parsecs) in length. The jet originates at the white dwarf of the old nova GK Persei (nova Per 1901 CE). It precesses on a ~ 3600 yr timescale, and must be at least 7200 years old. Detected across four decades of wavelength, the jet's ultimate energy source is likely the strong accretion shocks near the white dwarf's magnetic poles.

<p>
We present the first spatially-resolved infrared images of supernova remnants (SNRs) in M33 with the unprecedented sensitivity and resolution of JWST. We analyze 43 SNRs in four JWST fields: two covering central and southern M33 with separate NIRCam (F335M, F444W) and MIRI (F560W, F2100W) observations, one ~5 kpc-long radial strip observed with MIRI F770W, and one covering the giant HII region NGC 604 with multiple NIRCam and MIRI broad/narrowband filters. Of the 21 SNRs in the MIRI field, we found three clear detections (i.e., identical infrared and \ha morphologies), and six partial-detections, implying a detection fraction of 43&percnt; in these bands. In contrast, only one SNR (out of 16) is detectable in the NIRCam field. One of the SNRs, L10-080, is a potential candidate for having freshly-formed ejecta dust, based on its size and centrally-concentrated 21 &mu;m emission. Two SNRs near NGC 604 have strong evidence of molecular (H_2) emission at 4.7 &mu;m, making them the farthest known SNRs with visible molecular shocks. Five SNRs have F770W observations, with the smaller younger objects showing tentative signs of emission, while the older, larger ones have voids. Multi-wavelength data indicate that the clearly-detected SNRs are also among the smallest, brightest at other wavelengths (\ha, radio and X-ray), have the broadest line widths (H\alpha FWHM~250-350 km/s), and the densest environments. No strong correlation with star-formation histories are seen, with the clearly-detected SNRs having both high-mass (~35 \Msun) and low-mass (\lesssim10 \Msun) progenitors.

<p>
We present the first results of the JWST Emission Line Survey (JELS). Utilising the first NIRCam narrow-band imaging at 4.7&mu;m, over 63 arcmin^{2} in the PRIMER/COSMOS field, we identified 609 emission line galaxy candidates. From these, we robustly selected 35 H\alpha star-forming galaxies at z ~ 6.1, with H\alpha star-formation rates (\rm{SFR_{H\alpha}}) ~0.9-15\ \rm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}. Combining our unique H\alpha sample with the exquisite panchromatic data in the field, we explored their physical properties and star-formation histories, and compared these to a broad-band selected sample at z~ 6 which offered vital new insights into the nature of high-redshift galaxies. UV-continuum slopes (\beta) were considerably redder for our H\alpha sample (\langle\beta\rangle~-1.92) compared to the broad-band sample (\langle\beta\rangle~-2.35). This was not due to dust attenuation as our H\alpha sample was relatively dust-poor (median A_V=0.23); instead, we argued the reddened slopes could be due to nebular continuum. We compared \rm{SFR_{H\alpha}} and the UV-continuum-derived \rm{SFR_{UV}} to SED-fitted measurements averaged over canonical timescales of 10 and 100 Myr (\rm{SFR_{10}} and \rm{SFR_{100}}). We found an increase in recent SFR for our sample of H\alpha emitters, particularly at lower stellar masses (&lt;10^9 \ \rm{M_{\odot}}). We also found \rm{SFR_{H\alpha}} strongly traced SFR averaged over 10 Myr timescales, whereas the UV-continuum over-predicts SFR on 100 Myr timescales at low stellar masses. These results point to our H\alpha sample undergoing `bursty' star formation. Our F356W z ~ 6 sample showed a larger scatter in \rm{SFR_{10}/SFR_{100}} across all stellar masses, which highlighted how narrow-band photometric selections of H\alpha emitters are key to quantifying the burstiness of star-formation activity.

### 49) [2410.11680](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11680v1): Population synthesis and astrophysical inference for high-z JWST galaxies

<p> Trey Driskell, Ethan O. Nadler, Andrew Benson, Vera Gluscevic </p>
<p>
Observations of the high-z Universe from JWST have revealed a new population of bright, early galaxies. A robust statistical interpretation of this data requires fast forward models that account for uncertainties in galaxy evolution and incorporate observational systematic effects. We present a probabilistic framework for population synthesis of high-z galaxies and inference of their properties. Our framework is based on the semi-analytic galaxy-formation model Galacticus. To infer the astrophysical parameters governing high-z galaxy evolution, we analyze JWST data from the CEERS and NGDEEP surveys and calculate the likelihood of observing individual objects in apparent magnitude--redshift space, for z\geq8.5 galaxy candidates. We include observational selection effects due to limited survey volume and depth, as well as photometric redshift uncertainties. We recover the posterior probability distribution for parameters describing star formation and outflow rates. We place an upper limit on the star formation timescale of 500~\mathrm{Myr} at a disk velocity of 50~\mathrm{km\ s}^{-1}, and we infer a characteristic velocity at which the outflow mass-loading factor is ~ 1 of 150^{+280}_{-60}~\mathrm{km\ s}^{-1}, both at 95&percnt; confidence. Marginalizing over our astrophysical model, we find that galaxies in CEERS and NGDEEP data occupy halos with virial masses 10^{10\pm 0.5}~M_{\mathrm{\odot}} at 8.5\leq z\leq 12, at 95&percnt; confidence. The star formation timescale preferred by our fit is relatively short compared to typical values at lower redshifts, consistent with previous findings. The modeling and analysis framework presented here can enable systematic tests of high-z galaxies' dust content, initial mass functions, and star formation burstiness in the future.

### 50) [2410.11620](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11620v1): Exploring the effect of different cosmologies on the Epoch of Reionization 21-cm signal with POLAR

<p>
A detection of the 21-cm signal power spectrum from the Epoch of Reionization is imminent, thanks to consistent advancements from telescopes such as LOFAR, MWA, and HERA, along with the development of SKA. In light of this progress, it is crucial to expand the parameter space of simulations used to infer astrophysical properties from this signal. In this work, we explore the role of cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant H_0 and the matter clustering amplitude \sigma_8, whose values as provided by measurements at different redshifts are in tension. We run N-body simulations using GADGET-4, and post-process them with the reionization simulation code POLAR, that uses L-GALAXIES to include galaxy formation and evolution properties and GRIZZLY to execute 1-D radiative transfer of ionizing photons in the intergalactic medium (IGM). We compare our results with the latest JWST observations and explore which astrophysical properties for different cosmologies are necessary to match the observed UV luminosity functions at redshifts z = 10 and 9. Additionally, we explore the impact of these parameters on the observed 21-cm signal power spectrum, focusing on the redshifts within the range of LOFAR 21-cm signal observations (z \approx 8.5-10). Despite differences in cosmological and astrophysical parameters, the 21-cm power spectrum at these redshifts agrees with presently observed upper limits. This suggests the need for broader physical parameter spaces for inference modeling to account for all models that agree with observations. However, we also propose stronger constraining power by using a combination of galactic and IGM observables.

Near-infrared (NIR) emission is less affected by dust than UV and optical emission and is therefore useful for studying the properties of dust-obscured galaxies. Although rest-frame NIR observations of high-redshift galaxies have long been made using space telescopes, their structures were unresolved due to the lack of angular resolution. This letter reports the early results from the analysis of high-resolution Pa\beta imaging of the Spiderweb protocluster at z=2.16 with the JWST Near Infrared Camera. We investigate radial profiles of Pa\beta lines and rest-frame NIR continua from luminous H\alpha-emitting galaxies (HAEs) in the protocluster. Particularly, we compare those of 11 HAEs (N-HAEs) on the star-forming main sequence with those of 8 HAEs (X-HAEs) with X-ray AGNs. Resultant composite Pa\beta line images of N-HAEs indicate significant star formation in galactic disks. In contrast, X-HAEs are dominated by point source components rather than outer star formation, as inferred from our earlier work based on multi-wavelength SED fitting. Given their higher stellar potentials suggested from their rest-frame NIR images, the different characteristics may be driven by the impact of AGN feedback.

### 52) [2410.11095](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11095v1): Unveiling two deeply embedded young protostars in the S68N Class 0 protostellar core with JWST/NIRSpec

The near-infrared (NIR) emission of the youngest protostars still needs to be characterized to better understand the evolution of their accretion and ejection activity. We analyze James Webb Space Telescope NIRSpec 1.7 -- 5.3 &mu;m observations of two deeply embedded sources in the S68N protostellar core in Serpens. The North Central (NC) source exhibits a highly obscured spectrum (A_K ~ 4.8 mag) that is modeled with a pre-main-sequence photosphere and a hot disk component. The photospheric parameters are consistent with a young, low-mass photosphere, as suggested by the low surface gravity, log g of 1.94 \pm 0.15 cm s^{-2}. The hot disk suggests that accretion onto the central protostellar embryo is ongoing, although prototypical accretion-tracing emission lines HI are not detected. The South Central (SC) source, which is even more embedded (A_K ~ 8 mag; no continuum is detected shortward of 3.6 &mu;m) appears to be driving the large-scale S68N protostellar outflow, and launches a collimated hot molecular jet detected in \Ht and CO ro-vibrational lines. Shock modeling of the \Ht (ro)vibrational lines establishes that fast C-type shocks (\geq 30 km s^{-1}), with high pre-shock density (\geq 10^7 cm^{-3}), and strong magnetic field (b ~ 3--10, where B = b\,\times\,\sqrt{\textrm{n}_{\textrm{H}} (\textrm{cm}^{-3})}\,&mu;\textrm{G}) best match the data. The bright CO fundamental line forest suggests energetic excitation, with the contribution of non-LTE effects, ie irradiation pumping. Detected OH and CH^{+} ro-vibrational lines support this hypothesis. These two Class 0 protostars seem to be in very young evolutionary stages and still have to acquire the bulk of their final stellar masses. These results demonstrate that JWST enables unprecedented diagnostics of these first stages of the protostellar evolutionary phase.

The James Webb Space Telescope is revolutionising our ability to understand the host galaxies and local environments of high-z quasars. Here we obtain a comprehensive understanding of the host galaxy of the z=7.08 quasar J1120+0641 by combining NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy with NIRCam photometry of the host continuum emission. Our emission line maps reveal that this quasar host is undergoing a merger with a bright companion galaxy. The quasar host and the companion have similar dynamical masses of ~10^{10}M_\odot, suggesting that this is a major galaxy interaction. Through detailed quasar subtraction and SED fitting using the NIRCam data, we obtain an estimate of the host stellar mass of M_{\ast}~eq2.6\times10^9M_\odot, with M_{*}~eq5.0\times10^9M_\odot for the companion galaxy. Using the H\beta Balmer line we estimate a virial black hole mass of M_{\rm{BH}}~eq1.4\times10^9 M_\odot. Thus, J1120+0641 has an extreme black hole - stellar mass ratio of M_{\rm{BH}}/M_\ast~eq0.54, which is ~3 dex larger than expected by the local scaling relations between black hole and stellar mass. J1120+0641 is powered by an overmassive black hole with the highest reported black hole - stellar mass ratio, in a quasar host that is currently undergoing a major merger -- these new insights highlight the power of JWST for measuring and understanding these extreme first quasars.

### 54) [2410.10993](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10993v1): Direct High-resolution Observation of Feedback and Chemical Enrichment in the Circumgalactic Medium at Redshift 2.8

<p>
Although the circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a vital role in galaxy evolution, studying the emission from CGM is challenging due to its low surface brightness and the complexities involved in interpreting resonant lines like Ly\alpha. The near-infrared coverage, unprecedented sensitivity, and high spatial resolution of the JWST enable us to study the optical strong lines associated with the extended Ly\alpha "nebulae" at redshift 2-3. These lines serve as diagnostic tools to infer the physical conditions in the massive CGM gas reservoir of these systems. In deep medium-band images taken by the JWST, we serendipitously discover the [O III] emission from the CGM surrounding a massive interacting galaxy system at redshift z ~ 2.8, known to be embedded in a bright extended (100 kpc) Ly\alpha "nebula". This is the first time that the [O III] lines are detected from a Ly\alpha "nebula", and the JWST images reveal that the CGM gas actually resides in narrow (~ 2.5 kpc) filamentary structures with strong [O III] emission, tracing the same extent as the Ly\alpha emission. Analysis of the [O III] suggests that the emitting CGM is fully ionized and is energetically dominated by mechanical heating. We also find that the inferred density and pressure are higher than those commonly predicted by simulations of the CGM. We conclude that the observed CGM emission originates from the gas expelled by the episodic feedback processes, cooling down and enriching the CGM, while travelling to a distance of at least 60 kpc. These observations demonstrate how fierce feedback processes shape gas distribution and properties in the CGM around massive halos. While the deep high-resolution imaging opens up a new discovery space for investigating the CGM, it also challenges numerical simulations to explain and reproduce the exquisitely complex structures revealed by the observations.

<p>
Accurately quantifying the ionizing photon production efficiency (\xi_\rm{ion}) of z&gt;6 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is necessary to understand their contribution to reionization. We investigate the ionizing properties of N=289 SFGs selected at z=6.9-7.6 from the JWST Cycle-1 imaging programmes; PRIMER and JADES. We use BAGPIPES to consistently infer the equivalent widths of their [OIII]+\rm{H\beta} emission lines (W_\lambda) and their physical properties. To supplement our high-redshift galaxies, we measure W_\lambda photometrically for a sample of N=253 z=3.2-3.6 SFGs selected from the VANDELS spectroscopic survey. Comparing these samples, we find a strong apparent redshift evolution in their median W_\lambda, increasing from W_\lambda =310\pm25\,\r{A} in VANDELS to W_\lambda =630\pm30\,\r{A} in our JWST-based sample. In the JWST sample at z&gt;7, we find that W_\lambda correlates with both stellar mass and UV luminosity, with high-mass, M_{ UV}-faint galaxies producing systematically weaker emission lines. Moreover, we discover a departure from the standard log-normal shape of the W_\lambda distribution, characterised by a more pronounced tail at lower W_\lambda, consistent with increasingly bursty star formation. Using W_\lambda as a proxy for \xi_\rm{ion}, and UV spectral slope as a proxy for LyC escape fraction (f_\rm{esc}), we find a minority of galaxies with high \xi_\rm{ion} and f_\rm{esc} (e.g., \rm{log(\xi_{ion}/erg^{-1}Hz})~25.6 and f_\rm{esc}~0.15). However, we find that the LyC photon budget at z&gt;7 is dominated by galaxies with more moderate output, close to the sample median of \rm{log(\xi_{ion}/erg^{-1}Hz})~25.3 and f_\rm{esc}~0.05. This is consistent with estimates for the number of LyC photons required to power reionization at z&gt;7, with no evidence for over or under-production.

<p>
We present a sample of 1956 individual stellar clumps at redshift 0.7&lt;z&lt;10, detected with JWST/NIRCam in 476 galaxies lensed by the galaxy cluster Abell2744. The lensed clumps present magnifications ranging between &mu;=1.8 and &mu;=300. We perform simultaneous size-photometry estimates in 20 JWST/NIRCam median and broad-band filters from 0.7 to 5 &mu;m. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting analyses enable us to recover the physical properties of the clumps. The majority of the clumps are spatially resolved and have effective radii in the range R_eff = 10 - 700 pc. We restrict this first study to the 1751 post-reionisation era clumps with redshift &lt;5.5. We find a significant evolution of the average clump ages, SFR, SFR surface densities and metallicity with increasing redshift, while median stellar mass and stellar mass surface densities are similar in the probed redshift range. We observe a strong correlation between the clump properties and the properties of their host galaxies, with more massive galaxies hosting more massive and older clumps. We find that clumps closer to their host galactic center are on average more massive, while their ages do not show clear sign of migration. We find that clumps at cosmic noon sample the upper-mass end of the mass function to higher masses than at z&gt;3, reflecting the rapid increase towards the peak of the cosmic star formation history. We conclude that the results achieved over the studied redshift range are in agreement with expectation of in-situ clump formation scenario from large-scale disk fragmentation.

<p>
We present JWST/NIRSpec PRISM follow-up of candidate galaxies at z=9-11 selected from deep JWST/NIRCam photometry in GLASS-JWST Early Release Science data. We spectroscopically confirm six sources with secure redshifts at z = 9.52-10.43, each showing multiple emission lines. An additional object is likely at z = 10.66, based on its Lya-break and a single emission feature, while one source is a lower redshift interloper. The sample includes the first JWST-detected candidate at z=10, GHZ1/GLASS-z10, which we confirm at z = 9.875, and the X-ray detected AGN GHZ9 confirmed at z = 10.145. Three objects in our sample, including GHZ9, have EW(CIII])&gt;20A and occupy a region compatible with AGN emission in the EW(CIII]) vs CIV/CIII] diagram. The spectroscopic sample confirms a high abundance of galaxies at z &gt; 9. We measure a number density of z=10 galaxies in the GLASS-JWST ERS field that is a factor of &gt;3 higher than other JWST-based estimates at demagnified rest-frame magnitudes of -21 &lt; Muv &lt; -19. We find that the positions of these galaxies in redshift and angular space are not consistent with all of them being part of a unique progenitor of present-day galaxy clusters. The high density of objects in the GLASS region can be explained either by clustering on large scales or by a superposition of different forming structures of which we observe only the brightest members. By considering all the spectroscopic z=10 sources in the Abell-2744 field, we identify two potential galaxy proto-clusters centered around GHZ9 and JD1, with relative separations between their members of 1-2 pMpc. The potential AGN nature of three of the sources in our sample lends support to a scenario in which the high abundance of bright sources determined by JWST surveys at cosmic dawn may be affected by AGN contribution to their UV luminosity.

<p>
We present the first spectroscopic confirmation of a dust-obscured dwarf galaxy, CEERS-14821. The analysis is performed combining JWST NIRCam broad-band photometry and NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopic data. From the detection of multiple rest-frame optical lines, we derive that CEERS-14821 is located at z=4.883\pm0.003. Moreover, from a secure detection of the H_{\alpha} and H_{\beta} we derived that the galaxy has a dust extinction ranging from Av=2.2 to Av=3.3, depending on the assumed reddening law. This value is extremely large given that we estimated a low stellar mass around log(M/Mo)=8.0-8.2. Moreover, using different metallicity tracers, we verify that the galaxy is also metal-rich, with 12+log(O/H)&gt;8.3. This is well above the expectation from both the mass-metallicity relation and the fundamental mass-metalliticy relation. CEERS-14821 is going through a burst of star formation, there are no indications of a strong contribution from an active galactic nuclei (f(AGN)&lt;0.5 with respect to the total dust luminosity). Based on the rest-frame optical images, this source has a size compatible with galaxies of similar stellar mass and redshift. Finally, with the current data, it seems that there are galaxies closely interacting with CEERS-14821.

<p>
Cooling flows are common in galaxy clusters which have cool cores. The soft X-ray emission below 1 keV from the flows is mostly absorbed by cold dusty gas within the central cooling sites. Further evidence for this process is presented here through a more detailed analysis of the nearby Centaurus cluster and some additional clusters. Predictions of JWST near and mid-infrared spectra from cooling gas are presented. [NeVI] emission at 7.65 micron should be an important diagnostic of gas cooling between 6 and 1.5 times 10^5 K. The emerging overall picture of hidden cooling flows is explored. The efficiency of AGN feedback in reducing the total cooling rate in cool cores is shown to be above 50 percent for many clusters but is rarely above 90 per cent. The reduction is mostly in outer gas. Cooling dominates in elliptical galaxies and galaxy groups which have mass flow rates below about 15M/yr and in some massive clusters where rates can exceed 1000M/yr.

### 60) [2410.10406](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10406v1): Candidates for Substellar Members of the Orion Nebula Cluster from JWST/NIRCam

<p> K. L. Luhman </p>
<p>
In 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) obtained 1-5um images of the center of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). I have analyzed these data in an attempt to search for substellar members of the cluster. Using a pair of color-color diagrams, I have identified &gt;200 brown dwarf candidates that lack spectral classifications. Some of the candidates could be protostars (either stellar or substellar) given their very red colors. Based on the age of the ONC and the photometry predicted by theoretical evolutionary models, the faintest candidates could have masses of 1-2 Mjup. This sample of candidates may prove to be valuable for studying various aspects of young brown dwarfs, including their mass function and minimum mass. However, spectroscopy is needed to confirm the membership (via signatures of youth) and late spectral types of the candidates. Finally, I note that most of the "Jupiter-mass binary objects" that have been previously identified with these JWST images are absent from my sample of candidates because their colors are indicative of reddened background sources rather than young brown dwarfs or their photometry is inadequate for assessing their nature because of very low signal-to-noise ratios and/or detections in only a few bands.

<p> K. L. Luhman, C Alves de Oliveira, I. Baraffe, G. Chabrier, E. Manjavacas, R. J. Parker, P. Tremblin </p>
<p>
We have used the multiobject mode of the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to obtain low-resolution 1-5um spectra of 22 brown dwarf candidates in the Orion Nebula Cluster, which were selected with archival images from the Hubble Space Telescope. One of the targets was previously classified as a Herbig-Haro (HH) object and exhibits strong emission in H I, H2, and the fundamental band of CO, further demonstrating that HH objects can have bright emission in that CO band. The remaining targets have late spectral types (M6.5 to early L) and are young based on gravity sensitive features, as expected for low-mass members of the cluster. According to theoretical evolutionary models, these objects should have masses that range from the hydrogen burning limit to 0.003-0.007 Msun. Two of the NIRSpec targets were identified as proplyds in earlier analysis of Hubble images. They have spectral types of M6.5 and M7.5, making them two of the coolest and least massive known proplyds. Another brown dwarf shows absorption bands at 3-5um from ices containing H2O, CO2, OCN-, and CO, indicating that it is either an edge-on class II system or a class I protostar. It is the coolest and least massive object that has detections of these ice features. In addition, it appears to be the first candidate for a protostellar brown dwarf that has spectroscopy confirming its late spectral type.

### 62) [2410.09450](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09450v1): The effects of super-Eddington accretion and feedback on the growth of early supermassive black holes and galaxies

<p> Filip Huško, Cedric G. Lacey, William J. Roper, Joop Schaye, Jemima Mae Briggs, Matthieu Schaller </p>
<p>
We present results of cosmological zoom-in simulations of a massive protocluster down to redshift z\approx4 (when the halo mass is \approx10^{13} M_\odot) using the SWIFT code and the EAGLE galaxy formation model, focusing on supermassive black hole (BH) physics. The BH was seeded with a mass of 10^4 M_\odot at redshift z\approx17. We compare the base model that uses an Eddington limit on the BH accretion rate and thermal isotropic feedback by the AGN, with one where super-Eddington accretion is allowed, as well as two other models with BH spin and jets. In the base model, the BH grows at the Eddington limit from z=9 to z=5.5, when it becomes massive enough to halt its own and its host galaxy's growth through feedback. We find that allowing super-Eddington accretion leads to drastic differences, with the BH going through an intense but short super-Eddington growth burst around z\approx7.5, during which it increases its mass by orders of magnitude, before feedback stops further growth (of both the BH and the galaxy). By z\approx4 the galaxy is only half as massive in the super-Eddington cases, and an order of magnitude more extended, with the half-mass radius reaching values of a few physical kpc instead of a few hundred pc. The BH masses in our simulations are consistent with the intrinsic BH mass-stellar mass relation inferred from high-redshift observations by JWST. This shows that galaxy formation models using the \LambdaCDM cosmology are capable of reproducing the observed massive BHs at high redshift. Allowing jets, either at super- or sub-Eddington rates, has little impact on the host galaxy properties, but leads to lower BH masses as a result of stronger self-regulation, which is itself a consequence of higher feedback efficiencies.

### 63) [2410.09256](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09256v2): Measuring Star Formation Histories from Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars: A Demonstration in M31

<p> Abigail J. Lee, Daniel R. Weisz, Yi Ren, Alessandro Savino, Andrew E. Dolphin </p>
<p>
We demonstrate how near infrared (NIR) imaging of resolved luminous asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars can be used to measure well-constrained star formation histories (SFHs) across cosmic time. Using UKIRT J and K-band imaging of M31, we first show excellent agreement over the past ~8 Gyr between the PHAT SFH of M31's outer disk derived from a deep optical color-magnitude diagram (CMD; ~3.3\times10^{7} stars with M_{F814W} \lesssim +2), and our spatially-matched SFH based only on modeling AGB stars on a NIR CMD (~2.3\times10^{4} stars with M_{J} \lesssim -5). We find that only hundreds of AGB stars are needed for reliable SFH recovery, owing to their excellent age sensitivity in the NIR. We then measure the spatially resolved SFH of M31's inner stellar halo (D_{M31, projected} ~20-30 kpc) using ~10^4 AGB stars. We find: (i) a dominant burst of star formation across M31's inner stellar halo from 4-5 Gyr ago and lower level, spatially distributed star formation ~1-2 Gyr ago; (ii) a younger 'quenching time' in the vicinity of NGC 205 (~1 Gyr ago) than near M32 (~1.6 Gyr ago); (iii) M_{\star}~4\pm0.5\times10^9 M_{\odot} formed over the past ~8 Gyr. We discuss some caveats and the enormous potential of resolved AGB stars in the NIR for measuring SFHs back to ancient epochs (~13 Gyr ago) in galaxies to large distances (D\gtrsim20 Mpc) with JWST, Roman, and Euclid.

### 64) [2410.09253](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09253v1): The JWST-NIRCam View of Sagittarius C. I. Massive Star Formation and Protostellar Outflows

<p>
We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)-NIRCam observations of the massive star-forming molecular cloud Sagittarius C (Sgr C) in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). In conjunction with ancillary mid-IR and far-IR data, we characterize the two most massive protostars in Sgr C via spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, estimating that they each have current masses of m_* ~ 20\:M_\odot and surrounding envelope masses of ~ 100\:M_\odot. We report a census of lower-mass protostars in Sgr C via a search for infrared counterparts to mm continuum dust cores found with ALMA. We identify 88 molecular hydrogen outflow knot candidates originating from outflows from protostars in Sgr C, the first such unambiguous detections in the infrared in the CMZ. About a quarter of these are associated with flows from the two massive protostars in Sgr C; these extend for over 1 pc and are associated with outflows detected in ALMA SiO line data. An additional ~ 40 features likely trace shocks in outflows powered by lower-mass protostars throughout the cloud. We report the discovery of a new star-forming region hosting two prominent bow shocks and several other line-emitting features driven by at least two protostars. We infer that one of these is forming a high-mass star given an SED-derived mass of m_* ~ 9\:M_\odot and associated massive (~ 90\:M_\odot) mm core and water maser. Finally, we identify a population of miscellaneous Molecular Hydrogen Objects (MHOs) that do not appear to be associated with protostellar outflows.

### 65) [2410.09205](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09205v1): From UV-bright Galaxies to Early Disks: the Importance of Turbulent Star Formation in the Early Universe

<p> Vadim A. Semenov, Charlie Conroy, Lars Hernquist </p>
<p>
Bursty star formation at early times can explain the surprising abundance of early UV-bright galaxies revealed by JWST but can also be a reason for the delayed formation of galactic disks in high-resolution cosmological simulations. We investigate this interplay in a cosmological simulation of an early-forming Milky Way analog with detailed modeling of cold turbulent interstellar medium (ISM), star formation, and feedback. We find that the modeling of locally variable star formation efficiency (SFE) coupled with the ISM turbulence on the scales of star-forming regions is important for producing both early bursty evolution and early formation and survival of galactic disks. Such a model introduces a qualitatively new channel of the global star formation rate (SFR) burstiness caused by chaotic fluctuations in the average SFE due to changes in the ISM turbulence, which, in our simulation, dominates the short-term SFR variability. The average SFE stays low, close to ~ 1&percnt; per freefall time, and its variation decreases when the gas disk forms, leading to only mild effects of stellar feedback on the early disk, enabling its survival. By rerunning our simulation with fixed SFE values, we explicitly show that low SFEs lead to smoother SFR histories and disk survival, while high SFEs lead to bursty SFRs and hinder disk formation. The model with variable SFE switches between these two regimes at the moment of disk formation. These trends are missing in more commonly used star formation prescriptions with fixed SFE; in particular, the prescriptions tying star formation to molecular gas should be interpreted with caution because the two are decoupled at early times, as we also show in this paper.

### 66) [2410.09162](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09162v1): Extending the cosmic distance ladder two orders of magnitude with strongly lensed Cepheids, carbon AGB, and RGB stars

<p> J. M. Diego, S. P. Willner, J. M. Palencia </p>
<p>
Extreme magnification of stars near the caustics of clusters allow to detect individual luminous stars at high redshift. We show how deep exposures of caustic crossing galaxies at z\lesssim1 with IR telescopes such as JWST, can detect non-explosive distance calibrators, such as Cepheids, carbon stars in the asymptotic giant branch or stars in the tip of the red giant branch. A large number of such detections, combined with careful modelling of the magnification affecting these stars (including microlensing), opens the door to using them as alternative standard candles to SNe in a redshift range that would extend the cosmic distance ladder two orders of magnitude for these distance calibrators. As a bonus, strongly lensed stars detected in deep exposures provide also a robust method of mapping small dark matter substructures since they cluster around the critical curves of small scale dark matter halos.

<p>
Dust from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), specifically Type IIP SNe, has been suggested to be a significant source of the dust observed in high-redshift galaxies. CCSNe eject large amounts of newly formed heavy elements, which can condense into dust grains in the cooling ejecta. However, infrared (IR) observations of typical CCSNe generally measure dust masses that are too small to account for the dust production needed at high redshifts. Type IIn SNe, classified by their dense circumstellar medium (CSM), are also known to exhibit strong IR emission from warm dust, but the dust origin and heating mechanism have generally remained unconstrained because of limited observational capabilities in the mid-IR. Here, we present a JWST/MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) spectrum of the Type IIn SN 2005ip nearly 17 years post-explosion. The Type IIn SN 2005ip is one of the longest-lasting and most well-studied SNe observed to date. Combined with a Spitzer mid-IR spectrum of SN 2005ip obtained in 2008, this data set provides a rare 15-year baseline, allowing for a unique investigation of the evolution of dust. The JWST spectrum shows a new high-mass dust component (\gtrsim0.08 M_{\odot}) that is not present in the earlier Spitzer spectrum. Our analysis shows dust likely formed over the past 15 years in the cold, dense shell (CDS), between the forward and reverse shocks. There is also a smaller mass of carbonaceous dust (\gtrsim0.005 M_{\odot}) in the ejecta. These observations provide new insights into the role of SN dust production, particularly within the CDS, and its potential contribution to the rapid dust enrichment of the early Universe.

<p>
We present a spatially-resolved (~3 pc pix^{-1}) analysis of the distribution, kinematics, and excitation of warm H2 gas in the nuclear starburst region of M83. Our JWST/MIRI IFU spectroscopy reveals a clumpy reservoir of warm H2 (&gt; 200 K) with a mass of ~2.3 x 10^{5} Msun in the area covered by all four MRS channels. We additionally use the [Ne II] 12.8 {&mu;}m and [Ne III] 15.5 {&mu;}m lines as tracers of the star formation rate, ionizing radiation hardness, and kinematics of the ionized ISM, finding tantalizing connections to the H2 properties and to the ages of the underlying stellar populations. Finally, qualitative comparisons to the trove of public, high-spatial-resolution multiwavelength data available on M83 shows that our MRS spectroscopy potentially traces all stages of the process of creating massive star clusters, from the embedded proto-cluster phase through the dispersion of ISM from stellar feedback.

<p>
We present the JWST Emission Line Survey (JELS), a Cycle 1 JWST imaging programme exploiting the wavelength coverage and sensitivity of NIRCam to extend narrow-band rest-optical emission line selection into the epoch of reionization (EoR) for the first time, and to enable unique studies of the resolved ionised gas morphology in individual galaxies across cosmic history. The primary JELS observations comprise ~4.7&mu;m narrow-band imaging over ~63 arcmin^{2} designed to enable selection of H\alpha emitters at z~6.1, as well as the selection of a host of novel emission-line samples including [OIII] at z~8.3 and Pa \alpha/\beta at z~1.5/2.8. For the prime F466N and F470N narrow-band observations, the emission-line sensitivities achieved are up to ~2\times more sensitive than current slitless spectroscopy surveys (5\sigma limits of 1.1-1.6\times10^{-18}\text{erg s}^{-1}\text{cm}^{-2}), corresponding to unobscured H\alpha star-formation rates (SFRs) of 1-1.6 \text{M}_{\odot}\,\text{yr}^{-1} at z~6.1 and extending emission-line selections in the EoR to fainter populations. Simultaneously, JELS also obtained F200W broadband and F212N narrow-band imaging (H\alpha at z~2.23) that probes SFRs \gtrsim5\times fainter than previous ground-based narrow-band studies (~0.2 \text{M}_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}), offering an unprecedented resolved view of star formation at cosmic noon. In this paper we describe the detailed JELS survey design, key data processing steps specific to the survey observations, and demonstrate the exceptional data quality and imaging sensitivity achieved. We then summarise the key scientific goals of JELS and present some early science results, including examples of spectroscopically confirmed H\alpha and [OIII] emitters discovered by JELS that illustrate the novel parameter space probed.

<p>
We present the analysis of three intermediate-mass quiescent galaxies (QGs) with stellar masses of ~10^{10}M_{\rm \odot} at redshifts z~ 3 - 4 using NIRSpec low-resolution spectroscopy. Utilising the SED fitting code BAGPIPES, we confirm these target galaxies are consistent with quiescent population, with their specific star formation rates (sSFR) falling below 2-dex the star-forming main sequence at the same redshifts. Additionally, we identify these QGs to be less massive than those discovered in previous works, particularly prior to the JWST era. Two of our target galaxies exhibit the potentially-blended H{\alpha}+[NII] emission line within their spectra with S/N&gt;5. We discuss whether this feature comes from an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) or star formation although future high-resolution spectroscopy is required to reach a conclusion. One of the target galaxies is covered by JWST/NIRCam imaging of the PRIMER survey. Using the 2D profile fitting code Galfit, we examine its morphology, revealing a disc-like profile with a S\'{e}rsic index of n=1.1 \pm 0.1. On the size-mass relation, we find a potential distinction between less-massive (\log_{10}{(M_*/M_\odot)}&lt;10.3) and massive (\log_{10}{(M_*/M_\odot)}&gt;10.3) QGs in their evolutionary pathways. The derived quenching timescales for our targets are less than 1 Gyr. This may result from these galaxies being quenched by AGN feedback, supporting the AGN scenario of the emission line features.

### 71) [2410.08707](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08707v1): The nature of low-luminosity AGNs discovered by JWST at 5&lt;z&lt;6 based on clustering analysis: ancestors of quasars at z\lesssim3?

<p>
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered many faint AGNs at high-z by detecting their broad Balmer lines. However, their high number density, lack of X-ray emission, and overly high black hole masses with respect to their host stellar masses suggest that they are a distinct population from general type-1 quasars. Here, we present clustering analysis of 28 low-luminosity broad-line AGNs found by JWST (JWST AGNs) at 5&lt;z&lt;6 based on cross-correlation analysis with 679 photometrically-selected galaxies to characterize their host dark matter halo (DMH) masses. From angular and projected cross-correlation functions, we find that their typical DMH mass is \log (M_\mathrm{halo}/h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot) = 11.61_{-0.24}^{+0.19}, and 11.72_{-0.20}^{+0.17}, respectively. This result implies that the host DMHs of these AGNs are ~1 dex smaller than that of luminous quasars. The DMHs of JWST AGNs at 5&lt;z&lt;6 are predicted to grow to 10^{12\unicode{x2013}13}\,h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot, a typical mass of quasar at z\lesssim3. Applying the empirical stellar-to-halo mass ratio to the measured DMH mass, their host stellar mass is evaluated as \log(M_*/\mathrm{M}_\odot)=9.72_{-0.39}^{+0.31}, and 9.90_{-0.33}^{+0.27}, which are higher than some of those estimated by the SED fitting. We also evaluate their duty cycle as f_\mathrm{duty}=0.36_{-0.14}^{+0.18} per cent, namely ~7\times10^6 yr as the lifetime of JWST AGNs. While we cannot exclude the possibility that JWST AGNs are simply low-mass type-1 quasars, these results suggest that JWST AGNs are a different population from type-1 quasars, and may be the ancestors of quasars at z\lesssim3.

<p> Nuo Chen, Kentaro Motohara, Lee Spitler, Matthew A. Malkan </p>
<p>
We present a rest-frame optical, spatially resolved analysis of more than 100 \mathrm{H\alpha} emitters (HAEs) at z~2.2 in the ZFOURGE-CDFS field using NIRCam imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). The ultra-deep, high-resolution data gives us maps of the resolved emission line regions of HAEs with stellar mass ranging from 10^{8}\,M_{\odot} to 10^{10}\,M_{\odot}. An [OIII] emission-line map of each HAE is created from the flux excess in the F150W filter, leading to the discovery of a population of kiloparsec-scale compact emission line regions (``Green Seeds") with high equivalent widths (\mathrm{EW}). We obtain a sample of 128 Green Seeds from 68 HAEs with rest-frame \mathrm{EW_{[OIII]}}&gt;200\r{A}. Moreover, 17 of them have extremely large \mathrm{EW_{[OIII]}}&gt;1000\r{A}, suggesting the possible Lyman continuum (LyC) leakage from these emission line regions. Embedded within the host galaxy, many Green Seeds correspond to UV star-forming clumps and H{\sc ii} regions, indicating elevated starburst activity in them, with specific star formation rates (sSFR) several times higher than that of the host galaxy. Based on theoretical frameworks, Green Seeds are expected to be formed through gravitational disk instability and/or galaxy mergers. Considering the stellar masses of Green Seeds, we speculate that high-mass Green Seeds may migrate toward the galactic center to build the central bulge, while low-mass Green Seeds are easily disrupted and short-lived. Besides, we propose that some Green Seeds could be the progenitors of globular clusters or ultracompact dwarf galaxies observed in the local universe.

The dearth of high quality spectroscopy of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) -- the main drivers of the assembly of dust and stellar mass at the peak of activity in the Universe -- greatly hinders our ability to interpret their physical processes and evolutionary pathways. We present JWST/NIRSpec observations from RUBIES of four submillimeter-selected, ALMA-detected DSFGs at cosmic noon, z~2.3-2.7. While photometry uniformly suggests vigorous ongoing star formation for the entire sample in line with canonical DSFGs, the spectra differ: one source has spectroscopic evidence of an evolved stellar population, indicating a recent transition to a post-starburst phase, while the remainder show strong spectroscopic signatures of ongoing starbursts. All four galaxies are infrared-luminous (log_{10}L_{\rm{IR}}/L_{\rm \odot} &gt;12.4), massive (log_{10}\,M_\star/M_{\rm \odot} &gt;11), and very dust-obscured (A_V~3-4 ABmag). Leveraging detections of multiple Balmer and Paschen lines, we derive an optical attenuation curve consistent with Calzetti overall, yet an optical extinction ratio R_V~2.5, potentially indicating smaller dust grains or differences in star-dust geometry. This case study provides some of the first detailed spectroscopic evidence that the DSFGs encompass a heterogeneous sample spanning a range of star formation properties and evolutionary stages, and illustrates the advantages of synergistic JWST and ALMA analysis of DSFGs.

We find a flattening of the SMF at the high-mass end that is better described by a double power law at z&gt;5.5. At z \lesssim 5.5 it transitions to a Schechter law which coincides with the emergence of the first massive quiescent galaxies in the Universe. We trace the cosmic stellar mass density (SMD) and infer the star formation rate density (SFRD), which at z&gt;7.5 agrees remarkably with recent \JWST{} UV luminosity function-derived estimates. However, at z \lesssim 3.5, we find significant tension (~ 0.3 dex) with the cosmic star formation (SF) history from instantaneous SF measures, the causes of which remain poorly understood. We infer the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) and the SFE from abundance matching out to z=12, finding a non-monotonic evolution. The SFE has the characteristic strong dependence with mass in the range of 0.02 - 0.2, and mildly decreases at the low mass end out to z~3.5. At z~3.5 the SFE increases sharply from ~ 0.1 to approach high SFE of 0.8-1 by z~ 10 for log(M_{\rm h}/M_{\odot})\approx11.5, albeit with large uncertainties. Finally, we use the SHMR to track the SFE and stellar mass growth throughout the halo history and find that they do not grow at the same rate -- from the earliest times up until z~3.5 the halo growth rate outpaces galaxy assembly, but at z&gt;3.5 halo growth stagnates and accumulated gas reservoirs keep the SF going and galaxies outpace halos.

### 75) [2410.07498](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07498v1): Comparing E-MOSAICS predictions of high-redshift proto-globular clusters with JWST observations in lensed galaxies

High-resolution imaging and strong gravitational lensing of high-redshift galaxies have enabled the detection of compact sources with properties similar to nearby massive star clusters. Often found to be very young, these sources may be globular clusters detected in their earliest stages. In this work, we compare predictions of high-redshift (z ~ 1--10) star cluster properties from the E-MOSAICS simulation of galaxy and star cluster formation with those of the star cluster candidates in strongly lensed galaxies from James Webb (JWST) and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging. We select galaxies in the simulation that match the luminosities of the majority of lensed galaxies with star cluster candidates observed with JWST. We find that the luminosities, ages and masses of the brightest star cluster candidates in the high-redshift galaxies are consistent with the E-MOSAICS model. In particular, the brightest cluster ages are in excellent agreement. The results suggest that star clusters in both low- and high-redshift galaxies may form via common mechanisms. However, the brightest clusters in the lensed galaxies tend to be \approx 1--1.5 mag brighter and \approx 0.5 dex more massive than the median E-MOSAICS predictions. We discuss the large number of effects that could explain the discrepancy, including simulation and observational limitations, stellar population models, cluster detection biases and nuclear star clusters. Understanding these limitations would enable stronger tests of globular cluster formation models.

### 76) [2410.07377](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07377v1): Constraining Reionization with Lyα Damping-Wing Absorption in Galaxy Spectra: A Machine Learning Model Based on Reionization Simulations

<p>
Recently, NIRSpec PRISM/CLEAR observations by JWST have begun providing rest-frame UV continuum measurements of galaxies at z\gtrsim7, revealing signatures of Ly\alpha damping-wing (DW) absorption by the intergalactic medium (IGM). We develop a methodology to constrain the global ionization fraction of the IGM (Q_{\rm HII}) using low-resolution spectra, employing the random forest classification (RFC) method. We construct mock spectra using the simulated galaxies and the IGM from the Cosmic Dawn II simulation and train RFC models to estimate Q_{\rm HII} at the redshift of the source and to detect the presence of a damped Ly\alpha absorber (DLA). We find that individual galaxy spectra with spectral bins between 1220 and 1270 {&#8491;} and with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 20 can place tight constraints on Q_{\rm HII}, provided the UV continuum is accurately modeled. This method is particularly effective for the early phase of reionization (Q_{\rm HII}&lt;50&percnt;), when the IGM opacity is high in the DW. As a demonstration, we apply our model to existing NIRSpec PRISM/CLEAR spectra, placing upper bounds of Q_{\rm HII}=59.6&percnt;, 5.6&percnt;, and 18.5&percnt; at z=7.7,~9.4, and 10.6, respectively, with 68&percnt; confidence, though several modeling uncertainties remain to be discussed. These constraints favor late-starting reionization models, where \gtrsim 80&percnt; of the IGM is ionized after z=8. We conclude that high SNR observations of carefully selected targets around z~7-9 can effectively constrain reionization models.

JWST spectroscopy has discovered a population of z \gtrsim 3.5 galaxies with broad Balmer emission lines, and narrow forbidden lines, that are consistent with hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN). Many of these systems, now known as ``little red dots" (LRDs), are compact and have unique colors that are very red in the optical/near-infrared and blue in the ultraviolet. The relative contribution of galaxy starlight and AGN to these systems remains uncertain, especially for the galaxies with unusual blue+red spectral energy distributions. In this work, we use Balmer decrements to measure the independent dust attenuation of the broad and narrow emission-line components of a sample of 29 broad-line AGN identified from three public JWST spectroscopy surveys: CEERS, JADES, and RUBIES. Stacking the narrow components from the spectra of 25 sources with broad H\rm{\alpha} and no broad H\rm{\beta} results in a median narrow H\rm{\alpha}/H\rm{\beta} = 2.47^{+0.05}_{-0.05} (consistent with A_{v} = 0) and broad H\rm{\alpha}/H\rm{\beta} &gt; 8.85 (A_{v} &gt; 3.63). The narrow and broad Balmer decrements imply little-to-no attenuation of the narrow emission lines, which are consistent with being powered by star formation and located on larger physical scales. Meanwhile, the lower limit in broad H\rm{\alpha}/H\rm{\beta} decrement, with broad H\rm{\beta} undetected in the stacked spectrum of 25 broad-H\rm{\alpha} AGN, implies significant dust attenuation of the broad-line emitting region that is presumably associated with the central AGN. Our results indicate that these systems, on average, are consistent with heavily dust-attenuated AGN powering the red parts of their SED while their blue UV emission is powered by unattenuated star formation in the host galaxy.

<p>
We use James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) medium-resolution spectrometer (MRS) observations of UGC 8782, CGCG 012-070 and NGC 3884 to investigate the origin of the H_2 emission. These three nearby AGN hosts are known to present H_2 emission excess relative to star-forming galaxies, as traced by the H_2 S(3)/PAH_{\rm 11.3&mu; m} line ratio. For every spaxel, we also measure the velocity width (W_{\rm 80}) of H_2 S(3). We find that the distribution of H_2 in the space of these parameters - H_2/PAH and its velocity width - is bimodal: one cluster of points shows approximately constant values of W_{\rm 80}, while the other cluster exhibits a strong correlation between W_{\rm 80} and H_2/PAH. We estimated the temperature of the H_2 gas assuming a power-law distribution and find flatter distributions in regions where a correlation between W_{\rm 80} and H_2 S(3)/PAH_{\rm 11.3&mu; m} is observed. Additionally, we observed a correlation between the [Fe II]_{\rm 5.34 &mu; m} (a known shock tracer) and the H_2 emission. This indicates that the excess H_2 emission excess is associated to shock heating of the gas, generated by outflows or by the interaction of the radio jet with the ambient gas.

The composition of protoplanetary disks, and hence the initial conditions of planet formation, may be strongly influenced by the infall and thermal processing of material during the protostellar phase. Composition of dust and ice in protostellar envelopes, shaped by energetic processes driven by the protostar, serves as the fundamental building material for planets and complex organic molecules. As part of the JWST GO program, "Investigating Protostellar Accretion" (IPA), we observed an intermediate-mass protostar HOPS 370 (OMC2-FIR3) using NIRSpec/IFU and MIRI/MRS. This study presents the gas and ice phase chemical inventory revealed with the JWST in the spectral range of ~2.9 to 28 &mu;m and explores the spatial variation of volatile ice species in the protostellar envelope. We find evidence for thermal processing of ice species throughout the inner envelope. We present the first high-spatial resolution (~ 80 au) maps of key volatile ice species H_{2}O, CO_{2}, ^{13}CO_2, CO, and OCN^-, which reveal a highly structured and inhomogeneous density distribution of the protostellar envelope, with a deficiency of ice column density that coincides with the jet/outflow shocked knots. Further, we observe high relative crystallinity of H_{2}O ice around the shocked knot seen in the H_2 and OH wind/outflow, which can be explained by a lack of outer colder material in the envelope along the line of sight due to the irregular structure of the envelope. These observations show clear evidence of thermal processing of the ices in the inner envelope, close to the outflow cavity walls, heated by the luminous protostar.

<p>
JWST has revealed an abundance of compact, red objects at z\approx5-8 dubbed "little red dots" (LRDs), whose SEDs display a faint blue UV continuum followed by a steep rise in the optical. Despite extensive study of their characteristic V-shaped SEDs, the nature of LRDs remains unknown. We present a new analysis of the NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum of A2744-QSO1, a triply imaged LRD at z=7.04 from the UNCOVER survey. The spectrum shows a strong Balmer break and broad Balmer emission lines, both of which are difficult to explain with models invoking exclusively AGN or stellar contributions. Our fiducial model decomposes the spectrum into a post-starburst galaxy dominating the UV-optical continuum and a reddened AGN being sub-dominant at all wavelength and contributing at ~20&percnt; level. However, our most credible model infers a stellar mass of M_\star\approx 4\times10^9\,\mathrm{M_\odot} within a radius of r_\mathrm{e}&lt;30\,pc, driving its central density to the highest among observations to date. This high central density could be explained if A2744-QSO-1 is the early-forming core of a modern-day massive elliptical galaxy that later puffed up via the inside-out growth channel. The models also necessitate an unusually steep dust law to preserve the strong break strength, though this steepness may be explained by a deficit of large dust grains. It is also probable that these challenges reflect our ignorance of A2744-QSO1's true nature. Future variability and reverberation mapping studies could help disentangle the galaxy and AGN contribution to the continuum, and deeper redder observations could also unveil the dust properties in LRDs.

### 81) [2410.06252](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06252v1): Force-feeding Supermassive Black Holes with Dissipative Dark Matter

<p> Matthew R. Buckley, Nicolas Fernandez </p>
<p>
Supermassive black holes with masses \gtrsim 10^9\,M_\odot have been discovered by JWST at high redshifts (z~ 7). It is difficult to explain such objects as the result of accretive growth of stellar-mass seeds, as the rate at which baryons can be fed to the black hole is limited by the radiation pressure of the infalling matter. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism to create the early progenitors: the collapse of small dark matter halos through a dissipative cooling mechanism in the dark sector. These small black holes can then be efficiently fed with additional dissipative dark matter due to the comparatively weak interactions between the dark radiation and dark matter, which results in a very short Eddington time and high accretion rates.

<p> Zacariyya A. Khan, Kate Pattle, Sarah F. Graves </p>
<p>
We present 850&mu;m polarized observations of the molecular cloud G34.26+0.15 taken using the POL-2 polarimeter mounted on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). G34.26+0.15 is a hub-filament system with ongoing high-mass star-formation, containing multiple HII regions. We extend the Histogram of Relative Orientations technique with an alternative application that considers the alignment of the magnetic field to the filaments and a HII region boundary, denoted as the filament alignment factor (\xi_{F}) and the ellipse alignment factor (\xi_{E}) respectively. Using these metrics, we find that, although in general the magnetic field aligns parallel to the filamentary structure within the system in the north-west, the magnetic field structure of G34.26+0.15 has been radically reshaped by the expansion of an evolved HII region in the south-east, which itself may have triggered further high-mass star formation in the cloud. Thus, we suggest high-mass star formation is both occurring through mass accretion as per the hub-filament model from one side, and through compression of gas under stellar feedback from the other. We also use HARP observations of C^{18}O from the CHIMPS survey to estimate the magnetic field strength across the cloud, finding strengths of ~0.5-1.4 mG.

### 83) [2410.05891](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05891v1): Supermassive primordial black holes for the GHZ9 and UHZ1 observed by the JWST

<p> Hai-Long Huang, Yu-Tong Wang, Yun-Song Piao </p>
<p>
The high redshift (z&gt;10) galaxies GHZ9 and UHZ1 observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are very massive and have exceptionally high black hole-to-star mass ratios with the central black hole masses M\gtrsim 10^7\rm~M_\odot. In this paper, we explore the possibility that they are seeded by the supermassive primordial black holes (SMPBHs), which came into being in the very early universe, with initial masses ~ 10^7\rm~M_\odot. We present the self-similar accretion solutions for SMPBHs, and find that the mass growth of SMPBHs during pregalactic era may be negligible. These SMPBHs, when the redshift z\lesssim 20, can accelerate seeding high-redshift galaxies and their baryonic content, and consequently explain the central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of high-redshift massive galaxies through sub-Eddington accretion. According to our results, SMPBHs actually could lead to the existence of more massive SMBHs at higher redshifts compared to other SMBH seed scenarios, specially SMBHs with masses M\gtrsim 10^7~\rm M_\odot at z&gt;20 might only origin from SMPBHs, thus the corresponding observation can serve as a potential probe to PBHs.

Combining Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array CO(2-1) mapping and JWST near- and mid-infrared imaging, we characterize the relationship between CO(2-1) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission at ~100 pc resolution in 66 nearby star-forming galaxies, expanding the sample size from previous ~100 pc resolution studies by more than an order of magnitude. Focusing on regions of galaxies where most of the gas is likely to be molecular, we find strong correlations between CO(2-1) and 3.3 micron, 7.7 micron, and 11.3 micron PAH emission, estimated from JWST's F335M, F770W, and F1130W filters. We derive power law relations between CO(2-1) and PAH emission, which have indices in the range 0.8-1.2, implying relatively weak variations in the observed CO-to-PAH ratios across the regions that we study. We find that CO-to-PAH ratios and scaling relationships near HII regions are similar to those in diffuse sight lines. The main difference between the two types of regions is that sight lines near HII regions show higher intensities in all tracers. Galaxy centers, on the other hand, show higher overall intensities and enhanced CO-to-PAH ratios compared to galaxy disks. Individual galaxies show 0.19 dex scatter in the normalization of CO at fixed I_PAH and this normalization anti-correlates with specific star formation rate (SFR/M*) and correlates with stellar mass. We provide a prescription that accounts for these galaxy-to-galaxy variations and represents our best current empirical predictor to estimate CO(2-1) intensity from PAH emission, which allows one to take advantage of JWST's excellent sensitivity and resolution to trace cold gas.

<p>
We present a detailed analysis of JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam observations of ZF-UDS-7329, a massive, quiescent galaxy at redshift z=3.2, which has been put forward to challenge cosmology and galaxy formation physics. Our study extends previous works by focusing on the impact of different star formation history (SFH) priors, stellar libraries, metallicity, and initial mass function assumptions. Our results show that ZF-UDS-7329, with a formed stellar mass of M_{\star} \approx 10^{11.4}~M_{\odot} and a specific star formation rate of \mathrm{sSFR} \approx 0.03 Gyr^{-1}, formed efficiently in the first billion years of the Universe. In agreement with previous work, we find that the spectrum is consistent with mass-weighted stellar ages of 1.3-1.8 Gyr, depending on the SFH prior used. A physically motivated rising SFH prior makes the formation history of ZF-UDS-7329 compatible with stellar mass and star-formation rate estimates of high-redshift (z&gt;6) galaxies. Using NIRCam imaging, we identify a colour gradient indicative of an old, quiescent bulge and a younger disc component, as expected from a complex formation history. The inferred SFH is consistent a high stellar fraction of f_{\star}=M_{\star}/(f_b \cdot M_{\rm h}) \approx 100&percnt; at z=7-12, implying an extremely high integrated star-formation efficiency. However, when considering cosmic variance and possible mergers as expected in over-dense environments - as traced by ZF-UDS-7329 - the stellar fractions could be reduced to f_{\star} \approx 50&percnt;, which is more consistent with galaxy formation models and the stellar-to-halo mass relation at lower redshifts. We conclude that ZF-UDS-7329 forms extremely efficient in the early universe, but does not necessitate unseen galaxies at higher redshifts since the inferred SFR of ancestors are consistent with those seen in z&gt;6 galaxies.

### 86) [2410.04227](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04227v2): Star formation in cosmic-dawn galaxies

<p> Sandro Tacchella </p>
<p>
In the first two years of operation JWST has delivered key new insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies in the early Universe. By combining imaging with spectroscopy, we discovered and characterised the first generation of galaxies, probing the Universe at an age of 300 million years. While the current JWST observations confirm the overall cosmological framework and the paradigm of galaxy formation, there are also surprises, including large abundances of bright galaxies and accreting black holes in the early Universe. These observations, together with detailed measurements of the stellar populations and morphological structure, will help us to develop in the coming years a more refined understanding of the baryonic physics (including star formation and feedback processes) that leads to the formation of mature systems at later epochs, including our own Milky Way galaxy.

### 87) [2410.03830](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03830v1): Suppressed accretion onto massive black hole binaries surrounded by thin disks

<p> Christopher Tiede, Jonathan Zrake, Andrew MacFadyen, Zoltan Haiman </p>
<p>
We demonstrate that gas disks around binary systems might deliver gas to the binary components only when the circumbinary disk is relatively warm. We present new grid-based hydrodynamics simulations, performed with the binary on the grid and a locally isothermal equation of state, in which the binary is seen to functionally ``stop accreting'' if the orbital Mach number in the disk exceeds a threshold value of about 40. Above this threshold, the disk continues to extract angular momentum from the binary orbit, but it delivers very little mass to the black holes, and instead piles up mass in a ring surrounding the binary. This ring will eventually become viscously relaxed and deliver mass to the binary at the large-scale inflow rate. However we show that the timescale for such relaxation can far exceed the implied binary lifetime. We demonstrate that the ability of a binary-disk system to equilibrate is dependent on the efficiency at which accretion streams deposit mass onto the binary; which in turn is highly sensitive to the thermodynamic conditions of the inner disk. If disks around massive black hole binaries do operate in such non-accreting regimes, it suggests these systems may be dimmer than their single black hole counterparts, but could exhibit dramatic re-brightening after the black holes in-spiral and merge. This dimming occurs at high photon energies, corresponding to the effective truncation of the circumbinary disk. As a result, such system may be underluminous in UV bands and missing X-ray emission entirely, potentially resembling the spectra of `Little Red Dots'' recently identified in JWST observations.

We present paper II comprising a 35 arcmin^2 JWST/NIRCam imaging and wide-field slitless spectroscopy mosaic centered on J0305-3150, a luminous quasar at z=6.61. The F356W grism data reveals 124 [OIII]+H\beta emitters at 5.3&lt;z&lt;7, 53 of which constitute a protocluster spanning (10 cMpc)^2 across 6.5&lt;z&lt;6.8. We find no evidence of any broad-line AGN in individual galaxies or stacking, reporting a median H\beta FWHM of 585 \pm 152 km s^{-1}; however, the mass-excitation diagram and ``little red dot" color and compactness criteria suggest that there are a few AGN candidates on the outskirts of the protocluster. We fit the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the [OIII] emitters with Prospector and Bagpipes, and find that none of the SED-derived properties (stellar mass, age, or star formation rate) correlates with proximity to the quasar. While there is no correlation between galaxy age and local galaxy density, we find modest correlations between local galaxy density with increasing stellar mass, decreasing 10-to-100 Myr star formation rate ratios and decreasing nebular line equivalent widths. We further find that the protocluster galaxies are consistent with being more massive, older, and hosting higher star formation rates than the field sample at the 3\sigma level, distributed in a filamentary structure which supports inside-out formation of the protocluster. There is modest evidence that galaxy evolution proceeds differently as a function of the density of local environment within protoclusters during the epoch of reionization, and the central quasar has little effect on the galaxy properties of the surrounding structure.

<p>
ASPIRE (A SPectroscopic survey of bIased halos in the Reionization Era) is a quasar legacy survey primarily using JWST to target a sample of 25 z&gt;6 quasars with NIRCam slitless spectroscopy and imaging. The first study in this series found evidence of a strong overdensity of galaxies around J0305-3150, a luminous quasar at z=6.61, within a single NIRCam pointing obtained in JWST Cycle 1. Here, we present the first results of a JWST Cycle 2 mosaic that covers 35 arcmin^2 with NIRCam imaging/WFSS of the same field to investigate the spatial extent of the putative protocluster. The F356W grism data targets [OIII]+H\beta at 5.3&lt;z&lt;7 and reveals a population of 124 line emitters down to a flux limit of 1.2\times10^{-18} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2}. Fifty-three of these galaxies lie at 6.5&lt;z&lt;6.8 spanning 10 cMpc on the sky, corresponding to an overdensity within a 2500 cMpc^3 volume of 12.5 \pm 2.6, anchored by the quasar. Comparing to the [OIII] luminosity function from the Emission line galaxies and Intergalactic Gas in the Epoch of Reionization (EIGER) project, we find a dearth of faint [OIII] emitters at log(L/erg s^{-1}) &lt; 42.3, which we suggest is consistent with either bursty star formation causing galaxies to scatter around the grism detection limit or modest suppression from quasar feedback. While we find a strong filamentary overdensity of [OIII] emitters consistent with a protocluster, we suggest that we could be insensitive to a population of older, more massive Lyman-break galaxies with weak nebular emission on scales &gt;10 cMpc.

### 90) [2410.03822](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03822v1): Connecting the growth of galaxies to the large-scale environment in a massive node of the Cosmic Web at z~3

<p>
A direct link between large-scale environment and galaxy properties is very well established in the local universe. However, very little is known about the role of the environment for galaxy growth before the peak of the cosmic star formation history at z&gt;3 due to the rarity of high-redshift, overdense structures. Using a combination of deep, multiwalength observations, including MUSE, JWST, Chandra, HST and ground-based imaging, we detect and study the properties of a population of star-forming galaxies in the field of a hyperluminous quasar at z\approx3.25 associated with the giant Ly\alpha nebula MQN01. We find that this region hosts one of the largest overdensity of galaxies found so far at z&gt;3, with \rho/\bar{\rho}=53\pm17 within 4\times4\rm\,cMpc^2 and |\Delta v|&lt;1000\rm\,km\,s^{-1} from the quasar, providing a unique laboratory to study the link between overdense regions and galaxy properties at high redshift. Even in these rare overdense regions, galaxies are forming stars at a rate consistent with the main sequence at z\approx3, demonstrating that their SFR is regulated by local properties correlated with their stellar mass rather than by their environment. However, the high-mass-end of the stellar mass function is significantly elevated with respect to that of galaxies in the field at \log(M_\star/{M_\odot})\gtrsim10.5, suggesting that massive galaxies in overdense regions build-up their stellar mass earlier or more efficiently than in average regions of the universe. Finally, the overdensity of color-selected Lyman break galaxies observed on larger scales, across \approx24\times24\rm\,cMpc^2, is found to be aligned toward the structure traced by the spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies identified with MUSE in the inner 4\times4\rm\,cMpc^2, suggesting that this highly overdense region could further extend up to a few tens of comoving Mpc.

### 91) [2410.03366](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03366v1): JWST/NIRCam Pa\mathrmβ narrow-band imaging reveals ordinary dust extinction for H\mathrmα emitters within the Spiderweb protocluster at z=2.16

<p>
We combine JWST/NIRCam and Subaru/MOIRCS dual Pa\mathrm{\beta} + H\mathrm{\alpha} narrow-band imaging to trace the dust attenuation and the star-formation activities of a sample of 43 H\mathrm{\alpha} emitters at the core of one of the most massive and best-studied clusters in formation at the cosmic noon: the Spiderweb protocluster at \mathrm{z=2.16}. We find that most H\mathrm{\alpha} emitters display Pa\mathrm{\beta}/H\mathrm{\alpha} ratios compatible with Case B recombination conditions, which translates into nebular extinction values ranging at \mathrm{A_V\approx0-3} magnitudes, and dust corrected \mathrm{Pa\beta} star formation rates consistent with coeval main sequence field galaxies at fixed stellar mass (\mathrm{9.4&lt;\log M_*/M_\odot&lt;11.0}) during this cosmic epoch. Furthermore, we investigate possible environmental impacts on dust extinction across the protocluster large-scale structure and find no correlation between the dustiness of its members and environmental proxies such as phase-space position, clustercentric radius, or local density. These results support the scenario for which dust production within the main galaxy population of this protocluster is driven by secular star formation activities fueled by smooth gas accretion across its large-scale structure. This downplays the role of gravitational interactions in boosting star formation and dust production within the Spiderweb protocluster, in contrast with observations in higher redshift and less evolved protocluster cores.

### 92) [2410.03362](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03362v1): JWST/NIRCam Narrowband Survey of Paβ Emitters in the Spiderweb Protocluster at z=2.16

<p>
We report the initial result of our Pa\beta narrowband imaging on a protocluster with the JWST Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam). As NIRCam enables deep narrowband imaging of rest-frame NIR lines at z&gt;1, we target one of the most studied protoclusters, the Spiderweb protocluster at z=2.16, in which previous studies have confirmed more than a hundred member galaxies. The NIRCam F405N narrowband filter covers in Pa\beta line the protocluster redshift given by known protocluster members, allowing the search for new member candidates. The weight-corrected color-magnitude diagram obtained 57 sources showing narrowband excesses, 41 of which satisfy further color selection criteria for limiting the sample to Pa\beta emitter candidates at z~2.16, and 24 of them do not have H\alpha emitter counterparts. The Pa\beta emitter candidates appear to follow the spatial distribution of known protocluster members; however, follow-up spectroscopic confirmation is required. Only 17 out of 58 known H\alpha-emitting cluster members are selected as Pa\beta emitters in the current data, albeit the rest fall out of the narrowband selection owing to their small Pa\beta equivalent widths. We derive Pa\beta luminosity function in the Spiderweb protocluster, showing a normalization density of \log{\phi^\ast}=-2.53\pm0.15 at a characteristic Pa\beta luminosity of \log{L^\ast}=42.33\pm0.17. Furthermore, we examine the possibility of detecting faint line emitters visible only in the narrow-band image, but find no promising candidates.

### 93) [2410.03337](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03337v1): A negligible contribution of two luminous z ~ 7.5 galaxies to the ionizing photon budget of reionization

<p>
We present indirect constraints on the absolute escape fraction of ionizing photons (f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}) of the system GN 42912 which comprises two luminous galaxies (M_{\rm UV} magnitudes of -20.89 and -20.37) at z~7.5, GN 42912-NE and GN 42912-SW, to determine their contribution to the ionizing photon budget of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The high-resolution James Webb Space Telescope NIRSpec and NIRCam observations reveal the two galaxies are separated by only ~0.1" (0.5 kpc) on the sky and have a 358 km s^{-1} velocity separation. GN 42912-NE and GN 42912-SW are relatively massive for this redshift (log(M_\ast/M_\odot) ~ 8.4 and 8.9, respectively), with gas-phase metallicities of 18 per cent and 23 per cent solar, O_{32} ratios of 5.3 and &gt;5.8, and \beta slopes of -1.92 and -1.51, respectively. We use the Mg II\lambda\lambda2796,2803 doublet to constrain f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}. Mg II has an ionization potential close to that of neutral hydrogen and, in the optically thin regime, can be used as an indirect tracer of the LyC leakage. We establish realistic conservative upper limits on f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC} of 8.5 per cent for GN 42912-NE and 14 per cent for GN 42912-SW. These estimates align with f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC} trends observed with \beta, O_{32}, and the H\beta equivalent width at z&lt;4. The small inferred ionized region sizes (&lt;0.3 pMpc) around both galaxies indicate they have not ionized a significant fraction of the surrounding neutral gas. While these z&gt;7 f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC} constraints do not decisively determine a specific reionization model, they support a minor contribution from these two relatively luminous galaxies to the EoR.

### 94) [2409.11468](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11468v2): Probing the Origin of the Star Formation Excess Discovered by JWST through Gamma-Ray Bursts

<p> Tatsuya Matsumoto, Yuichi Harikane, Keiichi Maeda, Kunihito Ioka </p>
<p>
The recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed a larger number of bright galaxies at z\gtrsim10 than was expected. The origin of this excess is still under debate, although several possibilities have been presented. We propose that gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are a powerful probe to explore the origin of the excess and, hence, the star and galaxy formation histories in the early universe. Focusing on the recently launched mission, Einstein Probe (EP), we find that EP can detect several GRBs annually at z\gtrsim10, assuming the GRB formation rate calibrated by events at z\lesssim6 can be extrapolated. Interestingly, depending on the excess scenarios, the GRB event rate may also show an excess at z~eq10, and its detection will help to discriminate between the scenarios that are otherwise difficult to distinguish. Additionally, we discuss that the puzzling, red-color, compact galaxies discovered by JWST, the so-called ``little red dots'', could host dark GRBs if they are dust-obscured star forming galaxies. We are eager for unbiased follow-up of GRBs and encourage future missions such as HiZ-GUNDAM to explore the early universe.

### 95) [2409.08328](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08328v2): JWST Reveals Bulge-dominated Star-forming Galaxies at Cosmic Noon

<p>
Hubble Space Telescope imaging shows that most star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon -- the peak of cosmic star formation history -- appear disk-dominated, leaving the origin of the dense cores in their quiescent descendants unclear. With the James Webb Space Telescope's (JWST) high-resolution imaging to 5 {&mu;}m, we can now map the rest-frame near-infrared emission, a much closer proxy for stellar mass distribution, in these massive galaxies. We selected 70 star-forming galaxies with 10&lt;log(M)&lt;12 and 1.5&lt;z&lt;3 in the CEERS survey and compare their morphologies in the rest-frame optical to those in the rest-frame near-IR. While the bulk of these galaxies are disk-dominated in 1.5 {&mu;}m (rest-frame optical) imaging, they appear more bulge-dominated at 4.4 {&mu;}m (rest-frame near-infrared). Our analysis reveals that in massive star-forming galaxies at z~2, the radial surface brightness profiles steepen significantly, from a slope of ~0.3/dex at 1.5 {&mu;}m to ~1.4/dex at 4.4 {&mu;}m within radii &lt; 1 kpc. Additionally, we find their total flux contained within the central 1 kpc is approximately 7 times higher in F444W than in F150W. In rest-optical emission, a galaxy's central surface density appears to be the strongest indicator of whether it is quenched or star-forming. Our most significant finding is that at redder wavelengths, the central surface density ratio between quiescent and star-forming galaxies dramatically decreases from ~10 to ~1. This suggests the high central densities associated with galaxy quenching are already in place during the star-forming phase, imposing new constraints on the transition from star formation to quiescence.

<p>
The active galactic nucleus (AGN) feeding and feedback process in the centers of galaxy clusters and groups is still not well understood. NGC 5044 is the ideal system in which to study AGN feedback. It hosts the largest known reservoir of cold gas in any cool-core galaxy group, and features several past epochs of AGN feedback imprinted as cavities in the X-ray bright intragroup medium (IGrM), as well as parsec scale jets. We present Submillimeter Array (SMA), Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) high frequency observations of NGC 5044 to assess the time variability of the mmwaveband emission from the accretion disk, and quantify the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) from the radio to sub-millimeter band. The SED is well described by advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model and self-absorbed jet emission from an aging plasma with tau = 1kyr. We find a characteristic variability timescale of 150 days, which constrains the ADAF emission region to about 0.1pc, and the magnetic field to 4.7mG in the jets and and 870G in the accretion disk. A longer monitoring/sampling will allow to understand if the underlying process is truly periodic in nature.

We present a set of photometric catalogs primarily aimed at providing the community with a comprehensive database for the study of galaxy populations in the high redshift Universe. The set gathers data from eight JWST NIRCam observational programs, targeting the Abell 2744 (GLASS-JWST, UNCOVER, DDT2756 and GO3990), EGS (CEERS), COSMOS and UDS (PRIMER), and GOODS North and South (JADES and NGDEEP) deep fields, for a total area of ~0.2 sq. degrees. Photometric estimates are obtained by means of well-established techniques, including tailored improvements designed to enhance the performance on the specific dataset. We also include new measurements from HST archival data, thus collecting 16 bands spanning from 0.44 to 4.44 &mu;m. A grand total of ~530 thousand sources is detected on stacks of NIRCam 3.56 and 4.44 &mu;m mosaics. We assess the photometric accuracy by comparing fluxes and colors against archival catalogs. We also provide photometric redshift estimates, statistically validated against a large set of robust spectroscopic data. The catalogs are publicly available on the Astrodeep website.

### 98) [2408.14534](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14534v3): Sequential formation of supermassive stars and heavy seed BHs through the interplay of cosmological cold accretion and stellar radiative feedback

<p> Masaki Kiyuna, Takashi Hosokawa, Sunmyon Chon </p>
<p>
Supermassive stars (SMSs) and heavy seed black holes, as their remnants, are promising candidates for Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) progenitors, especially for ones observed in the early universe z~eq 8.5-10 by recent JWST observations. Expected cradles of SMSs are the atomic cooling halos (M_{\rm halo}~eq 10^7~{\rm M_\odot}), where "cold accretion" emerges and possibly forms SMSs. We perform a suit of cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations and investigate star formation after the emergence of cold accretion, solving radiative feedback from stars inside the halo. We follow the mass growth of the protostars for ~ 3~{\rm Myr}, resolving the gas inflow down to ~ 0.1~{\rm pc} scales. We discover that, after cold accretion emerges, multiple SMSs of m_\star \gtrsim 10^5{\rm M_\odot} form at the halo centre with the accretion rates maintained at \dot{m}_\star ~eq 0.04~{\rm M_\odot}~{\rm yr^{-1}} for \lesssim 3~{\rm Myr}. Cold accretion supplies gas at a rate of \dot{M}_{\rm gas}\gtrsim 0.01-0.1~{\rm M_\odot}~{\rm yr^{-1}} from outside the halo virial radius to the central gas disc. Gravitational torques from spiral arms transport gas further inward, which feeds the SMSs. Radiative feedback from stars suppresses H_2 cooling and disc fragmentation, while photoevaporation is prevented by a dense envelope, which attenuates ionising radiation. Our results suggest that cold accretion can bring efficient BH mass growth after seed formation in the later universe. Moreover, cold accretion and gas migration inside the central disc increase the mass concentration and provide a promising formation site for the extremely compact stellar clusters observed by JWST.

### 99) [2408.11770](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11770v2): JWST Validates HST Distance Measurements: Selection of Supernova Subsample Explains Differences in JWST Estimates of Local H0

<p> Adam G. Riess, Dan Scolnic, Gagandeep S. Anand, Louise Breuval, Stefano Casertano, Lucas M. Macri, Siyang Li, Wenlong Yuan, Caroline D. Huang, Saurabh Jha, Yukei S. Murakami, Rachael Beaton, Dillon Brout, Tianrui Wu, Graeme E. Addison, Charles Bennett, Richard I. Anderson, Alexei V. Filippenko, Anthony Carr </p>
<p>
JWST provides new opportunities to cross-check the HST Cepheid/SNeIa distance ladder, which yields the most precise local measure of H0. We analyze early JWST subsamples (~1/4 of the HST sample) from the SH0ES and CCHP groups, calibrated by a single anchor (N4258). We find HST Cepheid distances agree well (~1 sigma) with all 8 combinations of methods, samples, and telescopes: JWST Cepheids, TRGB, and JAGB by either group, plus HST TRGB and Miras. The comparisons explicitly include the measurement uncertainty of each method in N4258, an oft-neglected but dominant term. Mean differences are ~0.03 mag, far smaller than the 0.18 mag "Hubble tension." Combining all measures produces the strongest constraint yet on the linearity of HST Cepheid distances, 0.994+-0.010, ruling out distance-dependent bias or offset as the source of the tension at ~7 sigma. Yet, measurements of H0 from current JWST subsamples produce large sampling differences whose size and direction we can directly estimate from the full HST set. We show that Delta(H0)~2.5 km/s/Mpc between the CCHP JWST program and the full HST sample is entirely consistent with differences in sample selection. Combining all JWST samples produces a new, distance-limited set of 16 SNeIa at D&lt;25 Mpc and more closely resembles the full sample thanks to "reversion to the mean" of larger samples. Using JWST Cepheids, JAGB, and TRGB, we find 73.4+-2.1, 72.2+-2.2, and 72.1+-2.2 km/s/Mpc, respectively. Explicitly accounting for SNe in common, the combined-sample three-method result from JWST is H0=72.6+-2.0, similar to H0=72.8 expected from HST Cepheids in the same galaxies. The small JWST sample trivially lowers the Hubble tension significance due to small-sample statistics and is not yet competitive with the HST set (42 SNeIa and 4 anchors), which yields 73.2+-0.9. Still, the joint JWST sample provides important crosschecks which the HST data passes.

### 100) [2408.10735](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10735v2): On the kinematic nature of apparent discs at high redshifts: Local counterparts are not dominated by ordered rotation but by tangentially anisotropic random motion

<p> Bitao Wang, Yingjie Peng, Michele Cappellari, Hua Gao, Houjun Mo </p>
<p>
It is not straightforward to physically interpret the apparent morphology of galaxies. Recent observations by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) revealed a dominant galaxy population at high redshifts (z&gt;2) that were visually classified as discs for their flattened shapes and/or exponential light profiles. The extensively accepted interpretation is that they are dynamically cold discs supported by bulk rotation. However, it is long known that flattened shapes and exponential profiles are not exclusive for rotating disc structure. To break degeneracy and assess the rotational support of typical high-z galaxies in the JWST samples, those with active star formation and stellar masses \mathrm{lg}(\mathcal{M}_{\star}/\mathcal{M}_{\odot})~9, we study the kinematics of their equal-mass counterparts at z=0. While these local star-forming low-mass galaxies are photometrically similar to real dynamically cold discs, they are not supported by ordered rotation but primarily by random motion, and their flattened shapes result largely from tangential orbital anisotropy. Given the empirical and theoretical evidence that young galaxies are dynamically hotter at higher redshifts, our results suggest that the high-z JWST galaxies may not be cold discs but are dynamically warm/hot galaxies with flattened shapes driven by anisotropy. While both having low rotational support, local low-mass galaxies possess oblate shapes, contrasting the prolate shapes (i.e. cigar-like) of low-mass systems at high redshifts. Such shape transition (prolate\Rightarrowoblate) indicates an associated change in orbital anisotropy (radial\Rightarrowtangential), with roots likely in the assembly of their host dark matter halos.

<p>
Integral field spectroscopy (IFS) is a powerful tool for understanding the formation of galaxies across cosmic history. We present the observing strategy and first results of MSA-3D, a novel JWST program using multi-object spectroscopy in a slit-stepping strategy to produce IFS data cubes. The program observed 43 normal star-forming galaxies at redshifts 0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 1.5, corresponding to the epoch when spiral thin-disk galaxies of the modern Hubble sequence are thought to emerge, obtaining kpc-scale maps of rest-frame optical nebular emission lines with spectral resolution R~eq2700. Here we describe the multiplexed slit-stepping method which is &gt;15 times more efficient than the NIRSpec IFS mode for our program. As an example of the data quality, we present a case study of an individual galaxy at z=1.104 (stellar mass M_{*} = 10^{10.3}~M_{\odot}, star formation rate~=3~M_{\odot} yr^{-1}) with prominent face-on spiral structure. We show that the galaxy exhibits a rotationally supported disk with moderate velocity dispersion (\sigma = 36^{+5}_{-4}~\kms), a negative radial metallicity gradient (-0.020\pm0.002~dex\,kpc^{-1}), a dust attenuation gradient, and an exponential star formation rate density profile which closely matches the stellar continuum. These properties are characteristic of local spirals, indicating that mature galaxies are in place at z~1. We also describe the customized data reduction and original cube-building software pipelines which we have developed to exploit the powerful slit-stepping technique. Our results demonstrate the ability of JWST slit-stepping to study galaxy populations at intermediate to high redshifts, with data quality similar to current surveys of the z~0.1 universe.

<p> Zhenwei Li, Lifan Wang, Zhanwen Han, Xuefei Chen </p>
<p>
Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered at redshift z\lesssim2.5 are presumed to be produced from Population (Pop) I/II stars. {In this work, we investigate the production of SNe Ia from Pop III binaries in the cosmological framework. We derive the SN Ia rate as a function of redshift under a theoretical context for the production of first generation stars and emanate the likelihood of their detection by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).} {Assuming the initial stellar mass function (IMF) favors low-mass stars as from recent numerical simulations, we found Pop III stars may give rise to a considerable amount of SNe Ia at high redshift and Pop III stars may even be the dominant SN Ia producer at z \gtrsim 6.} {In an optimistic scenario, we expect ~ 1(2) SNe Ia from Pop III stars at z\approx 4(5) for a survey of area 300 \;\rm arcmin^2 during a 3\;\rm yr period with JWST. The same survey may record more than ~ 400 SNe Ia at lower redshift (z\lesssim 2.5) but with only about one of them from Pop III progenitors. There will be ~ 6 Pop III SNe Ia in the same field of view at redshifts of 5-10.} Observational constraints on SN Ia rates at the redshift range of 5-10 can place crucial constraints on the IMF of Pop III stars.

### 103) [2407.17410](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17410v2): Strong Balmer break objects at z ~ 7-10 uncovered with JWST

<p> A. Kuruvanthodi, D. Schaerer, R. Marques-Chaves, D. Korber, A. Weibel, P. Oesch, G. Roberts-Borsani </p>
<p>
We report the discovery of robust spectroscopically confirmed Balmer break (BB) galaxies and candidates, with secure spectroscopic redshifts 7.1 \le z \le 9.6 from publicly available JWST extra-galactic photometric and spectroscopic surveys. To do so, we used dedicated filters probing the Balmer break and inspected the objects with NIRSpec spectroscopy. We recover the previously known objects with strong Balmer breaks and reveal 10-11 new objects with clear BBs, thus tripling the number of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies with a BB at z &gt;7. Approximately half of them show a pure BB and no signs of recent star formation, whereas the other half shows BB and emission lines, indicating most likely galaxies whose star formation ceased earlier and has restarted recently. Overall we find that ~10-20% of all galaxies from our sample show signatures of an evolved stellar population. Furthermore, we find that the strength of the BB does not significantly depend on the rest-UV and rest-optical brightness of these sources. In short, our work confirms that photometry alone has the potential to measure BB strengths and to identify evolved stellar populations at high redshift and that such objects may be more frequent than previously thought. The presence of galaxies with a range of break strengths and the joint presence of BB and emission lines indicate a bursty nature of the star formation in the early Universe.

### 104) [2407.15915](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15915v2): Mildly Super-Eddington Accretion Onto Slowly-Spinning Black Holes Explains the X-Ray Weakness of the Little Red Dots

<p> Fabio Pacucci, Ramesh Narayan </p>
<p>
JWST has revealed a population of low-luminosity AGN at z&gt;4 in compact, red hosts (the "Little Red Dots", or LRDs), which are largely undetected in X-rays. We investigate this phenomenon using GRRMHD simulations of super-Eddington accretion onto a SMBH with M_\bullet=10^7 \,\rm M_\odot at z~6, representing the median population; the SEDs that we obtain are intrinsically X-ray weak. The highest levels of X-ray weakness occur in SMBHs accreting at mildly super-Eddington rates (1.4&lt;f_{\rm Edd}&lt;4) with zero spin, viewed at angles &gt;30^\circ from the pole. X-ray bolometric corrections in the observed 2-10 keV band reach ~10^4 at z=6, ~5 times higher than the highest constraint from X-ray stacking. Most SEDs are extraordinarily steep and soft in the X-rays (median photon index \Gamma=3.1, mode of \Gamma=4.4). SEDs strong in the X-rays have harder spectra with a high-energy bump when viewed near the hot (&gt;10^8 K) and highly-relativistic jet, whereas X-ray weak SEDs lack this feature. Viewing a SMBH within 10^\circ of its pole, where beaming enhances the X-ray emission, has a ~1.5&percnt; probability, matching the LRD X-ray detection rate. Next-generation observatories like AXIS will detect X-ray weak LRDs at z~6 from any viewing angle. Although many SMBHs in the LRDs are already estimated to accrete at super-Eddington rates, our model explains 50&percnt; of their population by requiring that their masses are overestimated by a mere factor of ~3. In summary, we suggest that LRDs host slowly spinning SMBHs accreting at mildly super-Eddington rates, with large covering factors and broad emission lines enhanced by strong winds, providing a self-consistent explanation for their X-ray weakness and complementing other models.

<p>
We present an [O/Fe] ratio of a luminous galaxy GN-z11 at z=10.60 derived with the deep public JWST/NIRSpec data. We fit the medium-resolution grating (G140M, G235M, and G395M) data with the model spectra consisting of BPASS-stellar and CLOUDY-nebular spectra in the rest-frame UV wavelength ranges with Fe absorption lines, carefully masking out the other emission and absorption lines in the same manner as previous studies conducted for lower redshift (z~ 2-6) galaxies with oxygen abundance measurements. We obtain an Fe-rich abundance ratio \mathrm{[O/Fe]}=-0.37^{+0.43}_{-0.22}, which is confirmed with the independent deep prism data as well as by the classic 1978 index method. This [O/Fe] measurement is lower than measured for star-forming galaxies at z~ 2-3. Because z=10.60 is an early epoch after the Big Bang (~ 430 Myr) and the first star formation (likely ~ 200 Myr), it is difficult to produce Fe by Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) requiring sufficient delay time for white-dwarf formation and gas accretion. The Fe-rich abundance ratio in GN-z11 suggests that the delay time is short, or that the major Fe enrichment is not accomplished by SNeIa but bright hypernovae (BrHNe) and/or pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), where the yield models of BrHNe and PISNe explain Fe, Ne, and O abundance ratios of GN-z11. The [O/Fe] measurement is not too low to rule out the connection between GN-z11 and globular clusters (GCs) previously suggested by the nitrogen abundance, but rather supports the connection with a GC population at high [N/O] if a metal dilution process exists.

<p>
JWST has discovered a large population of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) at high redshift. Many of these newly discovered AGN have broad permitted lines (typically H\alpha), but are extremely weak in the X-rays. Here we present the NIRSpec spectrum of the most extreme of these objects, GN-28074, an AGN at z=2.26 with prominent Balmer, Paschen and \HeI broad lines, and with the highest limit on the bolometric to X-ray luminosity ratio among all spectroscopically confirmed AGN in GOODS. This source is also characterized by a mid-IR excess, most likely associated with the AGN torus' hot dust. The high bolometric luminosity and moderate redshift of this AGN allow us to explore its properties more in depth relative to other JWST-discovered AGN. The NIRSpec spectrum reveals prominent, slightly blueshifted absorption of H\alpha, H\beta and \HeI\lambda10830. The Balmer absorption lines require gas with densities of n_{\rm H}&gt; 10^8~{\rm cm}^{-3}, inconsistent with an ISM origin, but fully consistent with clouds in the Broad Line Region (BLR). This finding suggests that at least part of the X-ray weakness is due to high (Compton thick) X-ray absorption by (dust-free) clouds in the BLR, or in its outer, slowly outflowing regions. GN-28074 is also extremely radio-weak. The radio weakness can also be explained in terms of absorption, as the inferred density of the clouds responsible for H\alpha absorption makes them optically thick to radio emission through free-free absorption. Alternatively, in this and other JWST-discovered AGN, the nuclear magnetic field may have not developed properly yet, resulting both in intrinsically weak radio emission and also lack of hot corona, hence intrinsic X-ray weakness. Finally, we show that recently proposed scenarios, invoking hyper-dense and ultra-metal-poor outflows or Raman scattering to explain the broad H\alpha, are completely ruled out.

Photometric redshifts are widely used in studies of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs), but catastrophic photo-z failure can undermine all redshift-dependent results. Here we report the spectroscopic redshift confirmation of COSBO-7, a strongly lensed DSFG in the COSMOS-PRIMER field. Recently, a photometric redshift solution of z\gtrsim7.0 was reported for COSBO-7 based on ten bands of {\it James Webb} Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam and MIRI imaging data. This z value was favored by four independent spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes, and the result provided an appealing candidate for the most distant massive DSFG known to date. This photo-z solution was also supported by a single line detection in Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) Band 3 consistent with CO(7-6) at z=7.46. However, our new ALMA observations robustly detect two lines in Band 6 identified as CO(7-6) and [CI](2-1) at z_{\rm spec}=2.625, and thus the Band 3 line as CO(3-2). These three robust line detections decidedly place COSBO-7 at z=2.625, refuting the photo-z solution. We derive physical parameters by fitting near-infrared(NIR)-to-millimeter(mm) photometry and lens modeling, revealing that COSBO-7 is a main sequence galaxy. We examine possible reasons for this photo-z failure and attribute it to (1) the likely underestimation of photometric uncertainties at 0.9\,&mu;m and 1.15 \,&mu;m; and (2) the lack of photometry at wavelengths beyond 20\,&mu;m. Notably, we recover a bona fide z_{\rm phot}~ 2.3 by including the existing MIPS 24\,&mu;m photometry, demonstrating the critical importance of mid-infrared (MIR) data in bolstering photo-z measurements. This work highlights a common challenge in modeling the SEDs of DSFGs, and provides a cautionary tale regarding the reliability of photometric redshifts as well as pseudo-spectroscopic redshifts based on single line detection.

### 108) [2407.07162](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07162v3): Exploring a primordial solution for early black holes detected with the JWST

<p> Pratika Dayal </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unearthed black holes as massive as 10^{6.2-8.1}M_\odot at redshifts of z ~ 8.5-10.6 with many systems showing unexpectedly high black hole to stellar mass ratios &gt;=30%, posing a crucial challenge for theoretical models. Using analytic calculations, we explore the combination of {\it astrophysical} seeding mechanisms and Eddington accretion rates that can explain the observed objects. We then appeal to {\it cosmological} primordial black hole (PBH) seeds and show how these present an alternative path for "seeding" early structures and their baryonic contents. Assuming seeding (via astrophysical means) at a redshift of z_{\rm seed}=25 and continuous accretion, all of the black holes studied here can either be explained through super-Eddington accretion (at an Eddington fraction of f_{\rm Edd}&lt;= 2.1 ) onto low-mass (100M_\odot) seeds or Eddington-limited accretion onto high-mass (10^5 M_\odot) seeds. The upper limit, where we assume a primordial origin for all of these black holes, yields a continuous primordial black hole mass function (between 10^{-5.25} and 10^{3.75} M_\odot) and a fractional PBH value &lt;= 10^{-12}, in good agreement with observational constraints. Starting at the redshift of matter-radiation equality (z ~ 3400), we show how PBH-driven structure formation can reproduce the observed stellar and black hole masses for two of the highest redshift black holes (UHZ1 and GHZ9 at z ~ 10.3) with the same parameters governing star formation, black hole accretion and their feedbacks. Exploring a wide swathe of model parameter space for GHZ9, we find black hole-to-stellar mass ratios ranging between 0.1-1.86 i.e. in some cases (of high supernova feedback), the black hole grows to be more massive than the stellar mass of its host, presenting an attractive alternative to seeding these puzzling early systems.

### 109) [2407.06255](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06255v2): Linking high-z and low-z: Are We Observing the Progenitors of the Milky Way with JWST?

<p>
The recent JWST observation of the Firefly Sparkle at z=8.3 offers a unique opportunity to link the high- and the low-z Universe. Indeed, the claim of it being a Milky Way (MW) type of assembly at the cosmic dawn opens the possibility of interpreting the observation with locally calibrated galaxy-formation models. Here, we use the MW-evolution model NEFERTITI to perform forward modeling of our Galaxy's progenitors at high-z. We build a set of mock spectra for the MW building blocks to make predictions for JWST and to interpret the Firefly Sparkle observation. First, we find that the most massive MW progenitor becomes detectable in a deep survey like JADES from z\approx 8.2, meaning that we could have already observed MW-analogs that still need interpretation. Second, we provide predictions for the number of detectable MW progenitors in lensed surveys like CANUCS, and interpret the Firefly Sparkle as a group of MW building blocks. Both the number of detections and the observed NIRCam photometry are consistent with our predictions. By identifying the MW progenitors whose mock photometry best fits the data, we find bursty and extended star-formation histories, lasting &gt; 150-300~Myr, and estimate their properties: M_h \approx 10^{8-9} \, M_{\odot}, M_\star \approx 10^{6.2-7.5}\, M_{\odot}, SFR \approx 0.04-0.20 \, M_{\odot} yr^{-1} and Z_{gas} \approx 0.04 - 0.24 \, Z_{\odot}. Uncovering the properties of MW-analogs at cosmic dawn by combining JWST observations and locally-constrained models, will allow us to understand our Galaxy's formation, linking the high- and low-z perspectives.

### 110) [2407.04209](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04209v2): An Edge-on Regular Disk Galaxy at z=5.289

<p> Haojing Yan, Bangzheng Sun, Chenxiaoji Ling </p>
<p>
While rotation-supported gas disks are known to exist as early as at z ~ 7, it is still a general belief that stellar disks form late in the Universe. This picture is now being challenged by the observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which have revealed a large number of disk-like galaxies that could be at z &gt; 3, with some being candidates at z &gt; 7. As an early formation of stellar disks will greatly impact our theory of galaxy formation and evolution, it is important to determine when such systems first emerged. Here we present D-CEERS-RUBIES-z5289 at z=5.289+-0.001, the second confirmed stellar disk at z &gt; 5, discovered using the archival JWST NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec spectroscopic data. This galaxy has a highly regular edge-on disk morphology, extends to ~6.2 kpc along its major axis, and has an effective radius of ~1.3--1.4 kpc. Such a large stellar disk is yet to be produced in numerical simulations. By analyzing its 10-band spectral energy distribution using four different tools, we find that it has a high stellar mass of 10^{9.5-10.0} M_sun. Its age is in the range of 330--510 Myr, and it has a mild star formation rate of 10--30 M_sun/yr. While the current spectroscopic data do not allow the derivation of its rotation curve, the width of its Halpha line from the partial slit coverage on one side of the disk reaches ~345 km/s, which suggests that it could have a significant contribution from rotation.

Suess, Pieter van Dokkum, David Weinberg, Daniel R. Weisz </p>
<p>
We present the stellar metallicities and multi-element abundances (C, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Fe) of 15 massive (log M/M_\odot=10.2-11.2) quiescent galaxies at z=1-3, derived from ultradeep JWST-SUSPENSE spectra. Compared to quiescent galaxies at z~0, these galaxies exhibit a deficiency of 0.26\pm0.04 dex in [C/H], 0.16\pm0.03 dex in [Fe/H], and 0.07\pm0.04 dex in [Mg/H], implying rapid formation and quenching before significant enrichment from asymptotic giant branch stars and Type Ia supernovae. Additionally, we find that galaxies forming at higher redshift consistently show higher [Mg/Fe] and lower [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], regardless of their observed redshift. The evolution in [Fe/H] and [C/H] is therefore primarily driven by lower-redshift samples naturally including galaxies with longer star-formation timescales. In contrast, the lower [Mg/H] likely reflects earlier-forming galaxies expelling larger gas reservoirs during their quenching phase. Consequently, the mass-metallicity relation, primarily reflecting [Mg/H], is somewhat lower at z=1-3 compared to the lower redshift relation. Finally, we compare our results to standard stellar population modeling approaches employing solar abundance patterns and non-parametric star-formation histories (using Prospector). Our SSP-equivalent ages agree with the mass-weighted ages from Prospector, while the metallicities disagree significantly. Nonetheless, the metallicities better reflect [Fe/H] than total [Z/H]. We also find that star-formation timescales inferred from elemental abundances are significantly shorter than those from Prospector, and we discuss the resulting implications for the early formation of massive galaxies.

<p>
Context. The recent detection of nitrogen-enhanced, metal-poor galaxies at high redshift by the James Webb Space Telescope has sparked renewed interest in exploring the chemical evolution of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen (the CNO elements) at early times, prompting fresh inquiries into their origins. Aims. The main goal of this paper is to shed light onto the early evolution of the main CNO isotopes in our Galaxy and in young distant systems, such as GN-z11 at z=10.6. Methods. To this aim, we incorporate a stochastic star-formation component into a chemical evolution model calibrated with high-quality Milky Way (MW) data, focusing on the contribution of Population III (Pop III) stars to the early chemical enrichment. Results. By comparing the model predictions with CNO abundance measurements from high-resolution spectroscopy of an homogeneous sample of Galactic halo stars, we first demonstrate that the scatter observed in the metallicity range -4.5 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt;-1.5 can be explained by pre-enrichment from Pop III stars that explode as supernovae (SNe) with different initial masses and energies. Then, by exploiting the chemical evolution model, we provide testable predictions for log(C/N), log(N/O), and log(C/O) vs. log(O/H)+12 in MW-like galaxies observed at different cosmic epochs/redshifts. Finally, by calibrating the chemical evolution model to replicate the observed properties of GN-z11, we provide an alternative interpretation of its log(N/O) abundance ratio, demonstrating that its high N content can be reproduced through enrichment from high-mass faint Pop III SNe. Conclusions. Stochastic chemical enrichment from primordial stars explains both the observed scatter in CNO abundances in MW halo stars and the exceptionally high N/O ratios in some distant galaxies. These findings emphasize the critical role of Pop III stars in shaping early chemical evolution.

### 113) [2406.12122](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12122v2): The Glow of Axion Quark Nugget Dark Matter: (I) Large Scale Structures

<p> Fereshteh Majidi, Xunyu Liang, Ludovic Van Waerbeke, Ariel Zhitnitsky, Michael Sekatchev, Julian S. Sommer, Klaus Dolag, Tiago Castro </p>
<p>
Axion quark nuggets (AQNs) are hypothetical objects with a mass greater than a few grams and sub-micrometer size, formed during the quark-hadron transition. Originating from the axion field, they offer a possible resolution of the similarity between visible and dark components of the Universe. These composite objects behave as cold dark matter, interacting with ordinary matter and resulting in pervasive electromagnetic radiation throughout the Universe. This work aims to predict the electromagnetic signature in large-scale structures from the AQN-baryon interaction, accounting for thermal and non-thermal radiations. We use Magneticum hydrodynamical simulations to describe the distribution and dynamics of gas and dark matter at cosmological scales. We calculate the electromagnetic signature from radio, starting at \nu ~ 1 GHz, up to a few keV X-ray energies. We find that the AQNs signature is characterized by monopole and fluctuation signals. The amplitude of both signals strongly depends on the average AQN mass and the ionization level of the baryonic environment. We identify a most optimistic scenario with a signal often near the sensitivity limit of existing instruments, such as FIRAS and the South Pole Telescope for high-resolution. Fluctuations in the Extra-galactic Background Light caused by the AQN can be tested with space-based imagers Euclid and James Webb Space Telescope. We also identify a minimal configuration, still out of reach of existing instruments, but future experiments might be able to pose constraints on the AQN model. We conclude that this is a viable dark matter model, which does not violate the canons of cosmology, nor existing observations. The best chances for testing this model reside in 1) ultra-deep IR and optical surveys, 2) spectral distorsions of the CMB and 3) low-frequency (1 GHz &lt; \nu &lt; 100 GHz) and high-resolution (\ell &gt; 10^4) observations.

<p> Leonardo Clarke, Alice E. Shapley, Ryan L. Sanders, Michael W. Topping, Gabriel B. Brammer, Trinity Bento, Naveen A. Reddy, Emily Kehoe </p>
<p>
We have used public JWST/NIRSpec and JWST/NIRCam observations from the CEERS and JADES surveys in order to analyze the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) over the redshift range 1.4 \leq z &lt; 7. We calculate the star-formation rates (SFRs) of the galaxy sample using three approaches: Balmer line luminosity, spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, and UV luminosity. We find a larger degree of scatter about the SFMS using the Balmer-based SFRs compared to the UV-based SFRs. Because these SFR indicators are sensitive to star formation on different time scales, the difference in scatter may be evidence of bursty star-formation histories in the early universe. We additionally compare the H\alpha-to-UV luminosity ratio (L(H\alpha)/\nuL_{\nu,1600}) for individual galaxies in the sample and find that 29&percnt;-52&percnt; of the ratios across the sample are poorly described by predictions from a smooth star-formation history. Measuring the burstiness of star formation in the early universe has multiple significant implications, such as deriving accurate physical parameters from SED fitting, explaining the evolution of the UV luminosity function, and providing constraints for sub-grid models of feedback in simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.

<p>
We present the census of H\beta+[OIII] 4960,5008 &#8491; emitters at 6.8&lt;z&lt;9.0 from the JWST FRESCO survey over 124 arcmin^2 in the GOODS-North and GOODS-South fields. Our unbiased spectroscopic search results in 137 spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at 6.8&lt;z&lt;9.0 with observed [OIII] fluxes f_{[OIII]}\gtrsim 1\times 10^{-18}\ \rm{ergs}\ \rm{s}^{-1} \ \rm{cm}^{-2}. The rest-frame optical line ratios of the median stacked spectrum (median M_{\rm{UV}}=-19.65^{+0.59}_{-1.05}) indicate negligible dust attenuation, low metallicity (12+\log(\rm{O/H})= 7.2-7.7) and a high ionisation parameter \log_{10}U ~eq -2.5. We find a factor \times 1.3 difference in the number density of 6.8&lt;z&lt;9.0 galaxies between GOODS-South and GOODS-North, which is caused by a single overdensity at 7.0&lt;z&lt;7.2 in GOODS-North. The bright end of the UV luminosity function of spectroscopically-confirmed [OIII] emitters is in good agreement with HST dropout-selected samples. Discrepancies between the observed [OIII] LF, [OIII]/UV ratio and [OIII] equivalent widths, and that predicted by theoretical models, suggest burstier star-formation histories and/or more heterogeneous metallicity and ionising conditions in z&gt;7 galaxies. We report a rapid decline of the [OIII] luminosity density at z\gtrsim 6-7 which cannot be explained by the evolution of the cosmic star-formation rate density. Finally we find that FRESCO detects in only 2h galaxies likely accounting for ~ 10-20&percnt; of the ionising budget at z=7-8 (assuming an escape fraction of 10%), raising the prospect of directly detecting a significant fraction of the sources of reionisation with JWST.

<p>
We investigate the dynamics of GN-z11, a luminous galaxy at z=10.60, carefully analyzing the public deep integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data taken with JWST NIRSpec IFU. While the observations of the IFS data originally targeted a He II clump near GN-z11, we find that CIII]\lambda\lambda1907,1909 emission from ionized gas at GN-z11 is bright and spatially extended significantly beyond the point-spread function (PSF). The spatially extended CIII emission of GN-z11 shows a velocity gradient, red- and blue-shifted components in the north and south directions, respectively, which cannot be explained by the variation of [CIII]\lambda1907/CIII]\lambda1909 line ratios. Assuming the velocity gradient is produced by disk rotation, we perform forward modeling with GalPak^{3D}, including the effects of PSF smearing and line blending, and obtain a rotation velocity of v_{rot}=257^{+138}_{-117} km s^{-1}, a velocity dispersion of \sigma_v=91^{+18}_{-32} km s^{-1}, and a ratio of v_{rot}/\sigma_v=2.83^{+1.82}_{-1.41}. The v_{rot}/\sigma_v value would suggest a rotation-dominated disk existing at z&gt;10 albeit with the large uncertainties. The rotation velocity agrees with those of numerical simulations predicting a rotating disk formed in the early universe under the condition of mass compaction and weak feedback. While the velocity gradient is consistent with the rotating disk solution, we recognize that galactic outflows can also explain the velocity gradient as well as the extended morphology and the high velocity dispersion found in the outskirt. Higher S/N and resolution data are necessary to conclude the physical origin of the velocity gradient in GN-z11.

JWST spectroscopy has revolutionized our understanding of galaxies in the early universe. Covering wavelengths up to 5.3\,{\rm &mu; m}, NIRSpec can detect rest-frame optical emission lines H\alpha out to z = 7 and [O III] to z = 9.5. Observing these lines in more distant galaxies requires longer wavelength spectroscopy with MIRI. Here we present MIRI MRS IFU observations of the lensed galaxy merger MACS0647-JD at z = 10.165. With exposure times of 4.2 hours in each of two bands, we detect H\alpha at 9\sigma, [O III]\,\lambda5008 at 11\sigma, and [O III]\,\lambda4960 at 3\sigma. Combined with previously reported NIRSpec spectroscopy that yields seven emission lines including the auroral line [O III]\,\lambda4363, we present the first direct metallicity measurement of a z &gt; 10 galaxy: 12+{\rm log(O/H)}= 7.79\pm0.09, or 0.13^{+0.02}_{-0.03}\,Z_{\odot}. This is similar to galaxies at z ~ 4 - 9 with direct metallicity measurements, though higher than expected given the high specific star formation rate {\rm log(sSFR / yr^{-1})} = -7.4 \pm 0.3. We further constrain the ionization parameter {\rm log}(U) = -1.9 \pm 0.1, ionizing photon production efficiency {\rm log}(\xi_{\rm ion}) = 25.3\pm0.1, and star formation rate 5.0\pm0.6\,M_{\odot}/{\rm yr} within the past 10\,{\rm Myr}. These observations demonstrate the combined power of JWST NIRSpec and MIRI for studying galaxies in the first 500 million years.

We report the chemical abundance pattern of GS\_3073, a galaxy at z=5.55 which was previously confirmed to host an overmassive active black hole, by leveraging the detection of about 40 emission lines, combining JWST/NIRSpec observations and ground-based (VLT/VIMOS) data. Based on the rest-frame UV emission lines, which trace high-density (~ 10^5~{\rm cm}^{-3}) and highly ionized gas, we derived an abundance ratio of \rm log(N/O) = 0.42^{+0.13}_{-0.10}. At an estimated metallicity of 0.2~Z_{\odot}, this is the most extreme nitrogen-rich object found by JWST thus far. In comparison, the relative carbon abundance derived from the rest-frame UV emission lines is \rm log(C/O) = -0.38^{+0.13}_{-0.11}, which is not significantly higher than those in local galaxies and stars with similar metallicities. We also found potential detection of coronal lines including [FeVII]\lambda 6087 and [FeXIV]\lambda 5303, both blended with [CaV]. We inferred a range of Fe abundances compatible with those in local stars and galaxies. Overall, the chemical abundance pattern of GS\_3073 is compatible with enrichment by super-massive stars with M_* \gtrsim 1000~M_\odot, asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, or Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Interestingly, when using optical emission lines which trace lower density (~ 10^3~{\rm cm}^{-3}) and lower ionization gas, we found a sub-solar N/O ratio. We interpret the difference in N/O derived from UV lines and optical lines as evidence for a stratified system, where the inner and denser region is both more chemically enriched and more ionized. Taking this luminous, well-studied system as a benchmark, our results suggest that nitrogen loudness in high-z galaxies is confined to the central, dense, and highly ionized region of the galaxies, while the bulk of the galaxies evolves more normally.

Recent observations from the EIGER JWST program have measured for the first time the quasar-galaxy cross-correlation function at z\approx6. The auto-correlation function of faint z\approx6 quasars was also recently estimated. These measurements provide key insights into the properties of quasars and galaxies at high redshift and their relation with the host dark matter halos. In this work, we interpret these data building upon an empirical quasar population model that has been applied successfully to quasar clustering and demographic measurements at z\approx2-4. We make use of a new, large-volume N-body simulation with more than a trillion particles, FLAMINGO-10k, to model quasars and galaxies simultaneously. We successfully reproduce observations of z\approx6 quasars and galaxies (i.e., their clustering properties and luminosity functions), and infer key quantities such as their luminosity-halo mass relation, the mass function of their host halos, and their duty cycle/occupation fraction. Our key findings are: (i) quasars reside on average in \approx10^{12.5}\,{\rm M}_\odot halos (corresponding to \approx5\sigma fluctuations in the initial conditions of the linear density field), but the distribution of host halo masses is quite broad; (ii) the duty cycle of (UV-bright) quasar activity is relatively low (\approx1&percnt;); (iii) galaxies (that are bright in [OIII]) live in much smaller halos (\approx10^{10.9}\,{\rm M}_\odot) and have a larger duty cycle (occupation fraction) of \approx13&percnt;. Finally, we focus on the inferred properties of quasars and present a homogeneous analysis of their evolution with redshift. The picture that emerges reveals a strong evolution of the host halo mass and duty cycle of quasars at z\approx2-6, and calls for new investigations of the role of quasar activity across cosmic time.

We present an analysis of the galaxy merger rate in the redshift range 4.0&lt;z&lt;9.0 (i.e. about 1.5 to 0.5 Gyr after the Big Bang) based on visually identified galaxy mergers from morphological parameter analysis. Our dataset is based on high-resolution NIRCam JWST data (a combination of F150W and F200W broad-band filters) in the low-to-moderate magnification (&mu;&lt;2) regions of the Abell 2744 cluster field. From a parent set of 675 galaxies (M_{U}\in[-26.6,-17.9]), we identify 64 merger candidates from the Gini, M_{20} and Asymmetry morphological parameters, leading to a merger fraction f_m=0.11\pm0.04. There is no evidence of redshift evolution of f_m even at the highest redshift considered, thus extending well into the epoch of reionization the constant trend seen previously at z\lesssim 6. Furthermore, we investigate any potential redshift dependent differences in the specific star formation rates between mergers and non-mergers. Our analysis reveals no significant correlation in this regard, with deviations in the studied redshift range typically falling within (1-1.5)\sigma from the null hypotesis that can be attributed to sample variance and measurement errors. Finally, we also demonstrate that the classification of a merging system is robust with respect to the observed (and equivalently rest-frame) wavelength of the high-quality JWST broad-band images used. This preliminary study highlights the potential for progress in quantifying galaxy assembly through mergers during the epoch of reionization, with significant sample size growth expected from upcoming large JWST infrared imaging datasets.

<p>
We present the High-z Evolution of Large and Luminous Objects (HELLO) project, a set of ~\!30 high-resolution cosmological simulations aimed to study Milky Way analogues (M_\star~10^{10-11}\,\Msun) at high redshift (z~ [2-4]). Based on the Numerical Investigation of a Hundred Astrophysical Objects (NIHAO), HELLO features an updated scheme for chemical enrichment and the addition of local photoionization feedback. Independently of redshift and mass, our galaxies exhibit a smooth progression along the star formation main sequence until M_\star ~\!10^{10.5}, around which our sample at z ~ 4 remains mostly unperturbed while the most massive galaxies at z ~ 2 reach their peak star formation rate (SFR) and its subsequent decline, due to a mix of gas consumption and stellar feedback. While AGN feedback remains subdominant with respect to stellar feedback for energy deposition, its localised nature likely adds to the physical processes leading to declining SFRs. The phase in which a galaxy in our mass range can be found at a given redshift is set by its gas reservoir and assembly history. Finally, our galaxies are in excellent agreement with various scaling relations observed with the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} and the \textit{James Webb Space Telescope}, and hence can be used to provide the theoretical framework to interpret current and future observations from these facilities and shed light on the transition from star-forming to quiescent galaxies.

<p>
Gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters involves hundreds of galaxies over a large redshift range and increases the likelihood of rare phenomena (supernovae, dark substructures, etc.). We present the detailed analysis of \elanz, a prominent quintuply imaged dusty star-forming galaxy (\zs=2.29), mainly lensed by three members of the massive galaxy cluster ACT-CL\,J0102-4915, also known as \elgor (z_{\rm d}=0.87). We leverage JWST/NIRCam images, which contain lensing features that were unseen in previous HST images, using a Bayesian, multi-wavelength, differentiable and GPU-accelerated modeling framework that combines \herculens (lens modeling) and \nifty (field model and inference) software packages. For one of the deflectors, we complement lensing constraints with stellar kinematics measured from VLT/MUSE data. In our lens model, we explicitly include the mass distribution of the cluster, locally corrected by a constant shear field. We find that the two main deflectors (L1 and L2) have logarithmic mass density slopes steeper than isothermal, with \gamma_{\rm L1} = 2.23\pm0.05 and \gamma_{\rm L2} = 2.21\pm0.04. We argue that such steep density profiles can arise due to tidally truncated mass distributions, which we probe thanks to the cluster lensing boost and the strong asymmetry of the lensing configuration. Moreover, our three-dimensional source model captures most of the surface brightness of the lensed galaxy, revealing a clump with a maximum diameter of 400 parsecs at the source redshift, visible at wavelengths \lambda_{\rm rest}\gtrsim0.6 &mu;m. Finally, we caution on using point-like features within extended arcs to constrain galaxy-scale lens models before securing them with extended arc modeling.

### 123) [2402.18052](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18052v3): Galaxy clustering at cosmic dawn from JWST/NIRCam observations to redshift z~11

<p> Nicolò Dalmasso, Nicha Leethochawalit, Michele Trenti, Kristan Boyett </p>
<p>
We report measurements of the galaxy two-point correlation function at cosmic dawn, using photometrically-selected sources from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). The JWST/NIRCam dataset comprises approximately N_g ~eq 7000 photometrically-selected Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs), spanning in the redshift range 5\leq z&lt;11. The primary objective of this study is to extend clustering measurements beyond redshift z&gt;10, finding a galaxy bias b=9.6\pm1.7 for the sample at \overline{z} = 10.6. The result suggests that the observed sources are hosted by dark matter halos of approximately M_{h}~ 10^{10.6}~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}, in broad agreement with theoretical and numerical modelling of early galaxy formation during the epoch of reionization. Furthermore, the JWST JADES dataset enables an unprecedented investigation of clustering of dwarf galaxies two orders of magnitude fainter than the characteristic L_* luminosity (i.e. with M_{F200W}~eq-15.8) during the late stages of the epoch of reionization at z~ 6. By analyzing clustering as a function of luminosity, we find that b(M_{F200W}) aligns with previous results for brighter galaxies and then decreases with M_{F200W}, as theoretically expected for fainter candidates. These initial results demonstrate the potential for further quantitative characterisation of the interplay between assembly of dark matter and light during cosmic dawn that the growing samples of JWST observations are enabling.

<p>
Extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) exhibit large equivalent widths (EW) in their rest-optical emission lines ([OIII]\lambda5007 or H\alpha rest-frame EW &gt; 750\r{A}) which can be tied to a recent upturn in star formation rate, due to the sensitivity of the nebular line emission and the rest-optical continuum to young (&lt;10Myr) and evolved stellar populations, respectively. By studying a sample of 85 star forming galaxies (SFGs), spanning the redshift and magnitude interval 3 &lt;z&lt;9.5 and -16&gt; M_{UV}&gt;-21, in the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) with NIRSpec/prism spectroscopy, we determine that SFGs initiate an EELG phase when entering a significant burst of star formation, with the highest EWs observed in EELGs with the youngest luminosity-weighted ages (&lt;5 Myr old) and the highest burst intensity (those with the greatest excess between their current and long-term average SFR). We spectroscopically confirm that a greater proportion of SFGs are in an EELG phase at high redshift in our UV-selected sample (61\pm4&percnt; in our z&gt;5.7 high-redshift bin, compared to 23^{+4}_{-1}&percnt; in our lowest-redshift bin 3&lt;z&lt;4.1) due to the combined evolution of metallicity, ionisation parameter and star formation histories with redshift. We report that the EELGs within our sample exhibit a higher average ionisation efficiency (\log_{10}(\xi_{ion}^{HII}/erg^{-1}Hz)=25.5\pm0.2) than the non-EELGs. High-redshift EELGs therefore comprise a population of efficient ionising photon producers. Additionally, we report that 53&percnt; (9/17) of EELGs at z&gt;5.7 have observed Lyman-\alpha emission, potentially lying within large ionised regions. The high detection rate of Lyman-\alpha emitters in our EELG selection suggests that the physical conditions associated with entering an EELG phase also promote the escape of Lyman-\alpha photons.

### 125) [2310.16895](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16895v3): SPICE: the connection between cosmic reionisation and stellar feedback in the first galaxies

<p> Aniket Bhagwat, Tiago Costa, Benedetta Ciardi, Rüdiger Pakmor, Enrico Garaldi </p>
<p>
We present SPICE, a new suite of RHD cosmological simulations targeting the epoch of reionisation. The goal of these simulations is to systematically probe a variety of stellar feedback models, including "bursty" and "smooth" forms of supernova energy injection, as well as poorly-explored scenarios such as hypernova explosions and radiation pressure. Subtle differences in the behaviour of supernova feedback drive profound differences in reionisation histories, with burstier forms of feedback causing earlier reionisation. We also find that some global galaxy properties, such as the dust-attenuated luminosity functions and star formation main sequence, remain degenerate between models. Stellar feedback and its strength determine the morphological mix of galaxies emerging by z = 5 and that the reionisation history is inextricably connected to intrinsic properties such as galaxy kinematics and morphology. While star-forming, massive disks are prevalent if supernova feedback is "smooth", "bursty" feedback preferentially generates dispersion-dominated systems. Different modes of feedback produce different strengths of outflows, altering the ISM/CGM in different ways, and in turn strongly affecting the escape of LyC photons. We establish a correlation between galaxy morphology and LyC escape fraction, revealing that dispersion-dominated systems have escape fractions 10-50 times higher than their rotation-dominated counterparts at all redshifts. Dispersion-dominated systems should thus preferentially generate large HII regions as compared to their rotation-dominated counterparts. Since dispersion-dominated systems are more prevalent if stellar feedback is more explosive, reionisation occurs earlier in our simulation with burstier feedback. Statistical samples of post-reionisation galaxy morphologies probed with JWST, ALMA and MUSE can constrain stellar feedback and models of cosmic reionisation.

<p> Simeon Bird, Chia-Feng Chang, Yanou Cui, Daneng Yang </p>
<p>
We demonstrate that enhanced early galaxy formation can generically arise in axion-like particle (ALP) dark matter (DM) models with a delayed onset of axion field oscillation. In these models, the formation of localized massive objects enhances structure formation, potentially addressing the excess recently observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), while remaining consistent with existing constraints. We identify viable parameter space with the ALP mass in the range of 10^{-22}~{\rm eV}&lt;m_a&lt;10^{-19}~\rm eV. In addition, we show that the ALP parameter regions of interest can lead to intriguing complementary signatures in the small-scale structure of DM halos and existing experimental searches for ALPs.

We present a spatially resolved study of stellar populations in 6 galaxies with stellar masses M_*~10^{10}M_\odot at z~3.7 using 14-filter JWST/NIRCam imaging from the JADES and JEMS surveys. The 6 galaxies are visually selected to have clumpy substructures with distinct colors over rest-frame 3600-4100\r{A}, including a red, dominant stellar core that is close to their stellar-light centroids. With 23-filter photometry from HST to JWST, we measure the stellar-population properties of individual structural components via SED fitting using Prospector. We find that the central stellar cores are \gtrsim2 times more massive than the Toomre mass, indicating they may not form via single in-situ fragmentation. The stellar cores have stellar ages of 0.4-0.7 Gyr that are similar to the timescale of clump inward migration due to dynamical friction, suggesting that they likely instead formed through the coalescence of giant stellar clumps. While they have not yet quenched, the 6 galaxies are below the star-forming main sequence by 0.2-0.7 dex. Within each galaxy, we find that the specific star formation rate is lower in the central stellar core, and the stellar-mass surface density of the core is already similar to quenched galaxies of the same masses and redshifts. Meanwhile, the stellar ages of the cores are either comparable to or younger than the extended, smooth parts of the galaxies. Our findings are consistent with model predictions of the gas-rich compaction scenario for the buildup of galaxies' central regions at high redshifts. We are likely witnessing the coeval formation of dense central cores, along with the onset of galaxy-wide quenching at z&gt;3.

### 128) [2207.02143](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02143v3): Dark Energy Black Holes with Intermediate Masses at High Redshifts: an earlier generation of Quasars and observations

<p> Anupam Singh </p>
<p>
Dark Energy is the largest fraction of the energy density of our Universe - yet it remains one of the enduring enigmas of our times. Here we show that Dark Energy can be used to solve 2 tantalizing mysteries of the observable universe. We build on existing models of Dark Energy linked to neutrino masses. In these models Dark Energy can undergo Phase Transitions and form Black Holes. Here we look at the implications of the family structure of neutrinos for the phase transitions in dark energy and associated peaks in black hole formation. It has been previously shown that one of these peaks in Black Hole formation is associated with the observed peak in Quasar formation. Here, we predict that there will also be an earlier peak in the Dark Energy Black Holes at high redshifts. These Dark Energy Black Holes formed at high redshifts are Intermediate Mass Black Holes (IMBHs).These Dark Energy Black Holes at large redshift can help explain both the EDGES observations and the observations of large Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs) at redshifts z ~ 7. The existence of an earlier phase of Dark Energy Black Holes take care of some current challenges to theory implied by existing astronomical data and also helps us look for these Dark Energy Black Holes at high redshifts as predicted here through targeted searches for these Black Holes at the redshifts z ~ 18. There is a slight dependence of the location of the peak on the lightest neutrino mass - so the peak may be located at a slightly lower value of the redshift. This may actually enable a measurement of the lightest neutrino mass. Finding these Dark Energy Black Holes of Intermediate Mass should be within the reach of upcoming observations - particularly with the James Webb Space Telescope - but perhaps also through the use of other innovative techniques focusing specifically on the redshifts around z ~ 18.
