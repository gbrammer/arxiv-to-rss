<p>
We use JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging acquired by the Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic Star clusTers (FEAST) program along with archival HST imaging to map ionized gas (Paα, Brα, and Hα) and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission (3.3 and 7.7 μm) across a sample of four nearby galaxies (NGC 5194, 5236, 628, and 4449). These maps are utilized to calibrate the PAH features as star formation rate (SFR) indicators in 40 pc size regions around massive emerging young star clusters (eYSCs). We find a tight, sub-linear (power-law exponent, α  ~  0.8) relation between the PAH luminosities (3.3 and 7.7 μm) and SFR (extinction corrected Paα) in near solar metallicity environments. PAH destruction in more intense ionizing environments and/or variations in the age of our sources may drive the deviation from a linear relation. In the metal-poor environment of NGC 4449 (~1/3 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>), we see substantial deficits in the PAH feature strengths at fixed SFR and significantly higher scatter in the PAH-SFR relations. We determine that the 3.3/7.7 μm PAH luminosity ratio increases towards lower metallicity environments. This is interpreted as a result of a shift in the size distribution towards smaller PAHs at lower metallicities, possibly due to inhibited grain growth. Focusing on the regions in NGC 4449, we observe a decreasing 3.3/7.7 μm ratio towards higher SFR, which could indicate that small PAHs are preferentially destroyed relative to larger PAHs in significantly sub-solar metallicity conditions. We estimate that ~2/3 of the PAH emission in typical local star-forming galaxies is excited by older stars and unrelated to recent (&lt;10 Myr) star formation.

### 2) [2511.05647](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05647v1): Not all protoclusters host evolved galaxies: Evidence for reduced environmental effects in a lower halo mass protocluster at z = 7.66

<p>
The progenitors of present-day galaxy clusters offer crucial insight into how galaxies and large-scale structure co-evolve in the early Universe. We present JWST/NIRCam grism spectroscopy of the photometrically identified z=7.66 protocluster core in the SMACS J0723.3-7327 lensing field, SMACS-PC-z7p7. Six [O III]-emitters and five additional photometric candidates are found within a 0.3 arcmin<sup>2</sup> (1.5 cMpc^2) region, corresponding to an overdensity of δ~ 200. Despite the extreme overdensity, the resident galaxies exhibit star-formation histories, UV-slopes and neutral hydrogen column densities that are consistent with those of field galaxies at similar redshifts. This is in stark contrast with the consistently high neutral hydrogen column densities, old stellar populations and large dust masses of galaxies within a z=7.88 protocluster in the Abell 2744 field. Comparison with the TNG-Cluster and TNG300 simulations indicates a halo mass of log_10(M_200c[M<sub>&odot;</sub>]) = 11.4±0.2, and implies that, on average, SMACS-PC-z7p7 will evolve into a present-day Fornax-like cluster (log_10(M_200c, z=0[M<sub>&odot;</sub>]) = 13.7±0.6). The uniformly young, highly star-forming nature of the galaxy population of SMACS-PC-z7p7 suggests that environmental effects only become significant above halo masses of log_10(M_200c[M<sub>&odot;</sub>]) ≳ 11.5. Comparison to other z≳7 protoclusters reveals that vigorous star formation persists in lower-mass protoclusters, whereas accelerated evolution and suppression of star formation emerge in more massive haloes. SMACS-PC-z7p7 therefore represents an early stage of protocluster assembly, where residence within an overdense environment still enhances star formation, and feedback processes have yet to exert a significant influence.

### 3) [2511.05259](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05259v1): The stellar mass function of quiescent and star-forming galaxies and its dependence on morphology in COSMOS-Web

Sanders, Greta Toni, Laurence Tresse, Andrea Weibel, John R. Weaver, Lilan Yang </p>
<p>
We study the stellar mass function (SMF) of quiescent and star-forming galaxies and its dependence on morphology in 10 redshift bins at 0.2&lt;z&lt;5.5 using the COSMOS2025 catalog built from 0.54   deg<sup>2</sup> JWST imaging from COSMOS-Web. Galaxies are selected by type using the NUVrJ rest-frame color diagram and classified morphologically by bulge-to-total light ratio (B/T). The quiescent SMF shows rapid early build-up, with the most massive systems (log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≳11) assembled by z~1 and evolving little since. The star-forming SMF evolves more slowly, following a mass-evolution scenario where galaxies grow via star formation and quench at the characteristic mass log(M^*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)~10.6. Bulge systems (B/T&gt;0.6) dominate the quiescent SMF at log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&gt;10 at all redshifts, while disks (B/T&lt;0.2) dominate at log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;9. However, most bulge-dominated galaxies are star-forming, with their fraction increasing with redshift and decreasing mass, consistent with being progenitors of quiescent bulges. We find evidence for environmental quenching onset at z~3 from the upturn in the quiescent SMF at log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;9.5, contributed by disk-dominated galaxies consistent with satellite quenching that retains disk morphologies. Number densities of log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&gt;10 quiescent galaxies are lower than recent literature by 0.1-0.7 dex, but agree well with simulations at 2&lt;z&lt;3. At z&gt;3, simulations increasingly underpredict observations. Finally, we build an empirical model describing galaxy number density evolution by parametrizing quenching rates, baryon conversion efficiency, and bulge formation. Our model supports a scenario where star-forming galaxies grow central bulges before quenching in massive halos.

### 4) [2511.03681](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03681v1): Only Nitrogen-Enhanced Galaxies Have Detectable UV Nitrogen Emission Lines at High Redshift

<p> Peixin Zhu, Lisa J. Kewley, Tiger Yu-Yang Hsiao, James Trussler </p>
<p>
The detections of bright UV nitrogen emission lines in some high-redshift galaxies suggest unexpectedly high nitrogen-to-oxygen ratios (log(N/O)≳-1.0) compared to local values (log(N/O)≳-1.5) at similar metallicities (12+log(O/H)≲8.0). Although the presence of these `N-enhanced' galaxies indicates signatures of atypical chemical enrichment processes in the early universe, the prevalence of nitrogen enhancement in high-z galaxies is unclear. So far, only ~10 z&gt;5 galaxies have nitrogen abundance measurements, and they all suggest elevated N/O ratios. Do all high-redshift galaxies exhibit elevated N/O ratios, or are we simply missing `N-normal' galaxies whose nitrogen abundances follow the local N/O scaling relation? To tackle these questions, we calculate the detection limits of UV NIII] or NIV] lines in current JWST surveys CEERS and JADES, and compare them to predictions from both `N-enhanced' and `N-normal' AGN narrow-line region and H II region photoionization models. We find that CEERS can only detect galaxies with significant nitrogen enhancement (log(N/O)≳-0.4), while JADES can only detect galaxies with moderately elevated N/O ratios compared to local values (log(N/O)≳-1.0). Even for the deepest exposure in JADES, UV nitrogen lines produced by `N-normal' galaxies at z&gt;5 are too faint and thus not detectable, making their nitrogen abundance unmeasurable. Our results suggest that the existing sample of galaxies with measurable nitrogen abundances at z≳5 is incomplete and biased toward galaxies with significantly elevated N/O ratios. Deep (t_exp~40-500 hours) spectroscopic surveys will be crucial for building a complete sample to study nitrogen enrichment mechanisms in the early universe.

### 5) [2511.02902](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02902v1): A close look at the black hole masses and hot dusty toruses of the first quasars with MIRI-MRS

<p>
The presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs, M_BH~10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) at z&gt;7 remains a puzzle. While their existence appears to require exotic formation or growth processes, it is possible that BH mass estimates are incorrect due to differences from the low-z quasars where BH mass scaling relations are calibrated. In this work, we employ JWST MIRI-MRS spectroscopy to measure the rest-frame optical/IR properties of the four highest-redshift known luminous type-1 quasars at 7.08≤ z&lt;7.64. We use three new broad lines to measure updated BH masses, Hα, Paα and Paβ, finding them to be in the range (4-15)\cdot10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Our black hole mass estimates from all tracers agree with each other and with previous, less accurate, ground-based measurements based on MgII. The flux ratios of the H lines deviate from expectations for case A and B recombination in the same way as in z&lt;3 quasars, indicating similar physical conditions in the Broad Line Region. Rest-frame near-IR continuum emission from a hot dusty torus surrounding the accretion disc is unambiguously detected in all four objects. We model the emission with SKIRTOR and constrain the inclination (face-on) and the opening angle (θ=40-60&deg;) of the tori. These constraints are consistent for the four objects and with expectations from luminous quasars. We estimate a total dust mass (1-4)\cdot10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> in the tori, corresponding to (0.2-7)&percnt; of the total dust in the quasar host galaxies. Given observed accretion rates, these SMBHs will deplete their tori in only ~5 Myr. Overall, we confirm that z&gt;7 SMBHs in quasars could not have grown from stellar-remnant BHs if the radiative efficiency of accretion is 10&percnt;. We also find no evidence that inferred BH masses and accretion processes in z&gt;7 quasars differ significantly from their near-identical counterparts at z&lt;3.

<p>
We present an analysis of the gas-phase mass-metallicity relationship (MZR) and fundamental metallicity relationship (FMR) for 65 star-forming galaxies at 2 &lt; z &lt; 8 from the JWST/EXCELS survey. We calculate gas-phase metallicities (12 + log(O/H)) using strong-line calibrations explicitly tested against the EXCELS sample, and report direct-method metallicities for 25 galaxies. Our sample spans 8.1&lt;log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;10.3 in stellar mass and 0&lt;log(SFR/M<sub>&odot;</sub>   yr^-1)&lt;2 in star-formation rate, consistent with typical main-sequence star-forming galaxies at the same redshifts. We find a clear MZR at both 2&lt;z&lt;4 (&langle; z &rangle; = 3.2) and 4&lt;z&lt;8 (&langle; z &rangle; = 5.5), with consistent slopes and mild evolution in normalization of ≃ 0.1   dex, matching trends from simulations and recent observations. Our results demonstrate rapid gas-phase enrichment in the early Universe, with galaxies at fixed mass reaching ≃ 50 per cent of their present-day metallicity by z ≃ 3 (within the first ≃ 15 per cent of cosmic time). We find tentative evidence for SFR-dependence in the MZR scatter, though the results remain inconclusive and highlight the need for larger high-redshift samples. Comparison with locally derived FMRs reveals a clear offset consistent with other z &gt; 3 studies. We discuss potential drivers of this offset, noting that high-redshift samples have significantly different physical properties compared to local samples used to define the z=0 FMR. Our results confirm that low-mass, high specific star-formation rate galaxies common at high redshift are inconsistent with the equilibrium conditions underlying the local FMR, and highlight the rapid chemical enrichment at early cosmic epochs.

At low redshift, massive quiescent galaxies (MQGs) are most frequently found in massive, rich galaxy clusters, but at high redshift the trend is less clear. Here, we present spectroscopic evidence of the effects of environment on the formation and assembly of high-redshift MQGs. We identify 25 (5) log (M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>≥10.5 (10.0≤log (M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>&lt;10.5) spectroscopically-confirmed quiescent galaxies in the UDS and EGS fields at 3&lt;z&lt;5 with NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy from RUBIES and other public JWST NIRSpec programs. We measure the density contrast in these fields by applying a Monte Carlo Voronoi Tesselation density mapping technique to photometric and spectroscopic redshifts of m_F444W&lt;27.5 sources. We robustly detect 12 massive overdense peaks with log (M_Peak/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≥13 and six extended massive protoclusters (log (M_Struct/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≥13.85). We observe that MQGs are preferentially found in these massive peaks and within these massive structures: ≈50&percnt; of MQGs are found in massive peaks, compared to ≈20&percnt; of massive star forming galaxies (MSFGs) and ≈15&percnt; of the overall spectroscopically-confirmed population. We also find an apparent dependence on both quiescent galaxy mass and environment, with 75&percnt; of the most massive (log (M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>≥10.75) residing inside overdense peaks. We compare the star formation histories (SFHs) of the MQGs with the high-redshift galaxy stellar mass function from observations and simulated quiescent galaxies at z&gt;5, finding that the masses from the inferred MQG SFHs regularly exceed either observed or simulated high-redshift galaxies, which suggests indicates that mergers and ex-situ star formation play a key role in the mass assembly of MQGs in overdense environments.

### 8) [2510.23220](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23220v1): Using Type-II Cepheids as Extragalactic Standard Candles: Distances to M31

<p> V. D. Pipwala, H. N. Lala, B. Lemasle, E. K. Grebel, G. Bono, G. Fiorentino </p>
<p>
Several standard candles have been tested and used to measure accurate extragalactic distances over the past decades. There have been discussions regarding the possibility of using Type-II Cepheids (T2Cs) as an alternative tool, but rarely was this ever implemented. The aim of this project is to assert the use of T2Cs as a new avenue for calibrating the extragalactic distance scale, by using M31 as a benchmark galaxy. Since Ordinary Least Squares regression methods are not immune to outliers and offer an incomplete treatment of the uncertainties, we favor a Bayesian robust regression model to compute new Period&ndash;Luminosity (PL) and Period&ndash;Wesenheit (PW) relations calibrated using ~100 T2Cs, ~1000 fundamental-mode and ~750 first-overtone classical Cepheids (CCs) in the LMC. Using these relations, we employ a classification routine based on Bhattacharyya distances to filter out any contaminants from the M31 sample. We validate our method by verifying that we retrieve an accurate distance for the LMC. We find a distance to M31 of 24.487±0.001 (statistical) ±0.052 (systematic) mag using CCs and of 24.409±0.025 (statistical) ±0.156 (systematic) mag using T2Cs. Both values are in excellent agreement with literature values derived from meta-analyses, from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of CCs, from the Tip of the Red Giant Branch method, and from HST observations of RR Lyrae. In almost all cases, we reach a relative accuracy better than 98&percnt;, although the archival ground-based data we use cannot compare with HST photometry. We demonstrate that T2Cs can also be used as accurate tracers for determining extragalactic distances, thereby making them excellent candidates for JWST, LSST, and ELT observations. These stars allow us to probe galaxies deprived of young populations and are beyond the reach of the fainter RR Lyrae.

<p>
We present an analysis of the rest frame optical JWST NIRSpec Fixed Slit spectra of extended host galaxy emission in 12 quasars from the Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) sample at redshifts 6.0 &lt; z &lt; 6.4. The spatial point spread function is modeled primarily by a sum of two Gaussians as a function of wavelength and is used to fit and subtract the quasar from the 2D spectra, leaving only extended galaxy emission which we analyze. Ten of 12 systems show spatially extended line emission and five of 12 systems show an extended stellar continuum. From the extended [OIII]5008 emission line, we measure a 132 ± 19 km/s ionized outflow in one system and 52 ± 12 km/s rotation, suggesting a coherent disk, in another. From the extended narrow Hα emission, which we hypothesize is ionized by star-forming regions rather than the quasar, we measure star formation rates ranging from ~ 7 to 111 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr, the majority of which are consistent with the star-forming main sequence at z ≈ 6. The positions of our host galaxies on the log10[OIII]5008/Hβ vs. log10[NII]6584/Hα (R3N2) Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram indicate ionization rates typical of AGN activity in the low-redshift universe, but are consistent with the placement of similar z ≈ 6 quasar host galaxies, suggesting that the R3N2 line ratios cannot distinguish AGN and star-formation powered line emission at high redshifts. We conclude from the consistency between our quasar host sample with z ~ 6 galaxies that the presence of a low-luminosity AGN causes little significant change in the properties of galaxies at z ≈ 6 on 10 Myr timescales.

### 10) [2510.19959](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19959v1): Rapid, out of equilibrium metal enrichment indicated by a flat mass-metallicity relation at z~6 from NIRCam grism spectroscopy

<p>
We aim to characterise the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and the 3D correlation between stellar mass, metallicity and star-formation rate (SFR) known as the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) for galaxies at 5&lt;z&lt;7. Using ~800 [O III] selected galaxies from deep NIRCam grism surveys, we present our stacked measurements of direct-T_e metallicities, which we use to test recent strong-line metallicity calibrations. Our measured direct-T_e metallicities (0.1-0.2 Z<sub>&odot;</sub> for M<sub>&sext;</sub> ≈5×10^7-9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, respectively) match recent JWST/NIRSpec-based results. However, there are significant inconsistencies between observations and hydrodynamical simulations. We observe a flatter MZR slope than the SPHINX^20 and FLARES simulations, which cannot be attributed to selection effects. With simple models, we show that the effect of an [O III] flux-limited sample on the observed shape of the MZR is strongly dependent on the FMR. If the FMR is similar to the one in the local Universe, the intrinsic high-redshift MZR should be even flatter than observed. In turn, a 3D relation where SFR correlates positively with metallicity at fixed mass would imply an intrinsically steeper MZR. Our measurements indicate that metallicity variations at fixed mass show little dependence on the SFR, suggesting a flat intrinsic MZR. This could indicate that the low-mass galaxies at these redshifts are out of equilibrium and that metal enrichment occurs rapidly in low-mass galaxies. However, being limited by our stacking analysis, we are yet to probe the scatter in the MZR and its dependence on SFR. Large carefully selected samples of galaxies with robust metallicity measurements can put tight constraints on the high-redshift FMR and, help to understand the interplay between gas flows, star formation and feedback in early galaxies.

Characterizing dust attenuation is crucial for revealing the intrinsic physical properties of galaxies. We present an analysis of dust attenuation in 18 spectroscopically confirmed star-forming main-sequence galaxies at z = 4.4-5.7 observed with JWST/NIRSpec IFU and NIRCam, selected from the ALPINE and CRISTAL ALMA large programs. We fit the emission line fluxes from NIRSpec and the broad-band photometry from NIRCam with Prospector, using both spatially integrated emission and ~0.6 kpc pixel-by-pixel measurements. We derive the stellar-to-nebular dust attenuation ratio (f=E(B-V)_star/E(B-V)_neb) from the SED fits and the Balmer decrement with Hα and Hβ. Although individual galaxies show large scatter, the best-fit value is f = 0.51^+0.04_-0.03, slightly higher than that measured for local starburst galaxies. We find weak correlations of f with galaxy properties, increasing with higher specific star-formation rates, younger stellar ages, and more recent star-formation. For the range of E(B-V)_star = 0.009-0.15 mag for in our sample, assuming f = 1 (often adopted in high-redshift studies) instead of f = 0.51 underestimate line luminosities and ionizing photon production efficiency ξ<sub>ion</sub> by ~3-36&percnt; and ~4-46&percnt;, respectively. We also find that the total stellar masses estimated from spatially-integrated SED fits with a delayed-τ star-formation histories are systematically smaller than the sum of pixel-by-pixel SED fits, with a median offset of ~ 0.26 dex, likely because the integrated fits are biased toward luminous young stellar populations.

### 12) [2510.15024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15024v1): An Investigation into the Low-Mass Fundamental Metallicity Relation in the Local and High-z Universe

<p> Isaac H. Laseter, Michael V. Maseda, Andrew J. Bunker, Alex J. Cameron, Mirko Curti, Charlotte Simmonds </p>
<p>
Recent JWST/NIRSpec observations have revealed high-z star-forming galaxies depart from the Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR), yet the z = 0 FMR has not been well-characterized in the low-mass regime (log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≲ 9) for an appropriate comparison of low- and high-z systems. We attempt to rectify this limitation through a meta-analysis, providing a local, observational comparison for future high-z FMR studies. We analyzed common FMR fitting methods for ~ 700 [OIII]λ4363 emitters with log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≲ 9 at z ~ 0. We find no evidence of the FMR below log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≲ 9 through any method, suggesting that slowly-evolving, quasi-steady state gas reservoirs are not yet established. We simultaneously find a weak positive correlation between metallicity and star formation, and that these systems are gas-rich with substantial diversity in effective yields (y_eff) spanning ~ 3~dex. We demonstrate increasing y_eff correlates with decreasing FMR offsets, which in the context of the analytical and non-equilibrium gas models of Dalcanton et al. (2007), indicates a scenario where star formation bursts rapidly return and eject metals from the ISM before subsequent gas-balancing. Pristine infall diluting the ISM metal-content cannot lead to the y_eff diversity we measure, and thus is not the primary process behind FMR deviations. Our results suggest low-M<sub>&sext;</sub> systems, regardless of redshift, depart from a steady-state gas reservoir shaping the canonical FMR, in which metallicity variations are primarily driven by star formation and enriched outflows. With this characterization, we demonstrate z ≳ 3 [OIII]λ4363 systems are indeed more metal-poor than z ~ 0 counterparts (Δ12+log(O/H) = 0.3~dex) at fixed M<sub>&sext;</sub>.

JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopy enables dynamical mass measurements for typical star-forming galaxies only a billion years after the Big Bang. We model the Hα morpho-kinematics of 163 galaxies at redshift z≈4-6 from FRESCO and CONGRESS (with JADES imaging), using the ttgeko code, and infer rotational velocities and dispersions within r_e. Our sample spans log M<sub>&sext;</sub>≈7-10 and log M_dyn≈9-11. Gas masses are estimated via scaling relations, yielding baryonic masses and dark-matter (DM) fractions f_DM(r&lt;r_e) within the Hα half-light radius. We find high median fractions of &langle; f_gas&rangle;=0.77 and &langle; f_DM&rangle;=0.73, where f_gas is measured with respect to the baryonic mass and f_DM with respect to the DM+baryonic mass. About two-thirds of systems are DM-dominated within r_e~0.5-1 kpc. Both f_gas and f_DM decrease with stellar mass, consistent with simulations. The stellar Tully-Fisher relation shows a tentative offset to higher v_circ at fixed M<sub>&sext;</sub> and substantial intrinsic scatter, suggesting that the relation is only beginning to emerge at z~5. We measure a negative correlation between f_DM and baryonic surface density Σ_bar, weaker but broadly consistent with trends at cosmic noon and at z~0. Qualitatively comparing with modified NFW profiles coupled to an empirical stellar-to-halo mass relation suggests that the lowest f_DM (≲0.4) require cored inner DM profiles, while the highest fractions favour cuspier profiles, potentially reflecting adiabatic contraction. Overall, the elevated f_gas and f_DM at z≳4 are compatible with progenitors of baryon-dominated systems at z~2 and naturally anticipate overmassive black holes at fixed M<sub>&sext;</sub>.

<p>
We present JWST/NIRSpec dense-shutter spectroscopy (DSS). This novel observing strategy with the NIRSpec micro-shutter assembly (MSA) deliberately permits a high number of controlled spectral overlaps to reach extreme multiplex while retaining the low background of slit spectroscopy. In a single configuration over the JADES Origins Field we opened shutters on all faint (F444W&lt;30 mag) z<sub>phot</sub>&gt;3 candidates in the MSA, prioritising emission-line science and rejecting only bright continuum sources. Using 33.6 and 35.8 ks on-source in G235M and G395M, we observed a single mask with ~850 sources, obtaining secure spectroscopic redshifts for ~540 galaxies over 2.5&lt;z&lt;8.9. The per-configuration target density in DSS mode is 4-5x higher than standard no- and low-overlap MSA strategies (&lt;200 sources), with no loss in redshift precision or accuracy. Line-flux sensitivities are 30 percent lower at fixed exposure time, matching the expected increase in background noise, but the gain in survey speed is 5x in our setup, more than justifying the penalty. The measured line sensitivity exceeds NIRCam WFSS by a minimum factor of ~5 (i.e. ~25 in exposure time) at λ~4 μm, demonstrating that controlled overlap is a compelling method to gain deep, wide-band spectra for large samples. Crucially, we envisage the MSA could deliver even higher target allocation densities than what used here. We derive Balmer-line based SFRs, gas-phase metallicities (including a large sample suitable for strong-line calibrations), and identify rare sources (mini-quenched systems and broad-line AGN). This approach is immediately applicable wherever deep imaging enables robust pre-selection and astrometry, providing an efficient method to obtain large samples of faint emission-line galaxies, a compelling middle ground between the completeness of slitless surveys and the sensitivity and bandwidth of NIRSpec/MSA.

We present spatially resolved rest-optical spectroscopy of 38 star-forming galaxies at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.7 from the JWST/NIRSpec MSA-3D survey, which uses slit-stepping to build IFU-like datacubes at 0.1'' resolution. We map emission-line morphology, excitation, and kinematics of the warm ionized gas using [N II]/Hα, [S II]/Hα, and [O III]/Hβ. Relative to z~0 galaxies at fixed stellar mass, our sources show systematically lower [N II]/Hα and [S II]/Hα and elevated [O III]/Hβ, consistent with harder radiation fields and lower metallicities. Radially, [O III]/Hβ profiles are typically flat or mildly positive, whereas [N II]/Hα also remains flat or declines outward, mirroring metallicity trends. On kpc scales, we find a strong positive correlation between [N II]/Hα and velocity dispersion (σ), linking local excitation to turbulent or shock-driven kinematics. Six galaxies (~ 16% of the sample) host spatially localized regions with elevated [N II]/Hα, high EW(Hα), and V_RMS = \sqrtV^2 + σ^2 &gt; 200 km/s, indicative of weak AGN activity, shocks, or outflows. For these candidates we infer modest warm-ionized outflow rates of 1-4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr and kinetic powers ~ 0.1-1% of the AGN bolometric luminosity (from central [O III] or Hα). These values place our sample at the low-energy tail of known AGN-driven outflows yet in continuity with M&#775;_out-L_AGN scaling relations across 0 &lt; z &lt; 6. A completeness assessment shows MSA-3D is sensitive to AGN with L_AGN ≥ 10^43 erg/s, underscoring both the promise and current limitations of detecting weak AGN activity in distant galaxies with resolved spectroscopy.

### 16) [2510.07407](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07407v1): The evolution of the bar fraction and bar lengths in the last 12 billion years

We investigate the evolution of the bar fraction and length using an extended JWST NIRCam imaging dataset of galaxies in the 1 ≤ z ≤ 4 redshift range. We assess the wavelength dependence of the bar fraction in disc galaxies and bar length evolution by selecting a nearly mass-complete CEERS disc sample and performing independent visual classifications on the short (F200W) and long (F356W+F444W) wavelength channels. A similar bar fraction is observed for both samples, and combined we find a declining trend in the bar fraction: 0.16^+0.03_-0.03 at 1 ≤ z &lt; 2; 0.08^+0.02_-0.01 at 2 ≤ z &lt; 3; 0.07^+0.03_-0.01 at 3 ≤ z ≤ 4. This corroborates our previous work and other recent studies, suggesting that dynamically cold and rotationally supported massive discs are present at Cosmic Noon. No evolution in the F356W+F444W bar length is measured from z = 4 to z = 1, which has a mean of 3.6 kpc, but a slight increase of about 1 kpc towards z = 1 is measured in the F200W sample, which has a mean of 2.9 kpc. The bar sample is shorter in the short-wavelength channel due to the better physical spatial resolution; however, we also suggest that dust obscuration plays a role. We find that the correlation between bar length and galaxy mass for massive galaxies observed at z &lt; 1 is not seen at z &gt; 1. By adding samples of barred galaxies at z&lt;1, we show that there is a modest increase in the bar length (≈ 2 kpc) towards z=0, but bars longer than ≈8 kpc are only found at z&lt;1. We show that bars and discs grow in tandem, for the bar length normalised by disc size does not evolve from z = 4 to z = 0. Not only is a significant population of bars forming beyond z = 1, but our results also show that some of these bars are as long and strong as the average bar at z≈0.

<p>
We present results of Pop. III formation in the MEGATRON suite of simulations, which self-consistently follows radiation and non-equilibrium chemistry, and resolves gas at near-pc resolution of a Milky Way-mass halo at Cosmic Dawn. While the very first Pop. III stars form in halos with masses well below the atomic cooling limit, whose cooling is dominated by molecular hydrogen, the majority of Pop. III stars form in more massive systems above the 10^4~K atomic cooling threshold. The shift in cooling regime of halos hosting new Pop. III stars occurs within 100 Myr of the first Pop. III star as the Lyman-Werner (LW) background rapidly increases to 10^-21 erg s<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> Hz^-1 sr^-1. We find that the global Pop. III star formation rate stabilizes to a value of 10^-3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1 at z=20. Among the three processes that quench Pop. III star formation in mini-halos, the LW background, gas starvation, and external chemical enrichment, the LW background is most important. A small fraction of haloes undergo multiple episodes of Pop. III star formation when the earlier forming stars all directly collapse to black holes. If the halos become massive enough, they can form up to ~100 Pop. III stars in a single burst, which may be observable by JWST with moderate gravitational lensing. Pop. III stars form at a wide range of distances from UV-bright galaxies, with only 0.06&percnt; of Pop. III stars forming within the virial radius of galaxies with M_UV &lt; -17. Finally, by tracking Pop. III star remnants down to z=0, we find that 75-80 % reside in the stellar halo of our simulated Milky Way analogue, while the remainder are gravitationally bound to lower-mass systems, including satellite halos.

### 18) [2510.06362](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06362v1): Evidence of violation of Case B recombination in Little Red Dots

<p> G. P. Nikopoulos, D. Watson, A. Sneppen, V. Rusakov, K. E. Heintz, J. Witstok, G. Brammer </p>
<p>
Little Red Dots (LRDs) are a new class of compact extragalactic objects, with a v-shaped optical spectral energy distribution breaking close to the Balmer break wavelength, and broad, typically exponentially-shaped lines. They are believed to be supermassive black holes surrounded by very dense, ionized gas, leading us to explore for any departures from Case B recombination by examining the ratios of multiple hydrogen Balmer lines: Hα, Hβ, Hγ, and Hδ. We analyze a dozen high-S/N LRDs with JWST/NIRSpec, measuring Balmer ratios in the seven objects with coverage of at least three lines. We decompose the line ratios into their respective broad and narrow components. Broad line ratios are consistent with Case B plus dust extinction in all objects but one, RUBIES EGS-49140, which departs from Case B expectations by more than 5σ. The narrow components are consistent with minimal dust attenuation, while two objects exhibit narrow Hα/Hβ≈ 1.8. Such low decrements are observed in highly ionized density bounded nebulae, associated with starburst environments. Nevertheless, both flat decrement cases can be reconciled assuming an unresolved absorption feature. RUBIES EGS-49140, shows a high broad Hα/Hβ, but Hγ/Hα and Hδ/Hα ratios are lower than expected for extinction-modified Case B, hinting at an unphysically steep dust law. These line ratios may be due to increased optical depth in the Balmer lines, as a direct effect of high density (logn_e &gt; 9) gas surrounding the black hole. If Case B recombination does hold in most LRDs, they must be moderate-to-heavily dust obscured (A_V≃1-8) while the host-galaxy should be dust-free, suggesting that the extinction in the broad lines is local to the LRD and not due to the general ISM of the host galaxy.

<p>
We use the ultra-deep GLIMPSE JWST/NIRCam survey to constrain the faint-end of the Hβ+[OIII]λλ4960,5008 luminosity function (LF) down to 10^39 erg/s at z=7-9 behind the lensed Hubble Frontier Field Abell S1063. We perform SED fitting on a Lyman-Break Galaxy sample, measuring combined Hβ+[OIII] fluxes to construct the emission-line LF. The resulting LF (α=-1.55 to -1.78) is flatter than the UV LF (α&lt;-2), indicating a lower number density of low Hβ+[OIII] emitters at fixed MUV. We explore three explanations: (i) bursty star formation histories reducing the Hβ+[OIII]-to-UV ratio, (ii) metallicity effects on [OIII]/Hβ, or (iii) a faint-end turnover in the UV LF. Assuming an evolving [OIII]/Hβ ratio, we derive a flatter [OIII]λ5008 LF (α=-1.45 to -1.66) and a steeper Hβ LF (α=-1.68 to -1.95). The combination of decreasing metallicity and bursty star formation can reconcile the UV and Hβ+[OIII] LF differences. Converting the LF to the ionising photon production rate, we find that galaxies with Hα flux &gt;10^39 erg/s (SFR(Hα)&gt;5×10^-3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr) contribute 21-61% and 24-104% of the ionising photon budget at 7&lt;z&lt;8 and 8&lt;z&lt;9, respectively (for f<sub>esc</sub>=0.1). The LF shape suggests faint galaxies contribute minimally to the ionising photon production rate. Our cosmic star formation rate density (CSFRD) estimates align with previous work, but GLIMPSE's sensitivity to low SFRs confirms that very faint galaxies are minor contributors to both the ionising photon production rate and the CSFRD. Our results suggest that GLIMPSE has detected the bulk of the total Hβ+[OIII] emission from star-forming galaxies, with fainter sources playing a limited role in cosmic reionisation.

<p>
Context. Edge-on disks offer a unique opportunity to directly examine their vertical structure, providing valuable insights into planet formation processes. We investigate the dust properties, as well as the CO and HCO^+ gas properties, in the edge-on disk surrounding the T Tauri star 2MASS J04202144+281349 (SSTTau042021). Aims. We estimate the radial and vertical temperature and density profile for the gas and the dust. Methods. We use ALMA archival data of CO isotopologues and continuum emission at 2, 1.3 and 0.9 mm together with new NOEMA HCO^+ 3-2 observations. We retrieve the gas and dust disk properties using the tomographic method and the scDiskFit model. Results. The vertical CO emission appears very extended, partly tracing the H<sub>2</sub> wind observed by JWST. C^18O, ^13CO and HCO^+ emission characterize the bulk of the molecular layer. The dust and gas have a mid-plane temperatures of ~ 7-11 K. The temperature of the molecular layer (derived from ^13CO and HCO^+) is on the order of 16 K. HCO^+ 3-2 being thermalized, we derive a lower limit for the H<sub>2</sub> volume density of ~ 3 × 10^6 cm^-3 at radius 100-200 au between 1 and 2 scale heights. The atmosphere temperature of the CO gas is of the order ~ 31 K at a radius of 100 au. We directly observe CO and HCO^+ gas onto the mid-plane beyond the dust outer radius (≥ 300 au). The (gas+dust) disk mass estimated up to a radius of 300 au is on the order of 4.6 × 10^-2 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Conclusions. Thanks to the favorable disk inclination, we present the first quantitative evidence for vertical molecular stratification with direct observation of CO and HCO^+ gas along the mid-plane. We estimate the temperature profile with temperature of 7-11 K near the mid-plane, and 15-20 K in the dense part of the molecular layer up to ~ 35 K above.

There is increasing observational evidence for a failed galaxy formation pathway for some ultradiffuse galaxies (UDGs) at low redshift however they currently lack simulated counterparts. We attempt to identify dark matter halos at high redshift within the MAGNETICUM cosmological simulations that could plausibly be their progenitors. We build a toy model of passive galaxy evolution within the stellar mass-halo mass relation to trace z = 0 observations of UDGs back to their z = 2 locations. We identify a population of 443 galaxies that match these parameter space positions within the simulation. We build two comparison samples within the simulation that follow the stellar mass-halo mass relationship at z = 2, one of which is stellar mass matched (with varying smaller halo masses) and the other is halo mass matched (with varying larger stellar masses) to our sample. We identify that our failed galaxy progenitor candidates have 1) flatter, cored dark matter halos; 2) more extended stellar bodies; 3) a larger fraction of their gas in the outskirts of their halos; 4) lower metallicities and 5) higher star formation rates than the control samples. Findings 1) and 2) are similar to low redshift observations of UDGs. Finding 3) will aid the removal of gas and permanent quenching of star formation which is a requirement of the failed galaxy formation scenario. The low metallicities of finding 4) match those observed in low redshift failed galaxy UDGs. Comparing the high star formation rates of finding 5) to recent JWST observations suggests that a starburst would naturally explain the high globular cluster richness of the UDGs. Many of the properties we find for these failed galaxy progenitors can be explained by an assembly bias of their dark matter halo to later formation times. We conclude by proposing that the fraction of failed galaxy UDGs is expected to increase with environmental density.

### 22) [2510.02606](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02606v1): A Mid-Infrared Spectroscopic Study of Young Stellar Objects in the SMC Region NGC 346: JWST Detects Dust, Accretion, Ices and Outflows

We present mid-infrared spectroscopic observations of intermediate- to high-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) in the low-metallicity star-forming region NGC 346 located within the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We conduct these integral-field-unit observations with the Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium Resolution Spectroscopy instrument on board JWST. The brightest and most active star-forming region in the SMC, NGC 346 has a metallicity of ~1/5 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>, analogous to the era when star formation in the early Universe (z≃2) peaked. We discuss the emission and absorption features present in the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of five YSOs with coverage from 4.9-27.9μm and three other sources with partial spectral coverage. Via SED model-fitting, we estimate their parameters, finding masses ranging from 2.9-18.0 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. These targets show dusty silicates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and ices of CO<sub>2</sub>, CO, H<sub>2</sub>O and CH_3OH in their protostellar envelopes. We measure emission from H<sub>2</sub> and atomic fine-structure lines, suggesting the presence of protostellar jets and outflows. We detect H I lines indicating ongoing accretion and estimate accretion rates for each source which range from 2.50x10^-6-2.23x10^-4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>yr^-1 based on H I (7-6) line emission. We present evidence for a ~30,000AU protostellar jet traced by fine-structure, H I and H<sub>2</sub> emission about the YSO Y535, the first detection of a resolved protostellar outflow in the SMC, and the most distant yet detected.

### 23) [2510.02517](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02517v2): Impact of AGN and nuclear star formation on the ISM turbulence of galaxies: Insights from JWST/MIRI spectroscopy

Active galactic nuclei (AGN), star formation (SF), and galaxy interactions can drive turbulence in the gas of the ISM, which in turn plays a role in the SF within galaxies. The impact on molecular gas is of particular importance, as it serves as the primary fuel for SF. Our goal is to investigate the origin of turbulence and the emission of molecular gas, as well as low- and intermediate-ionization gas, in the inner few kpc of both AGN hosts and SF galaxies. We use JWST MIRI/MRS observations of a sample consisting of 54 galaxies at z&lt;0.1. We present fluxes of the H2 S(5)6.9091, [Ar II]6.9853, [FeII]5.3403, and [Ar III]8.9914 lines, along with velocity dispersion from W80. For galaxies with coronal emission, [Mg V]5.6098 is also included. Line ratios are compared to photoionization and shock models to explore the origin of the gas emission. AGNs exhibit broader emission lines than SFGs, with the largest velocity dispersions observed in radio-strong (RS) AGNs. H2 gas is less turbulent compared to ionized gas, while coronal gas presents higher velocity dispersions. The W80 values for the ionized gas exhibits a decrease from the nucleus out to radii of approximately 0.5&ndash;1 kpc, followed by an outward increase up to 2-3 kpc. In contrast, the H2 line widths generally display increasing profiles with distance from the center. Correlations W80 and line ratios such as H2 S(5)/[ArII] and [FeII]/[ArII] indicate that the most turbulent gas is associated with shocks, enhancing H2 and [FeII] emissions. We speculate that these shocked gas regions are produced by AGN outflows and jet-cloud interactions in AGN-dominated sources, while in SFGs, they may be created by stellar winds and mergers. This shock-induced gas heating may be an important mechanism of AGN (or stellar) feedback, preventing the gas from cooling and forming new stars.

### 24) [2510.01322](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.01322v1): Heavy seeds and the first black holes: Insights from the BRAHMA simulations

<p>
From the luminous quasars at z ~ 6 to the recent z ~ 9-11 AGNs revealed by JWST, observations of the earliest black hole (BH) populations can provide unique constraints on BH formation and growth models. We use the BRAHMA simulations with constrained initial conditions to investigate BH assembly in extreme overdense regions. The simulations implement heavy seeds (~ 10^4-10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) forming in dense, metal-poor gas exposed to sufficient Lyman-Werner flux. With gas accretion modeled via Bondi-Hoyle formalism and BH dynamics and mergers using a subgrid dynamical friction scheme, we isolate the impact of seeding, dynamics, accretion, and feedback on early BH growth. With fiducial stellar and AGN feedback inherited from IllustrisTNG, accretion is strongly suppressed at z ≳ 9, leaving mergers as the dominant growth channel. Gas accretion dominates at z ≲ 9, where permissive models (super-Eddington or low radiative efficiency) build ~ 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> BHs powering quasars by z ~ 6, while stricter IllustrisTNG-based prescriptions yield much lower BH masses (~ 10^6-10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>). Our seed models strongly affect merger-driven growth at z ≳ 9: only the most lenient models (with ~ 10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> seeds) produce enough BH mergers to reach ≳ 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> by z ~ 10, consistent with current estimates for GN-z11. Our dynamical friction model gives low merger efficiencies, hindering the buildup of ≳ 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub> BHs by z ~ 9-10, as currently inferred for GHZ9, UHZ1, and CAPERS-LRD-z9. If the BH-to-stellar mass ratios of these sources are indeed as extreme as currently inferred, they would require either very short BH merger timescales or reduced AGN thermal feedback. Weaker stellar feedback boosts both star formation and BH accretion and cannot raise these ratios.

We present a search for z≃7 Lyman-break galaxies using the 1.72   deg<sup>2</sup> near-infrared UltraVISTA survey in the COSMOS field, reaching 5 σ depths in Y of 26.2. We incorporate deep optical and Spitzer imaging for a full spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting analysis. We find 289 candidate galaxies at 6.5≤ z ≤ 7.5 covering -22.6 ≤ M_UV ≤ -20.2, faint enough to overlap with Hubble Space Telescope studies. We conduct a separate selection by including complementary Euclid performance verification imaging (reaching 5 σ depths of 26.3), yielding 140 galaxies in 0.65   deg<sup>2</sup>, with 38 sources unique to this sample. We compute the rest-frame UV luminosity function (UV LF) from our samples, extending below the knee (M^*=-21.14^+0.28_-0.25). We find that the shape of the UV LF is consistent with both a Schechter function and double-power law (DPL) at the magnitudes probed by this sample, with a DPL preferred at M_UV&lt;-22.5 when bright-end results are included. The UltraVISTA+Euclid sample provides a clean measurement of the LF due to the overlapping near-infrared filters identifying molecular absorption features in the SEDs of ultra-cool dwarf interlopers, and additional faint galaxies are recovered. A comparison with JWST LFs at z&gt;7 suggests a gentle evolution in the bright-end slope, although this is limited by a lack of robust bright-end measurements at z&gt;9. We forecast that in the Euclid Deep Fields, the removal of contaminant ultra-cool dwarfs as point sources will be possible at J_E &lt; 24.5. Finally, we present a high-equivalent-width Lyman-α emitter candidate identified by combining HSC, VISTA, and Euclid broadband photometry, highlighting the synergistic power these instruments will have in the Euclid Auxiliary Fields for identifying extreme sources in the Epoch of Reionisation.

### 26) [2510.00103](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.00103v2): The warm outer layer of a Little Red Dot as the source of [Fe II] and collisional Balmer lines with scattering wings

The population of the Little Red Dots (LRDs) may represent a key phase of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. A cocoon of dense excited gas is emerging as key component to explain the most striking properties of LRDs, such as strong Balmer breaks and Balmer absorption, as well as the weak IR emission. To dissect the structure of LRDs, we analyze new deep JWST/NIRSpec PRISM and G395H spectra of FRESCO-GN-9771, one of the most luminous known LRDs at z=5.5. These reveal a strong Balmer break, broad Balmer lines and very narrow [O III] emission. We unveil a forest of optical [Fe II] lines, which we argue is emerging from a dense (n_H=10^9-10 cm^-3) warm layer with electron temperature T_e≈7000 K. The broad wings of Hα and Hβ have an exponential profile due to electron scattering in this same layer. The high Hα:Hβ:Hγ flux ratio of ≈10.4:1:0.14 is an indicator of collisional excitation and resonant scattering dominating the Balmer line emission. A narrow Hγ component, unseen in the other two Balmer lines due to outshining by the broad components, could trace the ISM of a normal host galaxy with a star formation rate ~5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1. The warm layer is mostly opaque to Balmer transitions, producing a characteristic P-Cygni profile in the line centers suggesting outflowing motions. This same layer is responsible for shaping the Balmer break. The broad-band spectrum can be reasonably matched by a simple photoionized slab model that dominates the λ&gt;1500 Å continuum and a low mass (~10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) galaxy that could explain the narrow [O III], with only subdominant contribution to the UV continuum. Our findings indicate that Balmer lines are not directly tracing gas kinematics near the SMBH and that the BH mass scale is likely much lower than virial indicators suggest.

### 27) [2510.00101](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.00101v1): Irony at z=6.68: a bright AGN with forbidden Fe emission and multi-component Balmer absorption

<p> Francesco D'Eugenio, Erica Nelson, Xihan Ji, Josephine Baggen, Jenny Greene, Ivo Labbé, Gabriele Pezzulli, Vanessa Brown, Roberto Maiolino, Jorryt Matthee, Elena Terlevich, Roberto Terlevich, Alberto Torralba, Stefano Carniani </p>
<p>
We present the deepest medium-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy to date of a bright Little Red Dot (LRD) AGN, Irony at z=6.68. The data reveal broad Balmer emission from Hα-Hδ and Balmer absorption in Hα-Hε. The absorption lines are kinematically split: Hα is blueshifted while higher-order lines are redshifted suggesting complex gas kinematics; their relative ratios are inconsistent with a single, passive absorbing screen. The line depths require absorption of both the BLR and the continuum, ruling out a stellar origin, consistent with the smooth Balmer break. We fit the broad Hγ-Hα lines and find the data favor a double-Gaussian effective profile, although exponential wings are evident. Depending on the adopted profile, single-epoch virial estimates give log(M<sub>&bull;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=7.86-8.39 and λ_Edd=1.7-0.4. The dynamical mass implied by the narrow lines is low log(Mdyn/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=9.1, suggesting an overmassive black hole. The narrow lines display little attenuation, A_V&lt;0.5 mag; while broad Hα/Hβ~9 and the broad Balmer decrements are inconsistent with standard dust attenuation curves, suggesting collisional processes. The forbidden-line spectrum includes auroral [S II] and [N II], and a forest of [Fe II] lines. Line ratios and kinematics indicate a stratified narrow-line region with both low (n_e=420 cm^-3) and high densities (n_e≳ 6.3×10^5 cm^-3). We detect metal absorption lines in both the optical (Ca II and Na I) and UV range (Fe II UV1-UV3). Our results support a picture of a compact AGN embedded in a dense, high covering-factor and stratified cocoon, with complex neutral-gas kinematics. While the choice of broad-line profile affects the virial estimates of M<sub>&bull;</sub>, we find the effect to be of order 0.6 dex between the different approaches.

<p>
Charting the Epoch of Reionization demands robust assessments of what drives the production of ionizing photons in high-redshift star-forming galaxies (SFGs), and requires better predictive capabilities from current observations. Using a sample of N=159 SFGs at 1&lt;z&lt;8, observed with deep medium-resolution spectroscopy from the JWST/NIRSpec EXCELS survey, we perform a statistical analysis of their ionizing photon production efficiencies (ξ<sub>ion</sub>). We consider ξ<sub>ion</sub>, measured with Balmer line measurements, in relation to a number of key galaxy properties including; nebular emission line strengths (W_λ(Hα) and W_λ( [OIII])), UV luminosity (M_UV) and UV slope (β_UV), as well as dust attenuation (E(B-V)_neb) and redshift. Implementing a Bayesian linear regression methodology, we fit ξ<sub>ion</sub> against the principal observables while fully marginalising over all measurement uncertainties, mitigating against the impact of outliers and determining the intrinsic scatter. Significant relations between ξ<sub>ion</sub> and W_λ(Hα), W_λ([OIII]) and β_UV are recovered. Moreover, the weak trends with M_UV and redshift can be fully explained by the remaining property dependencies. Expanding our analysis to multivariate regression, we determine that W_λ(Hα) or W_λ([OIII]), along with β_UV and E(B-V)_neb, are the most important observables for accurately predicting ξ<sub>ion</sub>,0. The latter identifies the most common outliers as SFGs with relatively high E(B-V)_neb≳0.5, possibly indicative of obscured star-formation or strong differential attenuation. Combining these properties enable ξ<sub>ion</sub>,0 to be inferred with an accuracy of ~0.15 dex, with a population intrinsic scatter of σ_int~0.035 dex.

The multi-cycle JWST Treasury program NEXUS will obtain cadenced imaging and spectroscopic observations around the North Ecliptic Pole during 2024-2028. Here we report a systematic search for nuclear variability among ~ 25 k sources covered by NIRCam (F200W+F444W) imaging using the first two NEXUS epochs separated by 9 months in the observed frame. Difference imaging techniques reach 1σ variability sensitivity of 0.18~mag (F200W) and 0.15~mag (F444W) at 28th magnitude (within 0".2 diameter aperture), improved to 0.01~mag and 0.02~mag at &lt;25th magnitude, demonstrating the superb performance of NIRCam photometry. The difference imaging results represent significant improvement over aperture photometry on individual epochs (by &gt;30&percnt;). We identify 465 high-confidence variable sources among the parent sample, with 2-epoch flux difference at &gt;3σ from the fiducial variability sensitivity. Essentially all these variable sources are of extragalactic origin based on preliminary photometric classifications, and follow a similar photometric redshift distribution as the parent sample up to z<sub>phot</sub>&gt;10. While the majority of these variability candidates are likely normal unobscured AGNs, some of them may be rare nuclear stellar transients and tidal disruption events that await confirmation with spectroscopy and continued photometric monitoring. We also constrain the photometric variability of ten spectroscopically confirmed broad-line Little Red Dots (LRDs) at 3≲ z ≲ 7, and find none of them show detectable variability in either band. We derive stringent 3σ upper limits on the F444W variability of ~ 3-10&percnt; for these LRDs, with a median value of ~ 5&percnt;. These constraints imply weak variability in the rest-frame optical continuum of LRDs.

We explore the physical origins of the observed deficit of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at sub-solar metallicity using JWST/NIRCam imaging of the nearby galaxy M101, covering regions from solar metallicity (Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) down to 0.4 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>. These maps are used to trace the radial evolution of the shortest-wavelength PAH feature at 3.3 μm, which is emitted preferentially by the smallest PAHs (&lt;100 carbon atoms). The fractional contribution of PAH 3.3 μm to the total PAH luminosity (ΣPAH) increases by 3x as metallicity declines, rising from ~1&percnt; to ~3&percnt; over the observed range, consistent with prior predictions from the inhibited grain growth model based on Spitzer spectroscopy. We explore model refinements including photon effects and alternative size evolution prescriptions, and find that a modest amount of small grain photo-destruction remains possible, provided the grain size cutoff does not exceed ~55 carbon atoms. The best-fit models predict 3.3 μm/ΣPAH will rise to ~5.6-7.7&percnt; at 10&percnt; Z<sub>&odot;</sub>. Surprisingly, even as ΣPAH drops significantly relative to the total infrared luminosity (TIR) as metallicity declines, 3.3 μm/TIR alone rises, potentially indicating the mass fraction of the smallest PAH grains increases as the total dust content in galaxies drops. The current model cannot fully reproduce this trend even if the unusually strong effects of changing radiation field hardness on 3.3 μm/TIR are included. This may be evidence that the smallest PAHs are uniquely robust against destruction and inhibited growth effects. These results highlight the pivotal role that short-wavelength PAH emission can play in studies of low-metallicity and high-redshift galaxies.

<p>
We present a multiwavelength catalog of mid-infrared-selected compact sources in 19 nearby galaxies, combining JWST NIRCam/MIRI, HST UV-optical broadband, Hα narrow-band, and ALMA CO observations. We detect 24,945 compact sources at 21 μm and 55,581 at 10 μm. Artificial star tests show 50% completeness limits of ~5 μJy for the 10 μm catalog, and ~24 μJy for the 21 μm catalog. We find that 21 μm compact sources contribute ~20% of the total galaxy emission in that band, but only contribute 5% at 10 μm. We classify sources using stellar evolution and population synthesis models combined with empirical classifications derived from the literature. Our classifications include Hα-bright and dust-embedded optically faint clusters, red supergiants (RSGs), oxygen-rich and carbon-rich AGB stars, and a range of rarer stellar types. In sampling a broad range of star forming environments with a uniform, well-characterized selection, this catalog enables enables analyses of infrared-bright stellar populations. We find that Hα-faint sources account for only 10% of dusty (likely young) clusters, implying that the infrared-bright, optically-faint phase of cluster evolution is short compared to the Hα-bright stage. The luminosity functions of 10 and 21 μm sources follow power-law distributions, with the 21 μm slope (-1.7 ± 0.1) similar to that of giant molecular cloud mass functions and ultraviolet bright star-forming complexes, while the 10 μm slope (-2.0 ± 0.1) is closer to that of young stellar clusters.

### 32) [2509.12306](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12306v1): Off-center black hole seed formation? Implications for high and low redshift massive black holes

<p> David Izquierdo-Villalba, Daniele Spinoso, Marta Volonteri, Monica Colpi, Alberto Sesana, Silvia Bonoli </p>
<p>
Recent studies show that light seeds of black holes, which grow into massive black holes (MBHs) over time, often struggle to remain at the centers of their birthplaces in high-redshift galaxies, limiting their ability to accrete gas and merge with other black holes. In this work, we investigate how off-center formation of the first seeds affects the evolution of the MBH and massive black hole binary (MBHB) populations over cosmic history. To this end, we use the ttL-Galaxies  BH semi-analytical model, which includes multiple seed formation mechanisms, with light Population III remnants being the most significant contributors. To incorporate off-center formation, we modify the model to track the initial seed location, the sinking timescales toward the galactic center, and any growth during this phase. The results indicate that seed formation occurring away from the galactic center has a negligible impact on the MBH population at z&lt;1, but causes significant differences at higher redshifts. Particularly, the abundance of 10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> MBHs at z&gt;4 can be up to 2-10 times smaller compared to a nuclear seed formation model. Quasar luminosity functions with L_bol&gt;10^44 erg/s are similarly affected, although they still align with observational constraints. The off-centre formation also alters the galaxy-MBH mass relation. At z&gt;5, the amplitude of the relation can be up to 2 dex smaller than in nuclear seed models. These differences fade by z ~ 2 for galaxies &gt;10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, and by z=0 for smaller galaxies. Notably, the overmassive MBH population recently unveiled by JWST is still present in the model, suggesting they can form independently of the seed dynamics. Finally, the merging rate of MBHs within LISA sensitivity band is strongly impacted. Specifically, there is a suppression of events at high-z and an enhancement at low-z.

### 33) [2509.07913](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.07913v2): Disclosing Submillimeter Galaxy Formation: Mergers or Secular Evolution?

<p> Siu-Wang Chan, Yiping Ao, Qinghua Tan </p>
<p>
We analyze the morphology of 125 submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) in the PRIMER-COSMOS field using double Sersic modeling on JWST NIRCam images across six bands (F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M and F444W), with SMGs being classified by bulge Sersic index (n_bulge) and bulge-to-total luminosity ratio (B/T). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test between the bright (SFR &gt; 175 M_sun yr^-1) and the faint group (SFR &lt; 175 M_sun yr^-1) reveals no significant statistical differences in morphology across bands. However, we notice that SMGs skew towards higher B/T ratios and lower n_bulge from shorter to longer wavelengths. In F444W, bright SMGs exhibit higher B/T and lower n_bulge, indicating flatter, disturbed bulges, while faint SMGs show lower B/T and higher n_bulge. Notably, SMGs with higher B/T tend to have low Sersic index, challenging the local universe dichotomy of classical bulges (B/T &gt; 0.5, n &gt; 4) versus pseudo-bulges (B/T &lt; 0.35, n &lt; 2). In the F277W band, non-parametric measurements indicate predominantly disk-dominated patterns, with only 24 percent of SMGs demonstrating merger signatures. After the removal of SMGs with disturbed morphology, the bulge classification scheme in F277W shows pseudo-bulges (21 percent) and clump migration bulges (16 percent) from secular evolution, compared to 4 percent merger-built bulges. Surprisingly, 48 percent of SMGs defy the classification scheme, showing high B/T (approximately 0.7) but low Sersic index (n_bulge ≤ 1). Bars are confirmed in 7 percent of SMGs. This work suggests that secular evolution takes precedence over major mergers, supporting the idea that isolated evolution fueled by filamentary gas inflow plays a non-negligible role in the SMG bulge formation.

### 34) [2509.05551](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05551v1): Uncertainty-Aware Neural Networks for Fuzzy Dark Matter Model Selection from \texorpdfstringx_HI x_HI Measurements

<p> Bahareh Soleimanpour Salmasi, S. Mobina Hosseini </p>
<p>
The nature of dark matter remains a central question in cosmology, with fuzzy dark matter (FDM) models offering a compelling alternative to the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. We explore FDM scenarios by performing 21-cm simulations across a parameter space with \texorpdfstringf_FDM \in [0.02, 0.10] f_FDM in [0.02, 0.10] and \texorpdfstringm_FDM \in [10^-24, 10^-21] eV m_FDM in [10^-24, 10^-21] eV, obtaining global neutral hydrogen fractions (\texorpdfstringx_HI x_HI) for each model. Observational \texorpdfstringx_HI x_HI data and associated uncertainties from JWST are incorporated by estimating full probability density functions (PDFs) for both \texorpdfstringx_HI x_HI and redshift \texorpdfstringz z using Bayesian inference with the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), yielding non-Gaussian multivariate uncertainty distributions. A hybrid machine learning framework is then trained on these observational PDFs to learn both central values and correlated uncertainties in \texorpdfstringx_HI x_HI and \texorpdfstringz z, iteratively refining its parameters in each training epoch through direct incorporation of the multivariate PDFs derived from observational constraints. We then compare the simulation outputs to the machine-learned observational trends to identify the most consistent models. Our results indicate that FDM models with \texorpdfstringm_FDM ≃ 10^-22 eV m_FDM approx 10^-22 eV and \texorpdfstringf_FDM ≃ 0.04 f_FDM approx 0.04 best match current data, while lighter masses are strongly constrained. By integrating simulations and machine learning in an uncertainty-aware framework, this work explores the physics of the early Universe and guides future studies of 21-cm cosmology and reionization.

### 35) [2509.03039](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03039v4): Machine Learning Classification of COSMOS2020 Galaxies: Quiescent vs. Star-Forming

<p> Vahid Asadi, Nima Chartab, Akram Hasani Zonoozi, Hosein Haghi, Ghassem Gozaliasl, Aryana Haghjoo, Bahram Mobasher </p>
<p>
Accurately distinguishing between quiescent and star-forming galaxies is essential for understanding galaxy evolution. Traditional methods, such as spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, can be computationally expensive and may struggle to capture complex galaxy properties. This study aims to develop a robust and efficient machine learning (ML) classification method to identify quiescent and star-forming galaxies within the Farmer COSMOS2020 catalog. We utilized JWST wide-field light cones from the Santa Cruz semi-analytical modeling framework to train a supervised ML model, the CatBoostClassifier, using 28 color features derived from 8 mutual photometric bands within the COSMOS catalog. The model was validated against a testing set and compared to the SED-fitting method in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, and execution time. Preprocessing steps included addressing missing data, injecting observational noise, and applying a magnitude cut (ch1 &lt; 26 AB) along with a redshift range of 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5 to align the simulated and observational datasets. The ML method achieved an F1-score of 89&percnt; for quiescent galaxies, significantly outperforming the SED-fitting method, which achieved 54%. The ML model demonstrated superior recall (88% vs. 38%) while maintaining comparable precision. When applied to the COSMOS2020 catalog, the ML model predicted a systematically higher fraction of quiescent galaxies across all redshift bins within 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5 compared to traditional methods like NUVrJ and SED-fitting. This study shows that ML, combined with multi-wavelength data, can effectively identify quiescent and star-forming galaxies, providing valuable insights into galaxy evolution. The trained classifier and full classification catalog are publicly available.

<p>
We present JWST/MIRI spectra from the Medium-Resolution Spectrometer of IZw18, a nearby dwarf galaxy with a metallicity of ~ 3% Solar. Here, we investigate warm molecular hydrogen, H2, observed in spectra extracted in ~ 120 pc apertures centered on eleven regions of interest. We detect 7 H2 rotational lines, some of which are among the weakest ever measured. The H2 population diagrams are fit with local-thermodynamic-equilibrium models and models of photodissociation regions. We also fit the ortho-/para-H2 ratios (OPRs); in three of the six regions for which it was possible to fit the OPR, we find values significantly greater than 3, the maximum value for local thermodynamic equilibrium. To our knowledge, although predicted theoretically, this is the first time that OPR significantly &gt; 3 has been measured in interstellar gas. We find that OPR tends to increase with decreasing H2 column density, consistent with the expected effects of self-shielding in advancing photodissociation fronts. The population diagrams are consistent with H nucleon densities of ~ 10^5 cm^-3, and an interstellar radiation field scaling factor, G0, of ~ 10^3. This warm, dense H2 gas co-exists with the same highly ionized gas that emits [OIV] and [NeV]. Emission from T ≥ 50K dust is detected, including an as-yet unidentified dust emission feature near 14 μm; possible identification as Al_2O_3 is discussed. The continuum emission from several regions requires that a considerable fraction of the refractory elements be incorporated in dust. Despite stacking spectra in the SE where H2 is found, no significant emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is detected.

### 37) [2509.01302](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01302v1): An AGB star as the source of the abundance pattern of hyper-metal-poor star HE 1327-2326

<p> P. Gil-Pons, S. W. Campbell, C. L. Doherty, M. Lugaro </p>
<p>
Abridged. HE 1327-2326 (HE 1327), with [Fe/H]=-5.2, is one of the most metal-poor stars detected and a candidate to be the offspring of the first stars. Numerous efforts have been made to match its abundance pattern. However, no model satisfactorily explains its entire surface chemical composition. The high CNO pattern with [N/Fe]&gt;[C/Fe]&gt;[O/Fe], the light element 'slide' (between Na and Si), and the presence of Sr and Ba in HE 1327 is reminiscent of those asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars that undergo third dredge-up, hot bottom burning, and s-processing, suggesting that AGBs may have been progenitors of the star. We assume that, where HE 1327 formed, the interstellar medium was well-mixed, and adopt an initial stellar composition based on the observed chemical evolution of the early universe. We calculated models of hyper-metal-poor AGB stars and compared their yields to the observed abundances of HE 1327. Our 3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> models match 13 of the 14 measured elements in HE1327. They are also consistent with the seven elements with upper limits. The only discrepancy is O, underproduced by 0.5-1.0 dex. Unlike the SN models, the AGB models also match Sr and Ba. Our model predicts high abundances of P and Pb, which would be useful in testing the AGB scenario. We propose that HE 1327 is the oldest known object that shows nucleosynthetic evidence of the first AGB stars. With lifetimes as short as 200 Myr, these stars may have formed and polluted the universe very early. Recent Pop III star formation simulations support their formation, and their strong N production is qualitatively consistent with recent JWST observations showing high N/O ratios just 440 Myr after the Big Bang. Importantly, our results also suggest that the interstellar medium may have shown some degree of homogeneity and mixing even at these early epochs.

### 38) [2508.21708](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21708v1): JWST Spectroscopic Insights Into the Diversity of Galaxies in the First 500 Myr: Short-Lived Snapshots Along a Common Evolutionary Pathway

<p>
We investigate the nature and spectroscopic diversity of early galaxies from a sample of 40 sources at z&gt;10 with JWST/NIRSpec prism observations, the largest of its kind thus far. We compare the properties of strong UV line emitters, as traced by intense CIV emission, with those of more "typical" sources with weak or undetected CIV. The more typical (or "CIV-weak") sources reveal significant scatter in their CIII] line strengths, UV continuum slopes, and physical sizes, spanning CIII] equivalent widths of ~1-51 Å, UV slopes of β~-1.6 to -2.6, and half-light radii of ~50-1000 pc. In contrast, CIV-strong sources generally occupy the tail of these distributions, with CIII] EWs of 16-51 Å, UV slopes β&lt;-2.5, compact morphologies (r_50&lt;100 pc), and elevated star formation surface densities (Σ_SFR&gt;100 M<sub>&odot;</sub>yr^-1kpc^-2). Collectively these properties are consistent with concentrated starbursts that temporarily outshine the extended structure of the galaxy. Comparing average properties from composite spectra, we find the diversity of the sample is primarily driven by bursts and lulls of star formation on very short timescales (&lt;3 Myr), where strong CIV emitters are observed at the apex of these phases and sources devoid of emission lines represent periods of relative inactivity. An apparent association between strong CIV and enhanced nitrogen abundance suggests both features may be modulated by the same duty cycle and reflect a generic mode of star formation. We show that AGN are unlikely to be a significant contributor to this duty cycle based on a comparison of UV line diagnostics to photoionisation models, although some non-thermal activity cannot be fully ruled out. Our results support a unified evolutionary picture whereby transient bursts and lulls can explain the spectral diversity and early growth of bright galaxies in the first 500 Myr.

<p>
We analyze eight spectroscopically confirmed Little Red Dots (LRDs) at redshifts z = 5.1-8.7 with JWST/NIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI data. The LRDs have red NIRCam colors, F150W-F444W &gt; 1, but flat NIRCam-MIRI colors, -0.5 &lt; F444W - F770W &lt; 0.5, suggesting weak warm/hot dust components. The LRDs have -1.0 &lt; F1000W - F1500W &lt; 1.1, suggestive of non-uniform rest near-IR properties within the sample. We model the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the LRDs using the CIGALE and Prospector codes to assess how the differing templates impact the interpretation for LRDs for cases of: (1) models with star-forming stellar populations only; (2) active galactic nuclei (AGN) dominated models; and (3) composite AGN and star-forming models. Using the Bayesian information criterion, we find that six of the eight LRDs favor AGN models compared to star-forming models, though no model reproduces all of the observed properties. Two LRDs with pronounced Balmer-breaks and broad Hα have SEDs that are reproduced with hot, dense-gas (log T/K=5-5.7, log n/cm^-3 = 9-11) models with low dust attenuation (A(V)≃ 0.5 mag). However, these models require an additional thermal component (800-1400 K) to account for the MIRI data, and fail to reproduce the rest-UV and narrow [OIII] emission. The total bolometric emission from the dense-gas models, and possibly CIGALE AGN models, appear consistent with literature constraints in the far-IR and radio, and require log L_bol/L<sub>&odot;</sub>&lt;12. These results suggest that our LRDs cannot be modeled entirely with standard templates, but instead require a novel treatment of gas conditions, AGN and star-formation.

<p>
Though type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are found in all types of galaxies, recent local Hubble constant measurements have disfavored using SNe Ia in early-type or quiescent galaxies, aiming instead for better consistency with SNe Ia in star-forming, late-type host galaxies calibrated by Cepheid distances. Here we investigate the feasibility of a parallel distance ladder using SNe Ia exclusively in quiescent, massive (log M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub> ≥ 10) host galaxies, calibrated by tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distances. We present TRGB measurements to four galaxies: three measured from the Hubble Space Telescope with the ACS F814W filter, and one measured from the JWST NIRCam F090W filter. Combined with literature measurements, we define a TRGB calibrator sample of five high-mass, early-type galaxies that hosted well-measured SNe Ia: NGC 1316 (SN 2006dd), NGC 1380 (SN 1992A), NGC 1404 (SN 2007on, SN 2011iv), NGC 4457 (SN 2020nvb), and NGC 4636 (SN 2020ue). We jointly standardize these calibrators with a fiducial sample of 124 Hubble-flow SNe Ia from the Zwicky Transient Facility that are matched in host-galaxy and light-curve properties. Our results with this homogenized subsample show a Hubble residual scatter of under 0.11 mag, lower than usually observed in cosmological samples of the full SN~Ia distribution. We obtain a measurement of the Hubble constant, H_0 = 75.3 ± 2.9 km s<sup>-1</sup> Mpc^-1, including statistical and estimated systematic uncertainties, and discuss the potential to further improve the precision of this approach. As calibrator and supernova samples grow, we advocate that future cosmological applications of SNe Ia use subsamples matched in host-galaxy and supernova properties across redshift.

### 41) [2508.18369](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18369v1): A Uniform Analysis of Gas-phase Metallicity Evolution with 1-3 Gyr Time Sampling over the Past 12 Billion Years

We present a systematic investigation of the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) using uniform metallicity diagnostics across redshifts z~0 to z~3.3. We present new Keck/DEIMOS measurements of the [OII]λ&lambda;3726,3729 emission line doublet for star-forming galaxies at z~1.5 with existing measurements of redder rest-optical lines from the MOSDEF survey. These new observations enable uniform estimation of the gas-phase oxygen abundance using ratios of the [OII], Hβ, and [OIII] lines for mass-binned samples of star-forming galaxies in 6 redshift bins, employing strong-line calibrations that account for the distinct interstellar medium ionization conditions at z&lt;1 and z&gt;1. We find that the low-mass power law slope of the MZR remains constant over this redshift range with a value of γ=0.28±0.01, implying the outflow metal loading factor (ζ_out=\fracZ_out Z_ISM\fracM&#775;_out SFR) scales approximately as ζ_out&prop; M_*^-0.3 out to at least z~3.3. The normalization of the MZR at 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> decreases with increasing redshift at a rate of dlog(O/H)/dz =-0.11±0.01 across the full redshift range. We find that any evolution of the FMR is smaller than 0.1 dex out to z~3.3. We compare to cosmological galaxy formation simulations, and find that IllustrisTNG matches our measured combination of a nearly-invariant MZR slope, rate of MZR normalization decrease, and constant or very weakly evolving FMR. This work provides the most detailed view of MZR and FMR evolution from the present day through Cosmic Noon with a fine time sampling of 1-3 Gyr, setting a robust baseline for metallicity evolution studies at z&gt;4 with JWST.

Star formation governs galaxy evolution, shaping stellar mass assembly and gas consumption across cosmic time. The Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, linking star formation rate (SFR) and gas surface densities, is fundamental to understand star formation regulation, yet remains poorly constrained at z &gt; 2 due to observational limitations and uncertainties in locally calibrated gas tracers. The [CII] 158 μm line has recently emerged as a key probe of the cold ISM and star formation in the early Universe. We investigate whether the resolved [CII]-SFR and KS relations established at low redshift remain valid at 4 &lt; z &lt; 6 by analysing 13 main-sequence galaxies from the ALPINE and CRISTAL surveys, using multi-wavelength data (HST, JWST, ALMA) at ~2 kpc resolution. We perform pixel-by-pixel spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling with CIGALE on resolution-homogenised images. We develop a statistical framework to fit the [CII]-SFR relation that accounts for pixel covariance and compare our results to classical fitting methods. We test two [CII]-to-gas conversion prescriptions to assess their impact on inferred gas surface densities and depletion times. We find a resolved [CII]-SFR relation with a slope of 0.87 ± 0.15 and intrinsic scatter of 0.19 ± 0.03 dex, which is shallower and tighter than previous studies at z~5. The resolved KS relation is highly sensitive to the [CII]-to-gas conversion factor: using a fixed global α_[CII] yields depletion times of 0.5-1 Gyr, while a surface brightness-dependent W_[CII], places some galaxies with high gas density in the starburst regime (&lt;0.1 Gyr). Future inputs from both simulations and observations are required to better understand how the [CII]-to-gas conversion factor depends on local ISM properties. We need to break this fundamental limit to properly study the KS relation at z≳4.

JWST is discovering a plethora of species in planet-forming disks around very low-mass stars such as C2H2, C6H6, C4H2, CH3 etc. The column densities of these species retrieved from 0D slab models are very large, e.g. of the order of 10^20 cm<sup>2</sup>. This is indicating a carbon-dominated chemistry in a gas with a high C/O ratio. The disk around 2MASS-J1605321-1993159 (M4.5) is one such source showing a molecular pseudo-continuum of C2H2. Still two oxygen-bearing molecules, CO and CO2 are also detected in this source. We aim to take the next step beyond 0D slab models to interpret the spectrum. We examine whether 2D thermo-chemical disk models can produce the large inferred column densities of \ceC2H2 in the inner regions of the disk and produce a pseudo-continuum in the mid-IR spectrum. We also want to constrain whether depletion of oxygen or enrichment of carbon is causing the high C/O ratio triggering a carbon-dominated chemistry. We utilize the radiative thermo-chemical disk model P\tiny ROD\tiny IM\tiny O to identify a disk structure which is capable of producing the observed molecular emission of species such as CO, CO2, C2H2, and H2O simultaneously. The spectrum is generated using the fast line tracer FLiTs. We derive the gas temperature &langle; T &rangle;, column density &langle; log_10 N&rangle; and the emitting area &langle; r_1 - r_2 &rangle; for these molecules from the 2D disk model and compare them to the parameters retrieved originally from 0D slab models. We use the different effect that changing the O or C abundance has on CO and C2H2 respectively to discriminate between O depletion and C enhancement. We find that a disk structure characterised by the presence of a gap can best explain the observations. The inner disk is strongly depleted in dust, especially small grains (&lt;5 μm), and ..

### 44) [2508.08768](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08768v1): Impact of Resonance, Raman, and Thomson Scattering on Hydrogen Line Formation in Little Red Dots

<p> Seok-Jun Chang, Max Gronke, Jorryt Matthee, Charlotte Mason </p>
<p>
Little Red Dots (LRDs) are compact sources at z&gt;5 discovered through JWST spectroscopy. Their spectra exhibit broad Balmer emission lines (≳1000~km~s<sup>-1</sup>), alongside absorption features and a pronounced Balmer break &ndash; evidence for a dense, neutral hydrogen medium with the n=2 state. When interpreted as arising from AGN broad-line regions, inferred black hole masses from local scaling relations exceed expectations given their stellar masses, challenging models of early black hole-galaxy co-evolution. However, radiative transfer effects in dense media may also impact the formation of hydrogen emission lines. We model three scattering processes shaping hydrogen line profiles: resonance scattering by hydrogen in the n=2 state, Raman scattering of UV radiation by ground-state hydrogen, and Thomson scattering by free electrons. Using 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations with multi-branching resonance transitions, we examine their imprint on line shapes and ratios. Resonance scattering produces strong deviations from Case B flux ratios, clear differences between Hα and Hβ, and encodes gas kinematics in line profiles but cannot broaden Hβ due to conversion to Paα. While Raman scattering can yield broad wings, scattering of UV continuum is disfavored given the absence of strong FWHM variations across transitions. Raman scattering of higher Lyman-series emission can produce Hα/Hβ wing width ratios of ≳1.28, agreeing with observations. Thomson scattering can reproduce the observed ≳1000~km  s<sup>-1</sup> wings under plausible conditions, e.g., T_e ~ 10^4  K and N_e~10^24~cm<sup>2</sup> &ndash; and lead to black hole mass overestimates by factors ≳10. Our results provide a framework for interpreting hydrogen lines in LRDs and similar systems.

The chemical composition of the inner regions of disks around young stars will determine the properties of planets forming there. Many disk physical processes drive the chemical evolution, some of which depend on/correlate with the stellar properties. We aim to explore the connection between stellar properties and inner disk chemistry, using mid-infrared spectroscopy. We use JWST-MIRI observations of a large, diverse sample of sources to explore trends between C_2H<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O. Additionally, we calculate the average spectrum for the T Tauri (M_*&gt;0.2 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) and very low-mass star (VLMS, M_*≤0.2 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) samples and use slab models to determine the properties. We find a significant anti-correlation between the flux ratio of C_2H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O and the stellar luminosity. Disks around VLMS have significantly higher F_C_2H<sub>2</sub>/F_H<sub>2</sub>O flux ratios than their higher-mass counterparts. We also explore trends with the strength of the 10 μm silicate feature, stellar accretion rate, and disk dust mass, all of which show correlations with the flux ratio, which may be related to processes driving the carbon-enrichment in disks around VLMS, but also have degeneracies with system properties. Slab model fits to the average spectra show that the VLMS H<sub>2</sub>O emission is quite similar in temperature and column density to a warm (~600 K) H<sub>2</sub>O component in the T Tauri spectrum, indicating that the high C/O gas phase ratio in these disks is not due to oxygen depletion alone. Instead, the presence of many hydrocarbons, including some with high column densities, points to carbon enhancement in the disks around VLMS. The observed differences in the inner disk chemistry as a function of host properties are likely to be accounted for by differences in the disk temperatures, stellar radiation field, and the evolution of dust grains.

One of the most remarkable outcomes from JWST has been the exquisite UV-optical spectroscopic data for galaxies in the high-redshift Universe (z ≥ 5), enabling the use of various nebular emission lines to infer conditions of the interstellar medium. In this work, we evaluate the reliability of these diagnostics, specifically those used to recover the star formation rate (SFR), the ionising photon production efficiency, and the gas-phase oxygen abundance. We use forward-modelled galaxy spectra from idealised toy models and the FLARES cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to assess how these diagnostic lines respond to variations in the underlying stellar populations and star-dust geometry. We find that due to the clumpy nature of FLARES galaxies, they exhibit strong internal variation in age, metallicity and dust attenuation, biasing the interpretation using these diagnostics. In FLARES, the SFRD at the bright-end of the SFR function can be underestimated by as much as 30 &percnt; compared to the true values. Similarly, the true ionising photon production efficiency in FLARES remains almost constant with stellar mass, while estimates using Hα or Hβ can underestimate it by more than 0.5 dex at the massive end (&gt;10^9.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), introducing an artificial declining trend. The FLARES mass-metallicity relation derived from line ratios (dust corrected) exhibits a flat trend, whereas the intrinsic mass-weighted relation shows a strong positive correlation. These findings highlight the critical importance of understanding the biases introduced due to the coupling of star-dust geometry and heterogeneous stellar population when interpreting nebular emission lines at high redshift. Hence the accurate interpretation of high-redshift galaxy spectra requires careful forward modelling that accounts for realistic star-dust geometry and population variations.

### 47) [2507.16552](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16552v1): Low D/H ratio for benzonitrile in TMC-1: Implication for the origin of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in cold dark clouds

Radioastronomical observations have recently discovered PAHs of moderate size (up to 24 carbon atoms) in cold dark clouds, although it is currently unknown whether they are formed in situ through a bottom-up mechanism or from larger PAHs (20-100 carbon atoms) inherited from a previous diffuse stage in a top-down scenario. Infrared observations have recently shown that large PAHs present in UV-illuminated regions are strongly enriched in deuterium. In order to shed light on the origin of PAHs in cold clouds, we have searched for deuterated benzonitrile in the cold dark cloud TMC-1. To that purpose we have synthesized the three isomers (ortho, meta, and para) of monodeuterated benzonitrile, measured their rotational spectra across the 2-18 GHz and 75-110 GHz frequency ranges in the laboratory, and searched for them in TMC-1 using data from the QUIJOTE line survey. We did not detect any of the three species and have derived a 3sigma upper limit on the column density of each of them of 3.0e10 cm-2, meaning a fractional abundance relative to H2 of &lt;3e-12. We derived a D/H ratio (which we define as the total number of D atoms with respect to the total number of H atoms present in benzonitrile) of &lt;1.2 %. This value is in line with the range of D/H ratios observed for other molecules in TMC-1 (0.06-3.3 %), where deuterium enrichment is explained in terms of isotopic fractionation at low temperature. It is however below the range of D/H ratios derived for large unspecific PAHs from JWST observations of the galactic PDRs Orion Bar and M17 and the galaxies M51 and NGC3256-S (between 1% and &lt;17%). Although it is not straightforward to compare the deuteration of PAHs in dark and UV-irradiated clouds, our results suggest that the population of PAHs detected in cold dark clouds does not result from the fragmentation of larger PAHs inherited from the previous diffuse stage in a top-down scenario.

### 48) [2507.13904](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13904v1): The dynamical evolution of the stellar clumps in the Sparkler galaxy

<p> Eric Giunchi, Federico Marinacci, Carlo Nipoti, Adélaïde Claeyssens, Raffaele Pascale, Francesco Calura, Antonio Ragagnin </p>
<p>
Recent JWST observations detected stellar clumps around the z=1.4 gravitationally lensed Sparkler galaxy (of stellar mass M_*~ 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), with ages and metallicities compatible with globular clusters (GCs). However, most of their masses (&gt;10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) and sizes (&gt;30 pc) are about 10 times those of GCs in the local Universe. To assess whether these clumps can evolve into GCs, we performed N-body simulations of their dynamical evolution from z=1.4 to z=0 (9.23 Gyr), under the effect of dynamical friction and tidal stripping. Dynamical friction is studied performing multiple runs of a clump system in a Sparkler-like spherical halo of mass M_200≃ 5× 10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub> (from the stellar-to-halo mass relation). For the tidal stripping, we simulated resolved clumps, orbiting in an external, static gravitational potential including the same halo as in the dynamical friction simulations and also a Sparkler-like stellar disk. Dynamical friction causes the clumps with mass &gt;10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub> to sink into the galaxy central regions, possibly contributing to the bulge growth. In absence of tidal stripping, the mass distribution of the surviving clumps (40%) peaks at 5× 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, implying the presence of uncommonly over-massive clumps at z=0. Tidal shocks by the stellar disk strip considerable mass from low-mass clumps, even though their sizes remain larger than those of present-day GCs. When the surviving clumps are corrected for tidal stripping, their mass distribution peak shifts to 2× 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, compatible with massive GCs. Our simulations suggest that a fraction of the Sparkler clumps is expected to fall into the central regions, where they might become bulge fossil fragments or contribute to form a nuclear star cluster. The remaining clumps are too large in size to be progenitors of GCs.

JWST highlighted an excess of UV-bright galaxies at z&gt;10, with a derived UVLF that exhibits a softer evolution than expected. In this work, we aim at characterizing the burstiness level of high-redshift galaxy SFHs and its evolution. We implement a stochastic SFH module in CIGALE using power spectrum densities, to estimate the burstiness level of star formation in galaxies at 6&lt;z&lt;12. We find that SFHs with a high level of stochasticity better reproduce the SEDs of z&gt;6 galaxies, while smoother assumptions introduce biases when applied to galaxies with bursty star-formation activity. The assumed stochasticity level of the SFH also affects the constraints on galaxies' physical properties, including the main sequence. Successively assuming different levels of burstiness, we determined the best-suited SFH for each 6&lt;z&lt;12 galaxy in the JADES sample from a Bayes Factor analysis. Galaxies are classified according to their level of burstiness, and the corresponding physical properties are associated to them. For massive galaxies (log Mstar/M<sub>&odot;</sub>&gt; 8.8), the fraction of bursty galaxies increases from 0.42+/-0.08 to 0.76+/-0.20 from z=6 to 12, respectively. At all redshifts, only &lt;20% of low-mass galaxies are classified as bursty, due to their faintness resulting in low S/N. For bursty galaxies, the log10(SFR10/SFR100) ratio, another indicator of bursty star formation, does not evolve with redshift, but the fraction of galaxies with high log10(SFR10/SFR100) slightly increases from 0.25+/-0.06 to 0.37+/-0.11 between z=6 and z=9. We include additional constraints from observations on sigmaUV and SFE, finding a maximum of 0.72+/-0.02 mag and 0.06+/-0.01, for sigmaUV and SFE, respectively. This confirms that neither alone is responsible for the weak evolution of the UVLF at z&gt;10. Our results add further evidence that a combination with other mechanisms is likely responsible for the high-z UVLF.

We present a detailed analysis of the most luminous and obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) detected in the ultra-hard X-ray band (14-195 keV) by Swift/BAT. Our sample comprises 21 X-ray luminous (log L_X/erg s<sup>-1</sup>&gt;44.6, 2-10 keV) AGNs at z&lt;0.6, optically classified as Seyfert 1.9-2. Using NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, Suzaku, and Chandra, we constrain AGN properties such as absorption column density N_H, photon index Γ, intrinsic L_X, covering factor, and iron Kα equivalent width. For sources with black hole mass estimates (12/20), we find a weak correlation between Γ and Eddington ratio (λ_Edd). Of these, six (50±13&percnt;) lie in the N_H-λ_Edd "forbidden region'' and exhibit a combined higher prevalence of N_H variability and outflow signatures, suggesting a transitional phase where AGN feedback may be clearing the obscuring material. For the 13/21 sources with multi-epoch X-ray spectra, 82^+6_-16&percnt; exhibit variability in either 2-10 keV flux (73^+9_-16&percnt;) or line-of-sight N_H (33^+15_-10&percnt;). For the 20/21 sources with available near-UV/optical spectroscopy, we detect [NeV]λ3426 in 17 (85^+5_-11&percnt;), confirming its reliability to probe AGN emission even in heavily obscured systems. When normalized to the same [OIII]λ5007 peak flux as z = 2-9 narrow-line AGNs identified with JWST, our sample exhibits significantly stronger [NeV]λ3426 emission, suggesting that high-redshift obscured AGNs may be intrinsically weaker in [NeV]λ3426 or that [NeV]λ3426 is more challenging to detect in those environments. The sources presented here serve as a benchmark for high-redshift analogs, showing the potential of [NeV]λ3426 to reveal obscured AGNs and the need for future missions to expand X-ray studies into the high-redshift Universe.

We characterize the JWST spectra of 61 galaxies at z=9-14, including 30 newly-confirmed galaxies. We directly compare the z&gt;9 spectroscopic properties against 401 galaxies at 6&lt;z&lt;9, with the goal of identifying evolution in the star formation histories and ISM. We measure rest-UV emission line properties and UV continuum slopes, while also investigating the rest-optical emission lines for the subset of galaxies at 9.0&lt;z&lt;9.6. With these spectra, we constrain the stellar masses, specific star formation rates, dust attenuation, and the average metallicity and abundance pattern of z&gt;9 galaxies. Our dataset indicates that the emission lines undergo a marked change at z&gt;9, with extremely large CIII], Hβ, and Hγ EWs becoming 2-3× more common at z&gt;9 relative to 6&lt;z&lt;9. Using the spectra, we infer the distribution of SFRs on short (SFR_3Myr) and medium (SFR_3-50Myr) timescales, finding that rapid SFR upturns (large SFR_3Myr/SFR_3-50Myr ratios) are significantly more likely among z&gt;9 galaxies. These results may reflect a larger dispersion in UV luminosity at fixed halo mass and larger baryon accretion rates at z&gt;9, although other physical effects may also contribute. We suggest that the shift in star formation conditions explains the prevalence of extreme nebular spectra that have been detected at z&gt;9, with hard ionizing sources and nitrogen-enhancements becoming more typical at the highest redshifts. Finally, we identify five z&gt;9 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies with red UV colors (β≳-1.5), either revealing a small population with moderate dust attenuation (τ_V=0.23-0.35) or very high density nebular-dominated galaxies with hot stellar populations.

We present MIRI/JWST medium resolution spectroscopy (MRS) and imaging (MIRIM) of B14-65666, a Lyman-break and interacting galaxy at redshift z=7.15. We detect the Hα line emission in this system, revealing a spatially-resolved structure of the Hα emitting gas, which consists of two distinct galaxies, E and W, at a projected distance of 0.4". Galaxy E is very compact in the rest-frame UV, while W galaxy is more extended, showing a clumpy structure reminiscent of a tidal tail. The total Hα luminosity implies that the system is forming stars at a Star Formation Rate (SFR) of 76±8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1 and 30±4 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1 for E and W, respectively. The ionizing photon production efficiency is within the range measured in galaxies at similar redshifts. The high values derived for the Hα equivalent widths (EW) and the distinct locations of the E and W galaxies in the log(ζ<sub>ion</sub>) - EW (Hα) plane, indicate that the system is dominated by a young (less than 10 Myr) stellar population. The overall spectral energy distribution suggests that in addition to a young stellar population, the two galaxies may have mature stellar population and very different dust attenuation. The derived SFR and stellar masses identify the two galaxies as going through a starburst phase. The kinematics of the ionized gas traced by the Hα line show a velocity difference of 175 ± 28 km s<sup>-1</sup> between the two components of B14-65666. The in-depth study of systems like B14-65666 reveal how galaxy mergers in the early Universe drive intense star formation, shape the interstellar medium, and influence the buildup of stellar mass, just 700 - 800 Myr after the Big Bang.

### 53) [2507.01742](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01742v1): New clues on the extended HeII ionization in IZw18 from GTC/MEGARA and JWST/MIRI

<p>
IZw18 is one of the lowest-metallicity star-forming galaxies known at z~0, considered a unique local analogue of the first galaxies. The origin of its hard ionizing continuum, expected to be a common feature in the early Universe and traced by Hescii emission lines, remains intensely debated and challenging to explain. Here we combine optical (GTC/MEGARA) and mid-infrared (JWST/MIRI) integral field spectroscopic observations for IZw18 to shed new light on the high-ionization phenomenon. This letter reports the first detection of the high-ionization [Nescv]14.32 μm line in IZw18. Its emission is spatially extended and coincident with the Hescii peak, revealing the presence of highly energetic ionizing sources that surpass mechanisms previously proposed on the basis of Hescii alone. Our kinematic studies highlight that the Hesciiλ4686-emitting gas displays higher velocity dispersions and a different velocity pattern compared to the Hβ emission, suggesting the presence of energetic processes such as shocks or stellar-driven feedback. Additionally, integrated spectra show asymmetric blueshifted profiles in the Hesciiλ4686 line, possibly indicating bfearly-stage stellar-driven outflows potentially facilitating future ionizing photon leakage. Our spatial analysis also reveals differences in structure between the emission of Hβ and Hesciiλ4686, with the Hesciiλ4686 peak offset by a projected distance of 140 pc from the peak Hβ emission. This indicates distinct locations for the most extreme ionizing sources compared to moderate ionizing sources. Our findings underscore the complex interplay of physical processes in extremely metal-poor environments with bfhigh-ionized gas, offering new insights into the conditions prevailing in the early galaxies.

### 54) [2507.00870](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00870v1): The Evolution of Pop III.1 Protostars Powered by Dark Matter Annihilation. I. Fiducial model and first results

<p>
The existence of billion-solar-mass quasars at redshifts z ≳ 7 poses a formidable challenge to theories of black hole formation, requiring pathways for the rapid growth of massive seeds. Population III.1 stars, forming in pristine, dense dark matter (DM) minihalos, are compelling progenitors. This study presents a suite of stellar evolution models for accreting Pop III.1 protostars, calculated with the scGENEC code. We systematically explore a wide parameter space, spanning ambient WIMP densities of ρ_χ~ 10^12\mbox-10^16 GeV cm^-3 and gas accretion rates of 10^-3\mbox-10^-1 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1, to quantify the effects of DM annihilation. A central finding is that for a protostar to grow to supermassive scales (≳ 10^5   M<sub>&odot;</sub>), the ambient DM density in the immediate vicinity of the star must exceed a critical threshold of ρ_χ ≳ 5 × 10^14   GeV cm^-3. The energy injected by WIMP annihilation inflates the protostar, lowering its surface temperature, which suppresses the ionizing feedback that would otherwise halt accretion and significantly delays the onset of hydrogen fusion. This heating also governs the star's final fate: in dense halos (ρ_χ≳ 10^15 GeV cm^-3), stars remain stable against general relativistic instability beyond 10^6   M<sub>&odot;</sub>, whereas at lower densities (ρ_χ≲ 10^13 GeV cm^-3), they collapse at masses of ~ 5 × 10^5   M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Once the DM fuel is exhausted and core burning commences, the protostar contracts and its ionising photon output can reach very high levels ~ 10^53 s<sup>-1</sup>. These distinct evolutionary phases offer clear observational signatures for the JWST, providing a robust, physically-grounded pathway for forming heavy black hole seeds in the early universe.

### 55) [2506.20479](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20479v2): The MALATANG survey: Dense gas distribution on sub-kiloparsec scales across the disk of M82

Mark Rawlings, Amelie Saintonge, Yi-Chen Sun, Jing Zhou </p>
<p>
We present observations of HCN J=4-3 and HCO^+ J=4-3 lines obtained with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as part of the MALATANG survey, combined with archival HCN J=1-0 and HCO^+ J=1-0 data from the Green Bank Telescope, to study the spatial distribution and excitation conditions of dense molecular gas in the disk of M82. We detect HCN J=4-3 and HCO^+ J=4-3 emission within the central region (&lt; 500 pc) of the galaxy, while the J=1-0 emission lines exhibit a more extended spatial distribution (&gt; 700 pc). The dense gas shows a clear double-lobed structure in both spatial distribution and kinematics, with the HCN and HCO^+ J=4-3 lines in the southwest lobe blueshifted by ~ 40 km/s relative to the J=1-0 lines. The HCN J=4-3/1-0 and HCO^+ J=4-3/1-0 line-luminosity ratios range from 0.09 to 0.53 and from 0.14 to 0.87, respectively, with mean values of 0.18 +/- 0.04 and 0.36 +/- 0.06. The HCN ratio is lower than the typical average observed in nearby star-forming galaxies, whereas the HCO^+ ratio is comparatively higher, suggesting that the high-J HCN emission in M82 is significantly sub-thermally excited. Spatially, the peak values of the J=4-3/1-0 ratios are found in the northwest region of M82, coinciding with the galaxy-scale outflow. Elevated HCN/HCO^+ ratios are also detected in roughly the same area, potentially tracing local excitation enhancements driven by the outflow. The HCN/HCO^+ J=4-3 ratio across all detected regions ranges from 0.19 to 1.07 with a mean value of 0.41 +/- 0.11, which is significantly lower than the average J=1-0 ratio of 0.76 +/- 0.08. Both ratios are significantly lower than the average values observed in nearby star-forming galaxies, which could be related to the relatively low gas density and the presence of an extended photo-dissociation region in M82.

### 56) [2506.19721](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19721v1): MUSE-DARK-I: Dark matter halo properties of intermediate-z star-forming galaxies

<p> B. I. Ciocan, N. F. Bouché, J. Fensch, W. Mercier, D. Krajnović, J. Richard, T. Contini, A. Jeanneau </p>
<p>
[Abridged] We analyse the dark matter (DM) halo properties of 127 0.3&lt;z&lt;1.5 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) down to low stellar masses (7&lt;log(Mstar/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;11), using data from the MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field Survey and photometry from HST and JWST. We employ a 3D forward modelling approach to analyse the morpho-kinematics of our sample, enabling measurement of individual rotation curves out to 2-3 times the effective radius. We perform a disk-halo decomposition with a 3D parametric model that includes stellar, gas, and DM components, with pressure support corrections. We validate our methodology on mock data cubes generated from idealised disk simulations. We select the best-fitting DM model among six density profiles, including the Navarro-Frenk-White and the generalised alpha-beta-gamma profile of Di Cintio et al. (2014, DC14). Our Bayesian analysis shows that DC14 performs as well as or better than the other profiles in &gt;65% of the sample. We find that the kinematically inferred stellar masses agree with values from SED fitting. We find that 89% of galaxies have DM fractions &gt;50%. For 70% of SFGs, we infer a DM inner slope, gamma &lt; 0.5, indicating cored DM profiles, but no correlation is found between gamma and star formation rate of the sample. The stellar- and concentration-mass relations agree with theoretical expectations, but with larger scatter. We confirm the anticorrelation between halo scale radius and DM density. The halo scale radii and DM surface densities increase with Mstar, while DM densities stay constant. We find tentative evidence of an evolution of the DM density with z, which suggests that the DM halos of intermediate-z systems are denser than those of local galaxies. In contrast, the halo scale radii are z-invariant.

<p>
We present a kinematical study of the ionized and molecular gas in the central region (~7-14"~100-200pc) of the nearby radio galaxy Cen A. We used JWST/MIRI MRS 5-28μm observations taken as part of the MIR Characterization of Nearby Iconic galaxy Centers (MICONIC) of the MIRI EC. The two gas phases present contrasting morphologies and kinematics. The brightest emission from the ionized gas, traced with a range of IP lines ([Fe II] to [Ne VI]), is extended along the direction of the radio jet. We also detected emission from low IP emission lines and H<sub>2</sub> transitions in the galaxy disk. Both gas phases present rotational motions but also complex kinematics. The observations reveal several ionized gas kinematical features that are consistent with simulation predictions of a jet-driven bubble and outflow interacting with the galaxy ISM. These include broad components in the nuclear line profiles (σ~600km/s), high velocities (~ +1000, -1400km/s) confined within the nuclear region, velocities of hundreds of km/s in several directions in the central 2", and enhanced velocity dispersions perpendicular to the radio jet. Moreover, we find evidence of shock excitation in the nuclear region based on MIR line ratios. We compared the ionized gas mass outflow rate with Cen A's AGN luminosity and radio jet power and demonstrate that both mechanisms provide sufficient energy to launch the outflow. The noncircular motions observed in the H<sub>2</sub> lines can be reproduced with either a warped rotating disk model or a radial component. The latter might be to related to gas streamers detected in cold molecular gas. There is no clear indication of a fast nuclear H<sub>2</sub> outflow, only a weak blueshifted component. This could be due to a relatively low nuclear warm H<sub>2</sub> column density and/or the limited geometrical coupling of Cen A's inner radio jet with the circumnuclear disk of the galaxy.

<p>
We report the discovery of a little red dot (LRD), dubbed BiRD ('big red dot'), at z=2.33 in the field around the z=6.3 quasar SDSSJ1030+0524. Using NIRCam images, we identified it as a bright outlier in the F200W-F356W color vs F356W magnitude diagram of point sources in the field. The NIRCam/WFSS spectrum reveals the emission from HeIλ10830 and PaG line, both showing a narrow and a broad (FWHM≳ 2000 kms<sup>-1</sup>) component. The HeI line is affected by an absorption feature, tracing dense gas with HeI column density in the 2^3S level N~ 0.5-1.2× 10^14cm<sup>2</sup>, depending on the location of the absorber, which is outflowing at the speed of Δv ~ -830 kms<sup>-1</sup>. As observed in the majority of LRDs, BiRD does not show X-ray or radio emission. The BH mass and the bolometric luminosity, both inferred from the PaG broad component, amount to M_BH~ 10^8M<sub>&odot;</sub> and L_bol~ 2.9× 10^45ergs<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Intriguingly, BiRD presents strict analogies with other two LRDs spectroscopically confirmed at cosmic noon, GN-28074 ("Rosetta Stone") at z=2.26 and RUBIES-BLAGN-1 at z=3.1. The blueshifted HeI absorption detected in all three sources suggests that gas outflows may be common in LRDs. We derive a first estimate of the space density of LRDs at z&lt;3 based on JWST data, as a function of L_bol and BH mass. The space density is only a factor of ~ 2-3 lower than that of UV-selected quasars with comparable L_bol and z, meaning that the contribution of LRDs to the broader AGN population is also relevant at cosmic noon. A similar trend is also observed in terms of BH masses. If, as suggested by recent theories, LRDs probe the very first and rapid growth of black hole seeds, our finding may suggest that the formation of black hole seeds remains efficient at least up to cosmic noon.

<p>
He II λ1640 emission in galaxies indicates the presence of sources that produce extreme ionizing photons. Here, we report the discovery of a He II λ1640 emitting galaxy, GNHeII J1236+6215, at z= 2.9803 in the GOODS-north field. We use photometry in 17 wavebands from near-UV to infrared to characterize the galaxy SED and combine Keck LRIS and JWST NIRSpec spectra to identify 15 emission lines including He II λ1640. We infer that the He^+ ionization in the galaxy could be driven by small pockets of young Population III stars or low-metallicity Very Massive Stars (VMSs) rather than AGN or metal-rich Wolf-Rayet stars. The galaxy has a highly ionized ISM ([OIII]5007/[OII]3727 = 7.28±0.11, [SIII]/[SII] = 1.97±0.48 and detected Lyα, Hα, Hβ, Hγ lines), little reddening by dust (E(B-V) = 0.04±0.12), low metallicity (12 + log(O/H) = 7.85±0.22), and high star formation rate (SFR_SED = 12.2±2.0 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1). In addition to these ISM conditions, we also notice a significant [SII] deficiency ([SII]6718,6732/Hα = 0.08±0.02, Δ[SII] = -0.12) which may indicate the presence of density-bounded optically thin H~II regions that combined with the low dust extinction favor leaking of ionizing Lyman continuum (LyC) photons. Our best-fit SED model also infers a high nebular ionization (log U = -2.0) and a low stellar mass M = 7.8±3.1×10^8M<sub>&odot;</sub>. This discovery not only adds one important object to the known sample of high-redshift He~II emitters but also highlights a potential connection between He^+ ionization and favorable ISM conditions for the leakage of ionizing photons from galaxies.

<p>
The physical nature of Little Red Dots (LRDs) - a population of compact, red galaxies revealed by JWST - remains unclear. Photometric samples are constructed from varying selection criteria with limited spectroscopic follow-up available to test intrinsic spectral shapes and prevalence of broad emission lines. We use the RUBIES survey, a large spectroscopic program with wide color-morphology coverage and homogeneous data quality, to systematically analyze the emission-line kinematics, spectral shapes, and morphologies of ~1500 galaxies at z &gt; 3.1. We identify broad Balmer lines via a novel fitting approach that simultaneously models NIRSpec/PRISM and G395M spectra, yielding 80 broad-line sources with 28 (35%) at z &gt; 6. A large subpopulation naturally emerges from the broad Balmer line sources, with 36 exhibiting `v-shaped' UV-to-optical continua and a dominant point source component in the rest-optical; we define these as spectroscopic LRDs, constituting the largest such sample to date. Strikingly, the spectroscopic LRD population is largely recovered when either a broad line or rest-optical point source is required in combination with a v-shaped continuum, suggesting an inherent link between these three defining characteristics. We compare the spectroscopic LRD sample to published photometric searches. Although these selections have high accuracy, down to F444W&lt;26.5, only 50-62% of the RUBIES LRDs were previously identified. The remainder were missed due to a mixture of faint rest-UV photometry, comparatively blue rest-optical colors, or highly uncertain photometric redshifts. Our findings highlight that well-selected spectroscopic campaigns are essential for robust LRD identification, while photometric criteria require refinement to capture the full population.

### 61) [2506.04310](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04310v2): Fast Rotators at Cosmic Noon: Stellar Kinematics for 15 Quiescent Galaxies from JWST-SUSPENSE

<p>
We present spatially-resolved stellar kinematics of 15 massive (M_*=10^10.5-11.5M<sub>&odot;</sub>) quiescent galaxies at z~1.2-2.3 from the JWST-SUSPENSE program. This is the largest sample of spatially-resolved kinematic measurements of quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon to date. Our measurements are derived from ultra-deep NIRSpec/MSA stellar absorption line spectra, using a forward modelling approach that accounts for optics, source morphology, positioning, and data reduction effects. 10 out of 15 galaxies are orientated such that we can measure rotational support. Remarkably, all 10 galaxies show significant rotation (V_r_e=117-345km/s, σ_0 = 180-387km/s), and are classified as "fast rotators" from their spin parameter. The remaining galaxies are too misaligned with respect to the slit to constrain their rotational velocities. The widespread rotational support in our sample indicates that the process responsible for quenching star formation in early massive galaxies did not destroy rotating disc structures. When combined with other quiescent galaxy samples at z~0.5-2.5, we find a trend between rotational support and age, with younger quiescent galaxies being more rotationally supported. This age trend has also been found at z~0, and likely explains why our high-redshift galaxies show more rotational support compared to massive ETGs at z~0, which are, on average, older. Our kinematic modelling also enables us to calculate dynamical masses. These dynamical masses greatly exceed the stellar masses for our sample (median M_dyn/M_*=2.7); they even allow for the bottom-heavy IMF found in the cores of low-z massive ellipticals. Altogether, our results support a scenario in which distant quiescent galaxies evolve into nearby massive ETGs, gradually building up their outskirts and simultaneously losing rotation, due to a series of (mostly minor) mergers.

### 62) [2506.03242](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03242v2): Age dependence of Lyα escape fraction of Lyα emitters and their significant role in cosmic reionization

We study the Lyα escape fraction, f<sub>esc</sub>^Lyα of Lyα emitters (LAEs) identified by Subaru/HSC narrowband imaging at z = 2.2-6.6, using publicly available deep imaging data from HST and JWST. We perform SED fitting for 127 LAEs at 0.4 - 5.0  μm to estimate their physical properties robustly, and confirm that two distinct LAE populations exist: young LAEs (&lt; 100 Myr) and old LAEs (&gt; 100 Myr). Young LAEs are characterized by burst-like star formation activity and low dust content, significantly differing from Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at the same stellar mass, while old LAEs show similar star formation activity to LBGs, yet with lower dust content and more compact morphology in rest-UV/optical than LBGs. The f<sub>esc</sub>^Lyα of LAEs is anticorrelated with stellar mass, and this correlation is found to depend on the age of LAEs, such that old LAEs show a weaker anticorrelation than young LAEs, and tend to exhibit higher f<sub>esc</sub>^Lyα than young LAEs at a given stellar mass. This implies that Lyα photons escape more efficiently from old LAEs, possibly through the low-density channels of HI and dust created by outflows. The average f<sub>esc</sub>^Lyα of young LAEs remains nearly constant at ~40% at z = 2.2-6.6, suggesting that the previously observed evolution of global f<sub>esc</sub>^Lyα of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is due to the changes in the LAE fraction among the SFGs. Converting f<sub>esc</sub>^Lyα to Lyman continuum escape fraction using empirical relations, we demonstrate that LAEs alone can supply the ionizing photons necessary for reionization at z~6, causing rapid and late reionization.

Planet-forming disks around brown dwarfs and very low-mass stars (VLMS) are on average less massive and are expected to undergo faster radial solid transport than their higher mass counterparts. Spitzer had detected C_2H<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub> and HCN around these objects. With better sensitivity and spectral resolving power, JWST recently revealed incredibly carbon-rich spectra from such disks. A study of a larger sample of objects is necessary to understand how common such carbon-rich inner disk regions are and to put constraints on their evolution. We present and analyze MIRI observations of 10 disks around VLMS from the MIRI GTO program. This sample is diverse, with the central object ranging in mass from 0.02 to 0.14 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. They are located in three star-forming regions and a moving group (1-10 Myr). We identify molecular emission in all sources and report detection rates. We compare the molecular flux ratios between different species and to dust emission strengths. We also compare the flux ratios with the stellar and disk properties. The spectra of these VLMS disks are extremely molecular rich, and we detect the 10 μm silicate dust emission feature in 70% of the sample. We detect C_2H<sub>2</sub> and HCN in all of the sources and find larger hydrocarbons such as C_4H<sub>2</sub> and C_6H_6 in nearly all sources. Among O-bearing molecules, we find firm detections of CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, and CO in 90%, 50%, and 20% of the sample, respectively. We find that the detection rates of organic molecules correlate with other organic molecules and anti-correlate with inorganic molecules. Hydrocarbon-rich sources show a weaker 10μm dust strength as well as lower disk dust mass than the oxygen-rich sources. We find potential evidence for C/O enhancement with disk age. The observed trends are consistent with models that suggest rapid inward solid material transport and grain growth.

The evolution of interstellar ices can be studied with thermal tracers such as the vibrational modes of CO<sub>2</sub> ice that show great diversity depending on their local chemical and thermal environment. In this work we present JWST observations of the 15.2 μm bending mode, the 4.39 μm stretching mode and the 2.70 μm combination mode of ^12CO<sub>2</sub> and ^13CO<sub>2</sub> ice in the high-mass protostar IRAS 20126 and the low-mass protostar Per-emb 35. The 15.2 μm bending mode of both protostars shows the characteristic double peak profile that is associated with pure CO<sub>2</sub> ice and a sharp short-wavelength peak is observed at 4.38 μm in the ^13CO<sub>2</sub> bands of the two sources. Furthermore, a narrow short-wavelength feature is detected at 2.69 μm in the ^12CO<sub>2</sub> combination mode of Per-emb 35. We perform a consistent profile decomposition on all three vibrational modes and show that the profiles of all three bands can be reproduced with the same linear combination of CO<sub>2</sub> ice in mixtures with mostly CH_3OH and H<sub>2</sub>O ices when the ices undergo segregation due to heating. The findings show that upon heating, CO<sub>2</sub> ice is likely segregating from mostly the water-rich ice layer and the CO<sub>2</sub>-CH_3OH component becomes dominant in all three vibrational modes. Additionally, we find that the contribution of the different CO<sub>2</sub> components to the total absorption band is similar for both ^12CO<sub>2</sub> and ^13CO<sub>2</sub>. This indicates that fractionation processes must not play a significant role during the different formation epochs, H<sub>2</sub>O-dominated and CO-dominated. We quantify the ^12CO<sub>2</sub> and ^13CO<sub>2</sub> ice column densities and derive ^12C/^13C_ice = 90 ± 9 in IRAS 20126. Finally, we report the detection of the ^13CO<sub>2</sub> bending mode of pure CO<sub>2</sub> ice at 15.64 μm in both IRAS 20126 and Per-emb 35.

### 65) [2505.12867](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12867v1): The Dichotomy in the Nuclear and Host Galaxy Properties of High-redshift Quasars

<p> Ruancun Li, Luis C. Ho, Chang-Hao Chen </p>
<p>
The early growth of high-redshift quasars and their host galaxies raises critical questions about their cosmic evolution. We exploit the angular resolution and sensitivity of NIRCam to investigate the host galaxies of 31 quasars at 4≲ z≲7 drawn from multiple JWST surveys. Using a new multi-band forward-modeling code (scGalfitS) that incorporates physically motivated priors, we securely detect and quantify the host emission in 30 objects, while simultaneously characterizing the nuclear spectral energy distribution. The host galaxies of high-redshift quasars are ~ 0.3~dex more compact than star-forming galaxies of comparable mass. A striking dichotomy emerges: luminous "blue'' quasars (L_5100≳10^45 erg s<sup>-1</sup>) reside in bulge-dominated galaxies (n ≈ 5) and exhibit a narrow range of ultraviolet nuclear slopes (median β_UV ≈ -1.4), while fainter "red'' quasars inhabit disk-like hosts (n≈ 1) and display a broad range of slopes (β_UV≈-2 to 4). These two populations differ markedly in their black hole-to-stellar mass ratios, with high-luminosity quasars showing M_BH/M<sub>&ast;</sub> = 1.2&percnt; compared to 4.7&percnt; for lower luminosity sources, placing them collectively ~0.6~dex above the local M_BH-M<sub>&ast;</sub> relation. This offset likely reflects rapid black hole growth in early gas-rich environments, where feedback from the active galactic nucleus becomes effective only after substantial gas depletion. Our findings suggest that the observed dichotomy, whether due to intrinsic spectral differences or dust extinction, fundamentally shapes the coevolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies in the early Universe.

<p>
The abundant population of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs)-compact objects with red UV to optical colors and broad Balmer lines at high redshift-is unveiling new insights into the properties of early active galactic nuclei (AGN). Perhaps the most surprising features of this population are the presence of Balmer absorption and ubiquitous strong Balmer breaks. Recent models link these features to an active supermassive black hole (SMBH) cocooned in very dense gas (N_H~10^24 cm<sup>2</sup>). We present a stringent test of such models using VLT/MUSE observations of A2744-45924, the most luminous LRD known to date (L_Hα≈10^44~erg s<sup>-1</sup>), located behind the Abell-2744 lensing cluster at z=4.464 (μ=1.8). We detect a moderately extended Lyα nebula (h≈5.7 pkpc), spatially offset from the point-like Hα seen by JWST. The Lyα emission is narrow (FWHM=270± 15~km s<sup>-1</sup>), spatially offset to Hα, and faint (Lyα=0.07Hα) compared to Lyα nebulae typically observed around quasars of similar luminosity. We detect compact N IV]λ1486 emission, spatially aligned with Hα, and a spatial shift in the far-UV continuum matching the Lyα offset. We discuss that Hα and Lyα have distinct physical origins: Hα originates from the AGN, while Lyα is powered by star formation. In the environment of A2744-45924, we identify four extended Lyα halos (Δz&lt;0.02, Δr&lt;100 pkpc). Their Lyα luminosities match expectations based on Hα emission, indicating no evidence for radiation from A2744-45924 affecting its surroundings. The lack of strong, compact, and broad Lyα and the absence of a luminous extended halo, suggest that the UV AGN light is obscured by dense gas cloaking the SMBH with covering factor close to unity.

<p>
The embedded phase is a crucial period in the development of a young star. Mid-IR observations, now possible with JWST with unprecedented sensitivity, spectral resolution and sharpness are key for probing many physical and chemical processes on sub-arcsecond scales. JOYS addresses a wide variety of questions, from protostellar accretion and the nature of primeval jets, winds and outflows, to the chemistry of gas and ice, and the characteristics of embedded disks. We introduce the program and show representative results. MIRI-MRS data of 17 low-mass and 6 high-mass protostars show a wide variety of features. Atomic line maps differ among refractory (e.g., Fe), semi-refractory (e.g., S) and volatile elements (e.g., Ne), linked to their different levels of depletion and local (shock) conditions. Nested, stratified jet structures consisting of an inner ionized core seen in [Fe II] with an outer H2 layer are commonly seen. Wide-angle winds are found in low-J H2 lines. [S I] follows the jet in the youngest protostars, but is concentrated on source when more evolved. [Ne II] reveals a mix of jet shock and photoionized emission. H I lines measure accretion, but are also associated with jets. Molecular emission (CO2, C2H2, HCN, H2O, ..) is cool compared with disks, and likely associated with hot cores. Deep ice absorption features reveal not just the major ice components but also ions (as part of salts) and complex organic molecules, with comparable abundances from low- to high-mass sources. A second detection of HDO ice in a solar-mass source is presented with HDO/H2O ~ 0.4%, providing a link with disks and comets. A deep search for solid O2 suggests it is not a significant oxygen reservoir. Only few embedded Class I disks show the same forest of water lines as Class II disks do, perhaps due to significant dust extinction of the upper layers [abridged].

<p> Mengtao Tang, Daniel P. Stark, Adèle Plat, Anna Feltre, Harley Katz, Peter Senchyna, Charlotte A. Mason, Lily Whitler, Zuyi Chen, Michael W. Topping </p>
<p>
JWST spectroscopy has built large emission line samples at z≳4, but it has yet to confidently reveal many galaxies with the hard radiation fields commonly associated with AGN photoionization. While this may indicate a weaker UV ionizing spectrum in many z&gt;4 AGNs or obscuration from dense neutral gas and dust, the complete picture remains unclear owing to the small number of deep rest-UV spectra. Here we characterize the strength of high ionization lines in 53 new galaxies observed with NIRSpec R=2700 grating spectroscopy. We present new detections of narrow NV&lambda;1240 in two galaxies. One is a previously-confirmed z=6.98 Little Red Dot (LRD) with broad Hβ, and the other is a z=8.72 galaxy with a narrow line spectrum. Neither source exhibits CIV or HeII emission, indicating large NV/CIV and NV/HeII ratios that may reflect a combination of nitrogen-enhancement and resonant scattering effects. We investigate the incidence of narrow high ionization lines in a large database of 851 NIRSpec grating spectra, and we separately quantify the fraction of LRDs with narrow high ionization UV emission lines. Our results likely suggest that hard radiation fields are indeed present in a small subset of LRDs (12.5^+23.7_-10.4&percnt;) and UV-selected galaxies (2.2^+1.7_-1.0&percnt;) at z&gt;4. The identification of narrow high ionization lines in the population of LRDs with strong Balmer absorption suggests the dense neutral hydrogen gas may not uniformly cover the nucleus. The strong NV (coupled with weak CIV and HeII) suggests that efforts to identify high ionization lines should extend down in wavelength to the NV doublet.

### 69) [2505.03183](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03183v1): The Physical Nature of the Off-centered Extended Emission Associated with the Little Red Dots

<p> Chang-Hao Chen, Luis C. Ho, Ruancun Li, Kohei Inayoshi </p>
<p>
A significant fraction of little red dots (LRDs) exhibit nearby extended emission of unknown origin. If physically associated with the LRD, this component may trace stellar emission from an off-centered host galaxy, neighboring companions, or nebular gas illuminated by the active nucleus. We investigate the detailed spectral energy distribution of the extended emission near four LRDs in the JWST UNCOVER and MegaScience surveys. We accurately decompose the extended emission from the dominant point source by simultaneously fitting the images in eight broad-band and nine medium-band filters. After considering both the results from photometric redshift fitting and the probability of galaxies at different redshift overlapping, we confirm that the off-centered blobs in three sources are physically associated with the LRDs, with two of them showing strong [\ionO 3] λλ4959, 5007 emission captured by the medium-band filters. While the spectral energy distributions of all three blobs can be modeled assuming star-forming galaxies with stellar mass ~ 10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, the exceptionally strong [\ionO 3] emission of two sources is best interpreted as pure nebular emission from low-density (n&lt;10  cm^-3), low-metallicity (Z≈ 0.05 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) gas photoionized by the ultraviolet radiation from the nearby LRD. Adopting LRD halo masses constrained by clustering measurements and theoretical considerations, we estimate a typical baryonic halo mass accretion rate of ~ 2-9  M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1. If the halo accretion rate is sustained to z=4 and stars form with an efficiency of 10&percnt;, the accreted gas would form a galaxy with stellar mass ~ 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, potentially rendering them spatially resolved at lower redshift.

We present the morphological properties of 17 spectroscopically confirmed massive quiescent galaxies (10.2 &lt; log(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &lt; 11.2) at 3.0 &lt; z &lt; 4.3, observed with JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam. Using Sérsic profile fits to F277W and F444W imaging, we derive the size-mass relation and find typical sizes of ~0.6&ndash;0.8 kpc at M<sub>&ast;</sub> = 5 × 10^10~M<sub>&odot;</sub>, consistent with ~7× growth from z ~ 4 to the present, including ~2× by z ~ 2. We find tentative evidence that formation history and morphology jointly influence galaxy sizes: late-forming bulge-dominated galaxies appear more compact by ~0.2-0.3 dex relative to the expected relation, while late-forming disk-dominated galaxies are larger. Using a random forest regressor, we identify local environmental density, quantified by log(1+δ^&prime;_3) from the three nearest neighbors, as the strongest predictor of bulge-to-total ratio (B/T), which spans 0.25-1. In the \sc IllustrisTNG simulation, the ex-situ stellar mass fraction (f<sub>&ast;</sub>,ex-situ) &ndash; a proxy for mergers &ndash; is instead the dominant predictor of B/T. Galaxies with high B/T in dense environments show bursty star formation and short quenching timescales (≲0.4 Gyr), consistent with bulge growth through merger-driven starbursts; in simulations, such systems exhibit elevated ex-situ fractions (~20-30%). In contrast, some high-B/T galaxies in intermediate-density environments have low ex-situ fractions, suggesting that additional processes &ndash; such as violent disk instabilities &ndash; also contribute. These results point to multiple bulge growth pathways at high redshift, unified by rapid gas accretion, central starbursts, and AGN feedback, as predicted by cosmological simulations.

<p>
Galaxies grow alongside their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs), linked through fueling and feedback. However, the origins and details of this co-evolution remain unclear and differ significantly amongst modeling frameworks. Using a suite of semi-analytic models (SAMs), we trace SMBH mass assembly across M_BH ~ 10^6-10, M<sub>&odot;</sub>. We find significant discrepancies between observations and physics-based models of the local black hole mass function (BHMF), likely due to differences in the underlying stellar mass function and the scaling relations therefrom used to infer the BHMF. However, most physics-based models agree at z ~ 1-4 and align reasonably well with broad-line AGN BHMF from JWST observations at z=4-5. Most physics-based models reproduce the bolometric AGN luminosity evolution, except \sc Dark Sage, which predicts an excess deviating from models and observations. Interestingly, this pronounced "knee' in the bolometric AGN luminosity function predicted by \sc Dark Sage around L_bol ~ 10^46   erg   s<sup>-1</sup> is consistent with the inferred luminosity of "Little Red Dots'' at z=5-6, assuming that their entire emission originates from AGN activity. We analyze black hole mass build-up and accretion histories in \sc Dark Sage, which, unlike other models, allows for super-Eddington accretion. We report that on average, SMBHs in \sc Dark Sage primarily grow through secular disk instabilities and merger-driven cold gas accretion, while black hole mergers contribute 60&percnt; of the total mass budget only for the most massive SMBHs by z=0.

<p>
Extended emission line nebulae around galaxies or active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide a unique window to investigate the galactic ecosystem through the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Using Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam narrow-band imaging and spectroscopic follow-up, we serendipitously discover "Oxyster" - a large ionized nebula next to an interacting starburst galaxy at z=0.924. The nebula is traced by extended [OII]3726,3729 (~ 30 kpc) and [OIII]5007 (~ 20 kpc) emission lines. On the nebula luminosity-size plane, Oxyster surpasses the extended narrow-line regions around low-z AGNs, resembling a higher-z analog of "Hanny's Voorwerp". However, its uniformly low [OIII]/[OII] ratio (O32) sets it apart from typical AGN light echoes. For the host galaxy, HST and JWST images reveal a disturbed red disk galaxy with a single blue spiral "arm". Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting suggests the 2-6× 10^10 ~M<sub>&odot;</sub> host galaxy sits above the star-forming main sequence with an ongoing starburst, especially in the "arm", and have &lt;5&percnt; luminosity contribution from AGN, consistent with X-ray non-detection and radio continuum. Standard photoionization and shock models struggle to explain simultaneously Oxyster's emission line luminosities, low O32 ratio, and the non-detection of Hβ line. A plausible explanation could involve the combination of a recent (&lt;10^8 yrs) starburst and a low-luminosity AGN (L_bol ~ 1×10^42 erg/s). While Oxyster's nature awaits future investigation, its discovery highlights the potential of ground-based narrow-band imaging to uncover extended emission line nebulae around non-AGN systems, opening new avenues for studying the CGM of normal galaxies in the early Universe.

<p>
We report the discovery of 13 broad-line AGNs at z = 5 - 8 from the first 10% data of the JWST Cycle 3 Treasury Program COSMOS-3D. These AGNs are identified by their broad Hα or Hβ emission lines through the NIRCam grism wide-field slitless spectroscopy. One object at z = 7.646 with broad Hβ emission has an F444W magnitude of 23.6 mag, making it one of the brightest z &gt; 7.5 broad-line AGNs yet known. Among the 13 AGNs, 10 objects have reddened optical continua with slopes β_opt&gt;0. The remaining three objects have their overall SEDs that resemble those of UV-luminous quasars at similar redshifts, but their β_opt, though negative, are not as blue as those of unobscured quasars. We also obtain MIRI photometry at 7.7-18 μm for two AGNs and place strong constraints on their rest-frame near-IR SED. We find no significant variability in the rest-frame UV by comparing the COSMOS-3D and COSMOS-Web F115W images taken apart by 60 days in the rest-frame. We compute the Hα luminosity functions (LFs) for the broad Hα emitters at z ≈ 5-6 and find a potential redshift evolution when compared with that of the z ≈ 4-5 sample. We also derive the Hβ LF at z~8 for AGNs and galaxies by combining our sample with those from the literature. The broad Hβ emitters in this work suggest a number density two orders of magnitude higher than that predicted by the quasar LF based on rest-frame UV-selected samples. As a preview, our work showcases the ability of the COSMOS-3D grism survey to provide a complete view of the properties, growth, and evolution of bright broad-line AGNs at z&gt;5.

<p>
We measure galaxy sizes from 2 &lt; z &lt; 10 using COSMOS-Web, the largest-area JWST imaging survey to date, covering ~0.54 deg<sup>2</sup>. We analyze the rest-frame optical (~5000A) size evolution and its scaling relation with stellar mass (R_e&prop; M_*^α) for star-forming and quiescent galaxies. For star-forming galaxies, the slope α remains approximately 0.20 at 2 &lt; z &lt; 8, showing no significant evolution over this redshift range. At higher redshifts, the slopes are -0.13 ± 0.15 and 0.37 ± 0.36 for 8 &lt; z &lt; 9 and 9 &lt; z &lt; 10, respectively. At fixed galaxy mass, the size evolution for star-forming galaxies follows R_e &prop; (1+z)^-β, with β= 1.21 ± 0.05. For quiescent galaxies, the slope is steeper α~ 0.5-0.8 at 2 &lt; z &lt; 5, and β=0.81±0.26. We find that the size-mass relation is consistent between UV and optical at z &lt; 8 for star-forming galaxies. However, we observe a decrease in the slope from UV to optical at z &gt; 8, with a tentative negative slope in the optical at 8 &lt; z &lt; 9, suggesting a complex interplay between intrinsic galaxy properties and observational effects such as dust attenuation. We discuss the ratio between galaxies' half-light radius, and underlying halos' virial radius, R_vir, and find the median value of R_e/R_vir=2.7&percnt;. The star formation rate surface density evolves as logΣ_SFR = (0.20±0.08) z+(-0.65±0.51), and the Σ_SFR-M_* relation remains flat at 2&lt;z&lt;10. Lastly, we identify a threshold in stellar mass surface density logΣ_e~9.5-10  M<sub>&odot;</sub>/kpc<sup>2</sup> marking the transition to compact, quenched galaxies from extended, star-forming progenitors. In summary, our findings show that the extensive COSMOS-Web dataset at z &gt; 3 provides new insights into galaxy size and related properties in the rest-frame optical.

### 75) [2504.04683](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.04683v1): Probing the Cosmic Reionization History with JWST: Gunn-Peterson and Lyα Damping Wing Absorption at 4.5 &lt; z &lt; 13

<p> Hiroya Umeda, Masami Ouchi, Yuta Kageura, Yuichi Harikane, Minami Nakane, Tran Thi Thai, Kimihiko Nakajima </p>
<p>
We present a statistical analysis of Lyα absorption using 581 galaxies at z=4.5-13 observed with multiple JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy programs, including JADES, UNCOVER, CEERS, and GO/DDT. We carefully construct composite spectra binned by redshift with homogeneous UV properties (UV magnitudes, UV slopes, and Lyα equivalent widths) and identify significant Lyα forest signals in galaxies at z~5-6, which diminish toward higher redshifts. We also find UV continuum breaks at rest-frame 1216Å that soften beyond z≳6, confirming the effects of cosmic reionization through a self-consistent transition from Gunn-Peterson to Lyα damping wing absorption in galaxies. Fair comparisons of composite spectra with matched UV magnitudes and slopes across redshift reveal that UV-faint galaxies clearly show stronger Lyα absorption than UV-bright galaxies towards high redshift, providing insights into the topological evolution of reionization. We estimate Lyα transmission at the Gunn-Peterson trough and Lyα damping wing absorption by comparing the galaxy spectra to low-z (z~2-5) galaxy templates that include galactic and circumgalactic absorption and Lyα emission. Using these measurements together with reionization simulations, we derive volume average neutral hydrogen fractions of &langle; x_HI &rangle; = 0.00^+0.12_-0.00, 0.25^+0.10_-0.20, 0.65^+0.27_-0.35, 1.00^+0.00_-0.20, and 1.00^+0.00_-0.40 at z~5, 6, 7, 9, and 10, respectively. These values align with a reionization history characterized by a rapid transition around z~7-8, consistent with Lyα emitter observations. While the physical driver of this rapid reionization remains unclear, it may involve the emergence of hidden AGN populations and/or the onset of Lyman-continuum escape from galaxies.

### 76) [2504.03367](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.03367v1): Infrared bubble recognition in the Milky Way and beyond using deep learning

<p>
We propose a deep learning model that can detect Spitzer bubbles accurately using two-wavelength near-infrared data acquired by the Spitzer Space Telescope and JWST. The model is based on the Single Shot MultiBox Detector as an object detection model, trained and validated using Spitzer bubbles identified by the Milky Way Project (MWP-Bubble). We found that using only MWP-Bubbles with clear structures, along with normalization and data augmentation, significantly improved performance. To reduce the dataset bias, we also use the data without bubbles in the dataset selected by combining two techniques: negative sampling and clustering. The model was optimized by hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian optimization. Applying this model to a test region of the Galactic plane resulted in a 98 &percnt; detection rate for MWP-Bubbles with 8 μ m emission clearly encompassing 24 μ m emission. Additionally, we applied the model to a broader area of 1&deg; ≤ |l| ≤ 65&deg;, |b| ≤ 1&deg;, including both training and validation regions, and the model detected 3,006 bubbles, of which 1,413 were newly detected. We also attempted to detect bubbles in the high-mass star-forming region Cygnus X, as well as in the external galaxies Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and NGC 628. The model successfully detected Spitzer bubbles in these external galaxies, though it also detected Mira-type variable stars and other compact sources that can be difficult to distinguish from Spitzer bubbles. The detection process takes only a few hours, demonstrating the efficiency in detecting bubble structures. Furthermore, the method used for detecting Spitzer bubbles was applied to detect shell-like structures observable only in the 8 μ m emission band, leading to the detection of 469 shell-like structures in the LMC and 143 in NGC 628.

### 77) [2504.03156](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.03156v2): Comprehensive JWST+ALMA Study on the Extended Lyα Emitters, Himiko and CR7 at z~ 7: Blue Major Merger Systems in Stark Contrast to Submillimeter Galaxies

<p>
We present various properties of two bright extended Lyα objects, Himiko and CR7, at z=6.6 thoroughly investigated with JWST/NIRCam photometry, NIRSpec-IFU spectroscopy, and ALMA data, uncovering their physical origins. Himiko (CR7) shows at least five (four) clumps with small separations of 2.4&ndash;7.3 kpc and velocity offsets of Δv&lt;220~km~s<sup>-1</sup> in the [OIII]λ&lambda;4959,5007 line maps, three of which exhibit stellar components with comparable stellar masses ranging in log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=8.4&ndash;9.0 (8.3&ndash;8.8), indicative of major merger systems that are consistent with our numerical simulations. The [CII]158μm and Lyα lines are found in the middle of two clumps (the brightest clump) in Himiko (CR7), suggesting that the distribution of neutral gas does not always coincide with that of ionized gas or stars in merging processes. We find that some of the clumps have broad [OIII] components (250&ndash;400~km~s<sup>-1</sup>) in Himiko and CR7, likely tracing outflow and tidal features, while the central clump in Himiko presents a broad Hα (~1000~km~s<sup>-1</sup>) line explained by an AGN with a low mass black hole of M_BH=10^6.6~M<sub>&odot;</sub>, which contribute to the extended and bright nature of Himiko and CR7. We find low metallicities of 12+log(O/H)=7.9&ndash;8.1 in Himiko and CR7 based on auroral [OIII]&lambda;4363 and strong lines that are consistent with no 1-mm continuum detection corresponding to the dust mass limits of M_dust≲ 9× 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Himiko and CR7 are metal- and dust-poor blue merger systems with stellar and dust masses ≳2 orders of magnitude smaller than the massive dust-rich merger systems represented by submillimeter galaxies.

### 78) [2504.02136](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02136v1): Mid-infrared extinction curve for protostellar envelopes from JWST-detected embedded jet emission: the case of TMC1A

<p>
Context: Dust grains are key components of the interstellar medium and play a central role in star formation, acting as catalysts for chemical reactions and as building blocks of planets. Extinction curves are essential for characterizing dust properties, but mid-infrared (MIR) extinction remains less constrained in protostellar environments. Gas-phase line ratios from embedded protostellar jets provide a spatially resolved method for probing extinction through protostellar envelopes, complementing background starlight approaches. Aims: We aim to derive MIR extinction curves along sightlines toward a protostellar jet embedded in an envelope and assess whether they differ from those in dense molecular clouds. Methods: We analyze JWST NIRSpec IFU and MIRI MRS observations of four positions along the blue-shifted TMC1A jet. We extract observed [Fe II] line intensities and model intrinsic ratios using the Cloudy spectral synthesis code across a range of electron densities and temperatures. By comparing observed near-IR (NIR) and MIR line ratios to Cloudy predictions, we infer the relative extinction between NIR and MIR wavelengths. Results: Electron densities (ne) derived from NIR [Fe II] lines range from ~5 x 10^4 to ~5 x 10^3 cm^-3 at scales &lt;~350 AU. MIR extinction values show stronger reddening than the empirical dark cloud curve from McClure (2009) at similar ne and temperatures (~10^3 to 10^4 K). If MIR emission arises from cooler, lower-density gas, extinction curves remain consistent with background starlight measurements. Conclusions: This method enables spatially resolved MIR extinction curves in embedded protostellar systems. Results suggest either a change in dust size distribution (e.g., from grain growth) or that MIR emission originates from cooler, less dense regions than NIR emission. (Abstract shortened for arXiv.

<p>
Type-2 quasars (QSO2s) are active galactic nuclei (AGN) seen through a significant amount of dust and gas that obscures the central supermassive black hole and the broad line region. Here we present new mid-infrared spectra of the central kiloparsec of five optically-selected QSO2s at redshift z~0.1 obtained with JWST/MIRI/MRS. These QSO2s belong to the QSOFEED sample and they have log Lbol=45.5-46.0 erg/s, global SFRs that place them above the main sequence, and practically identical optical spectral shape and [OIII] luminosity, but their nuclear mid-infrared spectra exhibit an unexpected diversity of both continua and features. They show: 1) 9.7 micron silicate features going from emission (strength of S9.7=0.5) to relatively strong absorption (S9.7=-1.0) and 18 and 23 micron silicates either in emission or flat. In addition, two of the QSO2s show absorption bands of CO, H2O, and aliphatic grains, indicating different levels of nuclear obscuration across the sample. 2) [NeV]/[NeII] ratios ranging from 0.1 to 2.1 and [NeIII]/[NeII] from 1.0 to 3.5, indicating different coronal line and ionizing continuum strengths. 3) Warm molecular gas masses of 1-4x10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and warm-to-cold gas mass ratios of 1-2%, with molecular gas excitation likely due to jet-induced shocks in J1430+1339, and to UV heating and/or turbulence in J1509+0434. 4) PAH emission features with equivalent widths ranging from &lt;0.002 to 0.075 micron, from which we measure a larger contribution from neutral molecules (PAH 11.3/6.2=1.3-3.4) and SFRs&lt;3-7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr. This unprecedented dataset allowed us to start exploring the role of various AGN and galaxy properties including ionizing continuum, obscuration, electron density, and jet-ISM interactions on some of the spectral differences listed above, but larger samples are now required to fully understand the diversity of QSO2s' nuclear mid-infrared spectra.

<p>
We investigate the intrinsic and observational properties of z≳ 6 galaxies hosting coalescing massive black holes (MBHs) that gives rise to gravitational waves (GWs) detectable with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We adopt a zoom-in cosmological hydrodynamical simulation of galaxy formation and black hole (BH) co-evolution, zoomed-in on a M_h ~ 10^12~M<sub>&odot;</sub> dark matter halo at z = 6, which hosts a fast accreting super-massive black hole (SMBH) and a star-forming galaxy. Following the SMBH formation backward in time, we identify the merging events that concurred to its formation and we pick up the ones that are detectable with LISA. Among these LISA detectable events (LDEs), we select those that, based on their intrinsic properties are expected to be bright in one or more electromagnetic (EM) bands. We post-process these events with dust radiative transfer calculations to make predictions about their spectral energy distributions and continuum maps in the JWST to ALMA wavelength range. We compare the spectra arising from galaxies hosting the merging MBHs with those arising from AGN powered by single accreting BHs. We find that it will be impossible to identify an LDE from the continuum SEDs because of the absence of specific imprints from the merging MBHs. We also compute the profile of the H_α line arising from LDEs, considering the contribution from their star-forming regions and the accreting MBHs. We find that the presence of two accreting MBHs would be difficult to infer even if both MBHs accrete at super-Eddington rates. We conclude that the combined detection of GW and EM signals from z≳ 6 MBHs is challenging not only because of the poor sky-localization provided by LISA, but also because the loudest GW emitters are not massive enough to leave significant signatures in the emission lines arising from the broad line region.

Recent studies of gas kinematics at high redshift have reported disky systems which appear to challenge models of galaxy formation, but it is unclear whether they are representative of the underlying galaxy population. We present the first statistical sample of spatially resolved ionised gas kinematics at high redshift, comprised of 272 Hα emitters in GOODS-S and GOODS-N at redshifts z≈3.9-6.5, observed with JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopy and imaging from JADES, FRESCO and CONGRESS. The sample probes two orders of magnitude in stellar mass (log (M<sub>&sext;</sub>[M<sub>&odot;</sub>])≈8-10) and star formation rate (SFR≈0.3-100\thinspace M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr), and is representative down to log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>[M<sub>&odot;</sub>])≈ 9. Using a novel inference tool, ttgeko, we model the grism data to measure morphological and kinematic properties of the ionised gas, as probed by Hα. Our results are consistent with a decrease of the rotational support v/σ_0 and increase of the velocity dispersion σ_0 with redshift, with σ_0≈100 km/s and v/σ_0≈1-2 at z≈3.9-6.5. We study the relations between σ_0, and v/σ_0, and different star formation tracers and find a large scatter and diversity, with the strongest correlations between σ_0 and SFR and SFR surface density. The fraction of rotationally supported systems (v/σ_0&gt;1) slightly increases with cosmic time, from (36±6)&percnt; to (41±6)&percnt; from z~ 5.5 to z~ 4.5, for galaxies with masses 9&lt;log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>[M<sub>&odot;</sub>])&lt;10. Overall, disks do not dominate the turbulent high-redshift galaxy population in the mass range probed by this work. When placed in the context of studies up to cosmic noon, our results are consistent with a significant increase of disk-like systems with cosmic time.

Almost all globular clusters (GCs) contain multiple populations consisting of stars with varying helium and light-element abundances. These populations include first-population stars, which exhibit similar chemical compositions to halo-field stars with comparable [Fe/H], and second-population stars, characterized by enhanced He and N abundances along with reduced levels of O and C. Nowadays, one of the most intriguing open questions about GCs pertains to the formation and evolution of their multiple populations. Recent works based on N-body simulations of GCs show that the fractions and characteristics of binary stars can serve as dynamic indicators of the formation period of multiple-population in GCs and their subsequent dynamical evolution. Nevertheless, the incidence of binaries among multiple populations is still poorly studied. Moreover, the few available observational studies are focused only on the bright stars of a few GCs. In this work, we use deep images of the GC 47 Tucanae collected with the JWST and HST to investigate the incidence of binaries among multiple populations of M-dwarfs and bright main-sequence stars. To reach this objective, we use UV, optical, and near infrared filters to construct photometric diagrams that allow us to disentangle binary systems and multiple populations. Moreover, we compared these observations with a large sample of simulated binaries. In the cluster central regions, the incidence of binaries among first-population stars is only slightly higher than that of second-population stars. In contrast, in the external regions, the majority (&gt;85%) of the studied binaries are composed of first population stars. Results are consistent with the GC formation scenarios where the second-population stars originate in the cluster's central region, forming a compact and dense stellar group within a more extended system of first-population stars

### 83) [2503.16600](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16600v2): A remarkable Ruby: Absorption in dense gas, rather than evolved stars, drives the extreme Balmer break of a Little Red Dot at z=3.5

The origin of the rest-optical emission of compact, red, high-redshift sources known as `little red dots' (LRDs) poses a major puzzle. If interpreted as starlight, it would imply that LRDs would constitute the densest stellar systems in the Universe. However, alternative models suggest active galactic nuclei (AGN) may instead power the rest-optical continuum. Here, we present JWST/NIRSpec, NIRCam and MIRI observations from the RUBIES and PRIMER programs of The Cliff: a bright LRD at z=3.55 with an exceptional Balmer break, twice as strong as that of any high-redshift source previously observed. The spectra also reveal broad Hydrogen (Hα FWHM~1500km/s) and He I emission, but no significant metal lines. We demonstrate that massive evolved stellar populations cannot explain the observed spectrum, even when considering unusually steep and strong dust attenuation, or reasonable variations in the initial mass function. Moreover, the formally best-fit stellar mass and compact size (M_*~10^10.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, r_e~40 pc) would imply densities at which near-monthly stellar collisions might lead to significant X-ray emission. We argue that the Balmer break, emission lines, and Hα absorption line are instead most plausibly explained by a `black hole star' (BH*) scenario, in which dense gas surrounds a powerful ionising source. In contrast to recently proposed BH* models of dust-reddened AGN, we show that spectral fits in the rest UV to near-infrared favour an intrinsically redder continuum over strong dust reddening. This may point to a super-Eddington accreting massive black hole or, possibly, the presence of (super)massive stars in a nuclear star cluster. The Cliff is the clearest evidence to date that at least some LRDs are not ultra-dense, massive galaxies, and are instead powered by a central ionising source embedded in dense, absorbing gas.

We report the discovery of a galaxy proto-cluster candidate (dubbed MACS0416-OD-z8p5) at a spectroscopic redshift of z~8.47, dating back to ~550Myr after the Big Bang. The observations are part of the JWST Cycle-3 treasury program, Slitless Areal Pure-Parallel HIgh-Redshift Emission Survey (SAPPHIRES) with NIRCam-grism. Using wide field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) obtained in the MACS0416 parallel field, we robustly confirm nine galaxies at z<sub>spec</sub>~8.47 via emission line detections of [OIII]5008A (with &gt;5 σ) and tentatively confirm one additional galaxy (at ~3 σ). This discovery represents the highest-redshift, spectroscopically confirmed galaxy over-density known to date, which is ~6&ndash;8 times more dense than the average volume density of galaxies at the same redshift. Furthermore, a galaxy hosting a low-mass active galactic nucleus ("Little-Red-Dot'') is found as a member, suggesting an early emergence of active, massive black holes and feedback between these black holes and their surrounding environments. We also discuss the spatial structures connecting the galaxy over-density to nearby massive star-forming galaxies (separated by ~ 5pMpc, including MACS0416-Y1 and MACS0416-JD. This finding of a massive dark matter halo hosting a galaxy over-density at z~8.5 is surprising given that our survey covered only a small, random field (16.5 arcmin<sup>2</sup>) as part of a pure parallel observation. The comparison with cosmological simulations shows that the likelihood of finding such a large-scale structure is &lt;5 &percnt; under the current galaxy formation scenario and the observed survey volume. Our results demonstrate the power of WFSS observations to build a complete line-emitter sample and suggest an important role for over-densities in enhancing galaxy formation by funneling large-scale gas supplies into small cosmological volumes.

JWST spectroscopy has revealed a population of compact objects at redshifts z=2-9 with `v'-shaped spectral energy distributions, broad permitted lines, and, often, hydrogen Balmer absorption. Among these `Little Red Dots' (LRDs), Abell2744-QSO1 at z=7.04 has been confirmed to have time-variable equivalent width (EW) in its broad emission lines, confirming its AGN nature. We extend the analysis of NIRSpec/IFS data from the BlackTHUNDER survey to the Hα line. The broad-line profile in Abell2744-QSO1 is manifestly non-Gaussian, requiring at least two Gaussian components with full width at half maximum FWHM=450±50 and 1800±100 km s<sup>-1</sup>. Crucially, we also detect a narrow-line Gaussian component, and strong Hα absorption (EW relative to the continuum ≈ 30^+15_-9 A), confirming a connection between the strong Balmer break and line absorption. The absorber is at rest with respect to broad Hα, suggesting that the gas cannot be interpreted as an inflow or outflow, forming instead a long-lived structure. Its velocity dispersion is σ_abs = 100±10 km s<sup>-1</sup>, consistent with the value inferred from the analysis of the Balmer break. Based on Hα, we infer a black hole mass of log(M_BH/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=6.3-6.7, 0.9-1.3 dex smaller than previous estimates based on Hβ. The Eddington ratio is 0.7-1.6. Combining the high signal-to-noise ratio of the narrow Hα line with the spectral resolution R=3,700 of the G395H grating, we infer a narrow-line dispersion σ_n = 22^+5_-6 km s<sup>-1</sup>, which places a stringent constraint on the black-hole-to-dynamical-mass ratio of this system to be M_BH/M_dyn&gt;0.02-0.4. If M_BH is near the low-mass end of our estimates, the SMBH would be accreting at a super-Eddington rate. Alternatively, at the high-M_BH end, there would be minimal room for a host galaxy.

We present subarcsecond-resolution ALMA mosaics of the Orion Bar PDR in [CI] 609um, C2H (4-3), and C18O (3-2) emission lines complemented by JWST images of H2 and aromatic infrared band (AIB) emission. The rim of the Bar shows very corrugated structures made of small-scale H2 dissociation fronts (DFs). The [CI] 609 um emission peaks very close (~0.002 pc) to the main H2-emitting DFs, suggesting the presence of gas density gradients. These DFs are also bright and remarkably similar in C2H emission, which traces "hydrocarbon radical peaks" characterized by very high C2H abundances, reaching up to several x10^-7. The high abundance of C2H and of related hydrocarbon radicals, such as CH3, CH2, and CH, can be attributed to gas-phase reactions driven by elevated temperatures, the presence of C+ and C, and the reactivity of FUV-pumped H2. The hydrocarbon radical peaks roughly coincide with maxima of the 3.4/3.3 um AIB intensity ratio, a proxy for the aliphatic-to-aromatic content of PAHs. This implies that the conditions triggering the formation of simple hydrocarbons also favor the formation (and survival) of PAHs with aliphatic side groups, potentially via the contribution of bottom-up processes in which abundant hydrocarbon radicals react in situ with PAHs. Ahead of the DFs, in the atomic PDR zone (where [H]&gt;&gt;[H2]), the AIB emission is the brightest, but small PAHs and carbonaceous grains undergo photo-processing due to the stronger FUV field. Our detection of trace amounts of C2H in this zone may result from the photoerosion of these species. This study provides a spatially resolved view of the chemical stratification of key carbon carriers in a PDR. Overall, both bottom-up and top-down processes appear to link simple hydrocarbon molecules with PAHs in molecular clouds; however, the exact chemical pathways and their relative contributions remain to be quantified.

We present JWST NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy observations of the z=5.89 quasar NDWFS J1425+3254 from 0.6-5.3 microns, covering the rest-frame ultraviolet and optical at a spectral resolution of R~100. The quasar has a black hole mass of M_BH=(1.4\substack+3.1\\-1.0)×10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and an Eddington ratio of L_Bol/L_Edd=0.3\substack+0.6\\-0.2, as implied from the broad Balmer Hα and Hβ lines. The quasar host has significant ongoing obscured star formation, as well as a quasar-driven outflow with velocity 6050\substack+460\\-630 km/s and ionised outflow rate of 1650\substack+130\\-1230M<sub>&odot;</sub>yr^-1. This is possibly one of the most extreme outflows in the early Universe. The data also reveal that two companion galaxies are merging with the quasar host. The north-eastern companion galaxy is relatively old and very massive, with a luminosity-weighted stellar age of 65\substack+9\\-4 Myr, stellar mass of (3.6\substack+0.6\\-0.3)×10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, and star-formation rate (SFR) of ~15-30 M<sub>&odot;</sub>yr^-1. A bridge of gas connects this companion galaxy and the host, confirming their ongoing interaction. A second merger is occurring between the quasar host and a much younger companion galaxy to the south, with a stellar age of 6.7±1.8 Myr, stellar mass of (1.9±0.4)×10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, and SFR of ~40-65 M<sub>&odot;</sub>yr^-1. There is also another galaxy in the field, likely in the foreground at z=1.135, which could be gravitationally lensing the quasar with magnification 1&lt;μ&lt;2, and, thus, &lt;0.75 mag. Overall, the system is a 'train-wreck' merger of three galaxies, with star formation and extreme quasar activity that were likely triggered by these ongoing interactions.

### 88) [2502.18565](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18565v1): Formation of filaments and feathers in disc galaxies: Is self-gravity enough?

<p> Raghav Arora, Christoph Federrath, Mark Krumholz, Robi Banerjee </p>
<p>
Context. Dense filaments/feathers are kpc-scale dusty features present in nearby main sequence galaxies. Distinct from the spiral arms, filaments constitute a major portion of dense gas concentration. They are expected to play an important role in star formation and are known to harbour star-forming regions and H II regions. Aims. We explore the origin of filaments/feathers in disc galaxies via global gravitational instability. Methods. We conduct a parameter study using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of isolated disc galaxies that are isothermal, self-gravitating and initialised in equilibrium. Our galaxies are uniquely characterised by two dimensionless parameters, the Toomre Q and the rotational Mach number, M_c = v_c/c_s (ratio of circular velocity to sound speed). We carry out simulations covering a wide range in both. Results. We find that galaxies with Q = 1 form filaments within a single rotation, while galaxies with Q ≥ 2 do not. These filaments are kpc long and are semi-regularly spaced along the azimuth. Their morphology, density contrast and formation timescale vary with M_c, with filament spacing and instability onset time both inversely proportional to M_c and the density contrast increasing with M_c. However, their growth rates in all Q = 1 galaxies are ~ 0.5~Ω, where Ω is the angular frequency. We compare the filament spacing in our simulations with the ones from JWST/MIRI and HST observations of nearby galaxies and find them in agreement. Conclusions. Our study suggests that self-gravity and rotation are sufficient to form filaments, even in the absence of spiral arms or magnetic fields. Their morphologies are primarily determined by M_c, which parametrises the importance of thermal versus rotational support.

We reconstruct the SFHs of 7 massive (M<sub>&sext;</sub>≳ 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) early-type galaxies (ETGs) in the Virgo cluster by analysing their spatially resolved stellar population (SP), including their UV and Hα emission. As part of the VESTIGE survey, we used Hα images to select ETGs that show no signs of ongoing star formation. We combined VESTIGE with images from Astrosat/UVIT, GALEX and CFHT from the NGVS to analyse radial spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the FUV to the NIR. The UV emission in these galaxies is likely due to old, low mass stars in post main sequence (PMS) phases, the UV upturn. We fit the radial SEDs with novel SP models that include an old, hot stellar component of PMS stars with various temperatures and energetics. This way, we explore the main stellar parameters responsible for UV upturn stars irregardless of their evolutionary path. Standard models are not able to reproduce the galaxies' central FUV emission (SMA/R_eff≲1), while the new models well characterise it through PMS stars with temperatures T≳25000 K. All galaxies are old (mass-weighted ages ≳10 Gyr) and the most massive M49 and M87 are supersolar within SMA/R_eff≲0.2. Overall, we found flat age gradients (&nabla;Log(Age)~ -0.04 - 0 dex) and shallow metallicity gradients (&nabla;Log(Z)&lt;-0.2 dex), except for M87 (&nabla;Log(Z_M87)≃-0.45 dex). Our results show that these ETGs formed with timescales τ≲1500 Myr, having assembled between ~40-90&percnt; of their stellar mass at z~5. This is consistent with recent JWST observations of quiescent massive galaxies at high-z, which are likely the ancestors of the largest ETGs in the nearby Universe. The derived flat/shallow gradients indicate that major mergers might have contributed to the formation and evolution of these galaxies.

<p>
We homogeneously investigate the morphological properties of 169 galaxies at z~10-16 with deep JWST NIRCam images employing our established techniques of GALFIT modeling and uncertainty evaluation (systematics+statistics). We obtain effective radii r_e ranging 20-500 pc, with a distribution significantly broader than the scatter made by the uncertainties. We find that the r_e distribution is well described by a log-normal distribution with a mean of r_e=133^+13_-12 pc and a standard deviation of σ_lnr_e = 0.52 ± 0.08. The standard deviation is comparable to that of local galaxies, indicating no significant evolution over z~ 0-10. We also find that the axis ratio distribution is nearly uniform, statistically similar to that of local spirals. We estimate the virial radius r_vir from the stellar masses via the star-formation main sequence and stellar-to-halo mass relation, obtaining a stellar-to-halo size ratio r_e/r_vir = 0.015^+0.015_-0.005, which is comparable to those of star-forming galaxies in the local and low-z Universe. Our results of 1) the log-normal r_e distribution, 2) the uniform axis ratio distribution, and 3) a mean radial profile consistent with an exponential profile (n=1.3±0.6) suggest that galaxies at z~10-16 generally follow the classical galaxy disk formation scenario with a specific disk angular momentum fraction of j_d / m_d ~ 0.5-1. Interestingly, we identify two remarkable outliers GN-z11 (z<sub>spec</sub>=10.60) and GHZ2 (z<sub>spec</sub>=12.34) with r_e=55^+5_-6 pc and 39±11 pc, respectively, that may not be explained by disk structures but by AGN or compact star-forming galaxies merging underway in short periods of time, as reproduced in numerical simulations.

### 91) [2502.07875](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07875v3): Investigating photometric and spectroscopic variability in the multiply-imaged Little Red Dot A2744-QSO1

<p>
JWST observations have uncovered a new population of red, compact objects at high redshifts dubbed `Little Red Dots' (LRDs), which typically show broad emission lines and are thought to be dusty Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Some of their other features, however, challenge the AGN explanation, such as prominent Balmer breaks and extremely faint or even missing metal high-ionization lines, X-ray, or radio emission, including in deep stacks. Time variability is another, robust, test of AGN activity. Here, we exploit the z=7.045 multiply-imaged LRD A2744-QSO1, which offers a particularly unique test of variability due to lensing-induced time delays between the three images spanning 22 yr (2.7 yr in the rest-frame), to investigate its photometric and spectroscopic variability. We find the equivalent widths (EWs) of the broad Hα and Hβ lines, which are independent of magnification and other systematics, to exhibit significant variations, up to 18±3 % for Hα and up to 22±8 % in Hβ, on a timescale of 875 d (2.4 yr) in the rest-frame. This suggests that A2744-QSO1 is indeed an AGN. We find no significant photometric variability beyond the limiting systematic uncertainties, so it currently cannot be determined whether the EW variations are due to line-flux or continuum variability. These results are consistent with a typical damped random walk (DRW) variability model for an AGN like A2744-QSO1 (M_BH=4×10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) given the sparse sampling of the light-curve with the available data. Our results therefore support the AGN interpretation of this LRD, and highlight the need for further photometric and spectroscopic monitoring in order to build a detailed and reliable light-curve.

The field of high redshift galaxy formation has been revolutionised by JWST, which is yielding unprecedented insights on galaxy assembly at early times. Our key aim is to study the physical mechanisms that can explain the unexpected abundance of bright galaxies at z ≥ 11, as well as their metal enrichment and spectral properties. We also use recent data to determine the key sources of reionisation. To do so, we implement cold gas fractions and star formation efficiencies derived from the SPHINX20 high-resolution radiation-hydrodynamics simulation into DELPHI, a semi-analytic model that tracks the assembly of dark matter halos and their baryonic components from z ~ 4.5-40. In addition, we explore two different methodologies to boost galaxy luminosities at z ≥ 11: a stellar initial mass function (IMF) that becomes increasingly top-heavy with decreasing metallicity and increasing redshift (eIMF model), and star formation efficiencies that increase with increasing redshift (eSFE model). Our key findings are: (i) both the eIMF and eSFE models can explain the abundance of bright galaxies at z ≥ 11; (ii) dust attenuation plays an important role for the bright-end of the UV LF at z ≤ 11; (iii) the mass-metallicity relation is in place as early as z ~ 17 in all models although its slope is model-dependent; (iv) within the spread of both models and observations, all of our models are in good agreement with current estimates of β slopes at z ~ 5-17 and Balmer break strengths at z ~ 6-10; (v) in the eIMF model, galaxies at z≥12 or with M_UV≥-18 show values of ξ<sub>ion</sub> ~ 10^25.55~[Hz~erg^-1], twice larger than in other models; (vi) star formation in galaxies below 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> is the key driver of reionisation, providing the bulk (~ 85&percnt;) of ionising photons down to its midpoint at z ~ 7.

### 93) [2502.01895](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01895v2): Turbulent gas-rich discs at high redshift: origin of thick stellar discs through 3D 'baryon sloshing'

<p>
In response to recent observations from JWST and ALMA, we explore a new class of dynamically self-consistent models using our AGAMA/Ramses hydrodynamic N-body framework (Nexus) that mimics a plausible progenitor of the Milky Way over a wide range of disc gas fractions (f_gas = 0-100&percnt;). The high gas surface densities encourage vigorous star formation, which in turn couples with the gas to drive turbulence. We show that this coupling through momentum recoil drives 'baryon sloshing,' i.e. a random walk of the baryonic potential minimum with respect to the centre of the total gravitational potential, Φ_tot. The amplitude of the bulk motion depends on the strength of the feedback, which in turn is directly associated with f_gas. At its most extreme, when gas is the sole contributor to the disc potential (f_gas=100%), the amplitude of the walk can reach up to R≈ 5 kpc and  &vert;  z &vert;  ≈ 1 kpc within Φ_tot(R,φ,z). Consistent with observations, the disc dominates over dark matter (f_disc≳ 50%) within R_s=2.2 R_disc, where R_disc is the exponential disc scale length. For a lower f_disc and/or f_gas, the 3D sloshing amplitude and velocity are reduced. The combination of strong feedback (which unbinds the disc) and sloshing leads to the newly formed stars being dynamically heated and settling to a more spatially extended disc population. The 3D heating process is isotropic but its effects are more noticeable in  &vert;  z &vert;  due to the initial dynamical coldness of the star-forming disc. Such a disc has enhanced [α/Fe] stellar abundances and a vertical (but no radial) gradient in stellar age and metallicity, both consistent with the Milky Way's thick stellar disc. Contrary to earlier claims, star formation in a stationary turbulent disc does not produce thick stellar discs.

Stellar feedback is an essential step in the baryon cycle of galaxies, but it remains unconstrained beyond Cosmic Noon. We study the ionized gas kinematics, dynamical mass and gas-flow properties of a sample of 16 sub-L^&sext; star-forming galaxies at 4≤ z≤7.6, using high-resolution JWST/NIRSpec observations. The emission lines are resolved, with velocity dispersions (σ_gas ~(km~s<sup>-1</sup>)≃38-96) comparable to more massive galaxies at Cosmic Noon. From σ_gas and the galaxy size (r_e=400-960~pc), we estimate the dynamical mass to be log M_dyn/M<sub>&odot;</sub>=9.25-10.25. Stellar-to-dynamical mass ratios are low (log M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M_dyn\in[-0.5,-2]) and decrease with increasing SFR surface density (Σ_SFR). We estimate the gas surface densities assuming a star-formation law, but the gas masses do not balance the baryon-to-dynamical mass ratios, which would require a decrease in the star-formation efficiency. We find evidence of ionized outflows in five out of the sixteen galaxies, based on the need of broad components to reproduce the emission-line wings. We only observe outflows from galaxies undergoing recent bursts of star formation SFR_10/SFR_100≥1, with elevated Σ_SFR and low M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M_dyn. This links high gas surface densities to increased outflow incidence and lower M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M_dyn. With moderate outflow velocities (v_flow ~(km~s<sup>-1</sup>)=150-250) and mass outflow rates (M&#775;_flow/M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1=0.2-5), these high-redshift galaxies appear more efficient at removing baryons than low-redshift galaxies with similar M<sub>&sext;</sub>, showing mass loading-factors of M&#775;_flow/SFR=0.04-0.4. For their given dynamical mass, the outflow velocities exceed the escape velocities, meaning that they may eventually enrich the Circumgalactic Medium.

We present new JWST NIRSpec integral field unit (IFU) G395H/F290LP observations of a merging galaxy system at z=7.88, part of A2744-z7p9, the most distant protocluster to date. The IFU cube reveals [OIII] emissions in two previously known galaxies (ZD3 and ZD6) and a newly identified galaxy, ZD12, at z<sub>spec</sub>=7.8762. One of the detected [OIII]-emitting regions has a detection of the auroral [OIII]4363, line, allowing us to derive a direct metallicity of log(O/H)+12=7.4±0.2, while metallicities in other regions are measured using strong line calibration methods. We find large deviations within the measured metallicity (Δlog (O/H)~1), which suggests a fast chemical enrichment from intense star formation and merger-driven growth, as expected in early galaxies. Our analysis shows that metal-poor regions could easily be outshone by more enriched regions, posing a challenge for spectroscopic analysis based on integrated light (i.e., NIRSpec MSA) against identifying metal-free star formation in the early universe. NIRCam imaging reveals seven UV-bright clumps in ZD12, in the range of stellar mass log M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>~7.6&ndash;8.9. Four of them are unresolved (&lt; 100pc) and intensely star-forming (&gt;30 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1 kpc^-2), likely contributing to the scatter in metallicity by producing an ideal environment for rapid chemical cycles. Lastly, we revisit the nature of the host protocluster by including new member galaxies identified here and in the literature, and obtain local overdensity factor δ=44_-31^+89, total halo mass M_h = 5.8_-0.3^+0.2×10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, and a formal velocity dispersion of 1100±500 km s<sup>-1</sup>.

We explore the evolving relationship between galaxies and their dark matter halos from z ~ 0.1 to z ~ 12 using mass-limited angular clustering measurements in the 0.54 deg<sup>2</sup> of the COSMOS-Web survey. This study provides the first measurements of the mass-limited two-point correlation function at z ≥ 10 and a consistent analysis spanning 13.4 Gyr of cosmic history, setting new benchmarks for future simulations and models. Using a halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework, we derive characteristic halo masses and the stellar-to-halo mass relationship (SHMR) across redshifts and stellar mass bins. Our results first indicate that HOD models fit data at z ≥ 2.5 best when incorporating a non-linear scale-dependent halo bias, boosting clustering at non-linear scales (r = 10-100 kpc). We find that galaxies at z &gt; 10.5 with log(M<sub>&sext;</sub> / M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 8.85 are hosted by halos with M_h ~ 10^10.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, achieving a star formation efficiency (SFE) M<sub>&sext;</sub> / (f_b M_h) up to 1 dex higher than at z ≤ 1. The high galaxy bias at z ≥ 8 suggests that these galaxies reside in massive halos with intrinsic high SFE. Our SHMR evolves significantly with redshift, starting high at z ≥ 10.5, decreasing until z ~ 2 - 3, then increasing again until the present. Current simulations fail to reproduce both massive high-z galaxies and this evolution, while semi-empirical models linking SFE to halo mass, accretion rates, and redshift align with our findings. We propose that z &gt; 8 galaxies experience bursty star formation without significant feedback altering their growth, driving the rapid growth of massive galaxies observed by JWST. Over time, increasing feedback efficiency and exponential halo growth suppress star formation. At z ~ 2 - 3 and after, halo growth slows down while star formation continues, supported by gas reservoirs in halos.

<p>
We present integral field unit observations of the Phoenix Cluster with the JWST Mid-infrared Instrument's Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI/MRS). We focus this study on the molecular gas, dust, and star formation in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We use precise spectral modeling to produce maps of the silicate dust, molecular gas, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the inner ~50 kpc of the cluster. We measure the optical depth from silicates by comparing the observed H<sub>2</sub> line ratios to those predicted by excitation models. We provide updated measurements of the total molecular gas mass of 1.9^+0.5_-0.4 × 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> which agrees with CO-based estimates, providing an estimate of the CO-to-H<sub>2</sub> conversion factor of α_CO = 0.8 ± 0.2 M<sub>&odot;</sub> pc^-2 (K km s<sup>-1</sup>)^-1; an updated stellar mass of M_* = 2.6 ± 0.5 × 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>; and star formation rates averaged over 10 and 100 Myr of &langle;SFR&rangle;_10 = 1340 ± 100 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1, and &langle;SFR&rangle;_100 = 740 ± 80 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1, respectively. The H<sub>2</sub> emission seems to be powered predominantly by shocks and star formation within the central ~ 20 kpc, induced by stellar feedback and radio jets from the active galactic nucleus. Additionally, we find nearly an order of magnitude drop in the star formation rates estimated by PAH fluxes in cool core BCGs compared to field galaxies, suggesting that hot particles from the intracluster medium are destroying PAH grains even in the centralmost 10s of kpc.

<p>
Star-forming clumps have been found to significantly influence the star formation of gas-rich z&gt;1 galaxies. Using public data from JWST/NIRCam (COSMOS-Web) and ALMA (FMOS-COSMOS), we study a sample of 32 massive (&gt;10^10.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) main-sequence galaxies at z<sub>spec</sub>~1.5 with ~0.3 kpc resolution. We create composite morphological models consisting of bulge, disk, and clumps to fully 'deconstruct' the galaxy images. With the resulting measurements of the flux and size of these components, we find the following: (I)The combined contribution of clumps is 1-30&percnt; towards the net star formation rate (SFR) of the host while contributing 1-20&percnt; to its stellar mass. The clumps show a correlation between their stellar mass and SFR, but have an increased specific-SFR (sSFR) relative to the star-forming main sequence, with offsets ranging from 0≲ΔlogsSFR≲ 0.4. They feature star formation surface densities of 10^-2-10^2 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr/kpc<sup>2</sup>, consistent with values observed in local star-forming and starburst galaxies. (II)The clumps span a large range of characteristic sizes (r_e~0.1-1 kpc) and stellar masses (~ 10^8.0-9.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>). We estimate a mass-size relation (r_e&prop;M<sub>&sext;</sub>^ 0.52±0.07) along with a stellar mass function (slope, α=-1.85± 0.19), both suggesting a hierarchical nature similar to that expected in star-forming regions in local galaxies. (III)Our measurements agree with the properties of stellar clumps in z≳1 lensed systems, bridging the gap between lensed and unlensed studies by detecting structures at sub-kpc scales.(IV)Clumps are found to be preferentially located along spiral features visible primarily in the residual rest-frame near-IR images. In conclusion, we present an observation-based, coherent picture of star-forming clumps at z&gt;1.

<p>
As part of the guaranteed time observations program Mid-Infrared Characterization Of Nearby Iconic galaxy Centers (MICONIC), we used the medium-resolution spectrometer (MRS) of the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on board of the JWST to study the nearby merger NGC6240. We aim to characterise the dual active galactic nuclei (AGN), the ionised gas outflows and the main properties of the interstellar medium over a mapped area of 6.6"x7.7". We obtained integral field spectroscopic mid-infrared data of NGC6240, resolving both nuclei for the first time in the full 5-28μm spectral range. We modelled the emission lines through a kinematic decomposition, finding that the fine-structure lines in the southern (S) nucleus are broader than for the northern (N) nucleus (full width at half maximum of ≥1500 vs ~700 km s<sup>-1</sup> on average). High excitation lines, such as [NeV], [NeVI], and [MgV], are clearly detected in the N nucleus. In the S nucleus, the same lines can be detected but only after a decomposition of the PAH features in the integrated spectrum, due to a combination of a strong mid-IR continuum, the broad emission lines, and the intense star formation (SF). The SF is distributed all over the mapped FoV of 3.5kpc x 4.1kpc (projected), with the maximum located around the S nucleus. Both nuclear regions appear to be connected by a bridge region detected with all the emission lines. Based on the observed MRS line ratios and the high velocity dispersion (σ~600 km s<sup>-1</sup>), shocks are also dominating the emission in this system. We detected the presence of outflows as a bubble north-west from the N nucleus and at the S nucleus. We estimated a ionised mass outflow rate of 1.4±0.3 M yr^-1 and 1.8±0.2 M yr^-1, respectively. Given the derived kinetic power of these outflows, both the AGN and the starburst could have triggered them. [Abridged]

### 100) [2412.14685](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14685v3): The JWST/NIRSpec view of the nuclear region in the prototypical merging galaxy NGC 6240

Merger events are thought to be an important phase in the assembly of massive galaxies. At the same time, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) play a fundamental role in the evolution of their star formation histories. Both phenomena can be observed at work in NGC 6240, a local prototypical merger, classified as an UltraLuminous InfraRed Galaxy (ULIRG) thanks to its elevated infrared luminosity. Interestingly, NGC 6240 hosts two AGN separated by 1.5''(~ 735 pc), detected in both X-ray and radio band. Taking advantage of the unprecedented sensitivity and wavelength coverage provided by the Integral Field Unit (IFU) of the NIRSpec instrument onboard JWST, we observed the nuclear region of NGC 6240 in a FoV of 3.7'' x 3.7''(1.9 x 1.9 kpc<sup>2</sup>), to investigate gas kinematics and InterStellar Medium (ISM) properties with a high spatial resolution of ~ 0.1'' (or ~ 50 pc). We separated the different gas kinematic components through multi-Gaussian fitting and studied the excitation properties of the ISM from the NIR diagnostic diagram based on the H<sub>2</sub> 1-0 S(1)/BrGamma and [Fe II]1.257micron/PaBeta lines ratios. We isolated the ionization cones of the two nuclei, and detected coronal lines emission from both of them. Using H<sub>2</sub> line ratios, we found that the molecular hydrogen gas is excited mostly by thermal processes. We computed a hot molecular gas mass of 1.3 x 10^5 M_sun and an ionized gas mass in the range of 10^5 - 10^7 M_sun. We studied with unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity the kinematics of the molecular and ionized gas phases. We revealed the complex structure of the molecular gas and found a blueshifted outflow near the Southern nucleus, together with filaments connecting a highly redshifted H<sub>2</sub> cloud with the two nuclei. We speculate on the possible nature of this H<sub>2</sub> cloud and propose two possible scenarios: either outflowing gas, or a tidal cloud falling onto the nuclei.

We report the discovery of an ultra-massive grand-design red spiral galaxy, named Zhúlóng (Torch Dragon), at z<sub>phot</sub> = 5.2^+0.3_-0.2 in the JWST PANORAMIC survey, identified as the most distant bulge+disk galaxy candidate with spiral arms known to date. Zhúlóng displays an extraordinary combination of properties: 1) a classical bulge centered in a large, face-on exponential stellar disk (half-light radius of R_e = 3.7 ± 0.1   kpc), with spiral arms extending across 19 kpc; 2) a clear transition from the red, quiescent core (F150W-F444W=3.1 mag) with high stellar mass surface density (log(ΣM<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>   kpc^-2) = 9.91_-0.09^+0.11) to the star-forming outer regions, as revealed by spatially resolved SED analysis, which indicates significant inside-out galaxy growth; 3) an extremely high stellar mass at its redshift, with log (M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=11.03_-0.08^+0.10 comparable to the Milky Way, and an implied baryon-to-star conversion efficiency (ε~ 0.3) that is 1.5 times higher than even the most efficient galaxies at later epochs; 4) despite an active disk, a relatively modest overall star formation rate (SFR =66_-46^+89 ~M<sub>&odot;</sub>   yr^-1), which is &gt;0.5 dex below the star formation main sequence at z ~ 5.2 and &gt;10 times lower than ultra-massive dusty galaxies at z=5-6. Altogether, Zhúlóng shows that mature galaxies emerged much earlier than expected in the first billion years after the Big Bang through rapid galaxy formation and morphological evolution. Our finding offers key constraints for models of massive galaxy formation and the origin of spiral structures in the early universe.

### 102) [2412.12256](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12256v2): A unique window into the Epoch of Reionisation: A double-peaked Lyman-α emitter in the proximity zone of a quasar at z~ 6.6

<p>
We present a study of a double-peaked Lyα emitter, named LAE-11, found in the proximity zone of QSO J0910-0414 at z~6.6. We use a combination of deep photometric data from Subaru Telescope, HST, and JWST with spectroscopic data from Keck/DEIMOS, NIRCam WFSS and NIRSpec MSA to characterise the ionising and general properties of the galaxy, as well as the quasar environment surrounding it. We detect Lyα, Hβ, [OIII] doublet, and Hα emission lines in the various spectral datasets. The presence of a double-peaked Lyα line in the spectrum allows us to characterise the opening angle and lifetime of the QSO as θ_Q&gt;49.62° and t_Q &gt; 3.8×10^5 years. LAE-11 is a fairly bright (M_UV = -19.84^+0.14_-0.16), blue galaxy with a UV slope of β= -2.61^+0.06_-0.08. Since the galaxy is located in a quasar-ionised region, we have a unique opportunity to measure the escape fraction of Lyman Continuum photons using the un-attenuated double-peaked Lyα emission profile and its equivalent width at such high redshift. We employ diagnostics which do not rely on the detection of Lyα for comparison, and find that all tracers of ionising photon leakage agree within 1σ uncertainty. We measure a moderate escape of Lyman Continuum photons from LAE-11 of f<sub>esc</sub>^LyC = (8 - 33)&percnt;. Detections of both Hα and Hβ emission lines allow for separate measurements of the ionising photon production efficiency, resulting with log(ξ<sub>ion</sub>/Hz~erg^-1) = 25.59±0.08 and 25.65±0.09, for Hα and Hβ, respectively. The total ionising output of LAE-11, log(f<sub>esc</sub>^LyCξ<sub>ion</sub>, Hα/Hz~erg^-1) = 24.85^+0.24_-0.34, is higher than the value of 24.3 - 24.8 which is traditionally assumed as needed to drive Reionisation forward.

### 103) [2412.09592](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09592v1): JWST PRIMER: strong evidence for the environmental quenching of low-mass galaxies out to itz ≃ 2

<p>
We present the results of a study investigating the galaxy stellar-mass function (GSMF), size-mass relations and morphological properties of star-forming and quiescent galaxies over the redshift range 0.25&lt;z&lt;2.25, using the JWST PRIMER survey. The depth of the PRIMER near-IR imaging allows us to confirm the double Schechter function shape of the quiescent GSMF out to z≃2.0, via a clear detection of the upturn at log_10(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/ M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≤ 10 thought to be induced by environmental quenching. In addition to the GSMF, we confirm that quiescent galaxies can be split into separate populations at log_10(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≃ 10, based on their size-mass relations and morphologies. We find that low-mass quiescent galaxies have more disk-like morphologies (based on Sérsic index, Gini coefficient and M_20 metrics) and follow a shallower size-mass relation than their high-mass counterparts. Indeed, the slope of the size-mass relation followed by low-mass quiescent galaxies is indistinguishable from that followed by star-forming galaxies, albeit with a lower normalization. Moreover, within the errors, the evolution in the median size of low-mass quiescent galaxies is indistinguishable from that followed by star-forming galaxies (R_e&prop;(1+z)^-0.25±0.03), and significantly less rapid than that displayed by high-mass quiescent galaxies (R_e&prop; (1+z)^-1.14± 0.03). Overall, our results are consistent with low and high-mass quiescent galaxies following different quenching pathways. The evolution of low-mass quiescent galaxies is qualitatively consistent with the expectations of external/environmental quenching (e.g. ram-pressure stripping). In contrast, the evolution of high-mass quiescent galaxies is consistent with internal/mass quenching (e.g. AGN feedback) followed by size growth driven by minor mergers.

### 104) [2412.06763](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06763v1): New Ionization Models and the Shocking Nitrogen Excess at z &gt; 5

<p> Sophia R. Flury, Karla Z. Arellano-Córdova, Edward C. Moran, Alaina Einsig </p>
<p>
The new era of galaxy evolution studies hearkened in by JWST has led to the discovery of z &gt; 5 galaxies exhibiting excess nitrogen with log(N/O)~1 dex or more than expected from log(N/O) vs 12+log(O/H) trends in the local Universe. A variety of novel enrichment pathways have been presented to explain the apparent nitrogen excess, invoking a wide range of processes from very massive stars to stripped binaries to fine-tuned star-formation histories. However, understanding the excitation mechanism responsible for the observed nebular emission is necessary to accurately infer chemical abundances. As of yet, the ionization sources of these galaxies have not been thoroughly explored, with radiative shocks left out of the picture. We present a suite of homogeneous excitation models for star-forming galaxies, active galactic nuclei, and radiative shocks, with which we explore possible explanations for the apparent nitrogen excess. We propose new BPT-style diagnostics to classify galaxies at z &gt; 5, finding that, when combined with O iii] 1660,66 and He ii 1640, N iii] 1747-54 / C iii] 1907,09 best selects shock-dominated galaxies while N iv] 1483,86 / C iii] 1907,09 best distinguishes between active black holes and star forming galaxies. From our diagnostics, we find that slow/intermediate radiative shocks (v = 75-150 km/s) are most consistent with observed UV emission line flux ratios in nitrogen-bright galaxies. Accounting for the effects of shocks can bring nitrogen estimates into better agreement with abundance patterns observed in the local Universe and may be attributable to Wolf Rayet populations actively enriching these galaxies with nitrogen and possibly driving winds responsible for these shocks.

### 105) [2412.05668](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05668v3): Kinematic evidence of magnetospheric accretion for Herbig Ae stars with JWST NIRSpec

<p> Ciarán Rogers, Bernhard Brandl, Guido de Marchi </p>
<p>
Hydrogen emission lines have been used to estimate the mass accretion rate of pre-main-sequence stars for over 25 years, although the physical origin of these lines is still unclear. Magnetospheric accretion (MA) and magneto-centrifugal winds are the two most often invoked mechanisms. Using a combination of HST photometry and new JWST NIRSpec spectra in the range 1.66 - 3.2  μm, we analysed the emission line spectra of five sources to attempt to reveal the physical origin of their hydrogen emission lines. These sources reside in NGC 3603, a Galactic massive star forming region. We performed fits of the SEDs of the five sources employing a Markov chain Monte Carlo exploration to estimate T_eff, R_*, M_*, and A(V) for each source. We performed a kinematic analysis across three spectral series of hydrogen lines (Paschen, Brackett, and Pfund). We studied the full width at half maximum and optical depth of the lines in order to constrain the emission origin. We calculated the expected velocities from MA as well as gas in Keplerian orbit for our sources. All five sources have SEDs consistent with young intermediate-mass stars. We classified three of these sources as Herbig Ae type stars based on their T_eff. Hydrogen lines with high upper energy levels n_up tend to be significantly broader than lines with a lower n_up. The optical depth of the emission lines is also highest for the high-velocity component of each line, and it becomes optically thin in the low-velocity component. Emission from magneto-centrifugal winds is not consistent with any of our observations. Two sources are consistent with emission from a Keplerian disc, or MA. The remaining three sources are only consistent with emission from MA. In the future, this approach can be applied to more statistically significant samples of Herbig AeBe spectra, including existing archival observations.

### 106) [2412.05535](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05535v2): The First JWST View of a 30-Myr-old Protoplanetary Disk Reveals a Late-stage Carbon-rich Phase

<p>
We present a JWST MIRI/MRS spectrum of the inner disk of WISE J044634.16-262756.1B (hereafter J0446B), an old (~34 Myr) M4.5 star but with hints of ongoing accretion. The spectrum is molecule-rich and dominated by hydrocarbons. We detect 14 molecular species (H<sub>2</sub>, CH_3, CH_4, C_2H<sub>2</sub>, ^13CCH<sub>2</sub>, C_2H_4, C_2H_6, C_3H_4, C_4H<sub>2</sub>, C_6H_6, HCN, HC_3N, CO<sub>2</sub> and ^13CO<sub>2</sub>) and 2 atomic lines ([Ne II] and [Ar II]), all observed for the first time in a disk at this age. The detection of spatially unresolved H<sub>2</sub> and Ne gas strongly supports that J0446B hosts a long-lived primordial disk, rather than a debris disk. The marginal H<sub>2</sub>O detection and the high C_2H<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> column density ratio indicate that the inner disk of J0446B has a very carbon-rich chemistry, with a gas-phase C/O ratio ≳2, consistent with what have been found in most primordial disks around similarly low-mass stars. In the absence of significant outer disk dust substructures, inner disks are expected to first become water-rich due to the rapid inward drift of icy pebbles, and evolve into carbon-rich as outer disk gas flows inward on longer timescales. The faint millimeter emission in such low-mass star disks implies that they may have depleted their outer icy pebble reservoir early and already passed the water-rich phase. Models with pebble drift and volatile transport suggest that maintaining a carbon-rich chemistry for tens of Myr likely requires a slowly evolving disk with α-viscosity ≲10^-4. This study represents the first detailed characterization of disk gas at ~30 Myr, strongly motivating further studies into the final stages of disk evolution.

<p>
Distant quasars (QSOs) in galaxy overdensities are considered key actors in the evolution of the early Universe. In this work, we studied the kinematic and physical properties of the BR1202-0725 system at z=4.7, one of the most overdense fields known in the early Universe, consisting of a QSO, a submillimeter galaxy (SMG), and three Lyman-α emitters. We used data from the JWST/NIRSpec Integral Field Unit (IFU) to analyze the rest-frame optical emission of each source in the system. We estimated a bolometric luminosity of log(L_bol/[erg/s]) = 47.2 ± 0.4 and a black hole mass of log(M_BH/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 10.1 ± 0.5 for the QSO, which are consistent with previous measurements obtained with ground-based observations. The NIRSpec spectra of the SMG revealed instead unexpected [OIII] and Hα+[NII] profiles. The overall [OIII] line profile is blue-shifted by more than 700 km/s relative to the systemic velocity of the galaxy. Additionally, both the [OIII] and Hα+[NII] lines show prominent broad (1300 km/s), blueshifted wings associated with outflowing ionized gas. The analysis of NIRSpec and X-ray observations indicates that the SMG likely hosts an accreting supermassive black hole as supported by the following results: (i) the excitation diagnostic diagram is consistent with ionization from an active galactic nucleus (AGN); (ii) the X-ray luminosity is higher than 10^44 erg/s; and (iii) it hosts a fast outflow (v_out = 5000 km/s), comparable to those observed in luminous QSOs. Therefore, the QSO-SMG pair represents one of the highest-redshift double AGN to date, with a projected separation of 24 kpc. Finally, we investigated the environment of this system and found four new galaxies at the same redshift of the QSO and within a projected distance of 5 kpc from it. This overdense system includes at least ten galaxies in only 980 kpc<sup>2</sup>.

<p>
JWST has revealed a population of compact `Little Red Dots' (LRDs) at z≳4, with red rest-frame optical and blue UV colors. These objects are likely compact dusty starbursts or heavily reddened AGNs, playing a pivotal role in early black hole growth, dust production, and stellar assembly. We introduce a new photometric selection to identify LRDs over a broad range in redshifts and rest-frame UV-to-NIR colors enabling a more complete census of the population. This method identifies 248 LRDs with F444W&lt;27 mag over 263 arcmin<sup>2</sup> in the JADES, PRIMER-COSMOS, and UDS fields with MIRI coverage, increasing the number density by ×1.7 compared to previous samples, suggesting that previous census were underestimated. Most LRDs are detected in MIRI/F770W but only 7% (17) are detected in F1800W. We use MIRI-based rest-frame [1-3 μm] colors to trace dust emission. F1800W-detected LRDs have a median [1-3 μm]=1.5 mag, with a broad scatter indicative of diverse dust emission properties. About 20% exhibit [1-3 μm]&lt;1 mag colors consistent with negligible dust emission, but the majority show significant dust emission at 3 μm (f^dust_3μm≲0.8) from the galaxy ISM or a hot-dust-deficient AGN torus. A correlation between bluer UV-to-NIR colors and stronger IR emission suggests that the bluest LRDs may resemble unobscured QSOs. We report a LRD at z<sub>spec</sub>=3.1386, detected in MIRI, Spitzer/MIPS, and Herschel/PACS. Its IR SED rises steeply at λ_rest&gt;6~μm and peaks near ~40~μm, providing the first direct evidence of warm dust emission (T=50-100 K) in a LRD.

We present an analysis of the UV continuum slope, beta, using a sample of 733 galaxies selected from a mixture of JWST ERS/GTO/GO observational programs and with z &gt; 4. We consider spectroscopic data obtained with the low resolution PRISM/CLEAR NIRSpec configuration. Studying the correlation of beta with M_UV we find a decreasing trend of beta = (-0.056 +- 0.017) M_UV - (3.01 +- 0.34), consistent with brighter galaxies having redder beta as found in previous works. However, analysing the trend in separate redshift bins, we find that at high redshift the relation becomes much flatter, consistent with a flat slope. Furthermore, we find that beta decreases with redshift with an evolution as beta = (-0.075 +- 0.010) z - (1.496 +- 0.056), consistent with most previous results that show a steepening of the spectra going at higher z. We then select a sample of galaxies with extremely blue slopes (beta &lt; -2.6): such slopes are steeper than what is predicted by stellar evolution models, even for dust free, young, metal poor populations, when the contribution of nebular emission is included. We select 51 extremely blue galaxies (XBGs) and we investigate the possible physical origin of their steep slopes, comparing them to a sub-sample of redder galaxies (matched in redshift and M_UV). We find that XBGs have younger stellar populations, stronger ionization fields, lower dust attenuation, and lower but not pristine metallicity (~ 10% solar) compared to red galaxies. However, these properties alone cannot explain the extreme beta values. By using indirect inference of Lyman continuum escape, using the most recent models, we estimate escape fractions f<sub>esc</sub> &gt; 10% in at least 25% of XBGs, while all the red sources have smaller f<sub>esc</sub>. A reduced nebular continuum contribution as due to either a high escape fraction or to a bursty star-formation history is likely the origin of the extremely blue slopes.

Studying the distribution and properties of ionised gas in outflows driven by AGN is crucial for understanding the feedback mechanisms at play in extragalactic environments. In this study, we explore the connection between ionised outflows traced by rest-frame UV absorption and optical emission lines in GS133, a Compton thick AGN at z = 3.47. We combine observations from the JWST NIRSpec Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) with archival VLT VIMOS long-slit spectroscopic data, as part of the GA-NIFS project. We perform a multi-component kinematic decomposition of the UV and optical line profiles to derive the physical properties of the absorbing and emitting gas in GS133. Our kinematic decomposition reveals two distinct components in the optical lines. The first component likely traces a rotating disk with a dynamical mass of 2e10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. The second component corresponds to a galaxy-wide, bi-conical outflow, with a velocity of 1000 km/s and an extension of 3 kpc. The UV absorption lines show two outflow components, with bulk velocities v_out = -900 km/s and -1900 km/s, respectively. This characterises GS133 as a mini-BAL system. Balmer absorption lines with similar velocities are tentatively detected in the NIRSpec spectrum. Both photoionisation models and outflow energetics suggest that the ejected absorbing gas is located at 1-10 kpc from the AGN. We use 3D gas kinematic modelling to infer the orientation of the [O III] bi-conical outflow, and find that a portion of the emitting gas resides along our line of sight, suggesting that [O III] and absorbing gas clouds are partially mixed in the outflow. The derived mass-loading factor (i.e. the mass outflow rate divided by the SFR) of 1-10, and the kinetic coupling efficiency (i.e. the kinetic power divided by LAGN) of 0.1-1% per cent suggest that the outflow in GS133 provides significant feedback on galactic scales.

We determine the spectroscopic properties of ~1000 ostensibly star-forming galaxies at redshifts (z=4-10) using prism spectroscopy from JWST/NIRSpec. With rest-wavelength coverage between Lya and [S II] in the optical, we stack spectra as a function of nebular conditions, and compare UV spectral properties with stellar age. This reveals UV lines of N III], N IV], C III], C IV, He II, and O III] in the average high-z galaxy. All UV lines are more intense in younger starbursts. We measure electron temperatures from the collisionally excited [O III] line ratios, finding Te=18000-22000 K for the O++ regions. We also detect a significant nebular Balmer Jump from which we estimate only Te=8000-13000 K. Accounting for typical temperature offsets between zones bearing doubly and singly ionized oxygen, these two temperatures remain discrepant by around 40%. We use the [O III] temperatures to estimate abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. We find that log(C/O) is consistently ~-1, with no evolution of C/O with metallicity or stellar age. The average spectra are mildly enhanced in Nitrogen, with higher N/O than low-z starbursts, but are less enhanced than samples of high-z galaxies with visible UV N III] and N IV]. Whatever processes produce the N-enhancement in the individual galaxies must also be ongoing, at lower levels, in the median galaxy in the early Universe. The strongest starbursts are a source of significant ionizing emission: ionizing photon production efficiencies reach 10^25.7 Hz/erg, and show multiple signatures of high Lyman continuum escape, including Mg II escape fractions nearing 100%, significant deficits in [S II] emission, high degrees of ionization, and blue UV colors.

<p>
We present JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopic (IFS) observations of the \Lyalpha emitter CR7 at z ~ 6.6, observed as part of the GA-NIFS program. Using low-resolution PRISM (R ~ 100) data, we confirm a bright \Lyalpha emitter, and a diffuse \Lyalpha halo extending up to 3 kpc from the peak of ionized emission, both of them associated to the most massive, UV bright galaxy in the system (CR7-A). We confirm the presence of two additional UV-bright satellites (CR7-B and CR7-C) detected at projected distances of 6.4 and 5.2 kpc from the primary source. We perform SED fitting of the low-resolution data and revealed an inverted star formation history between two satellites at early epochs and a spatially resolved anti-correlation of the gas-phase metallicity and the star formation rate density, likely driven by the gas exchange among the satellites, favouring the merger scenario for CR7. From the high-resolution G395H (R ~ 2700) data, we discover at least three additional companions mainly traced by the \OIIIL emission line, although they are not detected in continuum. We disentangle the kinematics of the system and reveal extended ionised emission linking the main galaxy and the satellites. We spatially resolve the \OIIIL, \OIII[4363], and \Hgamma emission lines and use a diagnostic diagram tailored to high-z systems to reveal tentative evidence of AGN ionisation across the main galaxy (CR7-A) and the N-E companion (CR7-B). Moreover, we detect an unresolved blue-shifted outflow from one of the satellites and present first evidence for a redshifted outflow from the main galaxy. Finally, we compute resolved electron temperature (T_e ~ 1.6 × 10^4 K) and metallicity maps (log(Z/\zsun) from &ndash;0.8 to &ndash;0.5), and provide insights on how the physical properties of the system evolved at earlier epochs.

Galaxy mergers are a key driver of galaxy formation and evolution, including the triggering of AGN and star formation to a still unknown degree. We thus investigate the impact of galaxy mergers on star formation and AGN activity using a sample of 3,330 galaxies at z = [4.5, 8.5] from eight JWST fields (CEERS, JADES GOODS-S, NEP-TDF, NGDEEP, GLASS, El-Gordo, SMACS-0723, and MACS-0416), collectively covering an unmasked area of 189 arcmin<sup>2</sup>. We focuses on star formation rate (SFR) enhancement, AGN fraction, and AGN excess in major merger (μ&gt; 1/4) close-pair samples, defined by Δz &lt; 0.3 and projected separations r_p &lt; 100 kpc, compared to non-merger samples. We find that SFR enhancement occurs only at r_p &lt; 20 kpc, with values of 0.25 ± 0.10 dex and 0.26 ± 0.11 dex above the non-merger medians for z = [4.5, 6.5] and z = [6.5, 8.5]. No other statistically significant enhancements in galaxy sSFR or stellar mass are observed at any projected separation or redshift bin. We also compare our observational results with predictions from the SC-SAM simulation and find no evidence of star formation enhancement in the simulations at any separation range. Finally, we examine the AGN fraction and AGN excess, finding that the fraction of AGNs in AGN-galaxy pairs, relative to the total AGN population, is 3.25^+1.50_-1.06 times greater than the fraction of galaxy pairs relative to the overall galaxy population at the same redshift. We find that nearly all AGNs have a companion within 100 kpc and observe an excess AGN fraction in close-pair samples compared to non-merger samples. This excess is found to be 1.26 ± 0.06 and 1.34 ± 0.06 for AGNs identified via the inferred BPT diagram and photometric SED selection, respectively.

<p>
During the last decade, studies about highly attenuated and massive red star-forming galaxies (RedSFGs) at z ~ 4 have suggested that they could constitute a crucial population for unraveling the mechanisms driving the transition from vigorous star formation to quiescence at high redshifts. Since such a transition seems to be linked to a morphological transformation, studying the morphological properties of these RedSFGs is essential to our understanding of galaxy evolution. To this end, we are using JWST/NIRCam images from the CEERS survey to assemble a mass-complete sample of 188 massive galaxies at z=3-4, for which we perform resolved-SED fit. After classifying galaxies into typical blue SFGs (BlueSFGs), RedSFGs and quiescent galaxies (QGs), we compare the morphologies of each population in terms of stellar mass density, SFR density, sSFR, dust-attenuation and mass-weighted age. We find that RedSFGs and QGs present similar stellar surface density profiles and that RedSFGs manifest a dust attenuation concentration significantly higher than that of BlueSFGs at all masses. This indicates that to become quiescent, a BlueSFG must transit through a major compaction phase once it has become sufficiently massive. At the same time, we find RedSFGs and QGs to account for more than 50&percnt; of galaxies with log(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&gt; 10.4 at this redshift. This transition mass corresponds to the "critical mass" delineating the bimodality between BlueSFGs and QGs in the local Universe. We then conclude that there is a bimodality between extended BlueSFGs and compact, highly attenuated RedSFGs that have undergone a major gas compaction phase enabling the latter to build a massive bulb in situ. There is evidence that this early-stage separation is at the origin of the local bimodality between BlueSFGs and QGs, which we refer to as a "primeval bimodality".

### 115) [2410.19900](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.19900v2): The cooler past of the intracluster medium in TNG-Cluster

<p> Eric Rohr, Annalisa Pillepich, Dylan Nelson, Mohammadreza Ayromlou, Céline Péroux, Elad Zinger </p>
<p>
The intracluster medium (ICM) today is comprised largely of hot gas with clouds of cooler gas of unknown origin and lifespan. We analyze the evolution of cool gas (temperatures ≲10^4.5 K) in the ICM of 352 galaxy clusters from the TNG-Cluster simulations, with present-day mass ~10^14.3-15.4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. We follow the main progenitors of these clusters over the past ~13 billion years (since z≲7) and find that, according to TNG-Cluster, the cool ICM mass increases with redshift at fixed cluster mass, implying that this cooler past of the ICM is due to more than just halo growth. The cool cluster gas at z≲0.5 is mostly located in and around satellite galaxies, while at z≳2 cool gas can also accrete via filaments from the intergalactic medium. Lower-mass and higher-redshift clusters are more susceptible to cooling. The cool ICM mass correlates with the number of gaseous satellites and inversely with the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass. The average number of gaseous satellites decreases since z=2, correlating with the decline in the cool ICM mass over cosmic time, suggesting a link between the two. Concurrently, kinetic SMBH feedback shifts the ICM temperature distribution, decreasing the cool ICM mass inside-out. At z≈0.5, the predicted \ionMg ii column densities are in the ballpark of recent observations, where satellites and other halos contribute significantly to the total \ionMg ii column density. Suggestively, a non-negligible amount of the ICM cool gas forms stars in-situ at early times, reaching ~10^2 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1 and an Hα surface brightness of ~10^-17 erg s<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> arcsec^-2 at z≈2, detectable with Euclid and JWST.

### 116) [2410.18980](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.18980v1): Very massive stars and Nitrogen-emitting galaxies

<p> Jorick S. Vink </p>
<p>
Recent studies of high-redshift galaxies using JWST, such as GN-z11 revealed highly elevated levels of nitrogen (N). This phenomenon extends to gravitationally-lensed galaxies like the Sunburst Arc at z = 2.37, as well as to globular clusters (GCs). We propose that this originates from the presence of very massive stars (VMSs) with masses ranging from 100 to 1000 \M<sub>&odot;</sub>. The HeII observed in the Sunburst Arc could also stem from the disproportionately large contribution of VMSs. We build an entirely new Framework for massive star evolution which is no longer set by Dutch or other mass-loss "recipes" but which take the physics of Γ or L/M-dependent winds into account. We discuss the mass-loss kink and the transition mass-loss rate between optically thin and thick winds, before we study the evaporative mass-loss history of VMSs. Our novel evolution models exhibit vertical evolution in the HR-diagram from the zero-age main sequence due to a self-regulatory effect driven by their wind-dominated nature, and we discuss what wind physics sets the stellar upper-mass limit. Our estimate for the Sunburst Arc in Vink (2023) suggests that the significant amounts of N found in star-forming galaxies likely arise from VMSs. We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of previous hypotheses, including fast rotating massive stars and supermassive stars (SMSs), and we conclude that only our VMS model satisfies the relevant criteria. Finally, we advocate for the inclusion of VMSs in population synthesis and chemical evolution models, emphasizing the need for a self-consistent wind approach, which currently does not exist. Even minor inaccuracies in mass-loss rates dramatically impact the stellar evolution of VMS, as well as their ionizing and chemical feedback.

Quasar feedback may play a key role in the evolution of massive galaxies. The dust-reddened quasar, F2M110648.35+480712 at z = 0.4352 is one of the few cases at its redshift that exhibits powerful quasar feedback through bipolar outflows. Our new observation with the integral field unit mode of Near-infrared Spectrograph onboard JWST opens a new window to examine this spectacular outflow through Paα emission line with ~3× better spatial resolution than previous work. The morphology and kinematics of the Paα nebula confirm the existence of a bipolar outflow extending on a scale of ~17×14 kpc and with a velocity reaching ~1100 km s<sup>-1</sup>. The higher spatial resolution of our new observation leads to more reliable measurements of outflow kinematics. Considering only the spatially resolved outflow and assuming an electron density of 100 cm<sup>2</sup>, the mass, momentum and kinetic energy outflow rates are ~50-210 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1, ~0.3-1.7×10^36 dynes (~14-78&percnt; of the quasar photon momentum flux) and ~0.16-1.27×10^44 erg s<sup>-1</sup> (~0.02-0.20&percnt; of the quasar bolometric luminosity), respectively. The local instantaneous outflow rates generally decrease radially. We infer that the quasar is powerful enough to drive the outflow, while stellar processes cannot be overlooked as a contributing energy source. The mass outflow rate is ~0.4-1.5 times the star formation rate, and the ratio of kinetic energy outflow rate to the quasar bolometric luminosity is comparable to the minimum value required for negative quasar feedback in simulations. This outflow may help regulate the star formation activity within the system to some extent.

### 118) [2410.13254](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13254v2): Lyman Continuum leakage from massive leaky starbursts: A different class of emitters?

<p>
The origin of Lyman Continuum (LyC) photons responsible for reionizing the universe remains a mystery, with the fraction of escaping LyC photons from galaxies at z~ 6 to 12 being highly uncertain. While direct detection of LyC photons from this epoch is hindered by absorption from the intergalactic medium, lower redshift analogs offer a promising avenue to study LyC leakage. We present Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (HST COS) observations of five low redshift (z~ 0.3) massive starburst galaxies, selected for their high stellar mass and weak [SII] nebular emission - an indirect tracer of LyC escape. Three of the five galaxies show LyC leakage, highlighting the reliability of weak [SII] as a tracer, especially in light of recent JWST discoveries of z &gt; 5 galaxies with similarly weak [SII] emission. The dust corrected LyC escape fractions, which represent the LyC photons that would escape in the absence of dust, range from 33% to 84%. However, the absolute escape fractions, which show the LyC photons escaping after passing through both neutral hydrogen absorption and dust attenuation, are significantly lower, ranging between 1% and 3%. This suggests that while the galaxies are nearly optically thin to HI, their high dust content significantly suppresses LyC photon escape. These [SII] weak, massive leakers are distinct from typical low-redshift LyC emitters, showing higher metallicity, lower ionization states, more dust extinction and higher star formation surface densities. This suggests that these galaxies constitute a distinct population, likely governed by a different mechanism facilitating LyC photon escape. We propose that the feedback-driven winds in these compact starbursts create ionized channels through which LyC photons escape, aligning with a picket-fence model.

We present the first results of the JWST Emission Line Survey (JELS). Utilising the first NIRCam narrow-band imaging at 4.7μm, over 63 arcmin<sup>2</sup> in the PRIMER/COSMOS field, we identified 609 emission line galaxy candidates. From these, we robustly selected 35 Hα star-forming galaxies at z ~ 6.1, with Hα star-formation rates (SFR_Hα) ~0.9-15 M<sub>&odot;</sub>  yr^-1. Combining our unique Hα sample with the exquisite panchromatic data in the field, we explored their physical properties and star-formation histories, and compared these to a broad-band selected sample at z~ 6 which offered vital new insights into the nature of high-redshift galaxies. UV-continuum slopes (β) were considerably redder for our Hα sample (&langle;β&rangle;~-1.92) compared to the broad-band sample (&langle;β&rangle;~-2.35). This was not due to dust attenuation as our Hα sample was relatively dust-poor (median A_V=0.23); instead, we argued the reddened slopes could be due to nebular continuum. We compared SFR_Hα and the UV-continuum-derived SFR_UV to SED-fitted measurements averaged over canonical timescales of 10 and 100 Myr (SFR_10 and SFR_100). We found an increase in recent SFR for our sample of Hα emitters, particularly at lower stellar masses (&lt;10^9  M<sub>&odot;</sub>). We also found SFR_Hα strongly traced SFR averaged over 10 Myr timescales, whereas the UV-continuum over-predicts SFR on 100 Myr timescales at low stellar masses. These results point to our Hα sample undergoing `bursty' star formation. Our F356W z ~ 6 sample showed a larger scatter in SFR_10/SFR_100 across all stellar masses, which highlighted how narrow-band photometric selections of Hα emitters are key to quantifying the burstiness of star-formation activity.

<p> Filip Huško, Cedric G. Lacey, William J. Roper, Joop Schaye, Jemima Mae Briggs, Matthieu Schaller </p>
<p>
We present results of cosmological zoom-in simulations of a massive protocluster down to redshift z≈4 (when the halo mass is ≈10^13 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) using the SWIFT code and the EAGLE galaxy formation model, focusing on supermassive black hole (BH) physics. The BH was seeded with a mass of 10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at redshift z≈17. We compare the base model that uses an Eddington limit on the BH accretion rate and thermal isotropic feedback by the AGN, with one where super-Eddington accretion is allowed, as well as two other models with BH spin and jets. In the base model, the BH grows at the Eddington limit from z=9 to z=5.5, when it becomes massive enough to halt its own and its host galaxy's growth through feedback. We find that allowing super-Eddington accretion leads to drastic differences, with the BH going through an intense but short super-Eddington growth burst around z≈7.5, during which it increases its mass by orders of magnitude, before feedback stops further growth (of both the BH and the galaxy). By z≈4 the galaxy is only half as massive in the super-Eddington cases, and an order of magnitude more extended, with the half-mass radius reaching values of a few physical kpc instead of a few hundred pc. The BH masses in our simulations are consistent with the intrinsic BH mass-stellar mass relation inferred from high-redshift observations by JWST. This shows that galaxy formation models using the ΛCDM cosmology are capable of reproducing the observed massive BHs at high redshift. Allowing jets, either at super- or sub-Eddington rates, has little impact on the host galaxy properties, but leads to lower BH masses as a consequence of higher feedback efficiencies.

We present a detailed analysis of JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam observations of ZF-UDS-7329, a massive, quiescent galaxy at redshift z=3.2, which has been put forward to challenge cosmology and galaxy formation physics. We study on the impact of different star formation history (SFH) priors, stellar libraries, metallicity, and initial mass function assumptions. Our results show that ZF-UDS-7329, with a formed stellar mass of M<sub>&sext;</sub> ≈ 10^11.4~M<sub>&odot;</sub> (surviving mass M<sub>&sext;</sub>,surv ≈ 10^11.2~M<sub>&odot;</sub>) and a specific star-formation rate of sSFR ≈ 0.03 Gyr^-1, formed efficiently in the first billion years of the Universe. In agreement with previous work, we find that the spectrum is consistent with mass-weighted stellar ages of 1.3-1.8 Gyr, depending on the SFH prior used. A physically motivated rising SFH prior makes the formation history of ZF-UDS-7329 compatible with stellar mass and star-formation rate estimates of z&gt;6 galaxies. Using NIRCam imaging, we identify a colour gradient indicative of an old, quiescent bulge and a younger disc component, as expected from a complex formation history. The inferred SFH is consistent a high stellar fraction of f<sub>&sext;</sub>=M<sub>&sext;</sub>/(f_b \cdot M_h) ≈ 100&percnt; at z=7-12, implying an extremely high integrated star-formation efficiency. However, when considering cosmic variance and possible mergers as expected in over-dense environments &ndash; as traced by ZF-UDS-7329 &ndash; the stellar fractions could be reduced to f<sub>&sext;</sub> ≈ 50&percnt;, which is more consistent with galaxy formation models and the stellar-to-halo mass relation at lower redshifts. We conclude that ZF-UDS-7329 forms extremely efficient in the early universe, but does not necessitate unseen galaxies at higher redshifts since the inferred SFR of ancestors are consistent with those seen in z&gt;6 galaxies.

Utilizing Prism 1-5μm spectroscopy, we confirm that all 12 sources that eluded confirmation by ground-based spectroscopy lie at z&gt;3, resulting in a spectroscopically confirmed number density of ~1.4X10^-5Mpc^-3 between z~3-4. Rest-frame U-V vs V-J color selections show high effectiveness in identifying quiescent galaxies, with a purity of~90%. Our analysis shows that parametric star-formation histories (SFHs) from FAST++ and binned SFHs from Prospector on average yield consistent results, revealing diverse formation and quenching times. The oldest galaxy formed ~6X10^10M<sub>&odot;</sub> by z~10 and has been quiescent for over 1 Gyr at z~3.2. We detect two galaxies with ongoing star formation and six with active galactic nuclei (AGN). We demonstrate that the choice of stellar population models, stellar libraries, and nebular or AGN contributions does not significantly affect the derived average SFHs of the galaxies. We demonstrate that extending spectral fitting beyond the rest-frame optical regime reduces the inferred average star formation rates in the earliest time bins of the SFH reconstruction. The assumed SFH prior influences the star formation rate at early times, where spectral diagnostic power is limited. Simulated z~3 quiescent galaxies from IllustrisTNG, SHARK, and Magneticum broadly match the average SFHs of the observed sample but struggle to capture the full diversity, particularly at early stages. Our results emphasize the need for mechanisms that rapidly build stellar mass and quench star formation within the first billion years of the Universe.

### 123) [2410.01905](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01905v1): The Burstiness of Star Formation at z~6: A Huge Diversity in the Recent Star Formation Histories of Very UV-faint Galaxies

<p> Ryan Endsley, John Chisholm, Daniel P. Stark, Michael W. Topping, Lily Whitler </p>
<p>
IRAC data have long implied that early (z≳6) galaxies often have very high specific star formation rates (sSFR≳30 Gyr^-1), but JWST data have shown that at least some early galaxies are forming stars far less vigorously. Here, we systematically analyze the recent star formation histories (SFHs) of a large (N=368) sample of z~6 Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) spanning -22≲ M_UV≲-16 assembled from ACS+NIRCam imaging in the GOODS and Abell 2744 fields. We find that very low Hα-to-UV luminosity ratios (L_Hα/L_UV) and strong recent downturns in star formation rate (SFR) are ≈5× more common among the UV-faintest subset of our sample (&langle; M_UV&rangle;=-17.4) compared to the brightest subset (&langle; M_UV&rangle;=-20.0). The frequency of high L_Hα/L_UV and strong recent SFR upturns is approximately constant with UV luminosity. We discuss how bursty SFHs naturally reproduce this much greater diversity in recent SFHs among very UV-faint galaxies. Using public NIRSpec/prism data, we newly confirm recent strong SFR downturns among three LBGs in our sample, and validate our photometric inferences on key SFH signatures among z~6 LBGs in general. Our results imply that early galaxies frequently cycle through phases of rapid stellar mass assembly and other periods of much slower growth. This yields huge (≳1-2 mag) fluctuations in M_UV on rapid (~10-30 Myr) timescales, helping explain the surprising abundance of z&gt;10 galaxies. Finally, we caution that this burstiness causes all existing high-redshift samples (particularly line-selected samples) to be far less complete to galaxies with long recent phases of low sSFR than those currently undergoing a burst.

<p>
Rest-frame far-ultraviolet (FUV) observations from JWST are revolutionizing our understanding of the high-z galaxies that drove reionization and the mechanisms by which they accomplished it. To fully interpret these observations, we must be able to diagnose how properties of the interstellar medium (ISM; e.g., column density, covering fraction, outflow velocity) directly relate to the absorption features produced. Using the high-S/N and high-resolution FUV spectra of 45 nearby star-forming galaxies from CLASSY, we present the largest uniform, simultaneous characterization of neutral and low-ionization state (LIS) interstellar UV absorption lines (OI, SiII, SII, CII, AlII) across a wide range of galaxy properties. We also present 21-cm HI observations for 35 galaxies, multiple of which are gas-poor or non-detected, possibly indicating the onset of a post-starburst phase. We find that our simultaneous 1-component Voigt profile fits are capable of accurately modeling the LIS absorption for ~75% of galaxies, mitigating challenges associated with saturation, infilling, and degeneracies. While the most massive galaxies require additional components, our 1-component fits return average properties of the absorbing gas and follow the scaling relations described by a single gas cloud. We explore connections between LIS absorption and direct tracers of the neutral ISM (OI, Ly-alpha, HI 21-cm), finding that CII most closely traces the neutral gas trends while other ions exhibit weaker correlations. Given the challenges with directly observing HI at higher-z, we demonstrate that LIS absorption can be a powerful means to study the neutral ISM and present empirical relationships for predicting neutral gas properties.

### 125) [2409.18605](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18605v2): Growth of Massive Black-Holes in FFB Galaxies at Cosmic Dawn

<p> Avishai Dekel, Nicholas C. Stone, Dhruba Dutta Chowdhury, Shmuel Gilbaum, Zhaozhou Li, Nir Mandelker, Frank C. van den Bosch </p>
<p>
The scenario of feedback-free starbursts (FFB), which predicts excessively bright galaxies at cosmic dawn as observed using JWST, may provide a natural setting for black hole (BH) growth. This involves the formation of intermediate-mass seed BHs and their runaway mergers into super-massive BHs with high BH-to-stellar mass ratios and low AGN luminosities. We present a scenario of merger-driven BH growth in FFB galaxies and study its feasibility. BH seeds form within the building blocks of the FFB galaxies, namely, thousands of compact star clusters, each starbursting in a free-fall time of a few Myr before the onset of stellar and supernova feedback. The BH seeds form by rapid core collapse in the FFB clusters, in a few free-fall times, sped up by the migration of massive stars due to the young, broad stellar mass function and stimulated by a `gravo-gyro' instability due to internal cluster rotation and flattening. BHs of 10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub> are expected in 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> FFB clusters within sub-kpc galactic disks at z ~ 10. The BHs then migrate to the galaxy center by dynamical friction, hastened by the compact FFB stellar galactic disk configuration. Efficient mergers of the BH seeds will produce 10^6-8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> BHs with a BH-to-stellar mass ratio ~ 0.01 by z ~ 4-7, as observed. The growth of the central BH by mergers can overcome the bottleneck introduced by gravitational wave recoils if the BHs inspiral within a relatively cold disk or if the escape velocity from the galaxy is boosted by a wet compaction event. Such events, common in massive galaxies at high redshifts, can also help by speeding up the inward BH migration and by providing central gas to assist with the final parsec problem. The cold disk version of the FFB scenario provides a feasible route for the formation of supermassive BHs.

### 126) [2409.16347](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16347v2): TRINITY VI: Connection between Galaxy Star Formation Rates and Supermassive Black Hole Accretion Rates from z=0-10

<p> Haowen Zhang, Peter Behroozi, Marta Volonteri, Joseph Silk, Xiaohui Fan, James Aird, Jinyi Yang, Feige Wang, Philip F. Hopkins </p>
<p>
We infer supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion rates and Eddington ratios as a function of SMBH/host galaxy mass and redshift with the empirical TRINITY model of dark matter halo&ndash;galaxy&ndash;SMBH connection. The galaxy&ndash;SMBH mass and growth rate connection from TRINITY matches galaxy observables from 0&lt;z&lt;13 and SMBH observables from 0&lt;z&lt;6.5. Key findings include: 1) the ratio between cosmic SMBH accretion rate and galaxy star formation rate stays constant at ~ 2× 10^-3 from z=0-4, and decreases by 2 orders of magnitude from z=4-10; 2) the average SMBH Eddington ratio η increases towards higher redshifts, nearly reaching η=1 at z~ 10; 3) at fixed redshift for z&lt;3, SMBHs/galaxies with higher masses have lower η, consistent with AGN downsizing; 4) the average ratio of specific SMBH accretion rate (SBHAR) to average specific star formation rate (SSFR) is nearly mass-independent, with a value SBHAR/SSFR~ 1, which decreases slightly from z=10 to z=0; 5) similar to galaxies, SMBHs reach their peak efficiency to convert baryons into mass when host halos reach 10^12 M<sub>&odot;</sub>; 6) given galaxy and SMBH growth histories from TRINITY, the local descendants of 1&lt;z&lt;11 overmassive JWST AGNs will remain outliers from the local SMBH mass&ndash;galaxy mass relation. These findings combine to give a simple explanation for massive (10^9-10^10M<sub>&odot;</sub>) quasars at z&gt;6: at these redshifts, dark matter halos grow with an e-folding time of ~ 45 Myrs, driving similar growth rates in both galaxies and SMBHs.

### 127) [2409.10093](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10093v1): First map of D_2H^+ emission revealing the true centre of a prestellar core: further insights into deuterium chemistry

<p> L. Pagani, Arnaud Belloche, Bérengère Parise </p>
<p>
Context. IRAS 16293E is a rare case of a prestellar core being subjected to the effects of at least one outflow.Aims. We want to disentangle the actual structure of the core from the outflow impact and evaluate the evolutionary stage of the core. Methods. Prestellar cores being cold and depleted, the best tracers of their central regions are the two isotopologues of trihydrogren cation which are observable from the ground, ortho-H<sub>2</sub>D and para-D_2H . We used the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) telescope to map the para-D_2H^+ emission in IRAS 16293E and collected James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) archival data of ortho-H<sub>2</sub>D^+ . We compare their emission to that of other tracers, including dust emission, and analyse their abundance with the help of a 1D radiative transfer tool. The ratio of the abundances of ortho-H<sub>2</sub>D^+ and para-D_2H^+ can be used to estimate the stage of the chemical evolution of the core.Results. We have obtained the first complete map of para-D_2H^+ emission in a prestellar core. We compare it to a map of ortho-H<sub>2</sub>D^+ and show their partial anti-correlation. This reveals a strongly evolved core with a para-D_2H^+/ortho-H<sub>2</sub>D^+ abundance ratio towards the centre for which we obtain a conservative lower limit from 3.9 (at 12 K) up to 8.3 (at 8 K) while the high extinction of the core is indicative of a central temperature below 10 K. This ratio is higher than predicted by the known chemical models found in the literature. Para-D_2H^+ (and indirectly ortho-H<sub>2</sub>D^+) is the only species that reveals the true centre of this core, while the emission of other molecular tracers and dust are biased by the temperature structure that results from the impact of the outflow.Conclusions. This study invites to reconsider the analysis of previous observations of this source and possibly questions the validity of the deuteration chemical models or of the reaction and inelastic collisional rate coefficients of the H^+3 isotopologue family. This could impact the deuteration clock predictions for all sources.

### 128) [2409.01255](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01255v3): PAMS: The Perseus Arm Molecular Survey &ndash; I. Survey description and first results

The external environments surrounding molecular clouds vary widely across galaxies such as the Milky Way, and statistical samples of clouds are required to understand them. We present the Perseus Arm Molecular Survey (PAMS), a James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) survey combining new and archival data of molecular-cloud complexes in the outer Perseus spiral arm in ^12CO, ^13CO, and C^18O (J=3-2). With a survey area of ~8 deg<sup>2</sup>, PAMS covers well-known complexes such as W3, W5, and NGC 7538 with two fields at &ell; ≈ 110&deg; and &ell; ≈ 135&deg;. PAMS has an effective resolution of 17 arcsec, and rms sensitivity of T_mb = 0.7-1.0 K in 0.3 km s<sup>-1</sup> channels. Here we present a first look at the data, and compare the PAMS regions in the Outer Galaxy with Inner Galaxy regions from the CO Heterodyne Inner Milky Way Plane Survey (CHIMPS). By comparing the various CO data with maps of H<sub>2</sub> column density from Herschel, we calculate representative values for the CO-to-H<sub>2</sub> column-density X-factors, which are X_^12 CO (3-2)=4.0×10^20 and X_^13 CO (3-2)=4.0×10^21cm<sup>2</sup> (K km s<sup>-1</sup>)^-1 with a factor of 1.5 uncertainty. We find that the emission profiles, size-linewidth and mass-radius relationships of ^13CO-traced structures are similar between the Inner and Outer Galaxy. Although PAMS sources are slightly more massive than their Inner Galaxy counterparts for a given size scale, the discrepancy can be accounted for by the Galactic gradient in gas-to-dust mass ratio, uncertainties in the X-factors, and selection biases. We have made the PAMS data publicly available, complementing other CO surveys targeting different regions of the Galaxy in different isotopologues and transitions.

### 129) [2408.14545](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14545v1): H_3^+ absorption and emission in local U/LIRGs with JWST/NIRSpec: Evidence for high H<sub>2</sub> ionization rates

<p>
We study the 3.4-4.4μm fundamental rovibrational band of H3+, a key tracer of the ionization of the molecular interstellar medium (ISM), in a sample of 12 local (d&lt; 400 Mpc) ultra/luminous infrared galaxies (U/LIRGs) observed with JWST/NIRSpec. The P, Q, and R branches of the band are detected in 13 out of 20 analyzed regions within these U/LIRGs, which increases the number of extragalactic H3+ detections by a factor of 6. For the first time in the ISM, the H3+ band is observed in emission in 3 of these regions. In the remaining 10 regions, the band is seen in absorption. The absorptions are produced toward the 3.4-4.4μm hot dust continuum rather than toward the stellar continuum, indicating that they likely originate in clouds associated with the dust continuum source. The H3+ band is undetected in Seyfert-like U/LIRGs where the mildly obscured X-ray radiation from the AGN might limit the abundance of this molecule. For the detections, the H3+ abundances, N(H3+)/N_H = (0.5-5.5)x10^-7, imply relatively high ionization rates between 3x10^-16 and &gt;4x10^-15 s<sup>-1</sup>, which are likely associated with high-energy cosmic rays. In half of the targets the absorptions are blue-shifted by 50-180 km/s, which are lower than the molecular outflow velocities measured using other tracers such as OH 119μm or rotational CO lines. This suggests that H3+ traces gas close to the outflow launching sites before it has been fully accelerated. We used nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium models to investigate the physical conditions of these clouds. In 7 out of 10 objects, the H3+ excitation is consistent with inelastic collisions with H2 in warm translucent molecular clouds (T_kin ~ 250-500 K and n(H2) ~ 10^(2-3) cm^-3). In three objects, dominant infrared pumping excitation is required to explain the absorptions from the (3,0) and (2,1) levels of H3+ detected for the first time in the ISM.

### 130) [2408.13312](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13312v1): The Ultraviolet Slopes of Early Universe Galaxies: The Impact of Bursty Star Formation, Dust, and Nebular Continuum Emission

<p> Desika Narayanan, Daniel P. Stark, Steven L. Finkelstein, Paul Torrey, Qi Li, Fergus Cullen, Micheal W. Topping, Federico Marinacci, Laura V. Sales, Xuejian Shen, Mark Vogelsberger </p>
<p>
JWST has enabled the detection of the UV continuum of galaxies at z&gt;10, evidencing a population of extremely blue, potentially dust-free galaxies. Interpreting the UV spectra of galaxies as they redden is complicated by the well-known degeneracy between stellar ages, dust, and nebular continuum. The main goal of this paper is to develop a theoretical model for the relationship between galaxy UV slopes, bursty star formation histories, dust evolution, and the contribution from nebular regions. We accomplish this via cosmological zoom-in simulations, and in specific, build a layered model where we simulate the UV slopes of galaxies with increasingly complex physics. Our main results follow. (i) Unattenuated stellar populations with no nebular emission exhibit a diverse range of intrinsic UV slopes, with values ranging from beta ~ -3 &ndash;&gt; -2.2 due to long delays between bursts. This is manifested by an inverse correlation between the intrinsic UV slope and sSFR for early galaxies such that higher sSFR corresponds to bluer UV slopes. (ii) When including dust, our model galaxies demonstrate a rapid rise in dust obscuration between z ~ 8-10. This increase in dust mass is due to high grain-grain shattering rates, and enhanced growth per unit dust mass in very small grains, resulting in UV-detected galaxies at z ~ 12 descending into ALMA-detectable galaxies by z ~ 6. The rapid rise in dust content at z ~ 8-10 leads to a systematic reddening of the UV slopes during this redshift range. (iii) The inclusion of nebular continuum reddens the UV slope by a median factor Delta beta ~ 0.2-0.4. However, when including nebular continuum, our highest redshift galaxies (z~12) are insufficiently blue compared to observations; this may imply an evolving escape fraction from HII regions with redshift.

<p>
The escape of Lyman-alpha photons at redshifts greater than two is an ongoing subject of study and an important quantity to further understanding of Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs), the transmission of Lyman-alpha photons through the interstellar medium and intergalactic medium, and the impact these LAEs have on cosmic reionisation. This study aims to assess the Lyman-alpha escape fraction over the redshift range 2.9&lt;z&lt;6.7, focusing on VLT/MUSE-selected, gravitationally lensed, intrinsically faint LAEs. These galaxies are of particular interest as the potential drivers of cosmic reionisation. We assessed the Lyman-alpha escape fraction in two ways: through an individual study of 96 LAEs behind the A2744 lensing cluster, with JWST/NIRCam and HST data, and through a study of the global evolution of the escape fraction using the state-of-the-art luminosity functions for LAEs and the UV-selected `parent' population (dust-corrected). We compared these studies to those in the literature based on brighter samples. We find a negligible redshift evolution of the escape fraction for our individual galaxies; it is likely that it was washed out by significant intrinsic scatter. We observed a more significant evolution towards higher escape fractions with decreasing UV magnitude and fit this relation. When comparing the two luminosity functions to derive the escape fraction in a global sense, we saw agreement with previous literature when integrating the luminosity functions to a bright limit. However, when integrating using a faint limit equivalent to the observational limits of our samples, we observed enhanced escape fraction values, particularly around z~6, where the escape fraction becomes consistent with 100%. This indicates for the faint regimes we sampled that galaxies towards reionisation tend to allow very large fractions of Lyman-alpha photons to escape. (shortened)

We present JWST NIRCam imaging targeting 13 z~3 infrared-luminous (L_IR~5×10^12L<sub>&odot;</sub>) galaxies from the ALESS survey with uniquely deep, high-resolution (0.08''-0.16'') ALMA 870μm imaging. The 2.0-4.4μm (observed frame) NIRCam imaging reveals the rest-frame near-infrared stellar emission in these submillimeter-selected galaxies (SMGs) at the same (sub-)kpc resolution as the 870μm dust continuum. The newly revealed stellar morphologies show striking similarities with the dust continuum morphologies at 870μm, with the centers and position angles agreeing for most sources, clearly illustrating that the spatial offsets reported previously between the 870μm and HST morphologies were due to strong differential dust obscuration. The F444W sizes are 78±21% larger than those measured at 870μm, in contrast to recent results from hydrodynamical simulations that predict larger 870μm sizes. We report evidence for significant dust obscuration in F444W for the highest-redshift sources, emphasizing the importance of longer-wavelength MIRI imaging. The majority of the sources show evidence that they are undergoing mergers/interactions, including tidal tails/plumes &ndash; some of which are also detected at 870μm. We find a clear correlation between NIRCam colors and 870μm surface brightness on ~1 kpc scales, indicating that the galaxies are primarily red due to dust &ndash; not stellar age &ndash; and we show that the dust structure on ~kpc-scales is broadly similar to that in nearby galaxies. Finally, we find no strong stellar bars in the rest-frame near-infrared, suggesting the extended bar-like features seen at 870μm are highly obscured and/or gas-dominated structures that are likely early precursors to significant bulge growth.

We present observations of the type-2 Seyfert NGC7172 obtained with the medium-resolution spectrometer (MRS) of the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on board of the JWST. This galaxy hosts one of the lowest ionised gas mass outflow rates (Mout~0.005 M/yr) in a sample of six AGN with similar bolometric luminosities (log Lbol~44erg/s) within the Galactic Activity, Torus and Outflow Survey (GATOS). We aim to understand the properties of the ionised gas outflow, mainly using the emission lines from the neon transitions, that cover a broad range of ionisation potentials (IP) from ~20 eV to ~130 eV. We applied parametric and non-parametric methods to characterise the line emission and kinematics. The low excitation lines (IP&lt;25eV, e.g.[NeII]) trace the rotating disc emission. The high excitation lines (IP&gt;90eV, e.g.[NeV]), which are likely photoionised exclusively by the AGN, are expanding in the direction nearly perpendicular to the disc of the galaxy, with maximum projected velocities of ~350-500 km/s. In particular, [NeV] and [NeVI] lines reveal a biconical ionised gas outflow emerging N-S from the nuclear region, extending at least ~2.5"N and 3.8"S (projected distance of ~450 and 680 pc). Most of the emission arising in the northern part of the cone was not previously detected due to obscuration. Given the almost face-on orientation of the outflow and the almost edge-on orientation of the galaxy, NGC7172 may be a case of weak coupling. Nevertheless, we found evidence for positive feedback in two distinct outflowing clumps at projected distances of 3.1" and 4.3" (i.e. ~560 and 780 pc) SW from the AGN. We estimated a star formation rate in these regions using the [NeII] and [NeIII] luminosities of 0.08 M/yr, that is ~10% of that found in the circumnuclear ring. The star formation activity might have been triggered by the interaction between the ionised gas outflow and the ISM of the galaxy.

### 134) [2407.14294](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14294v2): Towards a universal analytical model for Population III star formation: interplay between feedback and fragmentation

<p> Boyuan Liu, James Gurian, Kohei Inayoshi, Shingo Hirano, Takashi Hosokawa, Volker Bromm, Naoki Yoshida </p>
<p>
JWST has brought us new insights into Cosmic Dawn with tentative detection of the unique signatures of metal-free Population III (Pop III) stars, such as strong HeII emission, extremely blue UV spectrum, and enhanced nitrogen abundance. Self-consistent theoretical predictions of the formation rates, sites, and masses of Pop III stars are crucial for interpreting the observations, but are challenging due to complex physical processes operating over the large range of length scales involved. One solution is to combine analytical models for the small-scale star formation process with cosmological simulations that capture the large-scale physics such as structure formation, radiation backgrounds, and baryon-dark matter streaming motion that regulate the conditions of Pop III star formation. We build an analytical model to predict the final masses of Pop III stars/clusters from the properties of star-forming clouds, based on the key results of small-scale star formation simulations and stellar evolution models. Our model for the first time considers the interplay between feedback and fragmentation and covers different modes of Pop III star formation ranging from ordinary small (~ 10-2000 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) clusters in molecular-cooling clouds to massive (≳ 10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) clusters containing supermassive (~ 10^4-3× 10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) stars under violent collapse of atomic-cooling clouds. As an example, the model is applied to the Pop III star-forming clouds in the progenitors of typical haloes hosting high-z luminous quasars, which shows that formation of Pop III massive clusters is common (~ 20-70&percnt;) in such biased (~4σ) regions, and the resulting heavy black hole seeds from supermassive stars can account for a significant fraction of observed luminous (≳ 10^46 erg s<sup>-1</sup>) quasars at z~ 6.

### 135) [2407.06281](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06281v2): Reconciling M/L Ratios Across Cosmic Time: a Concordance IMF for Massive Galaxies

<p> Pieter van Dokkum, Charlie Conroy </p>
<p>
The stellar initial mass function (IMF) is thought to be bottom-heavy in the cores of the most massive galaxies, with an excess of low mass stars compared to the Milky Way. However, studies of the kinematics of quiescent galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;5 find M/L ratios that indicate lighter IMFs. Light IMFs have also been proposed for the unexpected populations of luminous galaxies that JWST has uncovered at z&gt;7, to reduce tensions with galaxy formation models. Here we explore 'ski slope' IMFs that are simultaneously bottom-heavy, with a steep slope at low stellar masses, and top-heavy, with a shallow slope at high masses. We derive a form of the IMF for massive galaxies that is consistent with measurements in the local universe and yet produces relatively low M/L ratios at high redshift. This concordance IMF has slopes γ_1=2.40±0.09, γ_2=2.00±0.14, and γ_3=1.85±0.11 in the regimes 0.08-0.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, 0.5-1 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, and &gt;1 M<sub>&odot;</sub> respectively. The IMF parameter α, the mass excess compared to a Milky Way IMF, ranges from log(α)≈+0.3 for present-day galaxies to log(α)≈-0.1 for their star forming progenitors. The concordance IMF applies only to the central regions of the most massive galaxies, with velocity dispersions ~300 km/s, and their progenitors. However, it can be generalized using a previously-measured relation between α and σ. We arrive at the following modification to the Kroupa (2001) IMF for galaxies with σ≳ 160 km/s: γ_1≈1.3+4.3logσ_160; γ_2≈2.3-1.2logσ_160; and γ_3≈2.3-1.7logσ_160, with σ_160=σ/160 km/s. If galaxies grow primarily inside-out, so that velocity dispersions are relatively stable, these relations should also hold at high redshift.

### 136) [2407.02180](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02180v1): MICONIC: JWST/MIRI MRS observations of the nuclear and circumnuclear regions of Mrk231

<p>
We present JWST/MIRI MRS spatially resolved ~ 5-28 μm observations of the central ~4-8kpc of the ultraluminous infrared galaxy and broad absorption line quasar Mrk231. These are part of the Mid-Infrared Characterization of Nearby Iconic galaxy Centers (MICONIC) program of the MIRI European Consortium guaranteed time observations. No high excitation lines (i.e., [MgV] at 5.61μm or [NeV] at 14.32μm) typically associated with the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) are detected in the nuclear region of Mrk231. This is likely due to the intrinsically X-ray weak nature of its quasar. Some intermediate ionization potential lines, for instance, [ArIII] at 8.99μm and [SIV] at 10.51μm, are not detected either, even though they are clearly observed in a star-forming region ~920pc south-east of the AGN. Thus, the strong nuclear mid-infrared (mid-IR) continuum is also in part hampering the detection of faint lines in the nuclear region. The nuclear [NeIII]/[NeII]line ratio is consistent with values observed in star-forming galaxies. Moreover, we resolve for the first time the nuclear starburst in the mid-IR low-excitation line emission (size of ~400pc, FWHM). Several pieces of evidence also indicate that it is partly obscured even at these wavelengths. At the AGN position, the ionized and warm molecular gas emission lines have modest widths (W_80~300km/s). There are, however, weak blueshifted wings reaching velocities v_02~-400km/s in [NeII]. The nuclear starburst is at the center of a large (~8kpc), massive rotating disk with widely-spread, low velocity outflows. Given the high star formation rate of Mrk231, we speculate that part of the nuclear outflows and the large-scale non-circular motions observed in the mid-IR are driven by its powerful nuclear starburst.

<p>
We present results on the emission-line properties of z=1.4-7.5 star-forming galaxies in the Assembly of Ultradeep Rest-optical Observations Revealing Astrophysics (AURORA) Cycle 1 JWST/NIRSpec program. Based on its depth, continuous wavelength coverage from 1&ndash;5 microns, and medium spectral resolution (R~1000), AURORA includes detections of a large suite of nebular emission lines spanning a broad range in rest wavelength. We investigate the locations of AURORA galaxies in multiple different emission-line diagrams, including traditional "BPT" diagrams of [OIII]/Hbeta vs. [NII]/Halpha, [SII]/Halpha, and [OI]/Halpha, and the "ionization-metallicity" diagram of [OIII]/[OII] (O32) vs. ([OIII]+[OII])/Hbeta (R23). We also consider a bluer rest-frame "ionization-metallicity" diagram introduced recently to characterize z&gt;10 galaxies: [NeIII]/[OII] vs. ([NeIII]+[OII])/Hdelta; as well as longer-wavelength diagnostic diagrams extending into the rest-frame near-IR: [OIII]/Hbeta vs. [SIII]/[SII] (S32); and HeI/Pagamma and [SIII]/Pagamma vs. [FeII]/Pabeta. With a significant boost in signal-to-noise and large, representative samples of individual galaxy detections, the AURORA emission-line diagrams presented here definitively confirm a physical picture in which chemically-young, alpha-enhanced, massive stars photoionize the ISM in distant galaxies with a harder ionizing spectrum at fixed nebular metallicity than in their z~0 counterparts. We also uncover previously unseen evolution prior to z~2 in the [OIII]/Hbeta vs. [NII]/Halpha diagram, which motivates deep NIRSpec observations at even higher redshift. Finally, we present the first statistical sample of rest-frame near-IR emission-line diagnostics in star-forming galaxies at high redshift. In order to truly interpret rest-frame near-IR line ratios including [FeII], we must obtain better constraints on dust depletion in the high-redshift ISM.

Thanks to decades of observations using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the structure of galaxies at redshift z&gt;2 has been widely studied in the rest-frame ultraviolet regime, which traces recent star formation from young stellar populations. But, we still have little information about the spatial distribution of the older, more evolved stellar populations, constrained by the rest-frame infrared portion of the galaxies' spectral energy distribution. We present the morphological characterization of a sample of 49 massive galaxies (log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&gt;9) at redshift 3&lt;z&lt;5. The MIRI 5.6~μm imaging allows us to characterize the rest-frame near-infrared structure of galaxies beyond cosmic noon, at higher redshifts than possible with NIRCam, tracing their older and dust-insensitive stellar populations. We derive the non-parametric morphology of galaxies and model the light distribution of galaxies with a single Sérsic component and derive their parametric morphology. We find that at z&gt;3 massive galaxies show a smooth distribution of their rest-infrared light, strongly supporting the increasing number of regular disk galaxies already in place at early epochs. On the contrary, the ultraviolet structure obtained from HST/WFC3 and JWST/NIRCam observations at ~1.5~μm is generally more irregular, catching the most recent episodes of star formation. Importantly, we find a segregation of morphologies across cosmic time, where galaxies at redshift z&gt;3.75 show later-type morphologies compared to z~3 galaxies. These findings suggest a transition phase in galaxy assembly and central mass build-up, which is already taking place at z~3-4. The combined analysis of NIRCam and MIRI imaging datasets allows us to prove that the rest-frame near-infrared morphology of massive galaxies at cosmic noon is typical of compact disk galaxies with a smooth mass distribution.

### 139) [2406.17429](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.17429v1): Imaging of I Zw 18 by JWST: II. Spatially resolved star formation history

The blue compact dwarf galaxy I Zw 18 is one of the most metal-poor (Z ~ 3% Z_\sun) star-forming galaxies in the local Universe. Its evolutionary status has sparked debate within the astronomical community. We aim to investigate the stellar populations of I Zw 18 in the near-IR using JWST/NIRCam's high spatial resolution and sensitivity. Additionally, we aim to derive the galaxy's spatially resolved star formation history (SFH) over the last 1 Gyr and provide constraints for older epochs. We used DOLPHOT to measure positions and fluxes of point sources in the F115W and F200W filters' images of I Zw 18. To derive I Zw 18's SFH, we applied the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) fitting technique SFERA 2.0, using two independent sets of stellar models. Our analysis reveals three main stellar populations: one younger than ~30 Myr, mainly in the northwest star-forming (SF) region; an intermediate-age population (~ 100 - 800 Myr) in the southeast SF region; and a red and faint population linked to the underlying halo, older than 1 Gyr and possibly as old as 13.8 Gyr. The main body of the galaxy shows a very low star formation rate (SFR) of ~ 10^-4 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1 between 1 and 13.8 Gyr ago. In the last billion years, I Zw 18 shows increasing SF, with strong bursts around ~10 and ~100 Myr ago. Component C mirrors the main body's evolution but with lower SFRs. Our findings confirm that I Zw 18 contains stars of all ages, indicating it is not a young galaxy but has an old stellar halo, similar to other BCDs. The low SF activity over the past billion years supports the "slow cooking" dwarf scenario, explaining its low metal content. Currently, the galaxy is undergoing its strongest SF episode (~ 0.6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1) mainly in the northwest region, likely due to a recent gravitational interaction with Component C.

### 140) [2406.14658](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.14658v1): Growth of high redshift supermassive black holes from heavy seeds in the BRAHMA cosmological simulations: Implications of overmassive black holes

<p> Aklant K Bhowmick, Laura Blecha, Paul Torrey, Rachel S Somerville, Luke Zoltan Kelley, Mark Vogelsberger, Rainer Weinberger, Lars Hernquist, Aneesh Sivasankaran </p>
<p>
JWST has recently revealed a large population of accreting black holes (BHs) in the early Universe. Even after accounting for possible systematic biases, the high-z M_*-M_bh relation derived from these objects by Pacucci et al. (2023 P23 relation) is above the local scaling relation by &gt;3σ. To understand the implications of potentially overmassive high-z BH populations, we study the BH growth at z~4-7 using the [18~Mpc]^3 BRAHMA suite of cosmological simulations with systematic variations of heavy seed models that emulate direct collapse black hole (DCBH) formation. In our least restrictive seed model, we place ~10^5~M<sub>&odot;</sub> seeds in halos with sufficient dense and metal-poor gas. To model conditions for direct collapse, we impose additional criteria based on a minimum Lyman Werner flux (LW flux =10~J_21), maximum gas spin, and an environmental richness criterion. The high-z BH growth in our simulations is merger dominated, with a relatively small contribution from gas accretion. For the most restrictive simulation that includes all the above seeding criteria for DCBH formation, the high-z M_*-M_bh relation falls significantly below the P23 relation (by factor of ~10 at z~4). Only by excluding the spin and environment based criteria, and by assuming ≲750~Myr delay times between host galaxy mergers and subsequent BH mergers, are we able to reproduce the P23 relation. Overall, our results suggest that if high-z BHs are indeed systematically overmassive, assembling them would require more efficient heavy seeding channels, higher initial seed masses, additional contributions from lighter seeds to BH mergers, and / or more efficient modes for BH accretion.

We present JWST NIRSpec observations in IFS mode of the galaxy GS5001 at redshift z=3.47, the central member of a candidate protocluster in the GOODS-S field. The data cover a field of view (FoV) of 4''×4'' (~30×30~kpc<sup>2</sup>) and were obtained as part of the GA-NIFS GTO program. The observations include both high (R~2700) and low (R~100) spectral resolution data, spanning the rest-frame wavelength ranges 3700-6780A and 1300-11850A, respectively. We analyse the spatially resolved ionised gas kinematics and interstellar medium properties, including obscuration, gas metallicity, excitation, ionisation parameter, and electron density. In addition to the main galaxy (GS5001), the NIRSpec FoV covers three components in the south, with velocities blue-shifted by -150 km/s with respect to the main galaxy, and another source in the north redshifted by ~200 km/s. Optical line ratio diagnostics indicate star formation ionisation and electron densities of ~500 cm^-3 across all sources in the FoV. The gas-phase metallicity in the main galaxy is 12+log(O/H) = 8.45±0.04, and slightly lower in the companions (12+log(O/H) = 8.34-8.42), consistent with the mass-metallicity relation at z~3. We find peculiar line ratios (high log [NII]/Hα, low log [OIII]/Hβ) in the northern part of GS5001. These could be attributed to either higher metallicity, or to shocks resulting from the interaction of the main galaxy with the northern source. We identify a spatially resolved outflow in the main galaxy, with an extension of about 3 kpc. We find maximum outflow velocities of ~400 km/s, an outflow mass of (1.7±0.4)× 10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, a mass outflow rate of 23±5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1 and a mass loading factor of 0.23. These properties are compatible with star formation being the driver of the outflow.

New JWST/NIRCam wide-field slitless spectroscopy provides redshifts for four z&gt;8 galaxies located behind the lensing cluster MACS J0416.1-2403. Two of them, "Y1" and "JD", have previously reported spectroscopic redshifts based on ALMA measurements of [OIII] 88 μm and/or [CII] 157.7 μm lines. Y1 is a merging system of three components, and the existing redshift z=8.31 is confirmed. However, JD is at z=8.34 instead of the previously claimed z=9.28. JD's close companion, "JD-N", which was a previously discovered z&gt;8 candidate, is now identified at the same redshift as JD. JD and JD-N form an interacting pair. A new candidate at z&gt;8, "f090d_018", is also confirmed and is at z=8.49. These four objects are likely part of an overdensity that signposts a large structure extending ~165 kpc in projected distance and ~48.7 Mpc in radial distance. They are magnified by less than one magnitude and have intrinsic M_UV ranging from -19.57 to -20.83 mag. Their spectral energy distributions show that the galaxies are all very young with ages ~ 4-18 Myr and stellar masses about 10^7-8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. These infant galaxies have very different star formation rates ranging from a few to over a hundred M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1, but only two of them (JD and f090d_018) have blue rest-frame UV slopes β&lt;-2.0 indicative of a high Lyman-continuum photon escape fraction that could contribute significantly to the cosmic hydrogen-reionizing background. Interestingly, these two galaxies are the least massive and least active ones among the four. The other two systems have much flatter UV slopes largely because of their high dust extinction (A_V=0.9-1.0 mag). Their much lower indicated escape fractions show that even very young, actively star-forming galaxies can have negligible contribution to reionization when they quickly form dust throughout their bodies.

### 143) [2405.14980](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14980v1): Active Galactic Nuclei and Host Galaxies in COSMOS-Web. II. First Look at the Kpc-scale Dual and Offset AGN Population

<p>
Kpc-scale dual and offset Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are signposts of accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) triggered during late-stage galaxy mergers, offering crucial insights into the coevolution of SMBHs and galaxies. However, robustly confirmed systems at high redshift (e.g., z&gt;1) are scarce and biased towards the most luminous and unobscured systems. In this study, we systematically search for kpc-scale (projected separation &lt;15 kpc) dual and offset AGNs around 571 moderate-luminosity, X-ray-selected AGNs including the obscured population, utilizing deep HST ACS/F814W and multiband JWST NIRCam imaging from the COSMOS-Web survey. We identify 59 dual and 30 offset AGN candidates in late stage major mergers based on spatially-resolved spectral energy distribution analyses. This translates to ~28 and ~10 bona-fide dual and offset AGNs using a probabilistic pair counting scheme to minimize chance superpositions. Notably, the fraction of dual and offset AGNs among moderate-luminosity (L_bol~10^43-10^46 erg s<sup>-1</sup>), obscured AGNs is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that of the most luminous, unobscured quasar pairs. We find tentative evidence for an increasing pair fraction among AGNs with redshift (from a few percent at z~ 0.5 to ~22.9_-17.7^+27.5&percnt; at z~4.5) and a higher occurrence rate of dual over offset AGNs. There is no pileup of dual/offset AGNs below ~ 2~kpc separations. These results generally align with predictions from the ASTRID and Horizon-AGN cosmological simulations when matching sample selection criteria, implying a high probability of both BHs being active simultaneously in late-stage major mergers.

We present observations of the z~5.7 Lyman-break galaxy HZ10 with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU in high and low spectral resolution (G395H, spectral resolving power R~2700 and PRISM, R~100, respectively), as part of the GA-NIFS program. By spatially resolving the source (spatial resolution ~0.15'' or ~0.9kpc), we find three spatially and spectrally distinct regions of line emission along with one region of strong continuum emission, all within a projected distance of &lt;10kpc. The R2700 data features strong detections in Hβ, [OIII]λ&lambda;4959,5007, [NII]λ&lambda;6548,6584, Hα, and [SII]λ&lambda;6716,6731. The R100 data additionally contains a strong detection of the Lyα break, rest-frame UV and optical continuum, and [OII]λ&lambda;3726,3729. None of the detected lines present strong evidence for AGN excitation from line diagnostic diagrams, and no high-ionisation lines are detected. Using the detected lines, we constrain the electron density ≤ft( log_10≤ft( n_e / cm^-3)~ 3) and metallicity (~0.5-0.7 solar) in each component. Spaxel-by-spaxel fits reveal a strong east-west velocity gradient and significant line asymmetries (possibly indicating tidal features or outflows). The western component features a very red UV slope (β_UV~-0.9) and significant Hα emission, suggesting an evolved population and active star formation. A comparison to high resolution (~0.3'' or ~1.8kpc) [CII]158μm imaging obtained with the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) reveals areas of dust obscuration. Altogether, these data suggest that HZ10 represents an ongoing merger, with a complex distribution of stars, gas, and dust &lt;1Gyr after the Big Bang.

### 145) [2405.12287](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.12287v2): Improved model of the Supernova Refsdal cluster MACS J1149.5+2223 thanks to VLT/MUSE

<p>
We present new VLT/MUSE observations of the Hubble Frontier Field (HFF) galaxy cluster MACS J1149.5+2223, lensing the well-known supernova "Refsdal" into multiple images, which enabled the first cosmological applications with a strongly lensed supernova. Thanks to these data, targeting a northern region of the cluster and thus complementing our previous MUSE program on the cluster core, we release a new catalog containing 162 secure spectroscopic redshifts. We confirm 22 cluster members, which were previously only photometrically selected, and detect ten additional ones, resulting in a total of 308 secure members, of which 63% are spectroscopically confirmed. We further identify 17 new spectroscopic multiple images belonging to 6 different background sources. By exploiting MUSE data, in combination with the deep HFF images, we develop an improved total mass model of MACS J1149.5+2223. This model includes 308 total mass components for the member galaxies and requires four additional mass profiles, one of which is associated with a cluster galaxy overdensity identified in the North, representing the DM mass distribution on larger scales. The values of the resulting 34 free parameters are optimized based on the observed positions of 106 multiple images from 34 different families, that cover the redshift range between 1.240 and 5.983. Our final model has a multiple image position rms value of 0.39", which is well in agreement with that of other cluster lens models. With this refined mass model, we pave the way towards even better strong-lensing analyses that will exploit the deep and high resolution observations with HST and JWST on a pixel level in the region of the supernova Refsdal host. This will increase the number of observables by around two orders of magnitudes, thus offering us the opportunity of carrying out more precise and accurate cosmographic measurements.

### 146) [2405.02058](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.02058v1): Radiative and mechanical energies in galaxies I. Contributions of molecular shocks and PDRs in 3C 326 N

<p> J. A. Villa-Vélez, B. Godard, P. Guillard, G. Pineau des Forêts </p>
<p>
Context: Atomic and molecular lines in galaxies offer insights into energy budgets and feedback mechanisms. Aims: This study establishes a new framework for interpreting these lines and deducing energy budgets from observations. Methods: Atomic and molecular lines detected in a given object are assumed to result from the combination of distributions of shocks and photo-dissociation regions (PDR). Using the Paris-Durham shock code and the Meudon PDR code, emissions are computed over a wide range of parameters. Total emissions are calculated using probability distribution functions, with a defined distance metric based on observed and predicted intensity ratios. Results: We analyze the radio galaxy 3C 326 N, finding both shocks and PDRs necessary to explain the line fluxes. Viable solutions occur only at low densities (n_H &lt; 100 cm^-3), indicating emission from diffuse interstellar matter. The optimal solution involves low-velocity shocks (5-20 km/s) in PDRs illuminated by UV radiation ten times stronger than in the solar neighborhood. The H2 0-0 S(0) 28 μm, [CII] 158 μm, and [OI] 63 μm lines originate from PDRs, while other H2 lines mostly come from shocks. The reprocessed radiative and mechanical energies are L_UV = 6.3×10^9 L&odot; and L_K = 3.9×10^8 L<sub>&odot;</sub>, respectively, in agreement with 3C 326 N's infrared luminosity, and consistent with 1% of the AGN jet kinetic power dissipated in the interstellar medium. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the radiative and mechanical energy budgets of galaxies can be derived from observations of atomic and molecular lines alone. It highlights the unexpected importance of the diffuse medium for 3C 326 N. Comparison with new JWST data for 3C 326 N shows striking agreement, opening new prospects for predicting and interpreting extragalactic observations.

<p>
We present HeI/Hβ-flux and He/H-abundance ratios in three JWST galaxies with significant constraints on N/O-abundance ratios, GS-NDG-9422, RXCJ2248-ID, and GLASS150008 at z~ 6 mostly with the spectroscopic coverage from HeIλ4471 and HeIIλ4686 to HeIλ7065, comparing with 68 local-dwarf galaxies. We find that these high-z galaxies present strong HeI emission with HeI/Hβ flux ratios generally larger than those of local-dwarf galaxies. We derive He/H with all of the detected HeI, HeII, and 2-3 hydrogen Balmer lines in the same manner as the local He/H determination conducted for cosmology studies. These high-z galaxies show He overabundance He/H≳ 0.10 or high electron density n_e~ 10^3-4 cm^-3 much larger than local values at low O/H, 12+log (O/H)=7-8. In contrast, we obtain low He/H and n_e values for our local-dwarf galaxies by the same technique with the same helium and hydrogen lines, and confirm that the difference between the high-z and local-dwarf galaxies are not mimicked by systematics. While two scenarios of 1) He overabundance and 2) high electron density are not clearly concluded, we find that there is a positive correlation on the He/H-N/O or n_e-N/O plane by the comparison of the high-z and local-dwarf galaxies. The scenario 1) suggests that the overabundant helium and nitrogen are not explained by the standard chemical enrichment of core-collapse supernovae, but the CNO-cycle products and equilibrium ratios, respectively. The scenario 2) indicates that the strong helium lines are originated from the central dense clouds of the high-z galaxies by excessive collisional excitation.

<p>
We present the first results on the spatial distribution of star formation in 454 star-forming galaxies at 4.8&lt;z&lt;6.5 using H-Alpha emission-line maps and F444W imaging tracing the stellar continuum from JWST FRESCO NIRCam Slitless Spectroscopy. Star-forming galaxies with stellar masses 6.8≤log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;11.1 have positive H-Alpha equivalent width profiles, providing direct evidence for the inside-out growth of galaxies just after the epoch of reionisation. GALFIT is used to calculate half-light radii, R_eff and central surface densities within 1 kiloparsec, Σ_1kpc. At a fixed stellar mass of log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=9.5, Σ_1kpc, Hα is 1.04±0.05 times higher than Σ_1kpc, C, R_eff, Hα is 1.18±0.03 times larger than R_eff, C and both R_eff measurements are less than 1 kiloparsec. These measurements suggest the rapid build-up of compact bulges just after the epoch of reionisation. By comparing to work done at lower redshifts with HST WFC3 Slitless Spectroscopy as part of the 3D-HST (z=1) and CLEAR (z=0.5) surveys, we find that R_eff(z) evolves at the same pace for Hα and the continuum, but Σ_1kpc(z) evolves faster for Hα. As a function of the Hubble parameter, \fracR_eff, Hα R_eff, C=1.1h(z) and \fracΣ_1kpc,Hα Σ_1kpc,C=h(z)^1.3. These functions suggest that the inside-out growth of the disk dominates the inside-out growth of the bulge towards lower redshifts. This is supported by the redshift evolution in EW(Hα) profiles, where there is rapid increase in EW(Hα) with radius within the half-light radius at z=5.3 but only significantly increasing EW(Hα) with radius in the outer disk at z=0.5.

### 149) [2404.16036](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16036v3): Spectroscopic Confirmation of an Ultra-Massive Galaxy in a Protocluster at z ~ 4.9

<p>
We present spectroscopic confirmation of an ultra-massive galaxy (UMG) with log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 10.98 ± 0.07 at z<sub>spec</sub> = 4.8947 in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS), based on deep observations of Lyα emission with Keck/DEIMOS. The ultra-massive galaxy (UMG-28740) is the most massive member in one of the most significant overdensities in the EGS, with four additional photometric members with log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &gt; 10.5 within R_proj ~ 1 cMpc. The Lyα profile is highly asymmetric (A_f = 3.56), suggesting the presence of neutral gas within the interstellar medium, circumgalactic medium, or via AGN-driven outflows. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using a large suite of star formation histories and two sets of high-quality photometry from ground- and space-based facilities consistently estimates the stellar mass of UMG-28740 to be log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ~ 11 with a small standard deviation between measurements (σ= 0.07). While the best-fit SED models agree on stellar mass, we find discrepancies in the estimated star formation rate for UMG-28740, resulting in either a star-forming or quiescent system. JWST/NIRCam photometry of UMG-28740 strongly favors a quiescent scenario, demonstrating the need for high-quality mid-IR observations. Assuming the galaxy to be quiescent, UMG-28740 formed the bulk of its stars at z &gt; 10 and is quenching at z ~ 8, resulting in a high star formation efficiency at high redshift (ε~ 0.2 at z ~ 5 and ε≳ 1 at z ≳ 8). As the most massive galaxy in its protocluster environment, UMG-28740 is a unique example of the impossibly early galaxy problem.

<p>
The JWST has captured the sharpest IR images ever taken of the Horsehead nebula, a prototypical moderately irradiated PDR that is fully representative of most of the UV-illuminated molecular gas in the Milky Way and star-forming galaxies. We investigate the impact of FUV radiation of a molecular cloud and constrain the structure of the edge of the PDR and its illumination conditions. We used NIRCam and MIRI to obtain 17 broadband and 6 narrowband maps from 0.7 to 28 μm. We mapped the dust emission, scattered light, and several gas phase lines. We also used HST-WFC3 maps at 1.1 and 1. 6 μm, along with HST-STIS spectroscopic observations of the Hα line. We probed the structure of the edge of the Horsehead and resolved its spatial complexity. We detected a network of faint striated features extending perpendicularly to the PDR front into the H II region in filters sensitive to nano-grain emission and light scattered by larger grains. This may indeed figure as the first detection of the entrainment of dust particles in the evaporative flow. The map of the 1-0 S(1) line of H<sub>2</sub> presents sharp sub-structures on scales as small as 1.5 arcsec. The ionization and dissociation fronts appear at distances 1-2 arcsec behind the edge of the PDR and seem to spatially coincide, indicating a thickness of the neutral atomic layer below 100 au. All broadband maps present strong color variations which can be explained by dust attenuation. Deviations of the emissions in the Hα, Paα, and Brα lines also indicate dust attenuation. With a very simple model, we derive the main features of the extinction curve. A small excess of extinction at 3 μm may be attributed to icy H<sub>2</sub>O mantles onto grains. In all lines of sight crossing the inner regions of the Horsehead, it appears that dust attenuation is non-negligible over the entire spectral range.

Weisz </p>
<p>
We present an overview and first results from the Spectroscopic Ultradeep Survey Probing Extragalactic Near-infrared Stellar Emission (SUSPENSE), executed with NIRSpec on JWST. The primary goal of the SUSPENSE program is to characterize the stellar, chemical, and kinematic properties of massive quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon. In a single deep NIRSpec/MSA configuration, we target 20 distant quiescent galaxy candidates (z=1-3, H_AB≤23), as well as 53 star-forming galaxies at z=1-4. With 16~hr of integration and the G140M-F100LP dispersion-filter combination, we observe numerous Balmer and metal absorption lines for all quiescent candidates. We derive stellar masses (logM_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>~10.2-11.5) and detailed star-formation histories (SFHs) and show that all 20 candidate quiescent galaxies indeed have quenched stellar populations. These galaxies show a variety of mass-weighted ages (0.8-3.3~Gyr) and star formation timescales (~0.5-4~Gyr), and four out of 20 galaxies were already quiescent by z=3. On average, the z&gt;1.75 [z&lt;1.75] galaxies formed 50&percnt; of their stellar mass before z=4 [z=3]. Furthermore, the typical SFHs of galaxies in these two redshift bins (z_mean=2.2~[1.3]) indicate that galaxies at higher redshift formed earlier and over shorter star-formation timescales compared to lower redshifts. Although this evolution is naturally explained by the growth of the quiescent galaxy population over cosmic time, number density calculations imply that mergers and/or late-time star formation also contribute to the evolution. In future work, we will further unravel the early formation, quenching, and late-time evolution of these galaxies by extending this work with studies on their chemical abundances, resolved stellar populations and kinematics.

<p>
We present recent JWST NIRCam imaging observations of SPT0615-JD (also known as the Cosmic Gems Arc), lensed by the galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0615-5746. The 5 arcsec long arc is the most highly magnified z&gt;10 galaxy known. It straddles the lensing critical curve and reveals five star clusters with radii of ~ 1 pc or less. We measure the full arc to have F200W 24.5 AB mag, consisting of two mirror images, each 25.3 AB mag with a median magnification of μ~ 60^+17_-8 (delensed 29.7 AB mag, M_UV = -17.8). The galaxy has an extremely strong Lyman break F115W-F200W &gt;3.2 mag (2σ lower limit), is undetected in all bluer filters (&lt; 2σ), and has a very blue continuum slope redward of the break (β= -2.7 ± 0.1). This results in a photometric redshift z<sub>phot</sub> = 10.2 ± 0.2 (95% confidence) with no significant likelihood below z&lt;9.8. Based on spectral energy distribution fitting to the total photometry, we estimate an intrinsic stellar mass of M_* ~ 2.4 - 5.6 × 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, young mass-weighted age of ~ 21 - 79 Myr, low dust content (A_V &lt; 0.15), and a low metallicity of ≲ 1&percnt;~Z<sub>&odot;</sub>. We identify a fainter third counterimage candidate within 2.2 arcsec of the predicted position, lensed to AB mag 28.4 and magnified by μ~ 2, suggesting the fold arc may only show ~ 60% of the galaxy. SPT0615-JD is a unique laboratory to study star clusters observed within a galaxy just 460 Myr after the Big Bang.

We present an analysis of rest-frame UV continuum slopes, β, using a sample of 1011 galaxies at 6.5&lt;z&lt;13 from the EPOCHS photometric sample collated from the GTO PEARLS and public ERS/GTO/GO (JADES, CEERS, NGDEEP, GLASS) JWST NIRCam imaging across 178.9~arcmin<sup>2</sup> of unmasked blank sky. We correct our UV slopes for the photometric error coupling bias using 200,000 power law SEDs for each β=\-1,-1.5,-2,-2.5,-3\ in each field, finding biases as large as Δβ≃-0.55 for the lowest SNR galaxies in our sample. Additionally, we simulate the impact of rest-UV line emission (including Lyα) and damped Lyα systems on our measured β, finding biases as large as 0.5-0.6 for the most extreme systems. We find a decreasing trend with redshift of β=-1.51±0.08-(0.097±0.010)× z, with potential evidence for Pop.~III stars or top-heavy initial mass functions (IMFs) in a subsample of 68 β+σ_β&lt;-2.8 galaxies. At z≃11.5, we measure an extremely blue β(M_UV=-19)=-2.73±0.06, deviating from simulations, indicative of low-metallicity galaxies with non-zero Lyman continuum escape fractions f<sub>esc</sub>, LyC≳0 and minimal dust content. The observed steepening of dβ/dlog_10(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) from 0.22±0.02 at z=7 to 0.81±0.13 at z=11.5 implies that dust produced in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) at early times may be ejected via outflows from low mass galaxies. We also observe a flatter dβ/dM_UV=0.03±0.02 at z=7 and a shallower dβ/dlog_10(M<sub>&sext;</sub> / M<sub>&odot;</sub>) at z&lt;11 than seen by HST, unveiling a new population of low mass, faint, galaxies reddened by dust produced in the stellar winds of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars or carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet binaries.

<p>
The ultraviolet continuum traces young stars while the near-infrared unveils older stellar populations and dust-obscured regions. Balmer emission lines provide insights on gas properties and young stellar objects but are highly affected by dust attenuation. The near-infrared Paschen lines suffer less dust attenuation and can be used to measure star formation rates (SFRs) in star-forming regions obscured by dust clouds. We select 13 sources between redshifts 1 and 3 observed with HST, JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec based on the availability of at least one Balmer and one Paschen line with S/N &gt; 5. With a newly-developed version of CIGALE, we fit their hydrogen line equivalent widths (EWs) and photometric data. We assess the impacts of the removal of spectroscopic data by comparing the quality of the fits of the spectro-photometric data to those with photometric data only. We compare the single (BC03) vs binary (BPASS) stellar populations models in the fitting process of spectro-photometric data. We derive the differential attenuation and explore different attenuation recipes by fitting spectro-photometric data with BC03. For each stellar model and for each input dataset (with and without EWs), we quantify the deviation on the SFRs and stellar masses from the "standard" choice. On average, the SFRs are overestimated and the stellar masses are underestimated when EWs are not included as input data. We find a major contribution of the Hα emission line to the broadband photometric measurements of our sources, and a trend of increasing contribution with specific SFR. Using the BPASS models has a significant impact on the derived SFRs and stellar masses. We show that a flexible attenuation recipe provides more accurate estimates of the dust attenuation parameters, especially the differential attenuation which agrees with the original value of Charlot & Fall (2000).

### 155) [2404.09112](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09112v1): The Timescales of Star Cluster Emergence: The Case of NGC 4449

<p>
We survey the young star cluster population in the dwarf galaxy NGC4449 with the goal of investigating how stellar feedback may depend on the clusters' properties. Using Ultraviolet(UV)-optical-NearIR(NIR) photometry obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope, we have recovered 99 compact sources exhibiting emission in the Paβ hydrogen recombination line. Our analysis reveals these sources possess masses 10^2&lt;M<sub>&odot;</sub>&lt;10^5, ages 1-20 Myr, and color excess E(B - V) in the range 0-1.4. After selecting clusters with mass above 3,000M<sub>&odot;</sub> to mitigate stochastic sampling of the stellar initial mass function, we find that our IR-selected clusters have a median mass of ~7×10^3  M<sub>&odot;</sub> and remain embedded in their surrounding gas and dust for 5-6 Myr. In contrast, line-emitting sources selected from existing UV/optically catalogs have a median mass of ~3.5×10^4  M<sub>&odot;</sub> and have cleared their surroundings by 4 Myr. We further find that the environment in NGC4449 is too low pressure to drive these differences. We interpret these findings as evidence that the clearing timescale from pre-supernova and supernova feedback is cluster mass-dependent. Even in clusters with mass~7,000~M<sub>&odot;</sub>, stochastic sampling of the upper end of the stellar initial mass function is present, randomly decreasing the number of massive stars available to inject energy and momentum into the surrounding medium. This effect may increase the clearing timescales in these clusters by decreasing the effectiveness of both pre-supernova and supernova feedback; neither models nor observations have so far explored such dependence explicitly. Future studies and observations with, e.g., the JWST, will fill this gap.

### 156) [2404.08910](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08910v1): Growing a nuclear star cluster from star formation and cluster mergers: The JWST NIRSpec view of NGC 4654

<p>
We present a detailed study of the centre of NGC4654, a Milky Way-like spiral galaxy in the Virgo cluster that has been reported to host a double stellar nucleus, thus promising a rare view of ongoing star cluster infall into a galaxy nucleus. Analysing JWST NIRSpec integral-field spectroscopic data and Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the inner 330 × 330 pc, we find that the nucleus harbours in fact three massive star clusters. Maps of infrared emission lines from NIRSpec show different morphologies for the ionised and molecular gas components. The emission from molecular hydrogen gas is concentrated at the NSC location, while emission from hydrogen recombination lines is more extended beyond the central cluster. The velocity fields of both gas and stars indicate that the three clusters are part of a complicated dynamical system, with the NSC having an elevated velocity dispersion in line with its high stellar mass. To investigate the stellar populations of the three clusters in more detail, we use surface brightness modelling to measure their fluxes from ultraviolet to mid-infrared wavelengths and fit their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Two of the clusters are UV-bright and well described by single stellar populations with young ages (~ 3 and 5 Myr) and low masses (M<sub>&ast;</sub> ~ 4 × 10^4 - 10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), whereas the central cluster is much more massive (3 × 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), and cannot be fitted by a single stellar population. Instead, we find that a minor young population (~ 1 Myr) embedded in a dominant old population (~ 8 Gyr) is needed to explain its SED. Given its complex composition and the close proximity of two young star clusters that are likely to merge with it within a few hundred million years, we consider NGC4654 a unique laboratory to study NSC growth from both in-situ star formation and the infall of star clusters.

### 157) [2404.05352](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05352v3): [CII] luminosity models and large-scale image cubes based on COSMOS 2020 and ALPINE-ALMA [CII] data back to the epoch of reionisation

<p>
We have implemented a novel method to create simulated [CII] emission line intensity mapping (LIM) data cubes using COSMOS 2020 galaxy catalogue data. It allows us to provide solid lower limits for previous simulation-based model predictions and the expected signal strength of upcoming surveys. We applied [CII]158μm luminosity models to COSMOS 2020 to create LIM cubes covering a 1.2×1.2 deg<sup>2</sup> sky area. These models were derived using galaxy bulk property data from the ALPINE-ALMA survey over the redshift range 4.4&lt;z&lt;5.9, while additional models were taken from the literature. The cubes cover 3.42&lt;z&lt;3.87, 4.14&lt;z&lt;4.76, 5.34&lt;z&lt;6.31, and 6.75&lt;z&lt;8.27, matched to planned observations from the EoR-Spec module of the Prime-Cam instrument in the Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST). We also created predictions including additional galaxies below current detection limits by `extrapolating' from the faint end of the COSMOS 2020 luminosity function, comparing these to predictions from the literature. In addition, we computed signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios for the power spectra, using parameters from the planned FYST survey with predicted instrumental noise levels. We find lower limits for the expected power spectrum using the likely incomplete empirical data: when normalised by 2π^2, the amplitudes at k = 1 Mpc^-1 are 3.06×10^7, 1.43×10^7, 9.80×10^5, 2.77×10^5 (Jy sr^-1)^2 for the aforementioned redshift ranges. For the extrapolated sample, the power spectra are consistent with prior predictions, indicating that extrapolation is a viable method for creating mock LIM cubes. In this case, we expect a result of S/N&gt;1 when using FYST parameters. However, our high-redshift results remain inconclusive because of the poor completeness of COSMOS 2020 at z&gt;6.3. These predictions will be improved on the basis of future JWST data.

### 158) [2404.04341](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04341v1): JWST/NIRSpec and MIRI observations of an expanding, jet-driven bubble of warm H<sub>2</sub> in the radio galaxy 3C 326 N

The physical link between AGN activity and the suppression of star formation in their host galaxies is one of the major open questions of AGN feedback. The Spitzer space mission revealed a subset of nearby radio galaxies with unusually bright line emission from warm (T≥ 100 K) H<sub>2</sub>, while typical star-formation tracers were exceptionally faint or undetected. We present JWST NIRSpec and MIRI IFU observations of 3C 326 N at z=0.09 and identify 19 ro-vibrational H<sub>2</sub> emission lines that probe hot (T~ 1000 K) gas as well as the rotational lines of H<sub>2</sub> 0&ndash;0 S(3), S(5), and S(6) which probe most of the 2× 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> of warm H<sub>2</sub> in this galaxy. CO band heads show a stellar component consistent with a "slow-rotator", typical of a massive 3×10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub> galaxy, and provide us with a reliable redshift of z=0.08979± 0.0003. Extended line emission shows a bipolar bubble expanding through the molecular disk at velocities of up to 380 km s<sup>-1</sup>, delineated by several bright clumps along the Northern outer rim, potentially from gas fragmentation. Throughout the disk, the H<sub>2</sub> is very broad, FWHM ~100-1300 km s<sup>-1</sup>, and shows dual-component Gaussian line profiles. [FeII]λ1.644 and Paα follow the same morphology, however [NeIII]λ15.56 is more symmetric about the nucleus. We show that the gas, with the exception of [NeIII]λ15.56, is predominantly heated by shocks driven by the radio jet and that the accompanying line broadening is sufficient to suppress star formation. We also compare the rotational and ro-vibrational lines, finding that the latter can be a good proxy to the global morphology and kinematic properties of the former in strongly turbulent environments. This enables studies of turbulence in galaxies at intermediate and high redshifts while most rotational lines are redshifted out of the MIRI bandpass for z&gt;1.5.

Mid-infrared emission features probe the properties of ionized gas, and hot or warm molecular gas. The Orion Bar is a frequently studied photodissociation region (PDR) containing large amounts of gas under these conditions, and was observed with the MIRI IFU aboard JWST as part of the "PDRs4All" program. The resulting IR spectroscopic images of high angular resolution (0.2") reveal a rich observational inventory of mid-IR emission lines, and spatially resolve the substructure of the PDR, with a mosaic cutting perpendicularly across the ionization front and three dissociation fronts. We extracted five spectra that represent the ionized, atomic, and molecular gas layers, and measured the most prominent gas emission lines. An initial analysis summarizes the physical conditions of the gas and the potential of these data. We identified around 100 lines, report an additional 18 lines that remain unidentified, and measured the line intensities and central wavelengths. The H I recombination lines originating from the ionized gas layer bordering the PDR, have intensity ratios that are well matched by emissivity coefficients from H recombination theory, but deviate up to 10% due contamination by He I lines. We report the observed emission lines of various ionization stages of Ne, P, S, Cl, Ar, Fe, and Ni, and show how certain line ratios vary between the five regions. We observe the pure-rotational H<sub>2</sub> lines in the vibrational ground state from 0-0 S(1) to 0-0 S(8), and in the first vibrationally excited state from 1-1 S(5) to 1-1 S(9). We derive H<sub>2</sub> excitation diagrams, and approximate the excitation with one thermal (~700 K) component representative of an average gas temperature, and one non-thermal component (~2700 K) probing the effect of UV pumping. We compare these results to an existing model for the Orion Bar PDR and highlight the differences with the observations.

<p>
We present JWST NIRCam imaging of B14-65666 ("Big Three Dragons"), a bright Lyman-break galaxy system (M_UV=-22.5 mag) at z=7.15. The high angular resolution of NIRCam reveals the complex morphology of two galaxy components: galaxy E has a compact core (E-core), surrounded by diffuse, extended, rest-frame optical emission, which is likely to be tidal tails; and galaxy W has a clumpy and elongated morphology with a blue UV slope (β_UV=-2.2±0.1). The flux excess, F356W-F444W, peaks at the E-core (1.05^+0.08_-0.09 mag), tracing the presence of strong [OIII] 4960,5008 Å emission. ALMA archival data show that the bluer galaxy W is brighter in dust continua than the redder galaxy E, while the tails are bright in [OIII] 88 μm. The UV/optical and sub-mm SED fitting confirms that B14-65666 is a major merger in a starburst phase as derived from the stellar mass ratio (3:1 to 2:1) and the star-formation rate, ≃1 dex higher than the star-formation main sequence at the same redshift. The galaxy E is a dusty (A_V=1.2±0.1 mag) starburst with a possible high dust temperature (≥63-68 K). The galaxy W would have a low dust temperature (≤27-33 K) or patchy stellar-and-dust geometry, as suggested from the infrared excess (IRX) and β_UV diagram. The high optical-to-FIR [OIII] line ratio of the E-core shows its lower gas-phase metallicity (≃0.2-0.4 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) than the galaxy W. These results agree with a scenario where major mergers disturb morphology and induce nuclear dusty starbursts triggered by less-enriched inflows. B14-65666 shows a picture of complex stellar buildup processes during major mergers in the epoch of reionization.

<p>
Various galaxy merger detection methods have been applied to diverse datasets. However, it is difficult to understand how they compare. We aim to benchmark the relative performance of machine learning (ML) merger detection methods. We explore six leading ML methods using three main datasets. The first one (the training data) consists of mock observations from the IllustrisTNG simulations and allows us to quantify the performance metrics of the detection methods. The second one consists of mock observations from the Horizon-AGN simulations, introduced to evaluate the performance of classifiers trained on different, but comparable data. The third one consists of real observations from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) survey. For the binary classification task (mergers vs. non-mergers), all methods perform reasonably well in the domain of the training data. At 0.1&lt;z&lt;0.3, precision and recall range between ~70&percnt; and 80&percnt;, both of which decrease with increasing z as expected (by ~5&percnt; for precision and ~10&percnt; for recall at 0.76&lt;z&lt;1.0). When transferred to a different domain, the precision of all classifiers is only slightly reduced, but the recall is significantly worse (by ~20-40&percnt; depending on the method). Zoobot offers the best overall performance in terms of precision and F1 score. When applied to real HSC observations, all methods agree well with visual labels of clear mergers but can differ by more than an order of magnitude in predicting the overall fraction of major mergers. For the multi-class classification task to distinguish pre-, post- and non-mergers, none of the methods offer a good performance, which could be partly due to limitations in resolution and depth of the data. With the advent of better quality data (e.g. JWST and Euclid), it is important to improve our ability to detect mergers and distinguish between merger stages.

<p>
GHZ2/GLASS-z12 has been recently observed by JWST with both NIRSpec and MIRI spectrographs, making it the most distant galaxy (z<sub>spec</sub>=12.34) with complete spectroscopic coverage from rest-frame UV to optical. It is identified as a strong CIV_1549 emitter with many detected emission lines (NIV], HeII, OIII], NIII], CIII], [OII], [NeIII], [OIII], and Hα), including a remarkable OIII_1333 Bowen fluorescence line. We analyze in this paper the joint NIRSpec+MIRI spectral data set. Combining six optical diagnostics (R2, R3, R23, O32, Ne3O2, and Ne3O2Hd), we find extreme ionization conditions, with O32 =1.39 ± 0.19 and Ne3O2 =0.37 ± 0.18 in stark excess compared to typical values in the ISM at lower redshifts. These line properties are compatible either with an AGN or with a compact, dense star-forming environment (Σ_SFR ~ 10^2-10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr/kpc<sup>2</sup>), with a high ionization parameter (log_10(U) =-1.75 ± 0.16), a high ionizing photon production efficiency log(ξ<sub>ion</sub>) = 25.7_-0.1^+0.2, and a low, although not pristine, metal content between 5&percnt; and 11&percnt; Z<sub>&odot;</sub> (confirmed by the T_e method), indicating a rapid metal enrichment in the last few Myrs. These properties also suggest that a substantial amount of ionizing photons (~ 10&percnt;) are leaking outside. The general lessons learned from GHZ2 are the following: (i) the UV to optical combined nebular indicators are broadly in agreement with UV-only or optical-only indicators. (ii) UV+optical diagnostics fail to discriminate between an AGN and star-formation in a low metallicity, high density, and extreme ionization environment. (iii) comparing the nebular line ratios with local analogs may be approaching its limits at z ≳ 10, as this approach is potentially challenged by the unique conditions of star formation experienced by galaxies at these extreme redshifts.

### 163) [2403.07103](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07103v2): Between the Extremes: A JWST Spectroscopic Benchmark for High-redshift Galaxies Using ~500 Confirmed Sources at z≥slant5

<p>
The exceptional spectra of the most luminous z&gt;10 sources observed so far have challenged our understanding of early galaxy evolution, requiring a new observational benchmark for meaningful interpretation. As such, we construct spectroscopic templates representative of high-redshift, star-forming populations, using 482 confirmed sources at z=5.0-12.9 with JWST/NIRSpec prism observations, and report on their average properties. We find z=5-11 galaxies are dominated by blue UV continuum slopes (β=-2.3 to -2.7) and reduced Balmer indices, characteristic of dust-poor and young systems, with a shift towards bluer slopes and younger ages with redshift. The evolution is mirrored by ubiquitous CIII] detections across all redshifts (rest-frame equivalent widths of =5-14 Å), which increase in strength towards early times. Rest-frame optical lines reveal elevated ratios (O32=7-31, R23=5-8, and Ne3O2=1-2) and subsolar metallicities (log O/H=7.3-7.9), typical of ionization conditions and metallicities rarely observed in z~0 populations. Within our sample, we identify 57 Lyα emitters, which we stack and compare to a matched sample of nonemitters. The former are characterized by more extreme ionizing conditions with enhanced CIII], CIV, and HeII+[OIII] line emission, younger stellar populations from Balmer jumps, and a more pristine interstellar medium seen through bluer UV slopes and elevated rest-frame optical line ratios. The novel comparison illustrates important intrinsic differences between the two populations, with implications for Lyα visibility. The spectral templates derived here represent a new observational benchmark with which to interpret high-redshift sources, lifting our constraints on their global properties to unprecedented heights and extending out to the earliest of cosmic times.

<p>
Extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) are typically characterized by high equivalent widths (EWs) which are driven by elevated specific star formation rates (sSFR) in low-mass galaxies with subsolar metallicities and little dust. Such extreme systems are rare in the local universe, but the number density of EELGs increases with redshift. Such starburst galaxies are currently presumed to be the main drivers of hydrogen reionization over 5.5&lt;z&lt;15, which serves to motivate many of the searches for high-z EELGs. We aim to characterize the physical properties of a sample of ~730 EELGs at 4&lt;z&lt;9 photometrically selected from the CEERS survey using JWST/NIRCam. We validate our method and demonstrate the main physical properties of a subset of EELGs using NIRSpec spectra. We create synthetic NIRCam observations of EELGs using empirical templates based on ~2000 local metal-poor starbursts to select EELGs based on color-color criteria. We study their properties based on SED fitting and flux excess from emission lines in the photometric filters. Our sample has a mean stellar mass of 10^7.84M<sub>&odot;</sub> with high sSFRs with a mean value of 10^-7.03 yr^-1. We consider a delayed-τ model for the star formation history and find our sample of EELGs are young with a mean value of the time after the onset of star formation of 45Myr. We find that they have similar line ratios to local metal-poor starbursts with high log([OIII]/Hβ)&gt;0.4-1 which indicates that star formation may be the dominant source of ionization. Based on the photometric fluxes, we find an increase of EW([OIII]+Hβ) with sSFR and Σ_SFR, and a decrease with age and stellar mass. The sample of EELGs can reach Σ_SFR&gt;10M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1kpc^-2 which indicate they are strong candidates of LyC leakers. Another indirect indicator is the high values of O32&gt;5 that can be reached for some galaxies in the sample.

Dual quasars, two active supermassive black holes at galactic scales, represent crucial objects for studying the impact of galaxy mergers and quasar activity on the star formation rate (SFR) within their host galaxies, particularly at cosmic noon when SFR peaks. We present JWST/MIRI mid-infrared integral field spectroscopy of J074922.96+225511.7, a dual quasar with a projected separation of 3.8 kilo-parsec at a redshift z of 2.17. We detect spatially extended [Fe II] 5.34μm and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) 3.3μm emissions from the star formation activity in its host galaxy. We derive the SFR of 10^3.0±0.2 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1 using PAH 3.3μm, which is five times higher than that derived from the cutoff luminosity of the infrared luminosity function for galaxies at z~2. While the SFR of J0749+2255 agrees with that of star-forming galaxies of comparable stellar mass at the same redshifts, its molecular gas content falls short of expectations based on the molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt law. This discrepancy may result from molecular gas depletion due to the longer elevated stage of star formation, even after the molecular gas reservoir is depleted. We do not observe any quasar-driven outflow that impacts PAH and [Fe II] in the host galaxy based on the spatially resolved maps. From the expected flux in PAH-based star formation, the [Fe II] line likely originates from the star-forming regions in the host galaxy. Our study highlights the stardust nature of J0749+2255, indicating a potential connection between the dual quasar phase and intense star formation activities.

### 166) [2403.03977](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03977v2): Gas-phase metallicity gradients in galaxies at z ~ 6-8

The study of gas-phase metallicity and its spatial distribution at high redshift is crucial to understand the processes that shaped the growth and evolution of galaxies in the early Universe. Here we study the spatially resolved metallicity in three systems at z~6-8, namely A2744-YD4, BDF-3299, and COSMOS24108, with JWST NIRSpec IFU low-resolution (R~100) spectroscopic observations. These are among the highest-z sources in which metallicity gradients have been probed so far. Each of these systems hosts several spatial components in the process of merging within a few kpc, identified from the rest-frame UV and optical stellar continuum and ionised gas emission line maps. The sources have heterogeneous properties, with stellar masses log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ~ 7.6-9.3, star formation rates (SFRs) ~1-15 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1, and gas-phase metallicities 12+log(O/H) ~ 7.7-8.3, which exhibit a large scatter within each system. Their properties are generally consistent with those of the highest-z samples to date (z~3-10), though the sources in A2744-YD4 and COSMOS24108 are at the high end of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) defined by the z~3-10 sources. Moreover, the targets in this work follow the predicted slope of the MZR at z~ 6-8 from most cosmological simulations. The gas-phase metallicity gradients are consistent with being flat in the main sources of each system. Flat metallicity gradients are thought to arise from gas mixing processes on galaxy scales, such as mergers or galactic outflows and SN winds driven by intense stellar feedback, which wash out any gradient formed in the galaxy. The existence of flat gradients at z~6-8 sets also important constraints on cosmological simulations and chemical evolution models, whose predictions on the cosmic evolution of metallicity gradients differ significantly, but are mostly limited to z&lt;3 so far.

Here we present high spectral resolution itJWST NIRSpec observations of GN42437, a low-mass (log(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=7.9), compact (r_e &lt; 500pc), extreme starburst galaxy at z=5.59 with 13 emission line detections. GN42437 has a low-metallicity (5-10% Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) and its rest-frame Hα equivalent width suggests nearly all of the observed stellar mass formed within the last 3 Myr. GN42437 has an extraordinary 7σ significant [Ne V] 3427 \mathringA detection. The [Ne V] line has a rest-frame equivalent width of 11±2\mathringA, [Ne V]/Hα=0.04±0.007, [Ne V]/[Ne III] 3870\mathringA = 0.26±0.04, and [Ne V]/He II 4687 \mathringA = 1.2±0.5. Ionization from massive stars, shocks, or high-mass X-ray binaries cannot simultaneously produce these [Ne V] and low-ionization line ratios. Reproducing the complete nebular structure requires both massive stars and accretion onto a black hole. We do not detect broad lines nor do the traditional diagnostics indicate that GN42437 has an accreting black hole. Thus, the very-high-ionization emission lines powerfully diagnose faint narrow-line black holes at high-redshift. We approximate the black hole mass in a variety of ways as log(M_BH/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ~ 5-7. This black hole mass is consistent with local relations between the black hole mass and the observed velocity dispersion, but significantly more massive than the stellar mass would predict. Very-high-ionization emission lines may reveal samples to probe the formation and growth of the first black holes in the universe.

The galaxy integrated star-formation rate (SFR) surface density (Σ_SFR) has been proposed as a valuable diagnostic of the mass accumulation in galaxies as being more tightly related to the physics of star-formation (SF) and stellar feedback than other SF indicators. In this paper, we assemble a statistical sample of 230 galaxies observed with JWST in the GLASS and CEERS spectroscopic surveys to estimate Balmer line based dust attenuations and SFRs, and UV rest-frame effective radii. We study the evolution of galaxy SFR and Σ_SFR in the first 1.5 Billion years of our Universe, finding that Σ_SFR is mildly increasing with redshift with a linear slope of 0.16 ± 0.06. We also explore the dependence of SFR and Σ_SFR on stellar mass, showing that a SF 'Main-Sequence' and a Σ_SFR `Main-Sequence' are in place out to z=10, with a similar slope compared to the same relations at lower redshifts. We find that the specific SFR (sSFR) and Σ_SFR are correlated with the [OIII]5007/[OII]3727 ratio and with indirect estimates of the escape fraction of Lyman continuum photons, hence they likely play an important role in the evolution of ionization conditions and in the escape of ionizing radiation. We also search for spectral outflow signatures in a subset of galaxies observed at high resolution, finding an outflow incidence of 2/11 (=20&percnt;^32&percnt;_9&percnt;) at z&lt;6, but no evidence at z&gt;6 (&lt;26&percnt;). Finally, we find a positive correlation between A_V and Σ_SFR, and a flat trend as a function of sSFR, indicating that there is no evidence of a drop of A_V in extremely star-forming galaxies between z=4 and 10. This might be at odds with a dust-clearing outflow scenario, which might instead take place at redshifts z≥ 10, as suggested by some theoretical models.

The resonant scattering interaction between Lyα photons and neutral hydrogen implies that a partially neutral IGM can significantly impact the detectability of Lyα emission in galaxies. The redshift evolution of the Lyα equivalent width distribution of galaxies thus offers a key probe of the degree of ionization during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Previous in-depth investigations at z ≥ 7 were limited by ground-based instrument capabilities. We present an extensive study of Lyα emission from galaxies at 4 &lt; z &lt; 8.5, observed from the CEERS and JADES surveys in the JWST NIRSpec/PRISM configuration. The sample consists of 235 galaxies, among which we identify 65 as Lyα emitters. We first measure Lyα escape fractions from Balmer lines, and explore the correlations with the inferred galaxies' physical properties, which are similar to those found at lower redshift. We also investigate the possible connection between the escape of Lyα photons and the inferred escape fractions of LyC photons obtained from indirect indicators. We then analyze the redshift evolution of the Lyα emitter fraction, finding lower average values at z = 5 and 6 compared to ground-based observations. At z = 7 we find a very large difference in Lyα visibility between the EGS and GOODS-South fields, possibly due to the presence of early reionized regions in the EGS. Such large variance is also expected in the Cosmic Dawn II radiation-hydrodynamical simulation. Our findings suggest a scenario in which the ending phase of the EoR is characterized by ~ 1 pMpc ionized bubbles around a high fraction of moderately bright galaxies. Finally, we characterize such two ionized regions found in the EGS at z = 7.18 and z = 7.49 by estimating the radius of the ionized bubble that each of the spectroscopically-confirmed members could have created.

This paper utilizes the JWST MIRI multi-band imaging data from the SMILES survey (5-25micron), complemented with HST and NIRCam photometric and spectroscopic data from the JADES and FRESCO surveys for 443 star-forming (non-AGN) galaxies at z=0.7-2.0 to extend the study of dust and PAH emission to a new mass and SFR parameter space beyond our local universe. We find a strong correlation between the fraction of dust in PAHs (PAH fraction, q_PAH) with stellar mass. Moreover, the PAH fraction behavior as a function of gas-phase metallicity is similar to that at z~0 from previous studies, suggesting a universal relation: q_PAH is constant (~3.4%) above a metallicity of ~ 0.5Z<sub>&odot;</sub> and decreases to &lt;1% at metallicities &lt;0.3Z<sub>&odot;</sub>. This indicates that metallicity is a good indicator of the ISM properties that affect the balance between the formation and destruction of PAHs. The lack of a redshift evolution from z~0-2 also implies that above 0.5 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>, the PAH emission effectively traces obscured luminosity and the previous locally-calibrated PAH-SFR calibrations remain applicable in this metallicity regime. We observe a strong correlation between obscured UV luminosity fraction (ratio of obscured to total luminosity) and stellar mass. Above the stellar mass of &gt;5× 10^9M<sub>&odot;</sub>, on average, more than half of the emitted luminosity is obscured, while there exists a non-negligible population of lower mass galaxies with &gt;50% obscured fractions. At a fixed mass, the obscured fraction correlates with SFR surface density. This is a result of higher dust covering fractions in galaxies with more compact star forming regions. Similarly, galaxies with high IRX (IR to UV luminosity) at a given mass or UV continuum slope tend to have higher SFR surface density and shallower attenuation curves, owing to their higher effective dust optical depths and more compact star forming regions.

### 171) [2402.03626](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03626v1): Introducing the BRAHMA simulation suite: Signatures of low mass black hole seeding models in cosmological simulations

<p> Aklant K. Bhowmick, Laura Blecha, Paul Torrey, Luke Zoltan Kelley, Rainer Weinberger, Mark Vogelsberger, Lars Hernquist, Rachel S. Somerville, Analis Eolyn Evans </p>
<p>
The first "seeds" of supermassive black holes (BH) can range from ~10^2-10^6~M<sub>&odot;</sub>. However, the lowest mass seeds (≲10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) are inaccessible to most cosmological simulations due to resolution limitations. We present our new BRAHMA suite of cosmological simulations that uses a novel flexible seeding approach to represent low mass seeds. Our suite consists of two types of boxes that model ~10^3~M<sub>&odot;</sub> seeds using two distinct but mutually consistent seeding prescriptions at different simulation resolutions. First, we have the highest resolution [9~Mpc]^3 (BRAHMA-9-D3) boxes that directly resolve ~10^3~M<sub>&odot;</sub> seeds and place them within halos with dense and metal poor gas. Second, we have lower-resolution and larger-volume [18~Mpc]^3 (BRAHMA-18-E4) and ~[36~Mpc]^3 (BRAHMA-36-E5) boxes that seed their smallest resolvable ~10^4~\&~10^5~M<sub>&odot;</sub> BH descendants using new stochastic seeding prescriptions calibrated using the BRAHMA-9-D3 results. The three boxes together probe BHs between ~10^3-10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z&gt;7 and we predict their key observables. The variation in the AGN luminosity functions is small (factors of ~2-3) at the anticipated detection limits of potential future X-ray facilities (~10^43 ergs~s<sup>-1</sup> at z~7). Our simulations predict BHs ~10-100 times heavier than expectations from local M_* vs M_bh relations, consistent with several JWST-detected AGN. For different seed models, our simulations merge BH binaries at ~1-15~kpc, with rates of ~200-2000 per year for ≳10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> BHs, ~6-60 per year for ≳10^4~M<sub>&odot;</sub> BHs, and up to ~10 per year amongst ≳10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> BHs. These results suggest that the LISA mission has promising prospects for constraining seed models.

In anticipation of the Euclid Wide and Deep Surveys, we present optical emission-line predictions at intermediate redshifts from 0.4 to 2.5. Our approach combines a mock light cone from the GAEA semi-analytic model to self-consistently model nebular emission from HII regions, narrow-line regions of active galactic nuclei (AGN), and evolved stellar populations. Our analysis focuses on seven optical emission lines: Hα, Hβ, [SII]λλ6717, 6731, [NII]λ6584, [OI]λ6300, [OIII]λ5007, and [OII]λλ3727, 3729. We find that Euclid will predominantly observe massive, star-forming, and metal-rich line-emitters. Interstellar dust, modelled using a Calzetti law with mass-dependent scaling, may decrease observable percentages by a further 20-30% with respect to our underlying emission-line populations from GAEA. We predict Euclid to observe around 30-70% of Hα-, [NII]-, [SII]-, and [OIII]-emitting galaxies at redshift below 1 and under 10% at higher redshift. Observability of Hβ-, [OII]-, and [OI]- emission is limited to below 5%. For the Euclid-observable sample, we find that BPT diagrams can effectively distinguish between different galaxy types up to around redshift 1.8, attributed to the bias toward metal-rich systems. Moreover, we show that the relationships of Hα and [OIII]+Hβ to the star-formation rate, and the [OIII]-AGN luminosity relation, exhibit minimal changes with increasing redshift. Based on line ratios [NII]/Hα, [NII]/[OII], and [NII]/[SII], we further propose novel z-invariant tracers for the black hole accretion rate-to-star formation rate ratio. Lastly, we find that commonly used metallicity estimators display gradual shifts in normalisations with increasing redshift, while maintaining the overall shape of local calibrations. This is in tentative agreement with recent JWST data.

JWST has recently detected numerous disc galaxies at high-redshifts and there have been observations of cold disc galaxies at z &gt; 4 with ALMA. In the Milky Way, recent studies find metal-poor stars in cold disc orbits, suggesting an ancient disc. We investigated a sample of 565,606 stars from the hybrid-CNN analysis of the Gaia-DR3 RVS stars. The sample contains 8,500 stars with [Fe/H]&lt;-1. For a subset of ~200,000 MSTO and subgiant stars we computed distances and ages using the StarHorse code with a mean precision of 1% and 12%, respectively. First, we confirm the existence of metal-poor stars in thin disc orbits - over 50% are older than 13 Gyr. Second, we report the discovery of the oldest thin disc of the Milky Way(MW), which extends across a wide range of metallicities, from metal-poor to super-solar stars. The metal-poor stars in disc orbits manifest as a readily visible tail of the metallicity distribution. The high-[α/Fe] thick disc exhibits a vertical velocity dispersion of 35 km/s, while the thin disc shows 10 to 15 km/s lower at similar ages. Our old thin disc σ_V_z appears similar to those estimated for the high-z disc galaxies. Third, we extend the [Y/Mg] chemical clock to the oldest ages and estimate a slope of -0.038 dex/Gyr. Finally, we confirm our discovery by showing that the splash includes high- and low-[α/Fe] populations that are both old and extends to super-solar [Fe/H]. We find about 6 to 10% of the old thin disc was heated to thick disc orbits with the youngest splashed stars being 9 to 10 Gyrs. We conclude the MW thin disc forms &lt;1 billion years from Big Bang, building up inside-out, preceding earlier estimates by about 4-5 billion years. Considering a massive merger event such as the GSE, a Splash is expected - we find a portion of the old thin disc is heated to thick disc velocities and the Splash extends to super-solar [Fe/H] regimes.

Extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) exhibit large equivalent widths (EW) in their rest-optical emission lines ([OIII]&lambda;5007 or Hα rest-frame EW &gt; 750Å) which can be tied to a recent upturn in star formation rate, due to the sensitivity of the nebular line emission and the rest-optical continuum to young (&lt;10Myr) and evolved stellar populations, respectively. By studying a sample of 85 star forming galaxies (SFGs), spanning the redshift and magnitude interval 3 &lt;z&lt;9.5 and -16&gt; M_UV&gt;-21, in the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) with NIRSpec/prism spectroscopy, we determine that SFGs initiate an EELG phase when entering a significant burst of star formation, with the highest EWs observed in EELGs with the youngest luminosity-weighted ages (&lt;5 Myr old) and the highest burst intensity (those with the greatest excess between their current and long-term average SFR). We spectroscopically confirm that a greater proportion of SFGs are in an EELG phase at high redshift in our UV-selected sample (61±4&percnt; in our z&gt;5.7 high-redshift bin, compared to 23^+4_-1&percnt; in our lowest-redshift bin 3&lt;z&lt;4.1) due to the combined evolution of metallicity, ionisation parameter and star formation histories with redshift. We report that the EELGs within our sample exhibit a higher average ionisation efficiency (log_10(ξ<sub>ion</sub>^HII/erg^-1Hz)=25.5±0.2) than the non-EELGs. High-redshift EELGs therefore comprise a population of efficient ionising photon producers. Additionally, we report that 53&percnt; (9/17) of EELGs at z&gt;5.7 have observed Lyman-α emission, potentially lying within large ionised regions. The high detection rate of Lyman-α emitters in our EELG selection suggests that the physical conditions associated with entering an EELG phase also promote the escape of Lyman-α photons.

The XLF of AGN offers a robust tool to study the evolution and the growth of SMBHs over cosmic time. Owing to the limited area probed by X-ray surveys, optical surveys are routinely used to probe the accretion in the high redshift Universe z≥ 3. However, optical surveys may be incomplete because they are strongly affected by dust redenning. In this work, we derive the XLF and its evolution at high redshifts using a large sample of AGNs selected in different fields with various areas and depths covering a wide range of luminosities. Additionally, we put the tightest yet constraints on the absorption function in this redshift regime. In particular, we use more than 600 soft X-ray selected high-z sources in the Chandra Deep fields, the Chandra COSMOS Legacy survey and the XMM-XXL northern field. We derive the X-ray spectral properties for all sources via spectral fitting, using a consistent technique and model. For modeling the parametric form of the XLF and the absorption function, we use a Bayesian methodology allowing us to correctly propagate the uncertainties for the observed X-ray properties of our sources and also the absorption effects. The evolution of XLF is in agreement with a pure density evolution model similar to what is witnessed at optical wavelengths, although a luminosity dependent density evolution model cannot be securely ruled out. A large fraction (60&percnt;) of our sources are absorbed by column densities of N_H ≥ 10^23 cm<sup>2</sup> , while 17&percnt; of the sources are CTK. Our results favor a scenario where both the ISM of the host and the AGN torus contribute to the obscuration. The derived BHAD is in agreement with the simulations, if one takes into account that the X-ray AGN are hosted by massive galaxies, while it differs from the one derived using JWST data. The latter could be due to the differences in the AGN and host-galaxy properties.

Ultraviolet (UV; rest-frame ~1200-2000 A) spectra provide a wealth of diagnostics to characterize fundamental galaxy properties, such as their chemical enrichment, the nature of their stellar populations, and their amount of Lyman-continuum (LyC) radiation. In this work, we leverage publicly released JWST data to construct the rest-frame UV-to-optical composite spectrum of a sample of 63 galaxies at 5.6&lt;z&lt;9, spanning the wavelength range from 1500 to 5200 A. Based on the composite spectrum, we derive an average dust attenuation E(B-V)_gas=0.16^+0.10_-0.11 from \hb/\hg, electron density n_e = 570^+510_-290 cm^-3 from the [O II] doublet ratio, electron temperature T_e = 17000^+1500_-1500 K from the [O III] &lambda;4363/ [O III] &lambda;5007 ratio, and an ionization parameter log(U)=-2.18^+0.03_-0.03 from the [O III]/[O II] ratio. Using a direct T_e method, we calculate an oxygen abundance 12+log(O/H)=7.67±0.08 and the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) abundance ratio log(C/O)=-0.87^+0.13_-0.10. This C/O ratio is smaller than compared to z=0 and z=2 - 4 star-forming galaxies, albeit with moderate significance. This indicates the reionization-era galaxies might be undergoing a rapid build-up of stellar mass with high specific star-formation rates. A UV diagnostic based on the ratios of C III] λ&lambda;1907,1909/He II &lambda;1640 versus O III] &lambda;1666/He II &lambda;1640 suggests that the star formation is the dominant source of ionization, similar to the local extreme dwarf galaxies and z~2 - 4 He II-detected galaxies. The [O III]/[O II] and C IV/C III] ratios of the composite spectrum are marginally larger than the criteria used to select galaxies as LyC leakers, suggesting that some of the galaxies in our sample are strong contributors to the reionizing radiation.

Space-based mid-IR spectroscopy provides tracers of warm gas in star-forming regions that are inaccessible from the ground. Past mid-IR spectra of bright high-mass protostars in the hot-core phase typically showed strong absorption features from molecules such as CO<sub>2</sub>, C_2H<sub>2</sub>, and HCN. However, little is known about their fainter counterparts at earlier stages. We thus aim to characterize the gas-phase molecular features in JWST MIRI/MRS observations of the young high-mass star-forming region IRAS 23385+6053. Spectra were extracted from two mid-IR sources and three H<sub>2</sub> bright outflow knots in the MIRI/MRS field of view. Rich molecular spectra with emission from CO, H<sub>2</sub>, HD, H<sub>2</sub>O, C_2H<sub>2</sub>, HCN, CO<sub>2</sub>, and OH are detected towards the two mid-IR sources. However, only CO and OH are seen towards the brightest H<sub>2</sub> knots, suggesting that the majority of the observed species are associated with disks or hot core regions rather than outflows. Simple Local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) slab models were used to fit the observed molecular features. The LTE model fits to ^12CO<sub>2</sub>, C_2H<sub>2</sub>, and HCN emission suggest warm 120-200 K emission arising from a disk surface around one or both protostars. Weak ~500 K H<sub>2</sub>O emission at ~ 6-7 μm is detected towards one mid-IR source, whereas 250-1050 K H<sub>2</sub>O absorption is found in the other. The H<sub>2</sub>O absorption may occur in the disk atmosphere due to strong accretion-heating of the midplane, or in a disk wind viewed at an ideal angle for absorption. CO emission may originate in the hot inner disk or outflow shocks. OH emission is likely excited in a non-LTE manner through water photodissociation or chemical formation. The observations are consistent with disks having already formed in the young IRAS 23385+6053 system, but further observations are needed to disentangle the effects of geometry and evolution.

We present the latest version of the GAEA model of galaxy formation. Our new model combines (i) an updated treatment of AGN feedback including an improved modelling of cold gas accretion on super-massive BHs and an explicit implementation of quasar winds; and (ii) an improved modelling of cold and hot gas stripping from satellite galaxies. We show that our latest model predicts specific SFR distributions that are in remarkable agreement with observational measurements in the local Universe. Our updated model predicts quenched fractions that are in very nice agreement with data up to z~3-4, and a turn-over of the number densities of quenched galaxies at low stellar masses that is in qualitative agreement with current observational estimates. We show that the main reasons for the improved behaviour with respect to previous renditions of our model are the updated treatment for satellites at low galaxy masses (&lt;10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) and the inclusion of quasar winds at intermediate to large stellar masses (&gt;10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>). However, we show that the better treatment of the star formation threshold, due to our explicit partitioning of the cold gas in its atomic and molecular components, also plays an important role in suppressing excessive residual star formation in massive galaxies. While our analysis is based on a selection of quiescent galaxies that takes advantage of the information about their SFR, we demonstrate that the impact of a different (colour-colour) selection is not significant, at least for galaxies above the completeness limits of current surveys. Our new model predicts number densities of massive quiescent galaxies at z&gt;3 that are the largest among recently published models. Yet, our model predictions appear still to be below post-JWST observational measurements. We show that the expected cosmic variance is large, and can easily accommodate some of the most recent measurements.

We present the robust selection of quiescent (QG) and post-starburst (PSB) galaxies using ultra-deep NIRCam and MIRI imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). Key to this is MIRI 7.7μm imaging which breaks the degeneracy between old stellar populations and dust attenuation at 3&lt;z&lt;6 by providing rest-frame J-band. Using this, we identify 23 passively evolving galaxies in UVJ color space in a mass-limited (log M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>≥8.5) sample over 8.8 arcmin<sup>2</sup>. Evaluation of this selection with and without 7.7 μm shows that dense wavelength coverage with NIRCam (8-11 bands including 1-4 medium-bands) can compensate for lacking the J-band anchor, meaning that robust selection of high-redshift QGs is possible with NIRCam alone. Our sample is characterized by rapid quenching timescales (~100-600 Myr) with formation redshifts z_f≲8.5 and includes a potential record-holding massive QG at z<sub>phot</sub>=5.33_-0.17^+0.16 and two QGs with evidence for significant residual dust content (A_V~1-2). In addition, we present a large sample of 12 log M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>=8.5-9.5 PSBs, demonstrating that UVJ selection can be extended to low mass. Analysis of the environment of our sample reveals that the group known as the Cosmic Rose contains a massive QG and a dust-obscured star-forming galaxy (a so-called Jekyll and Hyde pair) plus three additional QGs within ~20 kpc. Moreover, the Cosmic Rose is part of a larger overdensity at z~3.7 which contains 7/12 of our low-mass PSBs. Another 4 low-mass PSBs are members of an overdensity at z~3.4; this result strongly indicates low-mass PSBs are preferentially associated with overdense environments at z&gt;3.

We present the star-formation-rate &ndash; stellar-mass (SFR-M<sub>&ast;</sub>) relation for galaxies in the CEERS survey at 4.5≤ z≤ 12. We model the \jwst and \hst rest-UV and rest-optical photometry of galaxies with flexible star-formation histories (SFHs) using \bagpipes. We consider SFRs averaged from the SFHs over 10~Myr (\sfrten) and 100~Myr (\sfrcen), where the photometry probes SFRs on these timescales, effectively tracing nebular emission lines in the rest-optical (on ~10~Myr timescales) and the UV/optical continuum (on ~100 Myr timescales). We measure the slope, normalization and intrinsic scatter of the SFR-M<sub>&ast;</sub> relation, taking into account the uncertainty and the covariance of galaxy SFRs and M<sub>&ast;</sub>. From z~ 5-9 there is larger scatter in the \sfrten-M<sub>&ast;</sub> relation, with σ(log \sfrcen)=0.4~dex, compared to the \sfrcen-M<sub>&ast;</sub> relation, with σ(log \sfrten)=0.1~dex. This scatter increases with redshift and increasing stellar mass, at least out to z~ 7. These results can be explained if galaxies at higher redshift experience an increase in star-formation variability and form primarily in short, active periods, followed by a lull in star formation (i.e. "napping'' phases). We see a significant trend in the ratio R_SFR=log(\sfrten/\sfrcen) in which, on average, R_SFR decreases with increasing stellar mass and increasing redshift. This yields a star-formation "duty cycle'' of ~40&percnt; for galaxies with log M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>≥ 9.3, at z~5, declining to ~20&percnt; at z~9. Galaxies also experience longer lulls in star formation at higher redshift and at higher stellar mass, such that galaxies transition from periods of higher SFR variability at z≳~6 to smoother SFR evolution at z≲~4.5.

Complex organic molecules (COMs) detected in the gas phase are thought to be mostly formed on icy grains, but no unambiguous detection of icy COMs larger than CH3OH has been reported so far. Exploring this matter in more detail has become possible with the JWST the critical 5-10 μm range. In the JOYS+ program, more than 30 protostars are being observed with the MIRI/MRS. This study explores the COMs ice signatures in the low and high-mass protostar, IRAS 2A and IRAS 23385, respectively. We fit continuum and silicate subtracted observational data with IR laboratory ice spectra. We use the ENIIGMA fitting tool to find the best fit between the lab data and the observations and to performs statistical analysis of the solutions. We report the best fits for the spectral ranges between 6.8 and 8.6 μm in IRAS 2A and IRAS 23385, originating from simple molecules, COMs, and negative ions. The strongest feature in this range (7.7 μm) is dominated by CH4 and has contributions of SO2 and OCN-. Our results indicate that the 7.2 and 7.4 μm bands are mostly dominated by HCOO-. We find statistically robust detections of COMs based on multiple bands, most notably CH3CHO, CH3CH2OH, and CH3OCHO. The likely detection of CH3COOH is also reported. The ice column density ratios between CH3CH2OH and CH3CHO of IRAS 2A and IRAS 23385, suggests that these COMs are formed on icy grains. Finally, the derived ice abundances for IRAS 2A correlate well with those in comet 67P/GC within a factor of 5. Based on the MIRI/MRS data, we conclude that COMs are present in interstellar ices, thus providing additional proof for a solid-state origin of these species in star-forming regions. The good correlation between the ice abundances in comet 67P and IRAS 2A is in line with the idea that cometary COMs can be inherited from the early protostellar phases.

### 182) [2312.06804](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06804v3): Lyα Emission at z=7-13: Clear Lyα Equivalent Width Evolution Indicating the Late Cosmic Reionization History

<p> Minami Nakane, Masami Ouchi, Kimihiko Nakajima, Yuichi Harikane, Yoshiaki Ono, Hiroya Umeda, Yuki Isobe, Yechi Zhang, Yi Xu </p>
<p>
We present the evolution of Lyα emission derived from 53 galaxies at z=6.6-13.2 that are identified by multiple JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy programs of ERS, GO, DDT, and GTO. These galaxies fall on the star-formation main sequence and are the typical star-forming galaxies with UV magnitudes of -22.5≤ M_UV≤-17.0. We find that 15 out of 53 galaxies show Lyα emission at the &gt;3σ levels, and obtain Lyα equivalent width (EW) measurements and stringent 3σ upper limits for the 15 and 38 galaxies, respectively. Confirming that Lyα velocity offsets and line widths of our galaxies are comparable with those of low-redshift Lyα emitters, we investigate the redshift evolution of the Lyα EW. We find that Lyα EWs statistically decrease towards high redshifts on the Lyα EW vs. M_UV plane for various probability distributions of the uncertainties. We then evaluate neutral hydrogen fractions x_HI with the Lyα EW redshift evolution and the cosmic reionization simulation results on the basis of a Bayesian inference framework, and obtain x_HI&lt;0.79, =0.62^+0.15_-0.36, and 0.93^+0.04_-0.07 at z~7, 8, and 9-13, respectively. These moderately large x_HI values are consistent with the Planck CMB optical depth measurement and previous x_HI constraints from galaxy and QSO Lyα damping wing absorptions, and strongly indicate a late reionization history. Such a late reionization history suggests that major sources of reionization would emerge late and be hosted by moderately massive halos in contrast with the widely-accepted picture of abundant low-mass objects for the sources of reionization.

<p>
We present an analysis of ALMA multi-band dust-continuum observations for 28 spectroscopically-confirmed bright Lyman-break galaxies at 5&lt;z&lt;8. Our sample consists of 11 galaxies at z~6 newly observed in our ALMA program, which substantially increases the number of 5&lt;z&lt;8 galaxies with both rest-frame 88 and 158 μm continuum observations, allowing us to simultaneously measure the IR luminosity and dust temperature for a statistical sample of z≳5 galaxies for the first time. We derive the relationship between the UV slope (β_UV) and infrared excess (IRX) for the z~6 galaxies, and find a shallower IRX-β_UV relation compared to the previous results at z~2&ndash;4. Based on the IRX-β_UV relation consistent with our results and the β_UV-M_UV relation including fainter galaxies in the literature, we find a limited contribution of the dust-obscured star formation to the total SFR density, ~30&percnt; at z~6. Our measurements of the dust temperature at z~6-7, T_dust=40.9_-9.1^+10.0 K on average, supports a gentle increase of T_dust from z=0 to z~6&ndash;7. Using an analytic model with parameters consistent with recent \itJWST results, we discuss that the observed redshift evolution of the dust temperature can be reproduced by an ~0.6 dex increase in the gas depletion timescale and ~0.4 dex decrease of the metallicity. The variety of T_dust observed at high redshifts can also be naturally explained by scatters around the star-formation main sequence and average mass-metallicity relation, including an extremely high dust temperature of T_dust&gt;80 K observed in a galaxy at z=8.3.

<p> Zuyi Chen, Daniel P. Stark, Charlotte Mason, Michael W. Topping, Lily Whitler, Mengtao Tang, Ryan Endsley, Stéphane Charlot </p>
<p>
We describe  JWST/NIRSpec prism measurements of Lyα emission in z≳ 5 galaxies. We identify Lyα detections in 10 out of 69 galaxies with robust rest-optical emission line redshift measurements at 5≤ z&lt;7 in the CEERS and DDT-2750 observations of the EGS field. Galaxies at z≃ 6 with faint continuum (F150W = 27&ndash;29 mag) are found with extremely large rest-frame Lyα equivalent widths (ranging up to 286 A). Likely Lyα detections are also seen in two new z&gt;7 galaxies (z= 7.49 and 7.17) from the second epoch of CEERS observations, both showing large Lyα equivalent widths that likely indicate significant transmission through the IGM. We measure high Lyα escape fractions in the 12 Lyα emitters in our sample (median 0.28), two of which show f<sub>esc</sub>^ Lyα near unity (&gt;0.80). We find that 50_-11^+11% of z≃ 6 galaxies with [OIII]+Hβ EW &gt; 1000 A have f<sub>esc</sub>^ Lyα &gt;0.2, consistent with the fractions found in lower-redshift samples with matched [OIII]+Hβ EWs. While uncertainties are still significant, we find that only 10_-5^+9% of z&gt;7 galaxies with similarly strong rest optical emission lines show such large f<sub>esc</sub>^ Lyα, as may be expected if IGM attenuation of Lyα increases towards higher redshifts. We identify photometric galaxy overdensities near the z≳ 7 Lyα emitters, potentially providing the ionizing flux necessary to create large ionized sightlines that facilitate Lyα transmission. Finally, we investigate the absence of Lyα emission in a comparable (and spectroscopically confirmed) galaxy overdensity at z=7.88 in the Abell 2744 field, discussing new prism spectra of the field obtained with the UNCOVER program.

<p>
We present measurements of the rest-frame UV spectral slope, β, for a sample of 36 faint star-forming galaxies at z ~ 9-16 discovered in one of the deepest JWST NIRCam surveys to date, the Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public (NGDEEP) Survey. We use robust photometric measurements for UV-faint galaxies (down to M_UV ~ -16), originally published in Leung+23, and measure values of the UV spectral slope via photometric power-law fitting to both the observed photometry and to stellar population models obtained through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with Bagpipes. We obtain a median and 68% confidence interval for β from photometric power-law fitting of β_PL = -2.7^+0.5_-0.5 and from SED-fitting, β_SED = -2.3^+0.2_-0.1 for the full sample. We show that when only 2-3 photometric detections are available, SED-fitting has a lower scatter and reduced biases than photometric power-law fitting. We quantify this bias and find that after correction, the median β_SED,corr = -2.5^+0.2_-0.2. We measure physical properties for our galaxies with Bagpipes and find that our faint (M_UV = -18.1^+0.7_-0.9) sample is low mass (log[M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>] = 7.7^+0.5_-0.5), fairly dust-poor (A_v = 0.1^+0.2_-0.1 mag), and modestly young (log[age] = 7.8^+0.2_-0.8 yr) with a median star formation rate of log(SFR) = -0.3^+0.4_-0.4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr. We find no strong evidence for ultra-blue UV spectral slopes (β ~ -3) within our sample, as would be expected for exotically metal-poor (Z/Z<sub>&odot;</sub> &lt; 10^-3) stellar populations with very high LyC escape fractions. Our observations are consistent with model predictions that galaxies of these stellar masses at z~9-16 should have only modestly low metallicities (Z/Z<sub>&odot;</sub> ~ 0.1&ndash;0.2).

### 186) [2310.20404](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.20404v1): Galactic `Snake' IRDC G11.11-0.12: a site of multiple hub-filament systems and colliding filamentary clouds

<p> L. K. Dewangan, N. K. Bhadari, A. K. Maity, C. Eswaraiah, Saurabh Sharma, O. R. Jadhav </p>
<p>
To probe star formation processes, we present a multi-scale and multi-wavelength investigation of the `Snake' nebula/infrared dark cloud G11.11-0.12 (hereafter, G11; length ~27 pc). Spitzer images hint at the presence of sub-filaments (in absorption), and reveal four infrared-dark hub-filament system (HFS) candidates (extent &lt; 6 pc) toward G11, where massive clumps (&gt; 500 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) and protostars are identified. The ^13CO(2-1), C^18O(2-1), and NH_3(1,1) line data reveal a noticeable velocity oscillation toward G11, as well as its left part (or part-A) around V_lsr of 31.5 km s<sup>-1</sup>, and its right part (or part-B) around V_lsr of 29.5 km s<sup>-1</sup>. The common zone of these cloud components is investigated toward the center's G11 housing one HFS. Each cloud component hosts two sub-filaments. In comparison to part-A, more ATLASGAL clumps are observed toward part-B. The JWST near-infrared images discover one infrared-dark HFS candidate (extent ~0.55 pc) around the massive protostar G11P1 (i.e., G11P1-HFS). Hence, the infrared observations reveal multiple infrared-dark HFS candidates at multi-scale in G11. The ALMA 1.16 mm continuum map shows multiple finger-like features (extent ~3500-10000 AU) surrounding a dusty envelope-like feature (extent ~18000 AU) toward the central hub of G11P1-HFS. Signatures of forming massive stars are found toward the center of the envelope-like feature. The ALMA H^13CO^+ line data show two cloud components with a velocity separation of ~2 km s<sup>-1</sup> toward G11P1. Overall, the collision process, the "fray and fragment'' mechanism, and the "global non-isotropic collapse'' scenario seem to be operational in G11.

### 187) [2310.08829](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08829v1): Disappearing galaxies: the orientation dependence of JWST-bright, HST-dark, star-forming galaxy selection

<p> R. K. Cochrane, D. Anglés-Alcázar, F. Cullen, C. C. Hayward </p>
<p>
Galaxies that are invisible in deep optical-NIR imaging but detected at longer wavelengths have been the focus of several recent observational studies, with speculation that they could constitute a substantial missing population and even dominate the cosmic star formation rate density at z≳4. The depths now achievable with JWST at the longest wavelengths probed by HST, coupled with the transformative resolution at longer wavelengths, are already enabling detailed, spatially-resolved characterisation of sources that were invisible to HST, often known as `HST-dark' galaxies. However, until now, there has been little theoretical work to compare against. We present the first simulation-based study of this population, using highly-resolved galaxies from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project, with multi-wavelength images along several lines of sight forward-modelled using radiative transfer. We naturally recover a population of modelled sources that meet commonly-used selection criteria (H_AB&gt;27 mag and H_AB-F444W&gt;2.3). These simulated HST-dark galaxies lie at high redshifts (z=4-7), have high levels of dust attenuation (A_V=2-4), and display compact recent star formation (R_1/2, 4.4 μm≲1 kpc). Orientation is very important: for all but one of the 17 simulated galaxy snapshots with HST-dark sightlines, there exist other sightlines that do not meet the criteria. This result has important implications for comparisons between observations and models that do not resolve the detailed star-dust geometry, such as semi-analytic models or coarsely-resolved hydrodynamical simulations. Critically, we demonstrate that HST-dark sources are not an unexpected or exotic population, but a subset of high-redshift, highly-dust-attenuated sources viewed along certain lines of sight.

<p>
A first look is taken at the NIRSpec 1-5 μm observations from JWST program 1591 that targets 7 objects along the low-mass stellar life cycle with PAH emission. Spectra extracted from a 1.5^&Prime; radius sized circular aperture are explored, showing a wealth of features, including the 3 μm PAH complex, the PAH-continuum, and atomic and molecular emission lines from HI, He, H<sub>2</sub>, and other species. CO<sub>2</sub>- and H<sub>2</sub>O-ice absorption and CO emission is also seen. Focusing on the bright-PDR position in M17, the PAH CH stretch falls at 3.29 μm (FWHM=0.04 μm). Signs of its 1.68 μm overtone are confused by line emission in all targets. Multi-component decomposition reveals a possible aliphatic deuterated PAH feature centered at 4.65 μm (FWHM=0.02 μm), giving [D/H]_alip.=31±12.7%. However, there is little sign of its aromatic counterpart between 4.36-4.43 μm. There is also little sign of PAH-nitrile emission between 4.34-4.39 μm. A PAH continuum rises from ~1 to 3.2 μm, after which it jumps by about a factor of 2.5 at 3.6 μm, with bumps at 3.8, 4.04, and 4.34 μm adding structure. The CO<sub>2</sub> absorption band in M17 is matched with 10:1 H<sub>2</sub>O:CO<sub>2</sub> ice at 10 K. The v=0 pure rotational molecular hydrogen population diagram reveals &gt;2200 K UV-pumped gas. The hydrogen Pfund series runs from levels 10 to &gt;30. Considering Brα/Brβ=0.381±0.01966 and Case B recombination results in A_V ≃8. CO emission in IRAS21282+5050 originates from 258 K gas. In-depth spectral-spatial analysis of all features and targets are planned for a series of forthcoming papers.

<p>
Aims. We provide an in-depth analysis of the COSMOS-Web ring, an Einstein ring at z=2 that we serendipitously discovered in the COSMOS-Web survey and possibly the most distant lens discovered to date. Methods. We extract the visible and NIR photometry from more than 25 bands and we derive the photometric redshifts and physical properties of both the lens and the source with three different SED fitting codes. Using JWST/NIRCam images, we also produce two lens models to (i) recover the total mass of the lens, (ii) derive the magnification of the system, (iii) reconstruct the morphology of the lensed source, and (iv) measure the slope of the total mass density profile of the lens. Results. The lens is a very massive and quiescent (sSFR &lt; 10^(-13) yr-1) elliptical galaxy at z = 2.02 ± 0.02 with a total mass Mtot(&lt;thetaE) = (3.66 ± 0.36) x 10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and a stellar mass M<sub>&sext;</sub> = (1.37 ± 0.14) x 10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Compared to SHMRs from the literature, we find that the total mass is consistent with the presence of a DM halo of mass Mh = 1.09^(+1.46)_(-0.57) x 10^13 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. In addition, the background source is a M<sub>&sext;</sub> = (1.26 ± 0.17) x 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> star-forming galaxy (SFR=(78 ± 15) M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr) at z = 5.48 ± 0.06. Its reconstructed morphology shows two components with different colors. Dust attenuation values from SED fitting and nearby detections in the FIR also suggest it could be partially dust-obscured. Conclusions. We find the lens at z=2. Its total, stellar, and DM halo masses are consistent within the Einstein ring, so we do not need any unexpected changes in our description of the lens (e.g. change its IMF or include a non-negligible gas contribution). The most likely solution for the lensed source is at z = 5.5. Its reconstructed morphology is complex and highly wavelength dependent, possibly because it is a merger or a main sequence galaxy with a heterogeneous dust distribution.

### 190) [2309.13228](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.13228v2): A physically motivated framework to compare pair fractions of isolated low and high mass galaxies across cosmic time

Low mass galaxy pair fractions are understudied, and it is unclear whether low mass pair fractions evolve in the same way as more massive systems over cosmic time. In the era of JWST, Roman, and Rubin, selecting galaxy pairs in a self-consistent way will be critical to connect observed pair fractions to cosmological merger rates across all mass scales and redshifts. Utilizing the Illustris TNG100 simulation, we create a sample of physically associated low mass (10^8&lt;M_*&lt;5×10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) and high mass (5×10^9&lt;M_*&lt;10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) pairs between z=0 and 4.2. The low mass pair fraction increases from z=0 to 2.5, while the high mass pair fraction peaks at z=0 and is constant or slightly decreasing at z&gt;1. At z=0, the low mass major (1:4 mass ratio) pair fraction is 4× lower than high mass pairs, consistent with findings for cosmological merger rates. We show that separation limits that vary with the mass and redshift of the system, such as scaling by the virial radius of the host halo (r_sep&lt; 1 R_vir), are critical for recovering pair fraction differences between low mass and high mass systems. Alternatively, static physical separation limits applied equivalently to all galaxy pairs do not recover the differences between low and high mass pair fractions, even up to separations of 300 kpc. Finally, we place isolated mass-analogs of Local Group galaxy pairs, i.e., Milky Way (MW)&ndash;M31, MW&ndash;LMC, LMC&ndash;SMC, in a cosmological context, showing that isolated analogs of LMC&ndash;SMC-mass pairs and low-separation (&lt;50 kpc) MW&ndash;LMC-mass pairs are 2-3× more common at z≳2-3.

### 191) [2309.06486](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06486v2): The CO-to-H2 conversion factor of molecular outflows. Rovibrational CO emission in NGC 3256-S resolved by JWST/NIRSpec

<p> M. Pereira-Santaella, E. González-Alfonso, I. García-Bernete, S. García-Burillo, D. Rigopoulou </p>
<p>
We analyze JWST/NIRSpec observations of the CO rovibrational v=1-0 band at 4.67um around the dust-embedded southern active galactic nucleus (AGN) of NGC3256 (d=40Mpc; L(IR)=10^11.6 Lsun). We classify the CO v=1-0 spectra into three categories based on the behavior of P- and R-branches of the band: (a) both branches in absorption toward the nucleus; (b) P-R asymmetry (P-branch in emission and R-branch in absorption) along the disk of the galaxy; and (c) both branches in emission in the outflow region above and below the disk. In this paper, we focus on the outflow. The CO v=1-0 emission can be explained by the vibrational excitation of CO in the molecular outflow by the bright mid-IR ~4.7um continuum from the AGN up to r~250pc. We model the ratios between the P(J+2) and R(J) transitions of the band to derive the physical properties (column density, kinetic temperature, and CO-to-H2 conversion factor, alpha_CO) of the outflowing gas. We find that the 12CO v=1-0 emission is optically thick for J&lt;4, while the 13CO v=1-0 emission remains optically thin. From the P(2)/R(0) ratio, we identify a temperature gradient in the outflow from &gt;40K in the central 100pc to &lt;15K at 250pc sampling the cooling of the molecular gas in the outflow. We used three methods to derive alpha_CO in eight 100pc (0.5") apertures in the outflow by fitting the P(J+2)/R(J) ratios with non-LTE models. We obtain low median alpha_CO factors (0.40-0.61) x 3.2e-4/[CO/H2] M<sub>&odot;</sub> (K km/s/pc2)^-1 in the outflow regions. This implies that outflow rates and energetics might be overestimated if a ULIRG-like alpha_CO, which is 1.3-2 times larger, is assumed. The reduced alpha_CO can be explained if the outflowing molecular clouds are not virialized. We also report the first extragalactic detection of a broad (sigma=0.0091um) spectral feature at 4.645um associated with aliphatic deuterium on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (D_n-PAH).

### 192) [2309.06470](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06470v2): Metal enrichment and evolution in four z &gt; 6.5 quasar sightlines observed with JWST/NIRSpec

<p> L. Christensen, P. Jakobsen, C. Willott, S. Arribas, A. Bunker, S. Charlot, R. Maiolino, M. Marshall, M. Perna, H. Übler </p>
<p>
We present JWST/NIRSpec R~2700 spectra of four high-redshift quasars: VDES J0020-3653 (z = 6.860), DELS J0411-0907 (z = 6.825), UHS J0439+1634 (z = 6.519) and ULAS J1342+0928 (z = 7.535). The exquisite data quality, signal-to-noise ratio of 50-200, and large 0.86\!~μm≤ λ≤ 5.5\!~μm spectral coverage allows us to identify between 13 and 17 intervening and proximate metal absorption line systems in each quasar spectrum, with a total number of 61 absorption-line systems detected at 2.42&lt;z&lt;7.48 including the highest redshift intervening OI 1302 and MgII systems at z=7.37 and z=7.44. We investigate the evolution of the metal enrichment in the epoch of reionization at z&gt;6 and find: i) A continued increase of the low-ionization OI, CII, and SiII incidence, ii) Decreasing high-ionization CIV and SiIV incidence with a transition from predominantly high- to low-ionization at z≈6.0, and iii) a constant MgII incidence across all redshifts. The observations support a change in the ionization state of the intergalactic medium in the EoR rather than a change in metallicity. The abundance ratio of [Si/O] in five z&gt;6 absorption systems show enrichment signatures produced by low-mass Pop III pair instability supernovae, and possibly Pop III hypernovae. In the Gunn-Peterson troughs we detect transmission spikes where Lyα photons can escape. From 22 absorption systems at z&gt;5.7, only a single low-ionization system out of 13 lies within 2000 km/s from a spike, while four high-ionization systems out of nine lie within ~2000 km/s from a spike. This confirms that galaxies responsible for the heavy elements that are transported into the circumgalactic medium lie in predominantly in high-density, neutral environments, while lower density environments are ionized without being polluted by metals at z≈ 6-7.

<p>
We present MIRI/JWST medium-resolution spectroscopy (MRS) and imaging (MIRIM) of the lensed galaxy MACS1149-JD1 at a redshift of z=9.1092±0.0002 (Universe age about 530 Myr). We detect, for the first time, spatially resolved Hα emission in a galaxy at a redshift above nine. The structure of the Hα emitting gas consists of two clumps, S and N. The total Hα luminosity implies an instantaneous star-formation of 5.3±0.4 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1 for solar metallicities. The ionizing photon production efficiency, log(ζ<sub>ion</sub>), shows a spatially resolved structure with values of 25.55±0.03, 25.47±0.03, and 25.91±0.09 Hz erg^-1 for the integrated galaxy, and clumps S and N, respectively. The Hα rest-frame equivalent width, EW_0(Hα), is 726^+660_-182 Ángstrom for the integrated galaxy, but presents extreme values of 531^+300_-96 Ángstrom and ≥1951 Ángstrom for clumps S and N, respectively. The spatially resolved ionizing photon production efficiency is within the range of values measured in galaxies at redshift above six, and well above the canonical value (25.2±0.1 Hz erg^-1). The extreme difference of EW_0(Hα) for Clumps S and N indicates the presence of a recent (&lt;5 Myrs) burst in clump N and a star formation over a larger period of time (e.g., ~50 Myr) in clump S. Finally, clump S and N show very different Hα kinematics with velocity dispersions of 56±4 km s<sup>-1</sup> and 113±33 km s<sup>-1</sup>, likely indicating the presence of outflows or increased turbulence in the clump N. The dynamical mass, M_dyn= (2.4±0.5)×10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, is within the range measured with the spatially resolved [OIII]88μm line.

<p>
JWST is revealing a new population of dust-reddened broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) at redshifts z≳5. Here we present deep NIRSpec/Prism spectroscopy from the Cycle 1 Treasury program UNCOVER of 15 AGN candidates selected to be compact, with red continua in the rest-frame optical but with blue slopes in the UV. From NIRCam photometry alone, they could have been dominated by dusty star formation or AGN. Here we show that the majority of the compact red sources in UNCOVER are dust-reddened AGN: 60&percnt; show definitive evidence for broad-line Hα with FWHM  &gt;2000 km/s, for 20&percnt; current data are inconclusive, and 20&percnt; are brown dwarf stars. We propose an updated photometric criterion to select red z&gt;5 AGN that excludes brown dwarfs and is expected to yield &gt;80&percnt; AGN. Remarkably, among all z<sub>phot</sub>&gt;5 galaxies with F277W-F444W&gt;1 in UNCOVER at least 33&percnt; are AGN regardless of compactness, climbing to at least 80&percnt; AGN for sources with F277W-F444W&gt;1.6. The confirmed AGN have black hole masses of 10^7-10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. While their UV-luminosities (-16&gt;M_UV&gt;-20 AB mag) are low compared to UV-selected AGN at these epochs, consistent with percent-level scattered AGN light or low levels of unobscured star formation, the inferred bolometric luminosities are typical of 10^7-10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> black holes radiating at ~ 10-40&percnt; of Eddington. The number densities are surprisingly high at ~10^-5 Mpc^-3 mag^-1, 100 times more common than the faintest UV-selected quasars, while accounting for ~1&percnt; of the UV-selected galaxies. While their UV-faintness suggest they may not contribute strongly to reionization, their ubiquity poses challenges to models of black hole growth.

<p> Ming-Yang Zhuang, Junyao Li, Yue Shen </p>
<p>
We present detailed and comprehensive data reduction and point-spread-function (PSF) model construction for all public JWST NIRCam imaging data from the COSMOS-Web treasury program (up to June 2023, totaling 0.28 deg<sup>2</sup>). We show that the NIRCam PSF has significant short-timescale temporal variations and random spatial variations in all four filters (F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W). Combining NIRCam with archival HST imaging, we perform multiwavelength AGN+host image decomposition to study the properties of 143 X-ray-selected (L_bol=10^43.6-47.2 erg s<sup>-1</sup>) broad-line AGNs at 0.35≲ z ≲ 3.5. Leveraging the superb resolution, wavelength coverage, and sensitivity of NIRCam, we successfully detect host stellar emission after decomposing the central AGN point source in 142 objects. ~ 2/3 AGNs are in star-forming galaxies based on the UVJ diagram, suggesting no instantaneous negative AGN feedback. X-ray-selected broad-line AGN hosts follow a similar stellar mass-size relation as inactive galaxies, albeit with slightly smaller galaxy sizes. We find that although major mergers are rare (~7-22%) among the sample, more subtle non-axisymmetric features from stellar bars, spiral arms, and minor mergers are ubiquitous, highlighting the importance of secular processes and minor mergers in triggering AGN activity. For a subsample of 30 AGNs at 1&lt;z&lt;2.5 with black hole mass measurements from single epoch spectra, they follow a similar black hole mass-stellar mass relation as local inactive early-type galaxies but reside preferentially near the upper envelope of nearby AGNs. We caution that selection biases and intrinsic differences of AGN populations at different redshifts may significantly affect their location on the black hole mass-stellar mass plane.

<p>
Massive, starbursting galaxies in the early Universe represent some of the most extreme objects in the study of galaxy evolution. One such source is HFLS3 (z~6.34), which was originally identified as an extreme starburst galaxy with mild gravitational magnification (μ~2.2). Here, we present new observations of HFLS3 with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU in both low (PRISM/CLEAR; R~100) and high spectral resolution (G395H/290LP; R~2700), with high spatial resolution (~0.1") and sensitivity. Thanks to the combination of the NIRSpec data and a new lensing model with accurate spectroscopic redshifts, we find that the 3"x3" field is crowded, with a lensed arc (C, z=6.3425±0.0002), two galaxies to the south (S1 and S2, z=6.3592±0.0001), two galaxies to the west (W1, z=6.3550±0.0001; W2, z=6.3628±0.0001), and two low-redshift interlopers (G1, z=3.4806±0.0001; G2, z=2.00±0.01). We present spectral fits and morpho-kinematic maps for each bright emission line from the R2700 data for all sources except G2. From a line ratio analysis, the galaxies in component C are likely powered by star formation, while we cannot rule out or confirm the presence of AGN in the other high-redshift sources. We perform gravitational lens modelling, finding evidence for a two-source composition of the lensed central object and a comparable magnification factor (μ=2.1-2.4) to previous work. The projected distances and velocity offsets of each galaxy suggest that they will merge within the next ~1Gyr. Finally, we examine the dust extinction-corrected SFR(Ha) of each z&gt;6 source, finding that the total star formation (510±140Msol/yr, magnification-corrected) is distributed across the six z~6.34-6.36 objects over a region of diameter ~11kpc. Altogether, this suggests that HFLS3 is not a single starburst galaxy, but instead is a merging system of star-forming galaxies in the Epoch of Reionisation.

### 197) [2308.11888](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.11888v1): First measurement of the Mg II forest correlation function in the Epoch of Reionization

<p> Suk Sien Tie, Joseph F. Hennawi, Feige Wang, Silvia Onorato, Jinyi Yang, Eduardo Bañados, Frederick B. Davies, Jose Oñorbe </p>
<p>
In the process of producing the roughly three ionizing photons per atom required to reionize the IGM, the same massive stars explode and eject metals into their surroundings. While the overly sensitive Lya transition makes Gunn-Peterson absorption of background quasar light an ineffective probe of reionization at z &gt; 6, strong low-ionization transitions like the MgII doublet will give rise to a detectable "metal-line forest", if metals pollute the neutral IGM. We measure the auto-correlation of the MgII forest transmission using a sample of ten ground based z ≥ 6.80 quasar spectra probing the redshift range 5.96 &lt; z_MgII &lt; 7.42 (z_MgII,median = 6.47). The correlation function exhibits strong small-scale clustering and a pronounced peak at the doublet velocity (768 km/s) arising from strong absorbers in the CGM of galaxies. After these strong absorbers are identified and masked the signal is consistent with noise. Our measurements are compared to a suite of models generated by combining a large hydrodynamical simulation with a semi-numerical reionization topology, assuming a simple uniform enrichment model. We obtain a 95% credibility upper limit of [Mg/H] &lt; -3.73 at z_MgII,median = 6.47, assuming uninformative priors on [Mg/H] and the IGM neutral fraction x_HI. Splitting the data into low-z (5.96 &lt; z_MgII &lt; 6.47; z_MgII,median = 6.235) and high-z (6.47 &lt; z_MgII &lt; 7.42; z_MgII,median = 6.72) subsamples again yields null-detections and 95% upper limits of [Mg/H] &lt; -3.75 and [Mg/H] &lt; -3.45, respectively. These first measurements set the stage for an approved JWST Cycle 2 program (GO 3526) targeting a similar number of quasars that will be an order of magnitude more sensitive, making the Mgii forest an emerging powerful tool to deliver precision constraints on the reionization and enrichment history of the Universe.

### 198) [2308.06317](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.06317v1): A fast-rotator post-starburst galaxy quenched by supermassive black-hole feedback at z=3

<p>
There is compelling evidence that the most massive galaxies in the Universe stopped forming stars due to the time-integrated feedback from their central super-massive black holes (SMBHs). However, the exact quenching mechanism is not yet understood, because local massive galaxies were quenched billions of years ago. We present JWST/NIRSpec integral-field spectroscopy observations of GS-10578, a massive, quiescent galaxy at redshift z=3.064. From the spectrum we infer that the galaxy has a stellar mass of M_*=1.6±0.2 × 10^11 MSun and a dynamical mass M_dyn=2.0±0.5 × 10^11 MSun. Half of its stellar mass formed at z=3.7-4.6, and the system is now quiescent, with the current star-formation rate SFR&lt;9 MSun/yr. We detect ionised- and neutral-gas outflows traced by [OIII] emission and NaI absorption. Outflow velocities reach v_out≈1,000 km/s, comparable to the galaxy escape velocity and too high to be explained by star formation alone. GS-10578 hosts an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), evidence that these outflows are due to SMBH feedback. The outflow rates are 0.14-2.9 and 30-300 MSun/yr for the ionised and neutral phases, respectively. The neutral outflow rate is ten times higher than the SFR, hence this is direct evidence for ejective SMBH feedback, with mass-loading capable of interrupting star formation by rapidly removing its fuel. Stellar kinematics show ordered rotation, with spin parameter λ_Re=0.62±0.07, meaning GS-10578 is rotation supported. This study shows direct evidence for ejective AGN feedback in a massive, recently quenched galaxy, thus clarifying how SMBHs quench their hosts. Quenching can occur without destroying the stellar disc.

<p>
We present a JWST/MRS spectrum of the quasar J1120+0641 at z=7.0848, the first spectroscopic observation of a reionisation-era quasar in the rest-frame infrared (0.6&lt;λ&lt;3.4μm). In the context of the mysterious fast assembly of the first supermassive black holes at z&gt;7, our observations enable for the first time the detection of hot torus dust, the Hα emission line, and the Paschen-series broad emission lines in a quasar at z&gt;7. Hot torus dust is clearly detected as an upturn in the continuum emission at λ_rest≃1.3μm, leading to a black-body temperature of T=1413.5^+5.7_-7.4K. Compared to similarly-luminous quasars at 0&lt;z&lt;6, the hot dust in J1120+0641 is somewhat elevated in temperature (top 1%). The temperature is more typical among 6&lt;z&lt;6.5 quasars (top 25%), leading us to postulate a weak evolution in the hot dust temperature at z&gt;6 (2σ significance). We measure the black hole mass of J1120+0641 based on the Hα Balmer line, M_BH=1.52±0.17\cdot 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, which is in good agreement with the previous rest-UV MgII black hole mass measurement. The black hole mass based on the Paschen-series lines is also consistent, indicating no significant extinction in the rest-frame UV measurement. The broad Hα, Pa-α and Pa-β emission lines are consistent with an origin in a common broad-line region (BLR) with density logN_H/cm^-3≥ 12, ionisation parameter -7&lt;logU&lt;-4, and extinction E(B-V)≲ 0.1mag. These BLR parameters are consistent with similarly-bright quasars at 0&lt;z&lt;4. Overall, we find that both J1120+0641's hot dust torus and hydrogen BLR properties show no significant peculiarity when compared to luminous quasars down to z=0. The quasar accretion structures must have therefore assembled very quickly, as they appear fully "mature" less than 760 million years after the Big Bang.

### 200) [2307.09590](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.09590v3): The FENIKS Survey: Spectroscopic Confirmation of Massive Quiescent Galaxies at z ~ 3-5

<p>
The measured ages of massive, quiescent galaxies at z~ 3-4 imply that massive galaxies quench as early as z~ 6. While the number of spectroscopic confirmations of quiescent galaxies at z &lt; 3 has increased over the years, there are only a handful at z &gt; 3.5. We report spectroscopic redshifts of one secure (z=3.757) and two tentative (z = 3.336, z=4.673) massive (log(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &gt; 10.3) quiescent galaxies with 11 hours of Keck/MOSFIRE K-band observations. Our candidates were selected from the FENIKS survey, which uses deep Gemini/Flamingos-2 K_b K_r imaging optimized for increased sensitivity to the characteristic red colors of galaxies at z &gt; 3 with strong Balmer/4000 Å breaks. The rest-frame UVJ and (ugi)_s colors of 3/4 quiescent candidates are consistent with 1-2 Gyr old stellar populations. This places these galaxies as the oldest objects at these redshifts, and challenges the notion that quiescent galaxies at z &gt; 3 are all recently-quenched, "post-starburst" galaxies. Our spectroscopy shows that the other quiescent-galaxy candidate is a broad-line AGN (z = 3.594) with strong, redshifted Hβ+[O III] emission with a velocity offset &gt;1000 km/s, indicative of a powerful outflow. The star-formation history of our highest redshift candidate suggests that its progenitor was already in place by z ~ 7-11, reaching ~ 10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub> by z ≃ 8. These observations reveal the limit of what is possible with deep near-infrared photometry and targeted spectroscopy from the ground and demonstrate that secure spectroscopic confirmation of quiescent galaxies at z &gt; 4 is only feasible with JWST.

### 201) [2307.06336](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06336v3): Ultraviolet Compactness of High-Redshift Galaxies as a Tracer of Early-Stage Gas Infall, Bursty Star Formation, and Offset from the Fundamental Metallicity Relation

<p> Danial Langeroodi, Jens Hjorth </p>
<p>
The empirical anti-correlation between gas-phase metallicity and star formation rate (SFR) at a fixed stellar mass, known as the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR), is commonly interpreted as an equilibrium state in the interplay between gas infall, enrichment, and gas removal. JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy has shown a z&gt;3 deviation from the local-universe FMR calibrations, suggesting that these galaxies are potentially caught out of equilibrium. To investigate this, we inferred the stellar population, nebular, and morphological properties of 427 galaxies at 3&lt;z&lt;10 using uniformly reduced NIRSpec prism spectroscopy and NIRCam photometry. We consider morphology as a possible indicator of chemical enrichment stage. We find a mass-size relation already in place at 4&lt;z&lt;10, with a normalization anti-correlated with redshift. The size-redshift anti-correlation depends on stellar mass: while the size of M_*&lt;10^8M<sub>&odot;</sub> galaxies strongly declines with redshift, M_*&gt;10^9M<sub>&odot;</sub> galaxies exhibit negligible redshift evolution. We also confirm the redshift evolution of the FMR: z&gt;3 galaxies appear metal-deficient compared to expectations for their stellar mass and SFR according to the local-universe FMR. This offset grows with redshift. Metal deficiency is correlated with compactness: galaxies most offset from the average mass-size relation are also the most metal-poor for their stellar mass and SFR. We interpret this as a product of bursty star formation: compact galaxies exhibit elevated SFR surface densities, indicating that they are observed during burst episodes triggered by gas infall. While accretion of metal-poor gas has reduced their gas-phase metallicity by diluting the interstellar medium, they are observed prior to chemical yield release by newly formed massive stars. Simply, they are chemically out of equilibrium compared to the equilibrium state known as the FMR.

### 202) [2307.04790](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.04790v2): The hunt for formamide in interstellar ices: A toolkit of laboratory infrared spectra in astronomically relevant ice mixtures and comparisons to ISO, Spitzer, and JWST observations

<p>
This work aims at characterizing the mid-IR spectra of formamide in its pure form as well as in mixtures of the most abundant interstellar ices via laboratory simulation of such ices, as well as demonstrating how these laboratory spectra can be used to search for formamide in ice observations. Mid-IR spectra (4000 - 500 cm^-1, 2.5 - 20 μm) of formamide, both in its pure form as well as in binary and tertiary mixtures with H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, CO, NH_3, CH_3OH, H<sub>2</sub>O:CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O:NH_3, CO:NH_3, and CO:CH_3OH, are collected at temperatures ranging from 15 - 212 K. Apparent band strengths and positions of eight IR bands of pure amorphous and crystalline formamide at various temperatures are provided. Three bands are identified as potential formamide tracers in observational ice spectra: the overlapping C=O stretch and NH<sub>2</sub> scissor bands at 1700.3 and 1630.4 cm^-1 (5.881 and 6.133 μm), the CH bend at 1388.1 cm^-1 (7.204 μm), and the CN stretch at 1328.1 cm^-1 (7.529 μm). The relative apparent band strengths, positions, and FWHM of these features in mixtures at various temperatures are also determined. Finally, the laboratory spectra are compared to observational spectra of low- and high-mass young stellar objects as well as pre-stellar cores observed with the Infrared Space Observatory, the Spitzer Space Telescope, and the JWST. A comparison between the formamide CH bend in laboratory data and the 7.24 μm band in the observations tentatively indicates that, if formamide ice is contributing significantly to the observed absorption, it is more likely in a polar matrix. Upper limits ranging from 0.35-5.1&percnt; with respect to H<sub>2</sub>O are calculated. These upper limits are in agreement with gas-phase formamide abundances and take into account the effect of a H<sub>2</sub>O matrix on formamide's band strengths.

### 203) [2307.04753](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.04753v1): Redshifting galaxies from DESI to JWST CEERS: Correction of biases and uncertainties in quantifying morphology

<p> Si-Yue Yu, Cheng Cheng, Yue Pan, Fengwu Sun, Yang A. Li </p>
<p>
Observations of high-redshift galaxies with unprecedented detail have now been rendered possible with JWST. However, accurately quantifying their morphology remains uncertain due to potential biases and uncertainties. To address this issue, we used a sample of 1816 nearby DESI galaxies, with a mass range of 10^9.75-11.25M<sub>&odot;</sub>, to compute artificial images of galaxies of the same mass located at 0.75≤ z≤ 3 and observed at rest-frame optical wavelength in CEERS. We analyzed the effects of cosmological redshift on the measurements of Petrosian radius (R_p), half-light radius (R_50), asymmetry (A), concentration (C), axis ratio (q), and Sérsic index (n). Our results show that R_p and R_50, calculated using non-parametric methods, are slightly overestimated due to PSF smoothing, while R_50, q, and n obtained through model fitting does not exhibit significant biases. We improve the computation of A by incorporating a more accurate noise effect removal procedure. Due to PSF asymmetry, there is a minor overestimation of A for intrinsically symmetric galaxies. However, for intrinsically asymmetric galaxies, PSF smoothing dominates and results in an underestimation of A, an effect that becomes more significant with higher intrinsic A or at lower resolutions. Moreover, PSF smoothing also leads to an underestimation of C, which is notably more pronounced in galaxies with higher intrinsic C or at lower resolutions. We developed functions based on resolution level, defined as R_p/FWHM, for correcting these biases and the associated statistical uncertainties. Applying these corrections, we measured the bias-corrected morphology for the simulated CEERS images and we find that the derived quantities are in good agreement with their intrinsic values &ndash; except for A, which is robust only for angularly large galaxies where R_p/FWHM≥ 5.

### 204) [2307.04234](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.04234v2): Extreme N-emitters at high-redshift: signatures of supermassive stars and globular cluster or black hole formation in action?

<p>
[Abridged] Using the JWST/NIRSpec observations from CEERS we found an extreme N-emitter, CEERS-1019 at z=8.6782 showing intense NIV and NIII emission. From the observed rest-UV and optical lines we conclude that it is compatible with photoionization from stars and we determine accurate abundances for C, N, O, and Ne, relative to H, finding a highly supersolar ratio log(N/O) = -0.18+/-0.11, and normal log(C/O) = -0.75+/-0.11 and log(Ne/O) = -0.63+/-0.07, for its low metallicity, 12+log(O/H)= 7.70+/-0.18. We also analyze other N-emitters from the literature. All show strongly enhanced N/O ratios and two of them normal C/O. Massive star ejecta from WR stars are needed to explain the galaxies with enhanced C/O (Lynx arc and Mrk 996). On the other hand, supermassive stars (&gt;1000 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, SMS) in the "conveyer-belt model'' put forward to explain globular clusters (GCs), predict a high N/O and small changes in C/O, compatible with CEERS-1019, the Sunburst cluster, SMACS2031, and GN-z11. Based on the chemical abundances, possible enrichment scenarios, compactness, and high ISM density, we suggest that CEERS-1019, SMACS2031, and the Sunburst cluster could contain proto-GCs. Finally, we propose that some N-emitters enriched by SMS could also have formed intermediate-mass black holes, and we suggest that this might be the case for GN-z11. Our observations and analysis reinforce the suggested link between some N-emitters and proto-GC formation, which is supported both by empirical evidence and quantitative models. Furthermore, the observations provide possible evidence for the presence of supermassive stars in the early Universe (z&gt;8) and at z~2-3. Our analysis also suggests that the origin and nature of the N-emitters is diverse, including also objects like GN-z11 which possibly host an AGN.

<p>
Optical rest-frame spectroscopic diagnostics are usually employed to distinguish between star formation and AGN-powered emission. However, this method is biased against dusty sources, hampering a complete census of the AGN population across cosmic epochs. To mitigate this effect, it is crucial to observe at longer wavelengths in the rest-frame near-infrared (near-IR), which is less affected by dust attenuation and can thus provide a better description of the intrinsic properties of galaxies. AGN diagnostics in this regime have not been fully exploited so far, due to the scarcity of near-IR observations of both AGNs and star-forming galaxies, especially at redshifts higher than 0.5. Using Cloudy photoionization models, we identify new AGN - star formation diagnostics based on the ratio of bright near-infrared emission lines, namely [SIII] 9530 Angstrom, [CI] 9850 Angstrom, [PII] 1.188 μm, [FeII] 1.257 μm, and [FeII] 1.64 μm to Paschen lines (either Paγ or Paβ), providing simple, analytical classification criteria. We apply these diagnostics to a sample of 64 star-forming galaxies and AGNs at 0 &lt; z &lt; 1, and 65 sources at 1 &lt; z &lt; 3 recently observed with JWST-NIRSpec in CEERS. We find that the classification inferred from the near-infrared is broadly consistent with the optical one based on the BPT and the [SII]/Hα ratio. However, in the near-infrared, we find ~ 60 &percnt; more AGNs than in the optical (13 instead of 8), with 5 sources classified as 'hidden' AGNs, showing a larger AGN contribution at longer wavelengths, possibly due to the presence of optically thick dust. The diagnostics we present provide a promising tool to find and characterize AGNs from z=0 to z=3 with low and medium-resolution near-IR spectrographs in future surveys.

Although low surface brightness galaxies (LSBs) contribute a large fraction to the number density of galaxies, their properties are still poorly known. LSBs are often considered dust poor, based only on a few studies. We use, for the first time, a large sample of LSBs and high surface brightness galaxies (HSBs) with deep observational data to study their dust properties as a function of surface brightness. Our sample consists of 1631 optically selected galaxies at z &lt; 0.1 from the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) wide field. We use the large set of data available in this field, from UV to FIR. We measured the optical size and the surface brightness of the targets, and analyzed their spectral energy distribution using the CIGALE fitting code. We found that the specific star formation rate and specific infrared luminosity (total infrared luminosity per stellar mass) remain mostly flat as a function of surface brightness for both LSBs and HSBs that are star-forming but decline steeply for the quiescent galaxies. The majority of LSBs in our sample have negligible dust attenuation (A_V &lt; 0.1 mag), except for about 4% of them that show significant attenuation with a mean A_V of 0.8 mag. We found that these LSBs also have a high itr-band mass-to-light ratio (M/L_r&gt;3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/L<sub>&odot;</sub>), and show similarity to the extreme giant LSBs from the literature, indicating a possibly higher dust attenuation in giant LSBs as well. This work provides a large catalog of LSBs and HSBs with detailed measurements of their several optical and infrared physical properties. Our results suggest that the dust content of LSBs is more varied than previously thought, with some of them having significant attenuation making them fainter than their intrinsic value. This will have serious implications for the observation and analysis of LSBs with current/upcoming surveys like JWST and LSST.

We present the properties of 17 faint Lyα emitting galaxies (LAEs) at z&gt;5.8 from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field/GOODS-S. These LAEs span a redshift range z≈5.8-8.0 and a UV magnitude range M_UV≈-17 to -20.6, with the Lyα equivalent width (EW) in the range ≈ 25-350 Å. The detection of other rest-optical emission lines in the spectra of these LAEs enables the determination of accurate systemic redshifts and Lyα velocity offsets, as well as the physical and chemical composition of their stars and interstellar media. These faint LAEs are consistent with metal-poor systems with high ionization parameters, similar to the general galaxy population at z&gt;6. We measured an average ionizing photon production efficiency, log(ξ<sub>ion</sub>/erg^-1 Hz) ≈25.57 across our LAEs, which does not evolve strongly with redshift. We report an anti-correlation between the Lyα escape fraction (f<sub>esc</sub>) and the velocity offset from systemic redshift, consistent with model expectations. We further find that the strength and velocity offset of Lyα are neither correlated with galaxy spectroscopic properties nor with ξ<sub>ion</sub>. We find a decrease in f<sub>esc</sub>(Lyα) with redshift, indicative of decreasing sizes of ionized bubbles around LAEs at high redshifts. We used a range of galaxy properties to predict Lyman continuum f<sub>esc</sub> for our LAEs, finding that the ionizing photon output into the intergalactic medium remains roughly constant across the observed Lyα EW, showing a mild increase at fainter M_UV and at higher redshifts. We derived correlations between the ionizing photon output from LAEs and M_UV, Lyα EW and redshifts, which can be used to constrain the ionizing photon contribution of LAEs at z &gt; 6 towards cosmic reionization.

### 208) [2306.00487](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.00487v3): JWST Measurements of Neutral Hydrogen Fractions and Ionized Bubble Sizes at z=7-12 Obtained with Lyα Damping Wing Absorptions in 27 Bright Continuum Galaxies

We present volume-averaged neutral hydrogen fractions x_\HI and ionized bubble radii R_b measured with Lyα damping wing absorption of galaxies at the epoch of reionization. We combine JWST/NIRSpec spectra taken by CEERS, GO-1433, DDT-2750, and JADES programs, and obtain a sample containing 27 bright UV-continuum (M_UV&lt;-18.5~mag) galaxies at 7&lt;z&lt;12. We construct 4 composite spectra binned by redshift, and find the clear evolution of softening break towards high redshift at the rest-frame 1216 Å, suggesting the increase of Lyα damping wing absorption. We estimate Lyα damping wing absorption in the galaxy spectra with realistic templates including Lyα emission and circum-galactic medium absorptions. Assuming the standard inside-out reionization picture having an ionized bubble with radius R_b around a galaxy embedded in the intergalactic medium with x_\HI, we obtain x_\HI (R_b) values generally increasing (decreasing) from x_\HI=0.53^+0.18_-0.47 to 0.92^+0.08_-0.10 (log R_b=1.67^+0.14_-0.16 to -0.69^+0.89_-0.24 comoving Mpc) at redshift 7.12^+0.06_-0.08 to 9.91^+1.49_-1.15. The redshift evolution of x_\HI indicates a moderately late reionization history consistent with the one previously suggested from the electron scattering of cosmic microwave background and the evolution of UV luminosity function with an escape fraction f<sub>esc</sub>~ 0.2. Our R_b measurements suggest that bubble sizes could be up to a few dex larger than the cosmic average values estimated by analytic calculations for a given x_\HI, while our R_b measurements are roughly comparable with the values for merged ionized bubbles around bright galaxies predicted by recent numerical simulations.

### 209) [2305.16670](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16670v2): Insight from JWST/NIRCam into galaxy overdensities around bright Lyα emitters during reionization: implications for ionized bubbles at z ~ 9

<p>
Several studies have detected Lyman-alpha (Lyα) from bright (M_UV≲-21.5) galaxies during the early stages of reionization despite the significantly neutral intergalactic medium. To explain these detections, it has been suggested that z&gt;7 Lyα emitters (LAEs) inhabit physical Mpc (pMpc)-scale ionized regions powered by overdensities of faint galaxies, but systematic searches for these overdensities near LAEs have been challenging. Here, we use CEERS JWST/NIRCam imaging to search for large-scale galaxy overdensities near two very UV-bright, z=8.7 LAEs in the EGS field. We colour select 27 z=8.4-9.1 candidates, including the one LAE in the footprint (EGSY8p7). From SED models, we infer moderately faint UV luminosities (-21.2≲M_UV≲ -19.1) and stellar masses of M_*≈10^7.5-8.8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. All are efficient ionizing agents (ξ<sub>ion</sub>^*≈10^25.5-26.0 Hz erg^-1) and are generally morphologically simple with only one compact (r_e≲140 to ~650 pc) star-forming component. 13 candidates lie within 5 arcmin of EGSY8p7, leading to a factor-of-four galaxy overdensity at ≲ 5 arcmin (~ 1.4 projected pMpc at z~8.7) separations from EGSY8p7. Separations of 10-15 arcmin (~2.7-4.1 projected pMpc) are consistent with an average field. The spatial distribution of our sample may qualitatively suggest an R≥2 pMpc ionized bubble encompassing both LAEs in EGS, which is theoretically unexpected but may be possible for a galaxy population 4× more numerous than the average to create with moderate escape fractions (f<sub>esc</sub>≳0.15) over long times (≳200 Myr). Upcoming spectroscopic follow-up will characterize the size of any ionized bubble that may exist and the properties of the galaxies powering such a bubble.

### 210) [2305.09709](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.09709v1): "Dust Giant": Extended and Clumpy Star-Formation in a Massive Dusty Galaxy at z=1.38

<p>
We present NOEMA CO (2-1) line and ALMA 870 μm continuum observations of a main-sequence galaxy at z=1.38. The galaxy was initially selected as a "gas-giant", based on the gas mass derived from sub-mm continuum (log(M_gas/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=11.20±0.20), however the gas mass derived from CO (2-1) luminosity brings down the gas mass to a value consistent with typical star-forming galaxies at that redshift (log(M_gas/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=10.84±0.03). Despite that the dust-to-stellar mass ratio remains elevated above the scaling relations by a factor of 5. We explore the potential physical picture and consider an underestimated stellar mass and optically thick dust as possible causes. Based on the updated gas-to-stellar mass ratio we rule out the former, and while the latter can contribute to the dust mass overestimate it is still not sufficient to explain the observed physical picture. Instead, possible explanations include enhanced HI reservoirs, CO-dark H<sub>2</sub> gas, an unusually high metallicity, or the presence of an optically dark, dusty contaminant. Using the ALMA data at 870 μm coupled with HST/ACS imaging, we find extended morphology in dust continuum and clumpy star-formation in rest-frame UV in this galaxy, and a tentative ~ 10 kpc dusty arm is found bridging the galaxy center and a clump in F814W image. The galaxy shows levels of dust obscuration similar to the so-called HST-dark galaxies at higher redshifts, and would fall into the optically faint/dark JWST color-color selection at z&gt;2. It is therefore possible that our object could serve as low-z analog of the HST-dark populations. This galaxy serves as a caveat to the gas masses based on the continuum alone, with a larger sample required to unveil the full picture.

### 211) [2305.07066](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.07066v2): Mini-quenching of z=4-8 galaxies by bursty star formation

<p> Tibor Dome, Sandro Tacchella, Anastasia Fialkov, Daniel Ceverino, Avishai Dekel, Omri Ginzburg, Sharon Lapiner, Tobias J. Looser </p>
<p>
The recent reported discovery of a low-mass z=5.2 and an intermediate-mass z=7.3 quenched galaxy with JWST/NIRSpec is the first evidence of halted star formation above z≈ 5. Here we show how bursty star formation at z=4-8 gives rise to temporarily quenched, or mini-quenched galaxies in the mass range M<sub>&sext;</sub> = 10^7-10^9  M<sub>&odot;</sub> using four models of galaxy formation: the periodic box simulation IllustrisTNG, the zoom-in simulations VELA and FirstLight and an empirical halo model. The main causes for mini-quenching are stellar feedback, lack of gas accretion onto galaxies and galaxy-galaxy interactions. The abundance of (mini-)quenched galaxies agrees across the models: the population first appears below z≈ 8, after which their proportion increases with cosmic time, from ~ 0.5-1.0% at z=7 to ~ 2-4% at z=4, corresponding to comoving number densities of ~ 10^-5 Mpc^-3 and ~ 10^-3 Mpc^-3, respectively. These numbers are consistent with star formation rate duty cycles inferred for VELA and FirstLight galaxies. Their star formation histories (SFHs) suggest that mini-quenching at z=4-8 is short-lived with a duration of ~ 20-40 Myr, which is close to the free-fall timescale of the inner halo. However, mock spectral energy distributions of mini-quenched galaxies in IllustrisTNG and VELA do not match JADES-GS-z7-01-QU photometry, unless their SFHs are artificially altered to be more bursty on timescales of ~ 40 Myr. Studying mini-quenched galaxies might aid in calibrating sub-grid models governing galaxy formation, as these may not generate sufficient burstiness at high redshift to explain the SFH inferred for JADES-GS-z7-01-QU.

We present ionizing spectra estimated at 13.6&ndash;100 eV for ten dwarf galaxies with strong high ionization lines of HeIIλ4686 and [Ne \scv]λ3426 ([Ne \sciv]λ2424) at z=0 (z=8) that are identified in our Keck/LRIS spectroscopy and the literature (the JWST ERO program). With the flux ratios of these high ionization lines and &gt;10 low-ionization lines of hydrogen, helium, oxygen, neon, and sulfur, we determine ionizing spectra consisting of stellar and non-thermal power-law radiation by photoionization modeling with free parameters of nebular properties including metallicity and ionization parameter, cancelling out abundance ratio differences. We find that all of the observed flux ratios are well reproduced by the photoinization models with the power law index α_EUV of α_EUV~ (-1)-0 and the luminosity L_EUV of L_EUV~ 10^40-10^42 erg s<sup>-1</sup> at ~ 55-100 eV for six galaxies, while four galaxies include large systematics in α_EUV caused by stellar radiation contamination. We then compare α_EUV and L_EUV of these six galaxies with those predicted by the black hole (BH) accretion disk models, and find that α_EUV and L_EUV are similar to those of the intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) in BH accretion disk models albeit with possibilities of the other scenarios. Confirming these results with a known IMBH having a mass M_BH of M_BH=10^5.75  M<sub>&odot;</sub>, we find that four local galaxies and one z=7.665 galaxy have ionizing spectra consistent with those of IMBHs with M_BH ~ 10^3-10^5  M<sub>&odot;</sub>.

### 213) [2304.08526](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.08526v2): The Physics of Indirect Estimators of Lyman Continuum Escape and their Application to High-Redshift JWST Galaxies

Reliable indirect diagnostics of LyC photon escape from galaxies are required to understand which sources were the dominant contributors to reionization. While multiple LyC escape fraction (f<sub>esc</sub>) indicators have been proposed to trace favourable conditions for LyC leakage from the interstellar medium of low-redshift ''analog'' galaxies, it remains unclear whether these are applicable at high redshifts where LyC emission cannot be directly observed. Using a library of 14,120 mock spectra of star-forming galaxies with redshifts 4.64 ≤ z ≤ 10 from the SPHINX^20 cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulation, we develop a framework for the physics that leads to high f<sub>esc</sub>. We investigate LyC leakage from our galaxies based on the criteria that successful LyC escape diagnostics must i) track a high specific star formation rate, ii) be sensitive to stellar population age in the range 3.5-10~Myr representing the times when supernova first explode to when LyC production significantly drops, and iii) include a proxy for neutral gas content and gas density in the interstellar medium. O_32, Σ_SFR, M_UV, and Hβ equivalent width select for one or fewer of our criteria, rendering them either necessary but insufficient or generally poor diagnostics. In contrast, UV slope (β), and E(B-V) match two or more of our criteria, rendering them good f<sub>esc</sub> diagnostics (albeit with significant scatter). Using our library, we build a quantitative model for predicting f<sub>esc</sub> based on direct observables. When applied to bright z &gt; 6 Lyα emitters observed with JWST, we find that the majority of them have f<sub>esc</sub> ≲ 10&percnt;.

We analyse the gas-phase metallicity properties of a sample of low stellar mass (log M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M_sun ≤ 9) galaxies at 3 &lt; z &lt; 10, observed with JWST/NIRSpec as part of the JADES programme in its deep GOODS-S tier. By combining this sample with more massive galaxies at similar redshifts from other programmes, we study the scaling relations between stellar mass, oxygen abundance (O/H), and star-formation rate (SFR) for 146 galaxies, spanning across three orders of magnitude in stellar mass and out to the epoch of early galaxy assembly. We find evidence for a shallower slope at the low-mass-end of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR), with 12 + log(O/H) = (7.72+-0.02) + (0.17+-0.03) log(M<sub>&sext;</sub> / 10^8 M_sun), in good agreement with the MZR probed by local analogues of high-redshift systems like 'Green Pea' and 'Blueberry' galaxies. The inferred slope is well matched by models including 'momentum-driven' SNe winds, suggesting that feedback mechanisms in dwarf galaxies (and at high-z) might be different from those in place at higher masses. The evolution in the normalisation is observed to be relatively mild compared to previous determinations of the MZR at z~3 (~ 0.1 - 0.2 dex across the explored mass regime). We observe a deviation from the local fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) for our sample at high redshift, especially at z &gt; 6, with galaxies significantly less enriched (with a median offset in log(O/H) of ~ 0.5 dex, significant at ~ 5 sigma) than predicted given their M<sub>&sext;</sub> and SFR. These observations are consistent with an enhanced stochasticity in the star-formation history, and/or with an increased efficiency in metal removals by outflows, prompting us to reconsider the nature of the relationship between M<sub>&sext;</sub>, O/H, and SFR in the early Universe.

We present JWST/NIRSpec prism spectroscopy of seven galaxies selected from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) NIRCam imaging with photometric redshifts z<sub>phot</sub>&gt;8. We measure emission line redshifts of z=7.65 and 8.64 for two galaxies, and z=9.77(+0.37,-0.29) and 10.01(+0.14,-0.19) for two others via the detection of continuum breaks consistent with Lyman-alpha opacity from a mostly neutral intergalactic medium. The presence (absense) of strong breaks (strong emission lines) give high confidence that these two galaxies are at z&gt;9.6, but the break-derived redshifts have large uncertainties given the low spectral resolution and relatively low signal-to-noise of the CEERS NIRSpec prism data. The two z~10 sources are relatively luminous (M_UV&lt;-20), with blue continua (-2.3&lt;beta&lt;-1.9) and low dust attenuation (A_V=0.15(+0.3,-0.1)); and at least one of them has high stellar mass for a galaxy at that redshift (log(M_*/M_sol)=9.3(+0.2,-0.3)). Considered together with spectroscopic observations of other CEERS NIRCam-selected high-z galaxy candidates in the literature, we find a high rate of redshift confirmation and low rate of confirmed interlopers (8.3%). Ten out of 34 z&gt;8 candidates with CEERS NIRSpec spectroscopy do not have secure redshifts, but the absence of emission lines in their spectra is consistent with redshifts z&gt;9.6. We find that z&gt;8 photometric redshifts are generally in agreement (within uncertainties) with the spectroscopic values. However, the photometric redshifts tend to be slightly overestimated (average Delta(z)=0.50+/-0.12), suggesting that current templates do not fully describe the spectra of very high-z sources. Overall, our results solidifies photometric evidence for a high space density of bright galaxies at z&gt;8 compared to theoretical model predictions, and further disfavors an accelerated decline in the integrated UV luminosity density at z&gt;8.

We investigate how cosmic web structures affect galaxy quenching in the IllustrisTNG (TNG100) cosmological simulations by reconstructing the cosmic web within each snapshot using the DisPerSE framework. We measure the comoving distance from each galaxy with stellar mass log(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 8 to the nearest node (d_node) and the nearest filament spine (d_fil) to study the dependence of both median specific star formation rate (&lt;sSFR&gt;) and median gas fraction (&lt;f_gas&gt;) on these distances. We find that the &lt;sSFR&gt; of galaxies is only dependent on cosmic web environment at z&lt;2, with the dependence increasing with time. At z≤0.5, 8 ≤ log(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &lt; 9 galaxies are quenched at d_node≲1~Mpc, and have significantly-suppressed star formation at d_fil≲1~Mpc, trends driven mostly by satellite galaxies. At z≤1, in contrast to the monotonic drop in &lt;sSFR&gt; of log(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &lt;10 galaxies with decreasing d_node and d_fil, log(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 10 galaxies - both centrals and satellites - experience an upturn in &lt;sSFR&gt; at d_node≲0.2~Mpc. Much of this cosmic web dependence of star formation activity can be explained by an evolution in &lt;f_gas&gt;. Our results suggest that in the past ~10 Gyr, low-mass satellites are quenched by rapid gas stripping in dense environments near nodes and gradual gas starvation in intermediate-density environments near filaments, while at earlier times cosmic web structures efficiently channeled cold gas into most galaxies. State-of-the-art ongoing spectroscopic surveys such as SDSS and DESI, as well as those planned with the Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph, JWST and Roman, are required to test our predictions against observations.

### 217) [2303.05574](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05574v2): The rapid onset of stellar bars in the baryon-dominated centers of disk galaxies

<p> J. Bland-Hawthorn, T. Tepper-Garcia, O. Agertz, K. Freeman </p>
<p>
Recent observations of high-redshift galactic disks (z≈ 1-3) show a strong negative trend in the dark matter fraction f_DM with increasing baryonic surface density. For this to be true, the inner baryons must dominate over dark matter in early massive galaxies, as observed in the Milky Way today. If disks are dominant at early times, we show that stellar bars form promptly within these disks, leading to a high bar fraction at early times. New JWST observations provide the best evidence to date for mature stellar bars in this redshift range. The disk mass fraction f_disk within R_s=2.2 R_disk is the dominant factor in determining how rapidly a bar forms. Using 3D hydro simulations of halo-disk-bulge galaxies, we confirm the "Fujii relation" for the exponential dependence of the bar formation time τ_bar as a function of f_disk. For f_disk &gt; 0.3, the bar formation time declines exponentially fast with increasing f_disk. This relation is a challenge to simulators - barred models with inadequate resolution fall off this curve. Instead of Fujii's arbitrary threshold for when a bar forms, for the first time, we exploit the exponential growth timescale associated with a positive feedback cycle as the bar emerges from the underlying disk. A modified, mass-dependent trend is observed for halos relevant to systems at cosmic noon (10.5 &lt; log M_halo &lt; 12), where the bar onset is slower for higher mass halos at a fixed f_disk. If baryons dominate over dark matter within R ≈ R_s, we predict that a high fraction of bars will be found in high-redshift disks long before z = 1. Due to its widespread use in simulations, we investigate the Efstathiou-Lake-Negroponte criterion for bar instability: this sub-optimal parameter is inversely related to f_disk, with a secondary dependence on M_halo.

### 218) [2303.04827](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04827v2): Efficient Formation of Massive Galaxies at Cosmic Dawn by Feedback-Free Starbursts

<p> Avishai Dekel, Kartick S. Sarkar, Yuval Birnboim, Nir Mandelker, Zhaozhou Li </p>
<p>
JWST observations indicate a surprising excess of luminous galaxies at z~ 10 and above, consistent with efficient conversion of the accreted gas into stars, unlike the suppression of star formation by feedback at later times. We show that the high densities and low metallicities at this epoch  guarantee a high star-formation efficiency (SFE) in the most massive dark-matter haloes. Feedback-free starbursts (FFBs) occur when the free-fall time is shorter than ~ 1 Myr, below the time for low-metallicity massive stars to develop winds and supernovae. This corresponds to a characteristic density of ~ 3× 10^3cm^-3. A comparable threshold density permits a starburst by allowing cooling to star-forming temperatures in a free-fall time. The galaxies within ~ 10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub> haloes at z ~ 10 are expected to have FFB densities. The halo masses allow efficient gas supply by cold streams in a halo crossing time ~ 80 Myr. The FFBs gradually turn all the accreted gas into stars in clusters of ~ 10^4-7 M<sub>&odot;</sub> within galaxies that are rotating discs or shells. The starbursting clouds are insensitive to radiative feedback and are shielded against feedback from earlier stars. We predict high SFE above thresholds in redshift and halo mass, where the density is 10^3-4cm^-3. The z~ 10 haloes of ~ 10^10.8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> are predicted to host galaxies of ~ 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> with SFR ~ 65 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1 and sub-kpc sizes. The metallicity is ≤ 0.1 Z<sub>&odot;</sub> with little gas, dust, outflows and hot circumgalactic gas, allowing a top-heavy IMF but not requiring it. The compact galaxies with thousands of young FFB clusters may have implications on reionization, black-hole growth and globular clusters.

We investigate the stellar mass - black hole mass (M_*-M_BH) relation with type 1 AGN down to M_BH=10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, corresponding to a ≃ -21 absolute magnitude in rest-frame ultraviolet (UV), at z = 2-2.5. Exploiting the deep and large-area spectroscopic survey of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX), we identify 66 type 1 AGN with M_BH ranging from 10^7 to 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> that are measured with single-epoch virial method using C\sc iv emission lines detected in the HETDEX spectra. M_* of the host galaxies are estimated from optical to near-infrared photometric data taken with Spitzer, WISE, and ground-based 4-8m class telescopes by CIGALE SED fitting. We further assess the validity of SED fitting in two cases by host-nuclear decomposition performed through surface brightness profile fitting on spatially-resolved host galaxies with JWST/NIRCam CEERS data. We obtain the M_*-M_BH relation covering the unexplored low-mass ranges of M_BH~~~10^7-10^8~M<sub>&odot;</sub>, and conduct forward modelling to fully account for the selection biases and observational uncertainties. The intrinsic M_*-M_BH relation at z~ 2 has a moderate positive offset of 0.52±0.14~dex from the local relation, suggestive of more efficient black hole growth at higher redshift even in the low-mass regime of M_BH~~~10^7-10^8~M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Our M_*-M_BH relation is inconsistent with the M_BH suppression at the low-M_* regime predicted by recent hydrodynamic simulations at a 98&percnt; confidence level, suggesting that feedback in the low-mass systems may be weaker than those produced in hydrodynamic simulations.

We selected 35 low-mass SFGs (7.9&lt;log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;10.3) from deep spectroscopic surveys based on their CIII]1908 emission. We used follow-up NIR observations to examine their rest-optical emission lines and identify ionized outflow signatures through broad emission wings detected after Gaussian modeling of [OIII]4959,5007 profiles. We characterized the galaxies' gas-phase metallicity and carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) abundance using a Te-based method via the OIII]1666/[OIII]5007 ratio and photoionization models. We find line ratios and rest-frame EWs characteristic of high-ionization conditions powered by massive stars. Our sample displays mean rest-frame EW([OIII]5007)~560Å while 15% of them show EW([OIII]4959,5007)&gt;1000Å and EW(CIII])&gt;5Å, closely resembling those now seen in EoR galaxies with JWST. We find low gas-phase metallicities 12+log(O/H)~7.5-8.5 and C/O abundances from 23%-128% solar, with no apparent increasing trend with metallicity. From our [OIII]4959,5007 profile modeling, we find that 65% of our sample shows an outflow component, which is shifted relative to the ionized gas systemic velocity, with mean v_max~280 km/s which correlates with the Σ_SFR. We find that the mass-loading factor μ of our sample is typically lower than in more massive galaxies from literature but higher than in typical local dwarf galaxies. In the stellar mass range covered, we find that μ increases with Σ_SFR thus suggesting that for a given stellar mass, denser starbursts in low-mass galaxies produce stronger outflows. Our results complement the picture drawn by similar studies at lower redshift, suggesting that the removal of ionized gas in low-mass SFGs driven by stellar feedback is regulated by their stellar mass and by the strength and concentration of their star formation, i.e. Σ_SFR.

### 221) [2303.00410](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.00410v2): JWST/NIRSpec Measurements of the Relationships Between Nebular Emission-line Ratios and Stellar Mass at z~3-6

<p> Alice E. Shapley, Naveen A. Reddy, Ryan L. Sanders, Michael W. Topping, Gabriel B. Brammer </p>
<p>
We analyze the rest-optical emission-line ratios of star-forming galaxies at 2.7≤z&lt;6.5 drawn from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey, and their relationships with stellar mass (M_*). Our analysis includes both line ratios based on the [NII]6583 feature &ndash; [NII]6583/Ha, ([OIII]5007/Hb)/([NII]6583/Ha) (O3N2), and [NII]6583/[OII]3727 &ndash; and those those featuring alpha elements &ndash; [OIII]5007/Hb, [OIII]5007/[OII]3727 (O_32), ([OIII]4959,5007+[OII]3727)/Hb (R_23), and [NeIII]3869/[OII]3727. Given the typical flux levels of [NII]6583 and [NeIII]3869, which are undetected in the majority of individual CEERS galaxies at 2.7≤z&lt;6.5, we construct composite spectra in bins of M_* and redshift. Using these composite spectra, we compare the relationships between emission-line ratios and M_* at 2.7≤z&lt;6.5 with those observed at lower redshift. While there is significant evolution towards higher excitation (e.g., higher [OIII]5007/Hb, O_32, O3N2), and weaker nitrogen emission (e.g., lower [NII]6583/Ha and [NII]6583/[OII]3727) between z~0 and z~3, we find in most cases that there is no significant evolution in the relationship between line ratio and M_* beyond z~3. The [NeIII]3869/[OII]3727 ratio is anomalous in showing evidence for significant elevation at 4.0≤z&lt;6.5 at fixed mass, relative to z~3.3. Collectively, however, our empirical results suggest that there is no significant evolution in the mass-metallicity relationship at 2.7≤z&lt;6.5. Representative galaxy samples and metallicity calibrations based on existing and upcoming JWST/NIRSpec observations will be required to translate these empirical scaling relations into ones tracing chemical enrichment and gas cycling, and distinguish among the descriptions of star-formation feedback in simulations of galaxy formation at z&gt;3.

We present emission line ratios from a sample of 26 Lyman break galaxies from z~5.5-9.5 with -17.0&lt;M_1500&lt;-20.4, measured from ultra-deep JWST/NIRSpec MSA spectroscopy from JADES. We use 28 hour deep PRISM/CLEAR and 7 hour deep G395M/F290LP observations to measure, or place strong constraints on, ratios of widely studied rest-frame optical emission lines including Hα, Hβ, [OII] λλ3726,3729, [NeIII] λ3869, [OIII] λ4959, [OIII] λ5007, [OI] λ6300, [NII] λ6583, and [SII] λλ6716,6731 in individual z&gt;5.5 spectra. We find that the emission line ratios exhibited by these z~5.5-9.5 galaxies occupy clearly distinct regions of line-ratio space compared to typical z~0-3 galaxies, instead being more consistent with extreme populations of lower-redshift galaxies. This is best illustrated by the [OIII]/[OII] ratio, tracing interstellar medium (ISM) ionisation, in which we observe more than half of our sample to have [OIII]/[OII]&gt;10. Our high signal-to-noise spectra reveal more than an order of magnitude of scatter in line ratios such as [OII]/Hβ and [OIII]/[OII], indicating significant diversity in the ISM conditions within the sample. We find no convincing detections of [NII] in our sample, either in individual galaxies, or a stack of all G395M/F290LP spectra. The emission line ratios observed in our sample are generally consistent with galaxies with extremely high ionisation parameters (log U~-1.5), and a range of metallicities spanning from ~0.1× Z<sub>&odot;</sub> to higher than ~0.3× Z<sub>&odot;</sub>, suggesting we are probing low-metallicity systems undergoing periods of rapid star-formation, driving strong radiation fields. These results highlight the value of deep observations in constraining the properties of individual galaxies, and hence probing diversity within galaxy population.

We present the ultraviolet luminosity function and an estimate of the cosmic star formation rate density at 8&lt;z&lt;13 derived from deep NIRCam observations taken in parallel with the MIRI Deep Survey (MDS) of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), NIRCam covering the parallel field 2 (HUDF-P2). Our deep (40 hours) NIRCam observations reach a F277W magnitude of 30.8 (5σ), more than 2 magnitudes deeper than JWST public datasets already analyzed to find high redshift galaxies. We select a sample of 44 z&gt;8 galaxy candidates based on their dropout nature in the F115W and/or F150W filters, a high probability for their photometric redshifts, estimated with three different codes, being at z&gt;8, good fits based on χ^2 calculations, and predominant solutions compared to z&lt;8 alternatives. We find mild evolution in the luminosity function from z~13 to z~8, i.e., only a small increase in the average number density of ~0.2 dex, while the faint-end slope and absolute magnitude of the knee remain approximately constant, with values α=-2.2±0.1 and M^*=-20.8±0.2 mag. Comparing our results with the predictions of state-of-the-art galaxy evolution models, we find two main results: (1) a slower increase with time in the cosmic star formation rate density compared to a steeper rise predicted by models; (2) nearly a factor of 10 higher star formation activity concentrated in scales around 2 kpc in galaxies with stellar masses ~10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> during the first 350 Myr of the Universe, z~12, with models matching better the luminosity density observational estimations ~150 Myr later, by z~9.

We make use of itJWST medium and broad-band NIRCam imaging, along with ultra-deep MIRI 5.6 μm imaging, in the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (XDF) to identify prominent line emitters at z≃ 7-8. Out of a total of 58 galaxies at z≃ 7-8, we find 18 robust candidates (≃31&percnt;) for (Hβ + [OIII]) emitters, based on their enhanced fluxes in the F430M and F444W filters, with EW_0(Hβ +[OIII]) ≃ 87 - 2100 Å. Among these emitters, 16 lie in the MIRI coverage area and 12 exhibit a clear flux excess at 5.6   μm, indicating the simultaneous presence of a prominent Hα emission line with EW_0(Hα) ≃ 200-3000 Å. This is the first time that Hα emission can be detected in individual galaxies at z&gt;7. The Hα line, when present, allows us to separate the contributions of Hβ and [OIII] to the (Hβ +[OIII]) complex, and derive Hα-based star formation rates (SFRs). We find that in most cases [OIII]/Hβ&gt; 1. Instead, two galaxies have [OIII]/Hβ&lt; 1, indicating that the NIRCam flux excess is mainly driven by Hβ. This could potentially imply extremely low metallicities. Most prominent line emitters are very young starbursts or galaxies on their way to/from the starburst cloud. They make for a cosmic SFR density log_10(ρ_SFR_Hα) ≃ -2.35, which is about a quarter of the total value (log_10(ρ_SFR_tot) ≃ -1.76) at z≃ 7-8. Therefore, the strong Hα emitters likely had a significant role in reionization.

Brown dwarfs with well-measured masses, ages and luminosities provide direct benchmark tests of substellar formation and evolutionary models. We report the first results from a direct imaging survey aiming to find and characterize substellar companions to nearby accelerating stars with the assistance of the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalog of Accelerations (HGCA). In this paper, we present a joint high-contrast imaging and astrometric discovery of a substellar companion to HD 176535 A, a K3.5V main-sequence star aged approximately 3.59_-1.15^+0.87 Gyrs at a distance of 36.99 ± 0.03 pc. In advance of our high-contrast imaging observations, we combined precision HARPS RVs and HGCA astrometry to predict the potential companion's location and mass. We thereafter acquired two nights of KeckAO/NIRC2 direct imaging observations in the L' band, which revealed a companion with a contrast of ΔL'_p = 9.20±0.06 mag at a projected separation of ≈0.\!\!''35 (≈13 AU) from the host star. We revise our orbital fit by incorporating our dual-epoch relative astrometry using the open-source MCMC orbit fitting code \tt orvara. HD 176535 B is a new benchmark dwarf useful for constraining the evolutionary and atmospheric models of high-mass brown dwarfs. We found a luminosity of log(L_bol/L<sub>&odot;</sub>) = -5.26±0.07 and a model-dependent effective temperature of 980 ± 35 K for HD 176535 B. Our dynamical mass suggests that some substellar evolutionary models may be underestimating luminosity for high-mass T dwarfs. Given its angular separation and luminosity, HD 176535 B would make a promising candidate for Aperture Masking Interferometry with JWST and GRAVITY/KPIC, and further spectroscopic characterization with instruments like the CHARIS/SCExAO/Subaru integral field spectrograph.

<p>
We present a first look at the MRS observations of the nucleus of the nearby galaxy M83, taken with MIRI onboard JWST. The observations show a rich set of emission features from the ionized gas, warm molecular gas, and dust. To begin dissecting the complex processes in this part of the galaxy, we divide the observations into four different regions. We find that the strength of the emission features varies strongly from region to region, with the south-east region displaying the weakest features tracing the dust continuum and ISM properties. Comparison between the cold molecular gas traced by the ^12CO (1-0) transition with ALMA and the H<sub>2</sub> S(1) transition shows a similar spatial distribution. This is in contrast to the distribution of the much warmer H<sub>2</sub> emission from the S(7) transition found to be concentrated around the optical nucleus. We use the rotational emission lines and model the H<sub>2</sub> excitation to estimate a total molecular gas mass accounting for the warm H<sub>2</sub> component of M(&gt;50 K)_H<sub>2</sub> = 67.90 (± 5.43)×10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. We compare this value to the total gas mass inferred by probing the cold H<sub>2</sub> gas through the ^12CO (1-0) emission, M(CO)_H<sub>2</sub> = 17.15×10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. We estimate that ~75&percnt; of the total molecular gas mass is contained in the warm H<sub>2</sub> component. We also identify [\ionO 4] 25.89 μm and [\ionFe 2] 25.99 μm emission. We propose that the diffuse [\ionFe 2] 25.99 μm emission might be tracing shocks created during the interactions between the hot wind produced by the starburst and the much cooler ISM above the galactic plane. More detailed studies are needed to confirm such a scenario.

<p>
We present electron densities n_e in the inter-stellar medium (ISM) of star-forming galaxies at z=4-9 observed by the JWST/NIRSpec GLASS, ERO, and CEERS programs. We carefully evaluate line-spread functions of the NIRSpec instrument as a function of wavelength with the calibration data of a planetary nebula taken onboard, and obtain secure [OII]λλ3726,3729 doublet fluxes for 14 galaxies at z=4.02-8.68 falling on the star-formation main sequence with the NIRSpec high and medium resolution spectra. We thus derive the electron densities of singly-ionized oxygen nebulae with the standard n_e indicator of [OII] doublet, and find that the electron densities of the z=4-9 galaxies are n_e≳ 300 cm^-3 significantly higher than those of low-z galaxies at a given stellar mass, star-formation rate (SFR), and specific SFR. Interestingly, typical electron densities of singly ionized nebulae increase from z=0 to z=1-3 and z=4-9, which is approximated by the evolutionary relation of n_e&prop;(1+z)^p with p~ 1-2. Although it is not obvious that the ISM property of n_e is influenced by global galaxy properties, these results may suggest that nebula densities of high-z galaxies are generally high due to the compact morphologies of high-z galaxies evolving by r_e approximately proportional to (1+z)^-1 (r_vir &prop; (1+z)^-1) for a given stellar (halo) mass whose inverse square corresponds to the p~ 2 evolutionary relation. The p~ 1-2 evolutionary relation can be explained by a combination of the compact morphology and the reduction of n_e due to the high electron temperature of the high-z metal poor nebulae.

<p>
Using MIRI on-board JWST we present mid-infrared sub-arcsec imaging (MIRIM) and spectroscopy (MRS) of the hyperluminous infrared system SPT0311-58 at z=6.9. MIRI observations are compared with existing ALMA far-infrared continuum and [CII]158μm imaging. Even though the ALMA observations suggests very high star formation rates (SFR) in the eastern (E) and western (W) galaxies of the system, the Hα line is not detected. This, together with the detection of the Paα line, implies very high optical nebular extinction with lower limits of 4.2 (E) and 3.9 mag (W), and even larger 5.6 (E) and 10.0 (W) for SED derived values. The extinction-corrected Paα SFRs are 383 and 230M<sub>&odot;</sub>yr^-1 for the E and W galaxies, respectively. This represents 50% of the SFRs derived from the [CII]158μm line and infrared light for the E galaxy and as low as 6% for the W galaxy. The MIRI observations reveal a clumpy stellar structure, with each clump having 3 to 5 ×10^9M<sub>&odot;</sub>, leading to a total stellar mass of 2.0 and 1.5×10^10M<sub>&odot;</sub> for the E and W galaxies, respectively. The specific SFR in the stellar clumps ranges from 25 to 59Gyr^-1, which are 3 to 10 times larger than the values measured in galaxies of similar mass at redshifts 6 to 8. The overall gas mass fraction is M_gas/M_*~3, similar to that of z=4.5-6 star-forming galaxies. The observed properties of SPT0311-58 such as the clumpy distribution at sub(kpc) scales and the very high average extinction are similar to those observed in low- and intermediate-z LIRGs and ULIRGs, even though SPT0311-58 is observed only 800 Myr after the Big Bang. Massive, heavily obscured, clumpy starburst systems like SPT0311-58 likely represent the early phases in the formation of massive high-z bulge/spheroids and luminous quasars.

We compare embedded young massive star clusters (YMCs) to (sub-)millimeter line observations tracing the excitation and dissociation of molecular gas in the starburst ring of NGC 1365. This galaxy hosts one of the strongest nuclear starbursts and richest populations of YMCs within 20 Mpc. Here we combine near-/mid-IR PHANGS-JWST imaging with new ALMA multi-J CO (1-0, 2-1 and 4-3) and [CI](1-0) mapping, which we use to trace CO excitation via R42 = I_CO(4-3)/I_CO(2-1) and R21 = I_CO(2-1)/I_CO(1-0) and dissociation via RCICO = I_[CI](1-0)/I_CO(2-1) at 330 pc resolution. We find that the gas flowing into the starburst ring from northeast to southwest appears strongly affected by stellar feedback, showing decreased excitation (lower R42) and increased signatures of dissociation (higher RCICO) in the downstream regions. There, radiative transfer modeling suggests that the molecular gas density decreases and temperature and [CI/CO] abundance ratio increase. We compare R42 and RCICO with local conditions across the regions and find that both correlate with near-IR 2 um emission tracing the YMCs and with both PAH (11.3 um) and dust continuum (21 um) emission. In general, RCICO exhibits ~ 0.1 dex tighter correlations than R42, suggesting CI to be a more sensitive tracer of changing physical conditions in the NGC 1365 starburst than CO (4-3). Our results are consistent with a scenario where gas flows into the two arm regions along the bar, becomes condensed/shocked, forms YMCs, and then these YMCs heat and dissociate the gas.

Cosmic hydrogen reionization and cosmic production of first metals are major phase transitions of the universe occurring during the first billion years after the Big Bang, however these are still underexplored observationally. Using the JWST NIRSpec prism spectroscopy, we report the discovery of a sub-L<sub>&ast;</sub> galaxy at z<sub>spec</sub>=8.1623±0.0007, dubbed RXJ2129-z8HeII, via the detection of a series of strong rest-frame UV/optical nebular emission lines and the clear Lyman break. RXJ2129-z8HeII shows a pronounced UV continuum with an extremely steep (i.e. blue) spectral slope of β=-2.53_-0.07^+0.06, the steepest amongst all spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at z<sub>spec</sub>≳7, in support of its very hard ionizing spectrum that could lead to a significant leakage of its ionizing flux. Therefore, RXJ2129-z8HeII is representative of the key galaxy population driving the cosmic reionization. More importantly, we detect a strong He II λ1640 emission line in its spectrum, one of the highest redshifts at which such a line is robustly detected. Its high rest-frame equivalent width (EW=21±4 Angstrom) and extreme flux ratios with respect to UV metal and Balmer lines raise the possibility that part of RXJ2129-z8HeII's stellar populations could be Pop III-like. Through careful photoionization modeling, we show that the physically calibrated phenomenological models of the ionizing spectra of Pop III stars with strong mass loss can successfully reproduce the emission line flux ratios observed in RXJ2129-z8HeII. Assuming the Eddington limit, the total mass of the Pop III stars within this system is estimated to be 7.8±1.4×10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. To date, this galaxy presents the most compelling case in the early universe where trace Pop III stars might coexist with metal-enriched populations.

### 231) [2212.00180](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.00180v2): Star Formation and Molecular Gas Diagnostics with Mid- and Far-Infrared Emission

<p> C. M. Whitcomb, K. Sandstrom, A. Leroy, J. -D. T. Smith </p>
<p>
With the start of JWST observations, mid-infrared (MIR) emission features from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), H<sub>2</sub> rotational lines, fine-structure lines from ions, and dust continuum will be widely available tracers of gas and star formation rate (SFR) in galaxies at various redshifts. Many of these tracers originate from dust and gas illuminated by UV photons from massive stars, so they generally trace both SFR and gas to varying degrees. We investigate how MIR spectral features from 5 to 35μm and photometry from 3.4 to 250μm correlate with SFR traced by ionized neon (15.6μm [Ne III] and 12.8μm [Ne II]) and molecular gas traced by carbon monoxide (CO). In general, we find MIR emission features (i.e. PAHs and H<sub>2</sub> rotational lines) trace both CO and SFR better than CO and SFR trace one another. H<sub>2</sub> lines and PAH features correlate best with CO. Fine-structure lines from ions correlate best with SFR. The [S III] lines at 18.7 and 33.5μm, in particular, have a very tight correlation with SFR, and we use them to calibrate new single-parameter MIR tracers of SFR that have negligible metallicity dependence. The 17μm/7.7μm PAH feature ratio increases as a function of CO emission which may be evidence of PAH growth or neutralization in molecular gas. The degree to which dust continuum emission traces SFR or CO varies as a function of wavelength, with continuum between 20 to 70μm better tracing SFR, while longer wavelengths better trace CO.

<p>
The study of the properties of galaxies in the first billion years after the Big Bang is one of the major topic of current astrophysics. Optical/near-infrared spectroscopy of the afterglows of long Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) provide a powerful diagnostic tool to probe the interstellar medium (ISM) of their host galaxies and foreground absorbers, even up to the highest redshifts. We analyze the VLT/X-shooter afterglow spectrum of GRB 210905A, triggered by the Swift Neil Gehrels Observatory, and detect neutral-hydrogen, low-ionization, high-ionization, and fine-structure absorption lines from a complex system at z=6.3118, that we associate with the GRB host galaxy. We study the ISM properties of the host system, revealing the metallicity, kinematics and chemical abundance pattern. The total metallicity of the z~6.3 system is [M/H]=-1.72+/-0.13, after correcting for dust-depletion and taking into account alpha-element enhancement. In addition, we determine the overall amount of dust and dust-to-metal mass ratio (DTM) ([Zn/Fe]_fit=0.33+/-0.09, DTM=0.18+/-0.03). We find indications of nucleosynthesis due to massive stars and evidence of peculiar over-abundance of aluminium. From the analysis of fine-structure lines, we determine distances of several kpc for the low-ionization gas clouds closest to the GRB. Those farther distances are possibly due to the high number of ionizing photons. Using the HST/F140W image of the GRB field, we show the GRB host galaxy as well as multiple objects within 2" from the GRB. We discuss the galaxy structure and kinematics that could explain our observations, also taking into account a tentative detection of Lyman-alpha emission. Deep spectroscopic observations with VLT/MUSE and JWST will offer the unique possibility of combining our results with the ionized-gas properties, with the goal of better understanding how galaxies in the reionization era form and evolve.

Norman </p>
<p>
Star cluster formation in the early universe and their contribution to reionization remains to date largely unconstrained. Here we present JWST/NIRCam imaging of the most highly magnified galaxy known at z ~ 6, the Sunrise arc. We identify six young massive star clusters (YMCs) with measured radii spanning ~ 20 pc down to ~ 1 pc (corrected for lensing magnification), estimated stellar masses of ~ 10^(6-7) M<sub>&odot;</sub>, and with ages 1-30 Myr based on SED fitting to photometry measured in 8 filters extending to rest-frame 7000A. The resulting stellar mass surface densities are higher than 1000 M<sub>&odot;</sub> pc^-2 (up to a few 10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> pc^-2) and their inferred dynamical ages qualify the majority of these systems as gravitationally-bound stellar clusters. The star cluster ages map the progression of star formation along the arc, with to evolved systems (&gt;~ 10 Myr old) followed by very young clusters. The youngest stellar clusters (&lt; 5 Myr) show evidence of prominent Hbeta + [OIII]4959,5007 emission, based on photometry, with equivalent widths larger than 1000 A rest-frame, and are hosted in a 200 pc sized star-forming complex. Such a region dominates the ionizing photon production, with a high efficiency log(ξ<sub>ion</sub> [Hz erg^-1]) ~ 25.7. A significant fraction of the recently formed stellar mass of the galaxy (&gt; 10-30 %) occurred in these YMCs. We speculate that such sources of ionizing radiation boost the ionizing photon production efficiency which eventually carve ionized channels that might favor the escape of Lyman continuum radiation. The survival of some of the clusters would make them the progenitors of massive and relatively metal-poor globular clusters in the local Universe.

<p>
Context. Compact Obscured Nuclei (CONs) are an extreme phase of galaxy evolution where rapid supermassive black hole growth and/or compact star-forming activity is completely obscured by gas and dust. Aims. We investigate the properties of CONs in the mid-infrared and explore techniques aimed at identifying these objects such as through the equivalent width (EW) ratios of their Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) features. Methods. We model Spitzer spectra by decomposing the continua into nuclear and star-forming components from which we then measure the nuclear optical depth, τ_N, of the 9.8 μm silicate absorption feature. We also use Spitzer spectral maps to investigate how PAH EW ratios vary with aperture size for objects hosting CONs. Results. We find that the nuclear optical depth, τ_N, strongly correlates with the HCN-vib emission line in the millimetre for CONs with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.91. We find the PAH EW ratios technique to be effective at selecting CONs and robust against highly inclined galaxies where strong dust lanes may mimic a CON like spectrum by producing a high τ_N. Our analysis of the Spitzer spectral maps showed that the efficacy of the PAH EW ratios to isolate CONs is reduced when there is a strong star-forming component from the host galaxy. In addition, we find that the use of the inferred nuclear optical depth is a reliable method to identify CONs in 36^+8_-7&percnt; of ULIRGs and 17^+3_-3&percnt; of LIRGs, consistent with previous work. Conclusions. We confirm mid-IR spectra to be a powerful diagnostic of CONs where the increased sensitivity of JWST will allow identification of CONs at cosmic noon revealing this extreme but hidden phase of galaxy evolution.

<p>
Mapping star-formation rates (SFR) within galaxies is key to unveiling their assembly and evolution. Calibrations exist for computing SFR from a combination of ultraviolet and infrared bands for galaxies as integrated systems, but their applicability to sub-galactic (kpc) scales remains largely untested. Here we use integral field spectroscopy of 19 nearby (D &lt; 20 Mpc) galaxies obtained by PHANGS-MUSE to derive accurate Balmer decrements (Hα/Hβ) and attenuation-corrected Hα maps. We combine this information with mid-infrared maps from WISE at 22 μm, and ultraviolet maps from GALEX in the far-UV band, to derive SFR surface densities in nearby galaxies on resolved (kpc) scales. Using the Hα attenuation-corrected SFR as a reference, we find that hybrid recipes from the literature overestimate the SFR in regions of low SFR surface density, low specific star-formation rate (sSFR), low attenuation and old stellar ages. We attribute these trends to heating of the dust by old stellar populations (IR cirrus). We calibrate this effect by proposing functional forms for the coefficients in front of the IR term which depend on band ratios sensitive to the sSFR. These calibrations prove reliable as a function of physical scale. In particular, they agree within 10% with the attenuation corrections computed from the Balmer decrement on 100 pc scales. Despite small quantitative differences, our calibrations are also applicable to integrated galaxy scales probed by the MaNGA survey, albeit with a larger scatter (up to 0.22 dex). Observations with JWST open up the possibility to calibrate these relations in nearby galaxies with cloud-scale (~100 pc) resolution mid-IR imaging.

### 236) [2211.02038](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.02038v2): On the observability and identification of Population III galaxies with JWST

<p> James A. A. Trussler, Christopher J. Conselice, Nathan J. Adams, Roberto Maiolino, Kimihiko Nakajima, Erik Zackrisson, Duncan Austin, Leonardo Ferreira, Tom Harvey </p>
<p>
We utilise theoretical models of Population III stellar+nebular spectra to investigate the prospects of observing and accurately identifying Population III galaxies with JWST using both deep imaging and spectroscopy. We investigate a series of different colour cuts, finding that a combination of NIRCam and MIRI photometry through the F444W-F560W, F560W-F770W colours offers the most robust identifier of potential z=8 Pop III candidates. We calculate that NIRCam will have to reach ~28.5-30.0 AB mag depths (1-20 h), and MIRI F560W must reach ~27.5-29.0 AB mag depths (10-100 h) to achieve 5σ continuum detections of M_* = 10^6~M<sub>&odot;</sub> Pop III galaxies at z=8. We also discuss the prospects of identifying Pop III candidates through slitless and NIRSpec spectroscopic surveys that target Lyα, Hβ and/or He II λ1640. We find small differences in the Hβ rest-frame equivalent width (EW) between Pop III and non-Pop III galaxies, rendering this diagnostic likely impractical. Instead, we find that the detection of high EW He II λ1640 emission will serve as the definitive Pop III identifier, requiring (ultra-)deep integrations (10-250 h) with NIRSpec/G140M for M_*=10^6~M<sub>&odot;</sub> Pop III galaxies at z=8. However, MIRI F770W detections of Pop III galaxies will require substantial gravitational lensing (μ=10) and/or fortuitous imaging of exceptionally massive (M_* = 10^7~M<sub>&odot;</sub>) Pop III galaxies. Thus, NIRCam medium-band imaging surveys that can search for high EW He II λ1640 emitters in photometry may perhaps be a viable alternative for finding Pop III candidates.

The COS Legacy Archive Spectroscopic SurveY (CLASSY) HST/COS treasury program provides the first high-resolution spectral catalogue of 45 local high-z analogues in the UV (1200-2000Å) to investigate their stellar and gas properties. We present a toolkit of UV interstellar medium (ISM) diagnostics, analyzing the main emission lines of CLASSY spectra (i.e., NIV]λλ1483,87, CIVλλ1548,51, HeIIλ1640, OIII]λλ1661,6, SiIII]λλ1883,92, CIII]λλ1907,9). Specifically, we focus our investigation on providing accurate diagnostics for reddening, electron density and temperature, gas-phase metallicity and ionization parameter, taking into account the different ionization zones of the ISM. We calibrate our UV toolkit using well-known optical diagnostics, analyzing archival optical spectra for all the CLASSY targets. We find that UV density diagnostics estimate ne values that are ~1-2 dex higher (e.g., ne(CIII]λλ1907,9)~10^4cm^-3) than those inferred from their optical counterparts (e.g., ne([SII]λλ6717,31)~10^2cm^-3). Te derived from the hybrid ratio OIII]λ1666/[OIII]λ5007 proves to be a reliable Te diagnostic, with differences in 12+log(O/H) within ~±0.3dex. We also investigate the relation between the stellar and gas E(B-V), finding consistent values at high specific star formation rates, while at low sSFR we confirm an excess of dust attenuation in the gas. Finally, we investigate UV line ratios and equivalent widths to provide correlations with 12+log(O/H) and log(U), but note there are degeneracies between the two. With this suite of UV-based diagnostics, we illustrate the pivotal role CLASSY plays in understanding the chemical and physical properties of high-z systems that JWST can observe in the rest-frame UV.

<p>
We analyze a sample of 25 [Ne V] λ3426 emission-line galaxies at 1.4&lt;z&lt;2.3 using Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 G102 and G141 grism observations from the CANDELS Lyman-α Emission at Reionization (CLEAR) survey. [Ne V] emission probes extremely energetic photoionization (97.11-126.21 eV), and is often attributed to energetic radiation from active galactic nuclei (AGN), shocks from supernova, or an otherwise very hard ionizing spectrum from the stellar continuum. In this work, we use [Ne V] in conjunction with other rest-frame UV/optical emission lines ([O II] λλ3726,3729, [Ne III] λ3869, Hβ, [O III] λλ4959,5007, Hα+[N II] λλ6548,6583, [S II] λλ6716,6731), deep (2&ndash;7 Ms) X-ray observations (from Chandra), and mid-infrared imaging (from Spitzer) to study the origin of this emission and to place constraints on the nature of the ionizing engine. The majority of the [Ne V]-detected galaxies have properties consistent with ionization from AGN. However, for our [Ne V]-selected sample, the X-ray luminosities are consistent with local (z≲ 0.1) X-ray-selected Seyferts, but the [Ne V] luminosities are more consistent with those from z~ 1 X-ray-selected QSOs. The excess [Ne V] emission requires either reduced hard X-rays, or a ~0.1 keV excess. We discuss possible origins of the apparent [Ne V] excess, which could be related to the "soft (X-ray) excess'' observed in some QSOs and Seyferts, and/or be a consequence of a complex/anisotropic geometry for the narrow line region, combined with absorption from a warm, relativistic wind ejected from the accretion disk. We also consider implications for future studies of extreme high-ionization systems in the epoch of reionization (z ≳ 6) with JWST.

### 239) [2208.14999](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.14999v2): A JWST/NIRCam Study of Key Contributors to Reionization: The Star-forming and Ionizing Properties of UV-faint z~7-8 Galaxies

<p>
Spitzer/IRAC imaging has revealed that the brightest z~7-8 galaxies often exhibit young ages and strong nebular line emission, hinting at high ionizing efficiency among early galaxies. However, IRAC's limited sensitivity has long hindered efforts to study the fainter, more numerous population often thought largely responsible for reionization. Here we use CEERS JWST/NIRCam data to characterize 116 UV-faint (median M_UV=-19.5) z~6.5-8 galaxies. The SEDs are typically dominated by young (~10-50 Myr), low-mass (M<sub>&ast;</sub>~10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) stellar populations, and we find no need for extremely high stellar masses (~10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub>). Considering previous studies of UV-bright (M_UV~-22) z~7-8 galaxies, we find evidence for a strong (5-10×) increase in specific star formation rate toward lower luminosities (median sSFR=103 Gyr^-1 in CEERS). The larger sSFRs imply a more dominant contribution from OB stars in the relatively numerous UV-faint population, perhaps suggesting that these galaxies are very efficient ionizing agents (median ξ<sub>ion</sub>=10^25.7 erg^-1 Hz). In spite of their much larger sSFRs, we find no significant increase in [OIII]+Hβ EWs towards fainter M_UV (median ≈780 \mathringA). If confirmed, this may indicate that a substantial fraction of our CEERS galaxies possess extremely low metallicities (≲3% Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) where [OIII] emission is suppressed. Alternatively, high ionizing photon escape fractions or bursty star formation histories can also weaken the nebular lines in a subset of our CEERS galaxies. While the majority of our objects are very blue (median β=-2.0), we identify a significant tail of very dusty galaxies (β~-1) at ≈0.5L_UV<sup>&ast;</sup> which may contribute significantly to the z~7-8 star formation rate density.

### 240) [2208.04835](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04835v2): Low-power jet-ISM interaction in NGC 7319 revealed by JWST/MIRI MRS

<p>
We present JWST/MIRI MRS spectroscopy of NGC7319, the largest galaxy in the Stephan's Quintet, observed as part of the Early Release Observations (ERO). NGC7319 hosts a type 2 active galactic nucleus (AGN) and a low-power radio jet (L_1.4GHz=3.3x10^22 W Hz^-1) with two asymmetric radio hotspots at 430 pc (N2) and 1.5 kpc (S2) projected distances from the unresolved radio core. The MRS data suggest that the molecular material in the disk of the galaxy decelerates the jet and causes this length asymmetry. We find enhanced emission from warm and hot H<sub>2</sub> (T_w=330+-40 K, T_h=900+-60 K) and ionized gas at the intersection between the jet axis and dust lanes in the disk. This emission is coincident with the radio hotspot N2, the hotspot closer to the core, suggesting that the jet-interstellar medium (ISM) interaction decelerates the jet. Conversely, the mid-infrared emission at the more distant hotspot is fainter, more highly ionized, and with lower H<sub>2</sub> excitation, suggesting a more diffuse atomic environment where the jet can progress to farther distances. At the N2 radio hotspot, the ionized gas mass (M<sub>ion</sub>=(2.4-12)x10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) is comparable to that of the warm H<sub>2</sub>, but the former is more turbulent (sigma<sub>ion</sub>~300 vs. sigma_H2~150 km/s), so the mechanical energy of the ionized gas is ~1.3-10 times higher. From these estimates, we find that only &lt;1% of the jet energy remains as mechanical energy in these two ISM phases at N2. We also find extended (r&gt;0.3-1.5 kpc) high-ionization emission ([MgV], [NeVI], and [NeV]) close to the radio hotspots. This initial analysis of NGC7319 shows the potential of MIRI/MRS to investigate the AGN feedback mechanisms due to radio jets and their radiation field in the, often heavily dust-enshrouded, central regions of galaxies. Understanding these mechanisms is an essential ingredient in the development of cosmological simulations of galaxy evolution.

<p>
JWST's first glimpse of the z&gt;10 Universe has yielded a surprising abundance of luminous galaxy candidates. Here we present the most extreme of these systems: CEERS-1749. Based on 0.6-5μm photometry, this strikingly luminous (≈26 mag) galaxy appears to lie at z≈17. This would make it an M_UV≈-22, M<sub>&sext;</sub>≈5×10^9M<sub>&odot;</sub> system that formed a mere ~220 Myrs after the Big Bang. The implied number density of this galaxy and its analogues challenges virtually every early galaxy evolution model that assumes ΛCDM cosmology. However, there is strong environmental evidence supporting a secondary redshift solution of z≈5: all three of the galaxy's nearest neighbors at &lt;2.5" have photometric redshifts of z≈5. Further, we show that CEERS-1749 may lie in a z≈5 protocluster that is ≳5× overdense compared to the field. Intense line emission at z≈5 from a quiescent galaxy harboring ionized gas, or from a dusty starburst, may provide satisfactory explanations for CEERS-1749's photometry. The emission lines at z≈5 conspire to boost the &gt;2μm photometry, producing an apparent blue slope as well as a strong break in the SED. Such a perfectly disguised contaminant is possible only in a narrow redshift window (Δz≲0.1), implying that the permitted volume for such interlopers may not be a major concern for z&gt;10 searches, particularly when medium-bands are deployed. If CEERS-1749 is confirmed to lie at z≈5, it will be the highest-redshift quiescent galaxy, or one of the lowest mass dusty galaxies of the early Universe detected to-date. Both redshift solutions of this intriguing galaxy hold the potential to challenge existing models of early galaxy evolution, making spectroscopic follow-up of this source critical.

### 242) [2207.09411](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09411v1): Influence of grain growth on CO2 ice spectroscopic profiles : Modelling for dense cores and disks

<p> Emmanuel Dartois, Jennifer A. Noble, Nathalie Ysard, Karine Demyk, Marin Chabot </p>
<p>
Interstellar dust grain growth in dense clouds and protoplanetary disks, even moderate, affects the observed interstellar ice profiles as soon as a significant fraction of dust grains is in the size range close to the wave vector at the considered wavelength. The continuum baseline correction made prior to analysing ice profiles influences the subsequent analysis and hence the estimated ice composition, typically obtained by band fitting using thin film ice mixture spectra. We model the effect of grain growth on ice mantle spectroscopic profiles, focusing on CO2 to see how it can affect interstellar ice mantle spectral analysis and interpretation. Using the Discrete Dipole Approximation for Scattering and Absorption of Light, the mass absorption coefficients of distributions of grains composed of ellipsoidal silicate cores with water and carbon dioxide ice mantles are calculated. A few other ice mantle compositions are also calculated. We explore the size distribution evolution from dense clouds to simulate the first steps of grain growth up to three microns in size. The results are injected into RADMC-3D full scattering radiative transfer models of spherical clouds and protoplanetary disk templates to retrieve observable spectral energy distributions. We focus on calculated profile of the CO2 antisymmetric stretching mode ice band profile at 4.27 microns, a meaningful indicator of grain growth. The observed profiles toward dense cores with the Infrared space observatory and Akari satellites already showed profiles possibly indicative of moderate grain growth.The observation of protoplanetary disks at high inclination with the JWST should present distorted profiles that will put constraints on the extent of dust growth. The more evolved the dust size distribution, the more the extraction of the ice mantle composition will require both understanding and taking into account grain growth.

### 243) [2207.08718](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08718v1): Measuring chemical abundances in AGN from infrared nebular lines: HII-CHI-Mistry-IR for AGN

<p> Borja Pérez-Díaz, Enrique Pérez-Montero, Juan A. Fernández-Ontiveros, José M. Vílchez </p>
<p>
Future and on-going infrared and radio observatories such as JWST, METIS or ALMA will increase the amount of rest-frame IR spectroscopic data for galaxies by several orders of magnitude. While studies of the chemical composition of the ISM based on optical observations have been widely spread over decades for SFG and, more recently, for AGN, similar studies need to be performed using IR data. This regime can be especially useful in the case of AGN given that it is less affected by temperature and dust extinction, traces higher ionic species and can also provide robust estimations of the chemical abundance ratio N/O. We present a new tool based on a bayesian-like methodology to estimate chemical abundances from IR emission lines in AGN. We use a sample of 58 AGN with IR spectroscopic data retrieved from the literature to probe the validity of our method. The estimations of the chemical abundances based on IR lines in our sample are later compared with the corresponding abundances derived from the optical emission lines in the same objects. HII-CHI-Mistry-IR takes advantage of photoionization models, characterized by the chemical abundance ratios O/H and N/O and the ionization parameter U, to compare their predicted emission-line fluxes with a set of observed values. Instead of matching single emission lines, the code uses some specific emission-line ratios sensitive to the above free parameters. We report mainly solar and also subsolar abundances for O/H in the nuclear region for our sample of AGN, whereas N/O clusters around solar values. We find a discrepancy between the chemical abundances derived from IR and optical emission lines, being the latter higher than the former. This discrepancy, also reported by previous studies of the composition of the ISM in AGN from IR observations, is independent from the gas density or the incident radiation field to the gas.

### 244) [2207.06322](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.06322v1): Bayesian hierarchical modelling of the M<sub>&sext;</sub>-SFR relation from 1&lt;z&lt;6 in ASTRODEEP

<p> L. Sandles, E. Curtis-Lake, S. Charlot, J. Chevallard, R. Maiolino </p>
<p>
The Hubble Frontier Fields represent the opportunity to probe the high-redshift evolution of the main sequence of star-forming galaxies to lower masses than possible in blank fields thanks to foreground lensing of massive galaxy clusters. We use the BEAGLE SED-fitting code to derive stellar masses, M<sub>&sext;</sub>=log(M/M<sub>&odot;</sub>), SFRs, Ψ=log(ψ/M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1) and redshifts from galaxies within the ASTRODEEP catalogue. We fit a fully Bayesian hierarchical model of the main sequence over 1.25&lt;z&lt;6 of the form Ψ= α_9.7(z) + β(M<sub>&sext;</sub>-9.7) + N(0,σ^2) while explicitly modelling the outlier distribution. The redshift-dependent intercept at M<sub>&sext;</sub>=9.7 is parametrized as α_9.7(z) = log[N (1+z)^γ] + 0.7. Our results agree with an increase in normalization of the main sequence to high redshifts that follows the redshift-dependent rate of accretion of gas onto dark matter halos with γ=2.40^+0.18_-0.18. We measure a slope and intrinsic scatter of β=0.79^+0.03_-0.04 and σ=0.26^+0.02_-0.02. We find that the sampling of the SED provided by the combination of filters (Hubble + ground-based Ks-band + Spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 μm) is insufficient to constrain M<sub>&sext;</sub> and Ψ over the full dynamic range of the observed main sequence, even at the lowest redshifts studied. While this filter set represents the best current sampling of high-redshift galaxy SEDs out to z&gt;3, measurements of the main sequence to low masses and high redshifts still strongly depend on priors employed in SED fitting (as well as other fitting assumptions). Future data-sets with JWST should improve this.

### 245) [2206.10441](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.10441v1): The role of highly vibrationally excited H2 initiating the N chemistry: Quantum study and 3-sigma detection of NH emission in the Orion Bar PDR

<p> Javier R. Goicoechea, Octavio Roncero </p>
<p>
The formation of hydrides by gas-phase reactions between H2 and a heavy element atom is a very selective process. Reactions with ground-state neutral carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms are very endoergic and have high energy barriers because the H2 molecule has to be fragmented before a hydride bond is formed. In cold interstellar clouds, these barriers exclude the formation of CH, OH, NH, and SH radicals through hydrogen abstraction reactions. Here we study a very energetically unfavorable process, the reaction of N(4S) atoms with H2 molecules. We calculated the reaction rate coefficient for H2 in different vibrational levels, using quantum methods for v=0-7 and quasi-classical methods up to v=12. Owing to the high energy barrier, these rate coefficients increase with v and also with the gas temperature. We implemented the new rates in the Meudon PDR code and studied their effect on models with different ultraviolet (UV) illumination conditions. In strongly UV-irradiated dense gas (Orion Bar conditions), the presence of H2 in highly vibrationally excited levels (v&gt;7) enhances the NH abundance by two orders of magnitude (at the PDR surface) compared to models that use the thermal rate coefficient for reaction N(4S) + H2 -&gt; NH + H. The increase in NH column density across the PDR is a factor of ~25. We explore existing Herschel/HIFI observations of the Orion Bar and Horsehead PDRs. We report a 3-sigma emission feature at the ~974 GHz frequency of the NH N_J=1_2-0_1 line toward the Bar. The emission level implies N(NH)~10^13 cm<sup>2</sup>, which is consistent with PDR models using the new rate coefficients for reactions between N and UV-pumped H2. This formation route dominates over hydrogenation reactions involving the less abundant N+ ion. JWST observations will soon quantify the amount and reactivity of UV-pumped H2 in many interstellar and circumstellar environments.

### 246) [2203.14795](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.14795v1): A technique to select the most obscured galaxy nuclei

<p> I. García-Bernete, D. Rigopoulou, S. Aalto, H. W. W. Spoon, A. Hernán-Caballero, A. Efstathiou, P. F. Roche, S. König </p>
<p>
Compact obscured nuclei (CONs) are mainly found in local U/LIRGs. In the local Universe, these sources are generally selected through the detection of the HCN-vib (3-2) emission line at submillimetre wavelengths. In this work, we present a diagnostic method to select deeply buried nuclei based on mid-infrared (mid-IR) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and continuum ratios. Using Spitzer/IRS spectra of a representative sample of local ULIRGs (z&lt;0.27), we examine their PAH and underlying continuum emission ratios. For deeply embedded sources, we find that the 9.7 micron silicate absorption band has a particularly pronounced effect on the 11.3 micron PAH feature. The low flux level in the nuclear silicate absorption band enhances the 11.3 micron PAH feature contrast (high PAH equivalent width) compared to that of the other PAH features. The technique has been extended to include the use of the continuum ratios. However, the latter are affected both by the extinction coming from the host galaxy as well as the nuclear region, whereas the foreground extinction is cancelled out when using the PAH equivalent width ratios. We apply our method to the HERUS and GOALS samples and classify as CON candidates 14 ULIRGs and 10 LIRGs, corresponding to 30% of ULIRGs and 7% of LIRGs from these samples. We find that the observed continuum ratios of CON-dominated sources can be explained by assuming torus models with a tapered disk geometry and a smooth dust distribution. This suggests that the nuclear dusty structure of CONs has an extremely high dust coverage. We also demonstrate that the use of mid-IR color-color diagrams is an effective way to select CON-dominated sources at different redshifts. In particular, the combination of filters of the JWST/MIRI will enable the selection of CONs out to z~1.5. This will allow extending the selection of CONs to high redshifts where U/LIRGs are more numerous.

### 247) [2203.12741](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.12741v1): Black holes at cosmic dawn in the redshifted 21cm signal of HI

<p> I. Felix Mirabel, Luis F. Rodriguez </p>
<p>
Indirect insights of Pop III stars and Black Holes (BHs) at Cosmic Dawn (CD) may be imprinted as an absorption signal in the 21cm line of HI against the CMB, when the Universe was less than 200 Myr old. To explain the additional large amplitude of the 21cm HI absorption reported by EDGES there have been proposed models based on an additional synchrotron Cosmic Radio Background (CRB) from BH-jet sources that boost the HI absorption signal at CD. The recent observations of radio loud supermassive BHs (SMBHs) in high-z quasars up to z=7 suggest the existence of a CRB from growing BHs at z &gt; 15, of unknown intensity. To match the onset of the EDGES signal a CRB of comparable intensity to that of the CMB is required. Here we provide approximate calculations to analyze this type of absorption signals, taking that of EDGES as an example. Assuming a BH mass to radio luminosity ratio as observed in radio-loud SMBHs of ~10^9 solar masses in quasars at z = 6-7, we find that rapidly growing radio luminous BHs of Intermediate Mass (IMBHs) in their way to become SMBHs, are the only type of astrophysical radio sources of a CRB that could explain the amplitude of the HI absorption reported by EDGES in the interval of z = 18-20. At those redshifts the EDGES signal would imply that the global mass density of IMBHs must be dominant over that of stars, more than 70% of the maximum Stellar Mass Density (SMD) expected at those high redshifts. This suggests that those IMBHs are formed before and grow faster than the bulk of stars, with no large mass contribution from stellar-mass BH remnants of typical Pop III stars. The highly redshifted signals from these IMBHs may be detected at long radio wavelengths with ultrasensitive interferometers such as the SKA, in the infrared with the JWST, and in the X-rays with future space missions.

Far-ultraviolet (FUV; ~1200-2000 angstroms) spectra are fundamental to our understanding of star-forming galaxies, providing a unique window on massive stellar populations, chemical evolution, feedback processes, and reionization. The launch of JWST will soon usher in a new era, pushing the UV spectroscopic frontier to higher redshifts than ever before, however, its success hinges on a comprehensive understanding of the massive star populations and gas conditions that power the observed UV spectral features. This requires a level of detail that is only possible with a combination of ample wavelength coverage, signal-to-noise, spectral-resolution, and sample diversity that has not yet been achieved by any FUV spectral database. We present the COS Legacy Spectroscopic SurveY (CLASSY) treasury and its first high level science product, the CLASSY atlas. CLASSY builds on the HST archive to construct the first high-quality (S/N_1500 &gt;~ 5/resel), high-resolution (R~15,000) FUV spectral database of 45 nearby (0.002 &lt; z &lt; 0.182) star-forming galaxies. The CLASSY atlas, available to the public via the CLASSY website, is the result of optimally extracting and coadding 170 archival+new spectra from 312 orbits of HST observations. The CLASSY sample covers a broad range of properties including stellar mass (6.2 &lt; logM_star(M_sol) &lt; 10.1), star formation rate (-2.0 &lt; log SFR (M_sol/yr) &lt; +1.6), direct gas-phase metallicity (7.0 &lt; 12+log(O/H) &lt; 8.8), ionization (0.5 &lt; O_32 &lt; 38.0), reddening (0.02 &lt; E(B-V &lt; 0.67), and nebular density (10 &lt; n_e (cm^-3) &lt; 1120). CLASSY is biased to UV-bright star-forming galaxies, resulting in a sample that is consistent with z~0 mass-metallicity relationship, but is offset to higher SFRs by roughly 2 dex, similar to z &gt;~2 galaxies. This unique set of properties makes the CLASSY atlas the benchmark training set for star-forming galaxies across cosmic time.

<p> Polychronis Papaderos, Iris Breda, Andrew Humphrey, Jean Michel Gomes, Bodo L. Ziegler, Cirino Pappalardo </p>
<p>
Our knowledge about the photometric properties of bulges in late-type galaxies (LTGs) is founded upon image decomposition into a Sérsic model for the central luminosity excess of the bulge and an exponential model for the underlying disk. We argue that the standard practice of adopting an exponential model for the disk all the way to its center is inadequate because it implicitly neglects the fact of star formation (SF) quenching (SFQ) in the centers of LTGs. Extrapolating the fit for the observable star-forming zone of the disk (outside the bulge) inwardly overestimates the true surface brightness of the disk in its SF-quenched central zone. We refer to this effect as Dio. The primary consequence of the neglect of Dio in bulge-disk decomposition studies is the oversubtraction of the disk underneath the bulge, leading to a systematic underestimation of the luminosity of the latter. Framed in the picture of galaxy downsizing and inside-out SFQ, Dio is expected to differentially impact galaxies across redshift and stellar mass M<sub>&sext;</sub>, thus leading to systematic and complex biases in the scatter and slope of various galaxy scaling relations. We conjecture that correction for Dio will lead to a downbending of the bulge vs. super-massive black hole (SMBH) relation for galaxies below log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/Msolar)~10.7. A decreasing M(SMBH)/M<sub>&sext;</sub> ratio with decreasing M<sub>&sext;</sub> would help consistently explain the scarcity and weakness of accretion-powered nuclear activity in low-mass spiral galaxies. A well detectable Dio (~2 r mag) can emerge early on through inward migration of SF clumps from the disk in combination with a strong contrast of emission-line equivalent widths between the quenched proto-bulge and its SF periphery. Spatially resolved studies with the JWST, ELT, and Euclid could therefore offer key insights into the chronology and physical drivers of SFQ in the early phase of galaxy assembly. (abridged)

### 250) [2109.04493](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.04493v3): Spectroscopy of an extreme [OIII] emitting active galactic nucleus at z=3.212: implications for the reionisation era

<p> Mengtao Tang, Daniel P. Stark, Richard S. Ellis, Stéphane Charlot, Anna Feltre, Alice E. Shapley, Ryan Endsley </p>
<p>
Reionisation-era galaxies often display intense nebular emission lines, both in rest-frame optical ([OIII]+Hβ) and ultraviolet (UV; CIII], CIV). How such strong nebular emission is powered remains unclear, with both active galactic nuclei (AGN) and hot stars considered equally viable. The UV continuum slopes of these early systems tend to be very blue (β&lt;-2), reflecting minimal dust obscuration, young ages, and low metallicities. This contrasts with narrow-lined AGN at z~2-3, whose UV slopes are significantly redder (β&gt;-1) than typical star-forming systems in the reionisation era. To investigate the properties of AGN in the reionisation era, we have conducted a search for potential examples of rare analogues with blue continua at intermediate redshift (z~2-3). Our goals are to determine whether AGN with intense line emission and blue continua exist and thereby to establish the range of rest-frame UV and optical line ratios in this population. In this paper we report the detection of a X-ray luminous AGN at z=3.21 (UDS-24561) with extreme [OIII]+Hβ line emission (EW =1300 Å) and a blue UV continuum slope (β=-2.34). MMT/Binospec and Keck/MOSFIRE spectra indicate rest-frame UV line ratios consistent with AGN photoionisation models and rest-frame optical lines with both a narrow component (FWHM =154 km/s) and extended broad wings (FWHM =977 km/s), consistent with outflowing gas. We describe how such objects can be identified in future JWST emission line surveys in the reionisation era, thereby providing a valuable census of AGN activity at z&gt;6 and understanding their contribution to cosmic reionisation.

### 251) [2109.00078](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.00078v1): Do current X-ray observations capture most of the black-hole accretion at high redshifts?

<p> Guang Yang, Vicente Estrada-Carpenter, Casey Papovich, Fabio Vito, Jonelle L. Walsh, Zhiyuan Yao, Feng Yuan </p>
<p>
The cosmic black hole accretion density (BHAD) is critical for our understanding of the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (BHs). However, at high redshifts (z&gt;3), X-ray observations report BHADs significantly (~ 10 times) lower than those predicted by cosmological simulations. It is therefore paramount to constrain the high-z BHAD using independent methods other than direct X-ray detections. The recently established relation between star formation rate and BH accretion rate among bulge-dominated galaxies provides such a chance, as it enables an estimate of the BHAD from the star-formation histories (SFHs) of lower-redshift objects. Using the CANDELS Lyman-α Emission At Reionization (CLEAR) survey, we model the SFHs for a sample of 108 bulge-dominated galaxies at z=0.7-1.5, and further estimate the BHAD contributed by their high-z progenitors. The predicted BHAD at z≈ 4-5 is consistent with the simulation-predicted values, but higher than the X-ray measurements (by ≈3-10 times at z=4-5). Our result suggests that the current X-ray surveys could be missing many heavily obscured Compton-thick active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at high redshifts. However, this BHAD estimation assumes that the high-z progenitors of our z=0.7-1.5 sample remain bulge-dominated where star formation is correlated with BH cold-gas accretion. Alternatively, our prediction could signify a stark decline in the fraction of bulges in high-z galaxies (with an associated drop in BH accretion). JWST and Origins will resolve the discrepancy between our predicted BHAD and the X-ray results by constraining Compton-thick AGN and bulge evolution at high redshifts.

<p>
We present a rest-frame UV-optical stacked spectrum representative of massive quiescent galaxies at 1.0&lt;z&lt;1.3 with log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&gt;10.8. The stack is constructed using VANDELS survey data, combined with new KMOS observations. We apply two independent full-spectral-fitting approaches, measuring a total metallicity, [Z/H]=-0.13±0.08 with Bagpipes, and [Z/H]=0.04±0.14 with Alf, a fall of ~0.2-0.3 dex compared with the local Universe. We also measure an iron abundance, [Fe/H] =-0.18±0.08, a fall of ~0.15 dex compared with the the local Universe. We measure the alpha enhancement via the magnesium abundance, obtaining [Mg/Fe]=0.23±0.12, consistent with similar-mass galaxies in the local Universe, indicating no evolution in the average alpha enhancement of log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=11 quiescent galaxies over the last ~8 Gyr. This suggests the very high alpha enhancements recently reported for several bright z~1-2 quiescent galaxies are due to their extreme masses, log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≳11.5, rather than being typical of the z≳1 population. The metallicity evolution we observe with redshift (falling [Z/H], [Fe/H], constant [Mg/Fe]) is consistent with recent studies. We recover a mean stellar age of 2.5^+0.6_-0.4 Gyr, corresponding to a formation redshift, z_form=2.4^+0.6_-0.3. Recent studies have obtained varying average formation redshifts for z≳1 massive quiescent galaxies, and, as these studies report consistent metallicities, we identify different star-formation-history models as the most likely cause. Larger spectroscopic samples from upcoming ground-based instruments will provide precise constraints on ages and metallicities at z≳1. Combining these with precise JWST z&gt;2 quiescent-galaxy stellar-mass functions will provide an independent test of formation redshifts derived from spectral fitting.

<p>
We present new measurements of rest-UV luminosity functions and angular correlation functions from 4,100,221 galaxies at z~2-7 identified in the Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam survey and CFHT Large-Area U-band Survey. The obtained luminosity functions at z~4-7 cover a very wide UV luminosity range of ~0.002-2000L*uv combined with previous studies, revealing that the dropout luminosity function is a superposition of the AGN luminosity function dominant at Muv&lt;-24 mag and the galaxy luminosity function dominant at Muv&gt;-22 mag, consistent with galaxy fractions based on 1037 spectroscopically-identified sources. Galaxy luminosity functions estimated from the spectroscopic galaxy fractions show the bright end excess beyond the Schechter function at &gt;2sigma levels, which is possibly made by inefficient mass quenching, low dust obscuration, and/or hidden AGN activity. By analyzing the correlation functions at z~2-6 with halo occupation distribution models, we find a weak redshift evolution (within 0.3 dex) of the ratio of the star formation rate (SFR) to the dark matter accretion rate, SFR/(dMh/dt), indicating the almost constant star formation efficiency at z~2-6, as suggested by our earlier work at z~4-7. Meanwhile, the ratio gradually increases with decreasing redshift at z&lt;5 within 0.3 dex, which quantitatively reproduces the redshift evolution of the cosmic SFR density, suggesting that the evolution is primarily driven by the increase of the halo number density due to the structure formation, and the decrease of the accretion rate due to the cosmic expansion. Extrapolating this calculation to higher redshifts assuming the constant efficiency suggests a rapid decrease of the SFR density at z&gt;10 with &prop;10^-0.5(1+z), which will be directly tested with JWST.

<p>
We present deep Keck/MOSFIRE H-band spectroscopic observations covering the [CIII],CIII]λ&lambda;1907,1909 doublet for three z~8 galaxy candidates in the AEGIS field. Along with non-detections in two galaxies, we obtain one of the highest-redshift detections to-date of [CIII]λ1907 for the galaxy AEGIS-33376, finding z<sub>spec</sub>=7.945±0.001. We measure a [CIII]λ1907 flux of 2.24±0.71×10^-18 \mbox erg\mbox s<sup>-1</sup> \mbox cm<sup>2</sup>, corresponding to a rest-frame equivalent width of 20.3±6.5 \unicodex212B for the single line. Given the not very constraining upper limit for CIII]λ1909 based on strong sky-line contamination, we assume a [CIII]λ1907/CIII]λ1909 doublet ratio of 1.5 and infer a total [CIII],CIII]λ&lambda;1907,1909 equivalent width of 33.7± 10.8 \unicodex212B. We repeat the same reductions and analysis on multiple subsets of our raw data divided on the basis of time and observing conditions, verifying that the [CIII]λ1907 emission is present for AEGIS-33376 throughout our observations. We also confirm that the significance of the [CIII]λ1907 detection in different subsets of our data tracks that of brighter emission features detected on the same multi-slit mask. These multiple tests suggest that the observed emission line is real and associated with the z~ 8 target. The strong observed [CIII],CIII]λ&lambda;1907,1909 in AEGIS-33376 likely indicates ISM conditions of low metallicity, high ionization parameter, and a hard ionizing spectrum, although AGN contributions are possible. This single detection represents a sizable increase in the current sample [CIII],CIII]λ&lambda;1907,1909 detections at z&gt;7, while itJWST will provide the first statistical samples of such measurements at these redshifts.

### 255) [2107.03696](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.03696v2): Which molecule traces what: chemical diagnostics of protostellar sources

The physical and chemical conditions in Class 0/I protostars are fundamental in unlocking the protostellar accretion process and its impact on planet formation. The aim is to determine which physical components are traced by different molecules at sub-arcsecond scales (100 - 400 au). We use a suite of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) datasets in Band 6 (1 mm), Band 5 (1.8 mm) and Band 3 (3 mm) at spatial resolutions 0.5 - 3" for 16 protostellar sources. The protostellar envelope is well traced by C^18O, DCO^+ and N<sub>2</sub>D^+, with the freeze-out of CO governing the chemistry at envelope scales. Molecular outflows are seen in classical shock tracers like SiO and SO, but ice-mantle products such as CH_3OH and HNCO released with the shock are also observed. The molecular jet is prominent not only in SiO and SO but also occasionally in H<sub>2</sub>CO. The cavity walls show tracers of UV-irradiation such as C_2H c-C_3H<sub>2</sub> and CN. The hot inner envelope, apart from showing emission from complex organic molecules (COMs), also presents compact emission from small molecules like H<sub>2</sub>S, SO, OCS and H^13CN, most likely related to ice sublimation and high-temperature chemistry. Sub-arcsecond millimeter-wave observations allow to identify those (simple) molecules that best trace each of the physical components of a protostellar system. COMs are found both in the hot inner envelope (high excitation lines) and in the outflows (lower-excitation lines) with comparable abundances. COMs can coexist with hydrocarbons in the same protostellar sources, but they trace different components. In the near future, mid-IR observations with JWST-MIRI will provide complementary information about the hottest gas and the ice mantle content, at unprecedented sensitivity and at resolutions comparable to ALMA for the same sources.

### 256) [2106.04595](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.04595v1): New-generation dust emission templates for star-forming galaxies

<p> Médéric Boquien, Samir Salim </p>
<p>
The IR emission of dust heated by stars provides critical information for galaxy evolution studies. Unfortunately, observations are often limited to the MIR, making templates a necessity. Previously published templates were based on small samples of luminous galaxies, not necessarily representative of normal star-forming galaxies. We construct new dust templates, including instrument-specific relations and software tools that facilitate the estimation of the TIR luminosity and SFR based on one or several fluxes up to z=4. For the first time the templates include a dependence on both TIR luminosity and the sSFR, thereby increasing their reliability and utility. We also provide formulae for calculating TIR luminosities and SFR from JWST F2100W observations at 0&lt;z&lt;2. Our templates are based on 2584 normal star-forming galaxies spanning a wide range of stellar mass and sSFR, including sSFRs typical at higher redshifts. IR spectra and properties are obtained using CIGALE and the Draine & Li (2007) dust models. The photometry from the GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalog is supplemented with 2MASS and H-ATLAS, from FUV to 500 microns. The shape of the dust spectrum varies with TIR luminosity, but also independently with sSFR. Remarkably precise estimates of the dust luminosity are possible with a single band over the rest-frame 12-17 and 55-130 microns. We validate single-band estimates on diverse populations, including local LIRGs, and find no significant systematic errors. Using two or more bands simultaneously yields unbiased estimation of the TIR luminosity even of star-forming dwarfs. We obtain fresh insights regarding the interplay between monochromatic IR luminosities, spectral shapes and physical properties, and construct new templates and estimators of the dust luminosity and SFR. We provide software for generating templates and estimating these quantities based on 1-4 bands up to z=4.

### 257) [2104.08204](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08204v1): Influence of the nano-grain depletion in photon-dominated regions: Application to the gas physics and chemistry in the Horsehead

<p> T. Schirmer, E. Habart, N. Ysard, E. Bron, J. Le Bourlot, L. Verstraete, A. Abergel, A. P. Jones, E. Roueff, F. Le Petit </p>
<p>
The large disparity in physical conditions from the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) to denser clouds such as photon-dominated regions (PDRs) triggers an evolution of the dust properties (i.e. composition, size, and shape). The gas physics and chemistry are tightly connected to these dust properties and are therefore affected by dust evolution and especially the nano-grain depletion in the outer irradiated part of PDRs. We highlight the influence of nano-grain depletion on the gas physics and chemistry in the Horsehead nebula, a prototypical PDR. We used a model for atomic and molecular gas in PDRs, the Meudon PDR code, using diffuse ISM-like dust and Horsehead-like dust to study the influence of nano-grain depletion on the gas physics and chemistry, focusing on the impact on photoelectric heating and H2 formation and, therefore, on the H2 gas lines. We find that nano-grain depletion in the Horsehead strongly affects gas heating through the photoelectric effect and thus the gas temperature and the H2 formation, hence the H -&gt; H2 position. Consequently, the first four pure rotational lines of H2 (e.g. 0-0 S(0), S(1), S(2), and S(3)) vary by a factor of 2 to 14. The 0-0 S(3) line that is often underestimated in models is underestimated even more when taking nano-grain depletion into account due to the decrease in gas heating through the photoelectric effect. This strongly suggests that our understanding of the excitation of H2 and/or of heating processes in the Horsehead, and more generally in PDRs, is still incomplete. Nano-grain depletion in the outer part of the Horsehead has a strong influence on several gas tracers that will be prominent in JWST observations of irradiated clouds. We therefore need to take this depletion into account in order to improve our understanding of the Horsehead, and more generally PDRs, and to contribute to the optimal scientific return of the mission.

<p>
The chemical inventory of planets is determined by the physical and chemical processes that govern the early phases of star formation. The aim is to investigate N-bearing complex organic molecules towards two Class 0 protostars (B1-c and S68N) at millimetre wavelengths with ALMA. Next, the results of the detected N-bearing species are compared with those of O-bearing species for the same and other sources. ALMA observations in Band 6 (~ 1 mm) and Band 5 (~ 2 mm) are studied at ~ 0.5" resolution, complemented by Band 3 (~ 3 mm) data in a ~ 2.5" beam. NH2CHO, C2H5CN, HNCO, HN13CO, DNCO, CH3CN, CH2DCN, and CHD2CN are identified towards the investigated sources. Their abundances relative to CH3OH and HNCO are similar for the two sources, with column densities that are typically an order of magnitude lower than those of O-bearing species. The largest variations, of an order of magnitude, are seen for NH2CHO abundance ratios with respect to HNCO and CH3OH and do not correlate with the protostellar luminosity. In addition, within uncertainties, the N-bearing species have similar excitation temperatures to those of O-bearing species (~ 100 ~ 300 K). The similarity of most abundances with respect to HNCO, including those of CH2DCN and CHD2CN, hints at a shared chemical history, especially the high D/H ratio in cold regions prior to star formation. However, some of the variations in abundances may reflect the sensitivity of the chemistry to local conditions such as temperature (e.g. NH2CHO), while others may arise from differences in the emitting areas of the molecules linked to their different binding energies in the ice. The two sources discussed here add to the small number of sources with such a detailed chemical analysis on Solar System scales. Future JWST data will allow a direct comparison between the ice and gas abundances of N-bearing species.

### 259) [2103.16571](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.16571v1): Galaxy Stellar Mass Functions from z~10 to z~6 using the Deepest Spitzer/IRAC Data: No Significant Evolution in the Stellar-to-Halo Mass Ratio of Galaxies in the First Gyr of Cosmic Time

<p> Mauro Stefanon, Rychard J. Bouwens, Ivo Labbé, Garth D. Illingworth, Valentino Gonzalez, Pascal A. Oesch </p>

We present new stellar mass functions at z~6, z~7, z~8, z~9 and, for the first time, z~10, constructed from ~800 Lyman-Break galaxies previously identified over the XDF/UDF, parallels and the five CANDELS fields. Our study is distinctive due to (1) the much deeper (~200 hour) wide-area Spitzer/IRAC imaging at 3.6μm and 4.5μm from the GOODS Re-ionization Era wide Area Treasury from Spitzer (GREATS) program and (2) consideration of z~6-10 sources over a 3× larger area than previous HST+Spitzer studies. The Spitzer/IRAC data enable ≥2σ rest-frame optical detections for an unprecedented 50&percnt; of galaxies down to a stellar mass limit of ~10^8M<sub>&odot;</sub> across all redshifts. Schechter fits to our volume densities suggest a combined evolution in characteristic mass M^* and normalization factor φ^* between z~6 and z~8. The stellar mass density (SMD) increases by ~1000× in the ~500 Myr between z~10 and z~6, with indications of a steeper evolution between z~10 and z~8, similar to the previously-reported trend of the star-formation rate density. Strikingly, abundance matching to the Bolshoi-Planck simulation indicates halo mass densities evolving at approximately the same rate as the SMD between z~10 and z~4. Our results show that the stellar-to-halo mass ratios, a proxy for the star-formation efficiency, do not change significantly over the huge stellar mass build-up occurred from z~10 to z~6, indicating that the assembly of stellar mass closely mirrors the build-up in halo mass in the first ~1 Gyr of cosmic history. JWST is poised to extend these results into the "first galaxy" epoch at z≳10.

### 260) [2102.08956](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.08956v1): Infrared emission of z ~ 6 galaxies: AGN imprints

We investigate the infrared (IR) emission of high-redshift (z~ 6), highly star-forming ( SFR &gt; 100 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1) galaxies, with/without Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), using a suite of cosmological simulations featuring dust radiative transfer. Synthetic Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) are used to quantify the relative contribution of stars/AGN to dust heating. In dusty (M_d≳ 3× 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) galaxies, ≳ 50-90 &percnt; of the UV radiation is obscured by dust inhomogeneities on scales ≳ 100 pc. In runs with AGN, a clumpy, warm (≈ 250 K) dust component co-exists with a colder (≈ 60 K) and more diffuse one, heated by stars. Warm dust provides up to 50 &percnt; of the total IR luminosity, but only ≲ 0.1 &percnt; of the total mass content. The AGN boosts the MIR flux by 10-100 × with respect to star forming galaxies, without significantly affecting the FIR. Our simulations successfully reproduce the observed SED of bright (M_UV~ -26) z~ 6 quasars, and show that these objects are part of complex, dust-rich merging systems, containing multiple sources (accreting BHs and/or star forming galaxies) in agreement with recent HST and ALMA observations. Our results show that the proposed ORIGINS missions will be able to investigate the MIR properties of dusty star forming galaxies and to obtain good quality spectra of bright quasars at z~ 6. Finally, the MIR-to-FIR flux ratio of faint (M_UV~ -24) AGN is &gt;10× higher than for normal star forming galaxies. This implies that combined JWST/ORIGINS/ALMA observations will be crucial to identify faint and/or dust-obscured AGN in the distant Universe.

### 261) [2101.01989](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.01989v2): OH mid-infrared emission as a diagnostic of H<sub>2</sub>O UV photodissociation. I. Model and application to the HH 211 shock

<p> Benoît Tabone, Marc C. van Hemert, Ewine F. van Dishoeck, John H. Black </p>
<p>
Water is an important molecule in interstellar and circumstellar environments. Previous observations of mid-infrared rotational lines of OH suggest that these lines may be used to probe the photodissociation of water. In this work, cross sections for the photodissociation of H<sub>2</sub>O resolving the state of the OH fragment are collected and incorporated in a new molecular excitation code called GROSBETA, which includes radiative pumping, collisional (de)excitation, and prompt emission (i.e., following the production of OH in excited states). We find that the OH rotational line intensities in the range 9-16μm, covering rotational transitions with N_up=18 to 45, are proportional to the column density of H<sub>2</sub>O photodissociated per second by photons in the range 114-143nm and do not depend on other local properties. Provided an independent measurement of the column density of water is available, the strength of the local UV radiation field can be deduced with good accuracy. In contrast, the OH lines at longer far-infrared wavelengths are primarily produced by IR radiative pumping and collisions. Our model successfully reproduces the OH mid-IR lines in the 10-16μm range observed by Spitzer toward the tip of the HH 211 bow-shock and shows that the jet shock irradiates its surroundings, exposing H<sub>2</sub>O to a UV photon flux that is about 5 × 10^3 times larger than the standard interstellar radiation field. We also find that chemical pumping by the reaction H<sub>2</sub> + O may supplement the excitation of lines in the range 16-30μm. The mid-infrared lines of OH constitute a powerful diagnostic for inferring the photodissociation rate of water and thus the UV field water is exposed to. Future JWST-MIRI observations will be able to map the photodestruction rate of H<sub>2</sub>O in various dense and irradiated environments and provide robust estimates of the local UV radiation field.

### 262) [2009.08458](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08458v2): The MUSE Deep Lensed Field on the Hubble Frontier Field MACS~J0416

<p>
Context: A census of faint and tiny star forming complexes at high redshift is key to improving our understanding of reionizing sources, galaxy growth and the formation of globular clusters. Aims: We present the MUSE Deep Lensed Field (MDLF) program. Methods: We describe Deep MUSE observations of 17.1 hours integration on a single pointing over the Hubble Frontier Field galaxy cluster MACS~J0416. Results: We confirm spectroscopic redshifts for all 136 multiple images of 48 source galaxies at 0.9&lt;z&lt;6.2. Within those galaxies, we securely identify 182 multiple images of 66 galaxy components that we use to constrain our lens model. We identify 116 clumps belonging to background high-z galaxies; the majority of them are multiple images and span magnitude, size and redshift intervals of [-18,-10], [~400-3] parsec and 1&lt;z&lt;6.6, respectively, with the most magnified ones probing possible single gravitationally bound star clusters. The depth of the MDLF combined with lensing magnification lead us to reach a detection limit for unresolved emission lines of a few 10^-20 erg/s/cm2, after correction for lensing magnification. Ultraviolet high-ionization metal lines (and HeII1640) are detected with S/N&gt;10 for individual objects down to de-lensed magnitude 28-30 suggesting that they are common in such faint sources. Conclusions:Deep MUSE observations, in combination with existing HST imaging, allowed us to:(1) confirm redshifts for extremely faint high-z sources;(2) peer into their internal clumps (down to 100-200 pc scale);(3) in some cases break down such clumps into bound star clusters (&lt;20 pc scale);(4) double the number of constraints for the lens model,reaching an unprecedented set of 182 bona-fide multiple images and confirming up to 213 galaxy cluster members. These results demonstrate the power that JWST and future ELTs will have when combined to study gravitational telescopes.[abridged]

<p>
We present 0.2arcsec-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations at 870 μm in a stellar mass-selected sample of 85 massive (M_star&gt;10^11~M<sub>&odot;</sub>) star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at z=1.9-2.6 in the 3D-HST/CANDELS fields of UDS and GOODS-S. We measure the effective radius of the rest-frame far-infrared (FIR) emission for 62 massive SFGs. They are distributed over wide ranges of FIR size from R_e,FIR=0.4 kpc to R_e,FIR=6 kpc. The effective radius of the FIR emission is smaller by a factor of 2.3^+1.9_-1.0 than the effective radius of the optical emission and by a factor of 1.9^+1.9_-1.0 smaller than the half-mass radius. Even with taking into account potential extended components, the FIR size would change by ~10%. By combining the spatial distributions of the FIR and optical emission, we investigate how galaxies change the effective radius of the optical emission and the stellar mass within a radius of 1 kpc, M_1kpc. The compact starburst puts most of massive SFGs on the mass&ndash;size relation for quiescent galaxies (QGs) at z~2 within 300 Myr if the current star formation activity and its spatial distribution are maintained. We also find that within 300 Myr, ~38% of massive SFGs can reach the central mass of M_1kpc=10^10.5~M<sub>&odot;</sub>, which is around the boundary between massive SFGs and QGs. These results suggest an outside-in transformation scenario in which a dense core is formed at the center of a more extended disk, likely via dissipative in-disk inflows. Synchronized observations at ALMA 870 μm and JWST 3-4 μm will explicitly verify this scenario.

### 264) [2008.12798](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.12798v1): Theoretical clues about dust accumulation and galaxy obscuration at high and low redshift

<p> J. H. Barbosa-Santos, Gastão B. Lima Neto, Amancio C. S. Friaça </p>
<p>
Since the epoch of cosmic star formation peak at z ~ 2, most of it is obscured in high mass galaxies, while in low mass galaxies the radiation escapes unobstructed. During the reionization epoch, the presence of evolved, dust obscured galaxies are a challenge to galaxy formation and evolution models. By means of a chemodynamical evolution model, we investigate the star formation and dust production required to build up the bulk of dust in galaxies with initial baryonic mass ranging from 7.5 × 10^7~M<sub>&odot;</sub> to 2.0 × 10^12~M<sub>&odot;</sub>. The star formation efficiency was also chosen to represent the star formation rate from irregular dwarf to giant elliptical galaxies. We adopted a dust coagulation efficiency from \citep[][Case A]dwek1998evolution as well as a lower efficiency one (Case B), about five times smaller than Case A. All possible combination of these parameters was computed, summing forty different scenarios. We find that in high stellar formation systems the dust accretion in ISM rules over stellar production before the star formation peak, making these systems almost insensible to dust coagulation efficiency. In low star formation systems, the difference between Case A and B lasts longer, mainly in small galaxies. Thus, small irregular galaxies should be the best place to discriminate different dust sources. In our observational sample, taken from the literature, dust-to-gas ratio tends to be more spread only than dust mass, for both stellar mass and star formation rate. Dust-to-gas vs. dust-to-star diagram is a good tracer for both galaxy and dust evolution, due to the link between gas, star, dust and star formation rate. However, the model do not constrain simultaneously all this quantities. The new generation facilities (such as JWST, ELT, VLT and SPICA) will be indispensable to constrain dust formation across the cosmic time.

### 265) [2008.11208](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.11208v2): Completing the Census of AGN in GOODS-S/HUDF: New Ultra-Deep Radio Imaging and Predictions for JWST

<p> Stacey Alberts, Wiphu Rujopakarn, George Rieke, Preshanth Jagannathan, Kristina Nyland </p>
<p>
A global understanding of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and their host galaxies hinges on completing a census of AGN activity without selection biases down to the low-luminosity regime. Toward that goal, we identify AGN within faint radio populations at cosmic noon selected from new ultra-deep, high resolution imaging from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array at 6 and 3 GHz. These radio data are spatially coincident with the ultra-deep legacy surveys in the GOODS-S/HUDF region, particularly the unparalleled Chandra 7 Ms X-ray imaging. Combined, these datasets provide a unique basis for a thorough census of AGN, allowing simultaneous identification via (1) high X-ray luminosity; (2) hard X-ray spectra; (3) excess X-ray relative to 6 GHz; (4) mid-IR colors; (5) SED fitting; (6) radio excess via the radio-infrared relation; (7) flat radio spectra via multi-band radio; and (8) optical spectroscopy. We uncover AGN in fully half our faint radio sample, indicating a source density of one AGN arcmin^-2, with a similar number of radio-undetected AGN identified via X-ray over the same area. Our radio-detected AGN are majority radio-quiet, with radio emission consistent with being powered predominantly by star formation. Nevertheless, we find AGN radio signatures in our sample: ~12&percnt; with radio excess indicating radio-loud activity and ~16&percnt; of radio-quiet AGN candidates with flat or inverted radio spectra. The latter is a lower limit, pending our upcoming deeper 3 GHz survey. Finally, despite these extensive datasets, this work is likely still missing heavily obscured AGN. We discuss in detail this elusive population and the prospects for completing our AGN census with JWST/MIRI.

### 266) [2007.13557](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.13557v1): Infrared Spectra of Pyroxenes (Crystalline Chain Silicates) at Room Temperature

<p> J. E. Bowey, A. M. Hofmeister, E. Keppel </p>
<p>
Pyroxene crystals are common in meteorites but few compositions have been recognized in astronomical environments. We present quantitative room-temperature spectra of 17 Mg&ndash; Fe&ndash; and Ca&ndash;bearing ortho- and clinopyroxenes, and a Ca-pyroxenoid in order to discern trends indicative of crystal structure and a wide range of composition. Data are produced using a Diamond Anvil Cell: our band strengths are up to 6 times higher than those measured in KBr or polyethylene dispersions, which include variations in path length (from grain size) and surface reflections that are not addressed in data processing. Pyroxenes have varied spectra: only two bands, at 10.22~μm and 15.34~μm in enstatite (En_99), are common to all. Peak-wavelengths generally increase as Mg is replaced by Ca or Fe. However, two bands in MgFe-pyroxenes shift to shorter wavelengths as the Fe component increases from 0 to 60 per cent. A high-intensity band shifts from 11.6~μm to 11.2~μm and remains at 11.2~μm as Fe increases to 100~per~cent; it resembles an astronomical feature normally identified with olivine or forsterite. The distinctive pyroxene bands between 13~ and 16~μm show promise for their identification in MIRI spectra obtained with JWST. The many pyroxene bands between 40 and 80~μm could be diagnositic of silicate mineralogy if data were obtained with the proposed SPICA telescope. Our data indicate that comparison between room-temperature laboratory bands for enstatite and cold ~ 10-K astronomical dust features at wavelengths ≳ 28~μm can result in the identification of (Mg,Fe)- pyroxenes that contain 7&ndash;15 % less Fe&ndash; than their true values because some temperature shifts mimic some compositional shifts. Therefore some astronomical silicates may contain more Fe, and less Mg, than previously thought.

### 267) [2005.06784](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06784v1): Complex organic molecules in low-mass protostars on solar system scales &ndash; I. Oxygen-bearing species

<p>
Complex organic molecules (COMs) are thought to form on icy dust grains in the earliest phase of star formation. The evolution of these COMs from the youngest Class 0/I protostellar phases toward the more evolved Class II phase is still not fully understood. Since planet formation seems to start early, and mature disks are too cold for characteristic COM emission lines, studying the inventory of COMs on solar system scales in the Class 0/I stage is relevant. ALMA Band 3 (3 mm) and Band 6 (1 mm) observations are obtained of seven Class 0 protostars in the Perseus and Serpens star-forming regions. By modeling the inner protostellar region using 'LTE' models, the excitation temperature and column densities are determined for several O-bearing COMs. B1-c, B1-bS, and Serpens S68N show COM emission, i.e, three out of the seven sources. No clear correlation seems to exist between the occurrence of COMs and source luminosity. The abundances of several COMs with respect to CH3OH are remarkably similar for the three COM-rich sources, and to IRAS 16293-2422B and HH 212. For other COMs the abundances differ by up to an order of magnitude, indicating that local source conditions are case determining. B1-c hosts a cold (T_ex≈60 K), more extended component of COM emission with a column density of typically a few % of the warm/hot (T_ex~ 200 K), central component. A D/H ratio of 1-3 % is derived based on the CH2DOH/CH3OH ratio suggesting a temperature of ~15~K during the formation of methanol. This ratio is consistent with other low-mass protostars. Future mid-infrared facilities such as JWST/MIRI will be essential to directly observe COM ices. Combining this with a larger sample of COM-rich sources with ALMA will allow for directly linking ice and gas-phase abundances in order to constrain the routes that produce and maintain chemical complexity during the star formation process.

### 268) [2003.01845](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.01845v1): Molecule formation in dust-poor irradiated jets I. Stationary disk winds

<p> B. Tabone, B. Godard, G. Pineau des Forêts, S. Cabrit, E. F. van Dishoeck </p>
<p>
Recent ALMA observations suggest that the highest velocity part of molecular protostellar jets are launched from the dust-sublimation regions of the accretion disks (&lt;0.3 au). However, formation and survival of molecules in inner protostellar disk winds, in the presence of a harsh FUV radiation field and the absence of dust, remain unexplored. We aim at determining if simple molecules can be synthesized and spared in fast and collimated dust-free disk winds or if a fraction of dust is necessary to explain the observed molecular abundances. This work is based on the Paris-Durham shock code designed to model irradiated environments. Fundamental properties of the dust-free chemistry are investigated from single point models. A laminar 1D disk wind model is then built using a parametric flow geometry. This model includes time-dependent chemistry and the attenuation of the radiation field by gas-phase photoprocesses. We show that a small fraction of H2 (&lt; 1e-2), primarily formed through the H- route, can efficiently initiate molecule synthesis such as CO and SiO above TK ~ 800 K. The attenuation of the radiation field by atomic species (eg. C, Si, S) proceeds through continuum self-shielding. This process ensures efficient formation of CO, OH, SiO, H2O through neutral-neutral reactions, and the survival of these molecules. Class 0 dust-free winds with high mass-loss rates (M&#775;_w &gt; 2e-6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr) are predicted to be rich in molecules if warm (TK &gt; 800 K). The molecular content of disk winds is very sensitive to the presence of dust and a mass-fraction of surviving dust as small as 1e-5 significantly increases the H2O and SiO abundances. Chemistry of high-velocity jets is a powerful tool to probe their content in dust and uncover their launching point. Models of internal shocks are required to fully exploit the current (sub-)millimeter observations and prepare future JWST observations.

### 269) [2001.03498](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.03498v2): The Faint Host Galaxies of C IV Absorbers at z &gt; 5

<p> Kristian Finlator, Caitlin Doughty, Zheng Cai, Gonzalo Díaz </p>
<p>
We explore the expected galaxy environments of CIV absorbers at z&gt;5 using the Technicolor Dawn simulations. These simulations reproduce the observed history of reionization, the z~6 galaxy stellar mass function, the Lyα forest transmission at z&gt;5, and the SiIV column density distribution (CDD) at z~5.5. Nonetheless, the CIV CDD remains underproduced. Comparison with observed CII/SiII equivalent width ratios and the CII line incidence suggests that a low carbon yield accounts for some, but not all, of the CIV discrepancy. Alternatively, a density-bounded escape scenario could harden the metagalactic ionizing background more dramatically even than binary stellar evolution, boosting the CIV CDD into near-agreement with observations. In this case galaxies ionize more efficiently and fewer are required to host a given high-ionization absorber. Absorbers' environments therefore constrain ionizing escape. Regardless of the escape scenario, galaxies correlate with CIV absorbers out to 300 proper kpc (pkpc). The correlation strengthens independently with galaxy luminosity and CIV column density. Around strong systems (log(N_CIV/cm<sup>2</sup>)&gt;14)), the overdensity of galaxies with M_UV&lt;-18 or log(L_Lyα/erg s<sup>-1</sup>) &gt; 41.9 declines from 200-300 within 100 pkpc to 40-60 within 250 pkpc. The previously-suggested association between strong CIV absorbers and Lyα emitters at z&gt;5 is not expected. It may arise if both populations inhabit large-scale voids, but for different reasons. Although most neighboring galaxies are too faint for HST, JWST will, with a single pointing, identify ~10 neighboring galaxies per strong CIV absorber at z &gt; 5. Ground-based tests of these predictions are possible via deep surveys for Lyα emission using integral field units.

### 270) [1911.12372](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.12372v1): Expanding the Y Dwarf Census with Spitzer Follow-up of the Coldest CatWISE Solar Neighborhood Discoveries

<p>
We present Spitzer 3.6μm and 4.5μm follow-up of 170 candidate extremely cool brown dwarfs newly discovered via the combination of WISE and NEOWISE imaging at 3-5μm. CatWISE, a joint analysis of archival WISE and NEOWISE data, has improved upon the motion measurements of AllWISE by leveraging a &gt;10× time baseline enhancement, from 0.5 years (AllWISE) to 6.5 years (CatWISE). As a result, CatWISE motion selection has yielded a large sample of previously unrecognized brown dwarf candidates, many of which have archival detections exclusively in the WISE 4.6μm (W2) channel, suggesting that they could be both exceptionally cold and nearby. Where these objects go undetected in WISE W1 (3.4μm), Spitzer can provide critically informative detections at 3.6μm. Of our motion-confirmed discoveries, seventeen have a best-fit Spitzer [3.6]-[4.5] color most consistent with spectral type Y. CWISEP J144606.62-231717.8 (μ≈ 1.3''/yr) is likely the reddest, and therefore potentially coldest, member of our sample with a very uncertain [3.6]-[4.5] color of 3.71 ± 0.44 magnitudes. We also highlight our highest proper motion discovery, WISEA J153429.75-104303.3, with μ≈ 2.7''/yr. Given that the prior list of confirmed and presumed Y dwarfs consists of just 27 objects, the Spitzer follow-up presented in this work has substantially expanded the sample of identified Y dwarfs. Our new discoveries thus represent significant progress toward understanding the bottom of the substellar mass function, investigating the diversity of the Y dwarf population, and selecting optimal brown dwarf targets for JWST spectroscopy.

### 271) [1909.07323](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07323v2): Surprisingly Strong K-band Emission Found in Low Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei

<p> Antoine Dumont, Anil Seth, Jay Strader, Jenny E. Greene, Leonard Burtscher, Nadine Neumayer </p>
<p>
We examine the near-infrared (NIR) emission from low-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs). Our galaxy sample includes 15 objects with detected 2-10 keV X-ray emission, dynamical black hole mass estimates from the literature, and available Gemini/NIFS integral field spectroscopy (IFU) data. We find evidence for red continuum components at the center of most galaxies, consistent with the hot dust emission seen in higher luminosity AGN. We decompose the spectral data cubes into a stellar and continuum component, assuming the continuum component comes from thermal emission from hot dust. We detect nuclear thermal emission in 14 out of 15 objects. This emission causes weaker CO absorption lines and redder continuum (2.05-2.28\:μm) in our K-band data, as expected from hot dust around an AGN. The NIR emission is clearly correlated with the 2-10 keV X-ray flux, with a Spearman coefficient of r_spearman=0.69 suggesting a &gt;99&percnt; significance of correlation, providing further evidence of an AGN origin. Our sample has typical X-ray and NIR fluxes 3-4 orders of magnitude less luminous than previous work studying the NIR emission from AGN. We find that the ratio of NIR to X-ray emission increases towards lower Eddington ratios. The NIR emission in our sample is often brighter than the X-ray emission, with our K-band AGN luminosities comparable to or greater than the 2-10 keV X-ray luminosities in all objects with Eddington ratios below 0.01&percnt;. The nature of this LLAGN NIR emission remains unclear, with one possibility being an increased contribution from jet emission at these low luminosities. These observations suggest JWST will be a useful tool for detecting the lowest luminosity AGN.

### 272) [1908.10883](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.10883v2): Hubble Space Telescope Observations of Mira Variables in the Type Ia Supernova Host NGC 1559: An Alternative Candle to Measure the Hubble Constant

<p>
We present year-long, near-infrared Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 observations used to search for Mira variables in NGC 1559, the host galaxy of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2005df. This is the first dedicated search for Miras, highly-evolved low-mass stars, in a SN Ia host and subsequently the first calibration of the SN Ia luminosity using Miras in a role historically played by Cepheids. We identify a sample of 115 O-rich Miras with P &lt; 400 days based on their light curve properties. We find that the scatter in the Mira Period-Luminosity Relation (PLR) is comparable to Cepheid PLRs seen in SN Ia supernova host galaxies. Using a sample of O-rich Miras discovered in NGC 4258 with HST F160W and its maser distance, we measure a distance modulus for NGC 1559 of mu1559 = 31.41 +/- 0.050 (statistical) +/- 0.060 (systematic) mag. Based on the light curve of the normal, well-observed, low-reddening SN 2005df, we obtain a measurement of the fiducial SN Ia absolute magnitude of MB0 = -19.27 +/- 0.13 mag. With the Hubble diagram of SNe Ia we find H0 = 72.7 +/- 4.6 kms-1 Mpc-1. Combining the calibration from the NGC 4258 megamaser and the Large Magellanic Cloud detached eclipsing binaries gives a best value of H0 = 73.3 +/- 4.0 km s-1 Mpc-1. This result is within 1-sigma of the Hubble constant derived using Cepheids and multiple calibrating SNe Ia. This is the first of four expected calibrations of the SN Ia luminosity from Miras which should reduce the error in H0 via Miras to ~3%. In light of the present Hubble tension and JWST, Miras have utility in the extragalactic distance scale to check Cepheid distances or calibrate nearby SNe in early-type host galaxies that would be unlikely targets for Cepheid searches.

### 273) [1908.01438](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01438v1): Galaxy evolution and radiative properties in the early Universe: multi-wavelength analysis in cosmological simulations

<p> Shohei Arata, Hidenobu Yajima, Kentaro Nagamine, Yuexing Li, Sadegh Khochfar </p>
<p>
Recent observations have successfully detected UV or infrared flux from galaxies at the epoch of reionization. However, the origin of their radiative properties has not been fully understood yet. Combining cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and radiative transfer calculations, we present theoretical predictions of multi-wavelength radiative properties of the first galaxies at z=6-15. We find that most of the gas and dust are ejected from star-forming regions due to supernova (SN) feedback, which allows UV photons to escape. We show that the peak of SED rapidly shifts between UV and infrared wavelengths on a timescale of 100 Myr due to intermittent star formation and feedback. When dusty gas covers the star-forming regions, the galaxies become bright in the observed-frame sub-millimeter wavelengths. In addition, we find that the escape fraction of ionizing photons also changes between 1-40% at z&gt;10. The mass fraction of HII region changes with the star formation history, resulting in the fluctuations of metal lines and Lyman-alpha line luminosities. In the starbursting phase of galaxies with the halo mass ~ 10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub> (10^12 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), the simulated galaxy has L_[O III] ~ 10^42  (10^43)  erg s<sup>-1</sup>, which is consistent with the observed star-forming galaxies at z&gt;7. Our simulations suggest that deep [C II] observation with ALMA can trace the distribution of neutral gas extending over ~ 20 physical kpc. We also find that the luminosity ratio L_[O III]/L_[C II] decreases with bolometric luminosity due to metal enrichment. Our simulations show that the combination of multi-wavelength observations by ALMA and JWST will be able to reveal the multi-phase ISM structure and the transition from starbursting to outflowing phases of high-z galaxies.

<p> Peter Senchyna, Daniel P. Stark, Jacopo Chevallard, Stéphane Charlot, Tucker Jones, Alba Vidal García </p>
<p>
Ultraviolet (UV) observations of local star-forming galaxies have begun to establish an empirical baseline for interpreting the rest-UV spectra of reionization-era galaxies. However, existing high-ionization emission line measurements at z&gt;6 (W_C IV, 0 ≳ 20 Å) are uniformly stronger than observed locally (W_C IV, 0 ≲ 2 Å), likely due to the relatively high metallicities (Z/Z<sub>&odot;</sub> &gt; 0.1) typically probed by UV surveys of nearby galaxies. We present new HST/COS spectra of six nearby (z&lt;0.01) extremely metal-poor galaxies (XMPs, Z/Z<sub>&odot;</sub> ≲ 0.1) targeted to address this limitation and provide constraints on the highly-uncertain ionizing spectra powered by low-metallicity massive stars. Our data reveal a range of spectral features, including one of the most prominent nebular C IV doublets yet observed in local star-forming systems and strong He II emission. Using all published UV observations of local XMPs to-date, we find that nebular C IV emission is ubiquitous in very high specific star formation rate systems at low metallicity, but still find equivalent widths smaller than those measured in individual lensed systems at z&gt;6. Our moderate-resolution HST/COS data allow us to conduct an analysis of the stellar winds in a local nebular C IV emitter, which suggests that some of the tension with z&gt;6 data may be due to existing local samples not yet probing sufficiently high α/Fe abundance ratios. Our results indicate that C IV emission can play a crucial role in the JWST and ELT era by acting as an accessible signpost of very low metallicity (Z/Z<sub>&odot;</sub> &lt; 0.1) massive stars in assembling reionization-era systems.

<p>
Massive 10^6-10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> black holes (BHs) are ubiquitous in local galactic nuclei. They were common by the time the Universe is several Gyr old, and many of them were in place within the first 1~Gyr after the Big Bang. Their quick assembly has been attributed to mechanisms such as the rapid collapse of gas into the nuclei of early protogalaxies, accretion and mergers of stellar-mass BHs accompanying structure formation at early times, and the runaway collapse of early, ultra-dense stellar clusters. The origin of the early massive BHs remains an intriguing and long-standing unsolved puzzle in astrophysics. Here we discuss strategies for discerning between BH seeding models using electromagnetic observations. We argue that the most direct answers will be obtained through detection of BHs with masses M&lt;10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at redshifts z&gt;10, where we expect them to first form. Reaching out to these redshifts and down to these masses is crucial, because BHs are expected to lose the memory of their initial assembly by the time they grow well above 10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and are incorporated into higher-mass galaxies. The best way to detect 10^4-10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> BHs at high redshifts is by a sensitive X-ray survey. Critical constraining power is augmented by establishing the properties and the environments of their host galaxies in deep optical/IR imaging surveys. Required OIR data can be obtained with the JWST and WFIRST missions. The required X-ray flux limits (down to 10^-19 erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup>) are accessible only with a next-generation X-ray observatory which has both high (sub-1") angular resolution and high throughput. A combination of deep X-ray and OIR surveys will be capable of probing several generic markers of the BH seed scenarios, and resolving the long-stanging puzzle of their origin. These electromagnetic observations are also highly synergistic with the information from LISA on high-z BH mergers.

### 276) [1809.08077](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.08077v1): Star Formation and Molecular Gas in Extremely Metal-poor Galaxies: Insights from the Thermal Balance in the Neutral Gas

<p> Vianney Lebouteiller </p>
<p>
The apparent lack of cold molecular gas in blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies is at variance with their intense star-formation episode. The CO molecule, often used a tracer of H2 through a conversion function, is selectively photodissociated in dust-poor environments and, as a result, a potentially large fraction of H2 is expected to reside in the so-called CO-dark gas, where it could be traced instead by infrared cooling lines [CI], [CII], and [OI]. Although the fraction of CO-dark gas to total molecular gas is expected to be relatively large in metal-poor galaxies, many uncertainties remain due to the difficulty in identifying the main heating mechanism associated to the cooling lines observed in such galaxies. Investigations of the Herschel Dwarf Galaxy Survey show that the heating mechanism in the neutral gas of BCDs cannot be dominated by the photoelectric effect on dust grains below some threshold metallicity, implying that other heating mechanisms need to be invoked, along with a new interpretation of the corresponding infrared line diagnostics. In the study presented here and in Lebouteiller et al. 2017, we use optical and infrared lines to constrain the physical conditions in the HII region + HI region of the BCD IZw18 (18Mpc; 2% solar metallicity) within a consistent photoionization and photodissociation model. We show that the HI region is entirely heated by a single ultraluminous X-ray source with important consequences on the applicability of [CII] to trace the star-formation rate and to trace the CO-dark gas. We derive stringent upper limits on the size of H2 clumps that may be detected in the future with JWST and IRAM/NOEMA. We also show that the nature of the X-ray source can be inferred from the corresponding signatures in the ISM. Finally we speculate that star formation may be quenched in extremely metal-poor dwarf galaxies due to X-ray photoionization.

<p>
We present James Clerk Maxwell Telescope Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array 2 (SCUBA-2) 850 & 450 μm observations (σ_850~0.5 mJy, σ_450~5 mJy) of the HS1549+19 and HS1700+64 survey fields containing two of the largest known galaxy over-densities at z=2.85 and 2.30, respectively. We detect 56 sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs) with SNR &gt; 4 over ~ 50 arcmin<sup>2</sup> at 850 μm with flux densities of 3 - 17 mJy. The number counts indicate over-densities in the 3-arcmin diameter core region (~ 1.5 Mpc at z=2.5) of 6^+4_-2× (HS1549) and 4^+6_-2× (HS1700) compared to blank field surveys. Within these core regions, we spectroscopically confirm that approximately one third of the SMGs lie at the protocluster redshifts for both HS1549 and HS1700. We use statistical identifications of other SMGs in the wider fields to constrain an additional four candidate protocluster members in each system. We combine multi wavelength estimates of the star-formation rates (SFRs) from Lyman-break dropout- and narrowband-selected galaxies, and the SCUBA-2 SMGs, to estimate total SFRs of 12,500±2800 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1 (4900±1200 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1) in HS1549 (HS1700), and SFR densities (SFRDs) within the central 1.5-Mpc diameter of each protocluster to be 3000±900 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1 Mpc^-3 (1300±400 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1 Mpc^-3) in the HS1549 (HS1700) protocluster, ~10^4× larger than the global SFRDs found at their respective epochs, due to the concentration of star-forming galaxies in the small volume of the dense cluster cores. Our results suggest centrally concentrated starbursts within protoclusters may be a relatively common scenario for the build up of mass in rich clusters assembling at z≳2.

### 278) [1807.05784](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.05784v2): Modelling mid-infrared molecular emission lines from T Tauri stars

<p> P. Woitke, M. Min, W. -F. Thi, C. Roberts, A. Carmona, I. Kamp, F. Menard, C. Pinte </p>
<p>
We introduce a new modelling framework called FLiTs to simulate infrared line emission spectra from protoplanetary discs. This paper focuses on the mid-IR spectral region between 9.7 um to 40 um for T Tauri stars. The generated spectra contain several tens of thousands of molecular emission lines of H2O, OH, CO, CO2, HCN, C2H2, H2 and a few other molecules, as well as the forbidden atomic emission lines of SI, SII, SIII, SiII, FeII, NeII, NeIII, ArII and ArIII. In contrast to previously published works, we do not treat the abundances of the molecules nor the temperature in the disc as free parameters, but use the complex results of detailed 2D ProDiMo disc models concerning gas and dust temperature structure, and molecular concentrations. FLiTs computes the line emission spectra by ray tracing in an efficient, fast and reliable way. The results are broadly consistent with R=600 Spitzer/IRS observational data of T Tauri stars concerning line strengths, colour, and line ratios. In order to achieve that agreement, however, we need to assume either a high gas/dust mass ratio of order 1000, or the presence of illuminated disc walls at distances of a few au. The molecules in these walls cannot be photo-dissociated easily by UV because of the large densities in the walls which favour their re-formation. Most observable molecular emission lines are found to be optically thick, rendering a standard analysis with column densities difficult. We find that the difference between gas and dust temperatures in the disc surface is important for the line formation. We briefly discuss the effects of C/O ratio and choice of chemical rate network on these results. Our analysis offers new ways to infer the chemical and temperature structure of T Tauri discs from future JWST/MIRI observations, and to possibly detect secondary illuminated disc walls based on their specific mid-IR molecular signature.

<p>
Based on the 850 μm dust continuum data from SCUBA-2 at James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), we compare overall properties of Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (PGCCs) in the λ Orionis cloud to those of PGCCs in the Orion A and B clouds. The Orion A and B clouds are well known active star-forming regions, while the λ Orionis cloud has a different environment as a consequence of the interaction with a prominent OB association and a giant Hii region. PGCCs in the λ Orionis cloud have higher dust temperatures (Td=16.13±0.15 K) and lower values of dust emissivity spectral index ( β=1.65±0.02) than PGCCs in the Orion A (Td=13.79± 0.21K, β=2.07±0.03) and Orion B (Td=13.82±0.19K, β=1.96±0.02) clouds. We find 119 sub-structures within the 40 detected PGCCs and identify them as cores. Of total 119 cores, 15 cores are discovered in the λ Orionis cloud, while 74 and 30 cores are found in the Orion A and B clouds, respectively. The cores in the λ Orionis cloud show much lower mean values of size R=0.08 pc, column density N(H2)=(9.5±1.2) × 10^22 cm<sup>2</sup>, number density n(H2)=(2.9 ± 0.4)×10^5 cm^-3, and mass M_core=1.0±0.3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> compared to the cores in the Orion A (R=0.11pc, N(H2)=(2.3±0.3) × 10^23 cm<sup>2</sup>, n(H2)=(3.8±0.5) × 10^5cm^-3, and M_core=2.4 ± 0.3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) and Orion B (R=0.16pc, N(H2)=(3.8 ± 0.4) × 10^23cm<sup>2</sup>, n(H2)=(15.6±1.8)×10^5 cm^-3, and M_core= 2.7±0.3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) clouds. These core properties in the λ Orionis cloud can be attributed to the photodissociation and external heating by the nearby Hii region, which may prevent the PGCCs from forming gravitationally bound structures and eventually disperse them. These results support the idea of negative stellar feedback on core formation.

<p> G. Martin, S. Kaviraj, J. E. G. Devriendt, Y. Dubois, C. Pichon, C. Laigle </p>
<p>
As endpoints of the hierarchical mass-assembly process, the stellar populations of local early-type galaxies encode the assembly history of galaxies over cosmic time. We use Horizon-AGN, a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, to study the merger histories of local early-type galaxies and track how the morphological mix of their progenitors evolves over time. We provide a framework for alleviating `progenitor bias' &ndash; the bias that occurs if one uses only early-type galaxies to study the progenitor population. Early-types attain their final morphology at relatively early epochs &ndash; by z~1, around 60 per cent of today's early-types have had their last significant merger. At all redshifts, the majority of mergers have one late-type progenitor, with late-late mergers dominating at z&gt;1.5 and early-early mergers becoming significant only at z&lt;0.5. Progenitor bias is severe at all but the lowest redshifts &ndash; e.g. at z~0.6, less than 50 per cent of the stellar mass in today's early-types is actually in progenitors with early-type morphology, while, at z~2, studying only early-types misses almost all (80 per cent) of the stellar mass that eventually ends up in local early-type systems. At high redshift, almost all massive late-type galaxies, regardless of their local environment or star-formation rate, are progenitors of local early-type galaxies, as are lower-mass (M<sub>&sext;</sub> &lt; 10^10.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) late-types as long as they reside in high density environments. In this new era of large observational surveys (e.g. LSST, JWST), this study provides a framework for studying how today's early-type galaxies have been built up over cosmic time.

<p> Corentin Schreiber, David Elbaz, Maurilio Pannella, Laure Ciesla, Tao Wang, Maximilien Franco </p>
<p>
We present a new, publicly available library of dust spectral energy distributions (SEDs). These SEDs are characterized by only three parameters: the dust mass (Mdust), the dust temperature (Tdust), and the mid-to-total infrared color (IR8=LIR/L8). The latter measures the relative contribution of PAH molecules to the LIR. We used this library to model star-forming galaxies at 0.5&lt;z&lt;4 in the CANDELS fields, using both individual detections and stacks of Herschel and ALMA imaging, and extending this sample to z=0 using the Herschel Reference Survey. At first order, the dust SED of a galaxy was found independent of stellar mass, but evolving with redshift. We found trends of increasing Tdust and IR8 with redshift and distance from the SFR&ndash;Mstar main sequence (MS), and quantified for the first time their intrinsic scatter. Half of the observed variation of these parameters was captured by these empirical relations, with residual scatters of 12% and 0.18 dex, respectively. Second order variations with stellar mass are discussed. Building on these results, we constructed high-fidelity mock galaxy catalogs to predict the accuracy of LIR and Mdust determined from a single flux measurement. Using a single JWST MIRI band, we found that LIR is typically uncertain by 0.15 dex, with a maximum of 0.25 dex when probing the rest-frame 8 um, and this is not significantly impacted by typical redshift uncertainties. On the other hand, we found that ALMA bands 8-to-7 and 6-to-3 measure Mdust at better than 0.2 and 0.15 dex, respectively, and independently of redshift, while bands 9-to-6 only measure LIR at better than 0.2 dex at z&gt;1, 3.2, 3.8, and 5.7, respectively. Starburst galaxies above the MS have LIR significantly underestimated and Mdust overestimated. These results can be used immediately to interpret more accurately the large amount of archival data from Spitzer, Herschel and ALMA. [abridged]

### 282) [1710.02528](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.02528v1): The Persistence of Population III Star Formation

<p> Richard H. Mebane, Jordan Mirocha, Steven R. Furlanetto </p>
<p>
We present a semi-analytic model of star formation in the early universe, beginning with the first metal-free stars. By employing a completely feedback-limited star formation prescription, stars form at maximum efficiency until the self-consistently calculated feedback processes halt formation. We account for a number of feedback processes including a meta-galactic Lyman-Werner background, supernovae, photoionization, and chemical feedback. Halos are evolved combining mass accretion rates found through abundance matching with our feedback-limited star formation prescription, allowing for a variety of Population III (Pop III) initial mass functions (IMFs). We find that, for a number of models, massive Pop III star formation can continue on until at least z ~ 20 and potentially past z ~ 6 at rates of around 10^-4 to 10^-5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1 Mpc^-3, assuming these stars form in isolation. At this point Lyman-Werner feedback pushes the minimum halo mass for star formation above the atomic cooling threshold, cutting off the formation of massive Pop III stars. We find that, in most models, Pop II and Pop III star formation co-exist over cosmological time-scales, with the total star formation rate density and resulting radiation background strongly dominated by the former before Pop III star formation finally ends. These halos form at most ~ 10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> of massive Pop III stars during this phase and typically have absolute magnitudes in the range of M_AB = -5 to -10. We also briefly discuss how future observations from telescopes such as JWST or WFIRST and 21-cm experiments may be able to constrain unknown parameters in our model such as the IMF, star formation prescription, or the physics of massive Pop III stars.

### 283) [1707.02312](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.02312v2): The clustering of z &gt; 7 galaxies: Predictions from the BLUETIDES simulation

<p> Aklant Kumar Bhowmick, Tiziana Di Matteo, Yu Feng, Francois Lanusse </p>
<p>
We study the clustering of the highest-z galaxies (from ~ 0.1 to a few tens Mpc scales) using the BLUETIDES simulation and compare it to current observational constraints from Hubble legacy and Hyper Suprime Cam (HSC) fields (at z=6-7.2). With a box length of 400 Mpc/h on each side and 0.7 trillion particles, BLUETIDES is the largest high resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulation to date ideally suited for studies of high-z galaxies. We find that galaxies with magnitude m_UV&lt;27.7 have a bias (b_g) of 8.1± 1.2 at z=8, and typical halo masses M_H ≳ 6×10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Given the redshift evolution between z=8 to z=10 (b_g&prop;(1+z)^1.6), our inferred values of the bias and halo masses are consistent with measured angular clustering at z ~ 6.8 from these brighter samples. The bias of fainter galaxies (in the Hubble legacy field at H_160 ≲29.5) is 5.9±0.9 at z=8 corresponding to halo masses M_H ≳ 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. We investigate directly the 1-halo term inthe clustering and show that it dominates on scales r ≲ 0.1 Mpc/h (Θ≲ 3") with non-linear effect at transition scales between the 1-halo and 2-halo term affecting scales 0.1 ≲ r ≲ 20 Mpc/h (3"≲ Θ≲ 90"). Current clustering measurements probe down to the scales in the transition between 1-halo to 2-halo regime where non-linear effects are important. The amplitude of the 1-halo term implies that occupation numbers for satellites in ttBLUETIDES are somewhat higher than standard HODs adopted in these analyses (which predict amplitudes in the 1-halo regime suppressed by a factor 2-3). That possibly implies a higher number of galaxies detected by JWST (at small scales and even fainter magnitudes) observing these fields.

### 284) [1706.04811](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.04811v1): PAH features within few hundred parsecs of active galactic nuclei

<p> J. J. Jensen, S. F. Hönig, S. Rakshit, A. Alonso-Herrero, D. Asmus, P. Gandhi, M. Kishimoto, A. Smette, K. R. W. Tristram </p>
<p>
Spectral features from PAH molecules observed in the mid-IR range are typically used to infer the amount of recent and ongoing star formation (SF) on kpc scales around AGN where more traditional methods fail. This assumes that the observed PAH features are excited predominantly by SF. With current ground-based telescopes and the upcoming JWST, much smaller spatial scales can be probed and we aim at testing this assumption in the range of few tens to few hundreds of pc. For that, we spatially map the emitted 11.3μm PAH surface flux as a function of distance from 0.4-4 arcsec from the centre in 28 nearby AGN using ground-based high-angular resolution mid-IR spectroscopy. We detect and extract the 11.3μm PAH feature in 13 AGN. The fluxes within each aperture are scaled to a luminosity-normalised distance from the nucleus to be able to compare intrinsic spatial scales of AGN radiation spanning about 2 orders of magnitude in luminosity. For this, we establish an empirical relation between the absorption-corrected X-ray luminosity and the sublimation radius in these sources. Once normalised, the radial profiles of the emitted PAH surface flux show similar radial slopes, with a power-law index of approximately -1.1, and similar absolute values, consistent within a factor of a few of each other as expected from the uncertainty in the intrinsic scale estimate. We interpret this as evidence that the profiles are caused by a common compact central physical process, either the AGN itself or circumnuclear SF linked in strength to the AGN power. A photoionisation-based model of an AGN exciting dense clouds in its environment can reproduce the observed radial slope and confirms that the AGN radiation field is strong enough to explain the observed PAH surface fluxes within ~10-500 pc of the nucleus. Our results advice caution in the use of PAH emission as a SF tracer within a kpc around AGN.

<p>
We report on five compact, extremely young (&lt;10Myr) and blue (β_UV&lt;-2.5, F_λ=λ^β) objects observed with VLT/MUSE at redshift 3.1169, 3.235, in addition to three objects at z=6.145. These sources are magnified by the Hubble Frontier Field galaxy clusters MACS~J0416 and AS1063. Their de-lensed half light radii (Re) are between 16 to 140pc, the stellar masses are ~1-20 X 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, the magnitudes are m_uv=28.8 - 31.4 (-17&lt;Muv&lt;-15) and specific star formation rates can be as large as ~800Gyr^-1. Multiple images of these systems are widely separated in the sky (up to 50'') and individually magnified by factors 3-40. Remarkably, the inferred physical properties of two objects are similar to those expected in some globular cluster formation scenarios, representing the best candidate proto-globular clusters (proto-GC) discovered so far. Rest-frame optical high dispersion spectroscopy of one of them at z=3.1169 yields a velocity dispersion σ_v~20km/s, implying a dynamical mass dominated by the stellar mass. Another object at z=6.145, with de-lensed Muv ~ -15.3 (m_uv ~ 31.4), shows a stellar mass and a star-formation rate surface density consistent with the values expected from popular GC formation scenarios. An additional star-forming region at z=6.145, with de-lensed m_uv ~ 32, a stellar mass of 0.5 X 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and a star formation rate of 0.06 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr is also identified. These objects currently represent the faintest spectroscopically confirmed star-forming systems at z&gt;3, elusive even in the deepest blank fields. We discuss how proto-GCs might contribute to the ionization budget of the universe and augment Lya visibility during reionization. This work underlines the crucial role of JWST in characterizing the rest-frame optical and near-infrared properties of such low-luminosity high-z objects.

### 286) [1612.01304](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.01304v1): Galaxy Evolution at High Redshift: Obscured Star Formation, GRB Rates, Cosmic Reionization, and Missing Satellites

<p> A. Lapi, Claudia Mancuso, A. Celotti, L. Danese </p>
<p>
We provide an holistic view of galaxy evolution at high redshift z&gt;4, that incorporates the constraints from various astrophysical/cosmological probes, including the estimate of the cosmic SFR density from UV/IR surveys and long GRB rates, the cosmic reionization history after the latest Planck measurements, and the missing satellites issue. We achieve this goal in a model-independent way by exploiting the SFR functions derived by Mancuso et al. (2016) on the basis of an educated extrapolation of the latest UV/far-IR data from HST/Herschel, and already tested against a number of independent observables. Our SFR functions integrated down to an UV magnitude limit M_UV&lt;-13 (or SFR limit around 10^-2 M_sun/yr) produces a cosmic SFR density in excellent agreement with recent determinations from IR surveys and, taking into account a metallicity ceiling Z&lt;Z_sun/2, with the estimates from long GRB rates. They also yield a cosmic reionization history consistent with that implied by the recent measurements of the Planck mission on the electron scattering optical depth tau_es~0.058; remarkably, this result is obtained under a conceivable assumption regarding the average value f<sub>esc</sub>~0.1 of the escape fraction for ionizing photons. We demonstrate via the abundance matching technique that the above constraints concurrently imply galaxy formation to become inefficient within dark matter halos of mass below a few 10^8 M_sun; pleasingly, such a limit is also required not to run into the missing satellite issue. Finally, we predict a downturn of the galaxy luminosity function faintward of M_UV&lt;-12, and stress that its detailed shape, as plausibly probed in the next future by the JWST, will be extremely informative on the astrophysics of galaxy formation in small halos, or even on the microscopic nature of the dark matter.

We present VLT/X-Shooter and MUSE spectroscopy of an faint F814W=28.60+/-0.33 (Muv=-17.0), low mass (≲10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) and compact (Reff=62pc) freshly star-forming galaxy at z=3.1169 magnified (16x) by the Hubble Frontier Fields galaxy cluster Abell S1063. Gravitational lensing allows for a significant jump toward low-luminosity regimes, in moderately high resolution spectroscopy (R=lambda/dlambda ~ 3000-7400). We measured CIV1548,1550, HeII1640, OIII]1661,1666, CIII]1907,1909, Hbeta, [OIII]4959,5007, emission lines with FWHM&lt; 50 km/s and (de-lensed) fluxes spanning the interval 1.0x10^-19 - 2.0x10^-18 erg/s/cm2 at S/N=4-30. The double peaked Lya emission with Delta_v(red-blue) = 280(+/-7)km/s and de-lensed fluxes 2.4_(blue)|8.5_(red)x10^-18 erg/s/cm2 (S/N=38_(blue)|110_(red)) indicate a low column density of neutral hydrogen gas consistent with a highly ionized interstellar medium as also inferred from the large [OIII]5007/[OII]3727&gt;10 ratio. We detect CIV1548,1550 resonant doublet in emission, each component with FWHM ≲ 45 km/s, and redshifted by +51(+/-10)km/s relative to the systemic redshift. We interpret this as nebular emission tracing an expanding optically-thin interstellar medium. Both CIV1548,1550 and HeII1640 suggest the presence of hot and massive stars (with a possible faint AGN). The ultraviolet slope is remarkably blue, beta =-2.95 +/- 0.20 (F_lambda=lambda^beta), consistent with a dust-free and young ≲20 Myr galaxy. Line ratios suggest an oxygen abundance 12+log(O/H)&lt;7.8. We are witnessing an early episode of star-formation in which a relatively low NHI and negligible dust attenuation might favor a leakage of ionizing radiation. This galaxy currently represents a unique low-luminosity reference object for future studies of the reionization epoch with JWST.

### 288) [1509.02167](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02167v1): Mean Halpha+[NII]+[SII] EW Inferred for Star-Forming Galaxies at z=5.1-5.4 Using High-Quality Spitzer/IRAC Photometry

<p> N. Rasappu, R. Smit, I. Labbe, R. Bouwens, D. Stark, R. Ellis, P. Oesch </p>
<p>
Recent Spitzer/InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) photometric observations have revealed that rest-frame optical emission lines contribute signficantly to the broadband fluxes of high-redshift galaxies. Specifically, in the narrow redshift range z~5.1-5.4 the [3.6]-[4.5] color is expected to be very red, due to contamination of the 4.5-micron band by the dominant Halpha line, while the 3.6-micron filter is free of nebular emission lines. We take advantage of new reductions of deep Spitzer/IRAC imaging over the GOODS-North+South fields (Labbe+2015) to obtain a clean measurement of the mean Halpha equivalent width from the [3.6]-[4.5] color in the redshift range z=5.1-5.4. The selected sources either have measured spectroscopic redshifts (13 sources) or lie very confidently in the redshift range z=5.1-5.4 based on the photometric redshift likelihood intervals (11 sources). Our z<sub>phot</sub>=5.1-5.4 sample and z<sub>spec</sub>=5.10-5.40 spectroscopic sample have a mean [3.6]-[4.5] color of 0.31+/-0.05 mag and 0.35+/-0.07 mag, implying a rest-frame equivalent width EW(Halpha+[NII]+[SII]) of 665+/-53 Angstroms and 707+/-74 Angstroms, respectively, for sources in these samples. These values are consistent albeit slightly higher than derived by Stark+2013 at z~4, suggesting an evolution to higher values of the Halpha+[NII]+[SII] EW at z&gt;2. Using the 3.6micron band, which is free of emission line contamination, we perform robust SED fitting and find a median specific star formation rate of sSFR = 17_-5^+2 Gyr^-1, 7_-2^+1x higher than at z~2. We find no strong correlation (&lt;2sigma) between the Halpha+[NII]+[SII] EW and the stellar mass of sources. Before the advent of JWST, improvements in these results will come through an expansion of current spectroscopic samples and deeper Spitzer/IRAC measurements.

We aim to determine the redshift of GDS-1408, the most solid z~7 galaxy candidate lying in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. We have used all the VLT spectra of GDS-1408 collected by us and two other groups with FORS2 at VLT in the last five years, for a total integration time of 52hr. The combined spectrum is the deepest ever obtained of a galaxy in the Reionization epoch. We do not detect any emission line or continuum over the whole wavelength range, up to 10100A. Based on an accurate set of simulations, we are able to put a stringent upper limit of f(Lya)&lt;3x10^(-18) erg/s/cm2 at 3-9 sigma in the explored wavelength range, corresponding to a rest-frame equivalent width EW&lt;9A. Combining this limit with the SED modelling we refine the redshift to be z=6.82+/- 0.1 (1-sigma). The same SED fitting indicates that GDS-1408 is relatively extinct (A1600~1) with a dust corrected star formation rate of ~ 20 Msol/yr. The comparison between the un-attenuated equivalent width predicted by the case-B recombination theory and the observed upper limit, provides a limit on the effective Lya escape fraction of f_(esc)^(eff)(Lya)&lt;8%. Even though we cannot rule out a major contribution of the inter/circum galactic medium in damping the line, a plausible interpretation is that GDS-1408 is moderately evolved and contains sufficient gas and dust to attenuate the Lya emission, before it reaches the intergalactic medium. The redshift confirmation of even the best z~7 candidates is very hard to achieve (unless the Lya or unusually strong rest-UV nebular emission lines are present) with the current generation of 8-10m class telescopes. We show that both JWST and E-ELT will be necessary to make decisive progresses. Currently, the increased redshift accuracy obtained with this kind of analysis makes ALMA an interesting option for the redshift confirmation.

We present a tally of Milky Way late-type dwarf stars in 68 WFC3 pure-parallel fields (227 arcmin<sup>2</sup>) from the Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies (BoRG) survey for high-redshift galaxies. Using spectroscopically identified M-dwarfs in two public surveys, the CANDELS and the ERS mosaics, we identify a morphological selection criterion using the half-light radius (r50), a near-infrared J-H, G-J color region where M-dwarfs are found, and a V-J relation with M-dwarf subtype. We apply this morphological selection of stellar objects, color-color selection of M-dwarfs and optical-near-infrared color subtyping to compile a catalog of 274 M-dwarfs belonging to the disk of the Milky Way with a limiting magnitude of m_F125W &lt; 24. Based on the M-dwarfs statistics, we conclude that (a) the previously identified North/South discrepancy in M-dwarf numbers persists in our sample; there are more M-dwarfs in the Northern fields on average than in Southern ones, (b) the Milky Way's single disk scale-height for M-dwarfs is 0.3-4 kpc, depending on sub-type, (c) \bf ERRATUM: we present corrected coordinates (AstroPy) and distances and find a constant z_0=600 pc for all types. (d) a second component is visible in the vertical distribution, with a different, much higher scale-height. We report the M-dwarf component of the Sagittarius stream in one of our fields with 11 confirmed M-dwarfs, 7 of which are at the stream's distance. The dwarf scale-height and the relative low incidence in our fields of L- and T-dwarfs in these fields makes it unlikely that these stars will be interlopers in great numbers in color-selected samples of high-redshift galaxies. The relative ubiquity of M-dwarfs however will make them ideal tracers of Galactic Halo substructure with EUCLID and reference stars for JWST observations.

<p>
We study the mid- to far-IR properties of a 24um-selected flux-limited sample (S24 &gt; 5mJy) of 154 intermediate redshift (&lt;z&gt;~0.15), infrared luminous galaxies, drawn from the 5MUSES survey. By combining existing mid-IR spectroscopy and new Herschel SPIRE submm photometry from the HerMES program, we derived robust total infrared luminosity (LIR) and dust mass (Md) estimates and infered the relative contribution of the AGN to the infrared energy budget of the sources. We found that the total infrared emission of galaxies with weak 6.2um PAH emission (EW&lt;0.2um) is dominated by AGN activity, while for galaxies with EW&gt;0.2um more than 50% of the LIR arises from star formation. We also found that for galaxies detected in the 250-500um Herschel bands an AGN has a statistically insignificant effect on the temperature of the cold dust and the far-IR colours of the host galaxy, which are primarily shaped by star formation activity. For star-forming galaxies we reveal an anti-correlation between the LIR-to-rest-frame 8um luminosity ratio, IR8 = LIR\L8, and the strength of PAH features. We found that this anti-correlation is primarily driven by variations in the PAHs emission, and not by variations in the 5-15um mid-IR continuum emission. Using the [NeIII]/[NeII] line ratio as a tracer of the hardness of the radiation field, we confirm that galaxies with harder radiation fields tend to exhibit weaker PAH features, and found that they have higher IR8 values and higher dust-mass-weighted luminosities (LIR/Md), the latter being a proxy for the dust temperature (Td). We argue that these trends originate either from variations in the environment of the star-forming regions or are caused by variations in the age of the starburst. Finally, we provide scaling relations that will allow estimating LIR, based on single-band observations with the mid-infrared instrument, on board the upcoming JWST.

[abridged] We present the discovery of four surprisingly bright (H_160 ~ 26 - 27 mag AB) galaxy candidates at z~9-10 in the complete HST CANDELS WFC3/IR GOODS-N imaging data, doubling the number of z~10 galaxy candidates that are known, just ~500 Myr after the Big Bang. Two similarly bright sources are also detected in a systematic re-analysis of the GOODS-S data set. Three of the four galaxies in GOODS-N are significantly detected at 4.5-6.2sigma in the very deep Spitzer/IRAC 4.5 micron data, as is one of the GOODS-S candidates. Furthermore, the brightest of our candidates (at z=10.2+-0.4) is robustly detected also at 3.6 micron (6.9sigma), revealing a flat UV spectral energy distribution with a slope beta=-2.0+-0.2, consistent with demonstrated trends with luminosity at high redshift. The abundance of such luminous candidates suggests that the luminosity function evolves more significantly in phi_* than in L_* at z&gt;~8 with a higher number density of bright sources than previously expected. Despite the discovery of these luminous candidates, the cosmic star formation rate density for galaxies with SFR &gt;0.7 M_sun/yr shows an order-of-magnitude increase in only 170 Myr from z ~ 10 to z ~ 8, consistent with previous results. Based on the IRAC detections, we derive galaxy stellar masses at z~10, finding that these luminous objects are typically 10^9 M_sun. The cosmic stellar mass density at z~10 is log10 rho_* = 4.7^+0.5_-0.8 M_sun Mpc^-3 for galaxies brighter than M_UV~-18. The remarkable brightness, and hence luminosity, of these z~9-10 candidates highlights the opportunity for deep spectroscopy to determine their redshift and nature, demonstrates the value of additional search fields covering a wider area to understand star-formation in the very early universe, and highlights the opportunities for JWST to map the buildup of galaxies at redshifts much earlier than z~10.

### 293) [1302.6996](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.6996v2): Unravelling obese black holes in the first galaxies

<p> Bhaskar Agarwal, Andrew J. Davis, Sadegh Khochfar, Priyamvada Natarajan, James S. Dunlop </p>
<p>
We predict the existence and observational signatures of a new class of objects that assembled early, during the first billion years of cosmic time: Obese Black-hole Galaxies (OBGs). OBGs are objects in which the mass of the central black hole initially exceeds that of the stellar component of the host galaxy, and the luminosity from black-hole accretion dominates the starlight. From a cosmological simulation, we demonstrate that there are sites where star formation is initially inhibited and direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) form due to the photo-dissociating effect of Lyman-Werner radiation on molecular hydrogen. We show that the formation of OBGs is inevitable, because the probability of finding the required extra-galactic environment and the right physical conditions in a halo conducive to DCBH formation is quite high in the early universe. We estimate an OBG number density of 0.009/Mpc^3 at z~8 and 0.03/Mpc^3 at z~6. Extrapolating from our simulation volume, we infer that the most luminous quasars detected at z~6 likely transited through an earlier OBG phase. We find that these primordial galaxies start off with an over-massive BH and acquire their stellar component from subsequent merging as well as in-situ star formation. In doing so, they inevitably go through an OBG phase dominated by the accretion luminosity at the Eddington rate or below, released from the growing BH. The OBG phase is characterised by an ultra-violet (UV) spectrum with slope of beta ~ -2.3 and the absence of a Balmer Break. OBGs should also be spatially unresolved, and are expected to be brighter than the majority of known high-redshift galaxies. OBGs could potentially be revealed via HST follow-up imaging of samples of brighter Lyman-break galaxies provided by wide-area ground-based surveys such as UltraVISTA, and should be easily uncovered and studied with instruments aboard JWST...(abridged)

### 294) [1212.3297](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.3297v2): Exploring organic chemistry in planet-forming zones

<p> Jeanette E. Bast, Fred Lahuis, Ewine F. van Dishoeck, Alexander G. G. M. Tielens </p>
<p>
Over the last few years, the chemistry of molecules other than CO in the planet-forming zones of disks is starting to be explored with Spitzer and high-resolution ground-based data. However, these studies have focused only on a few simple molecules. The aim of this study is to put observational constraints on the presence of more complex organic and sulfur-bearing molecules predicted to be abundant in chemical models of disks and to simulate high resolution spectra in view of future missions. High S/N Spitzer spectra at 10-30 micron of the near edge-on disks IRS46 and GVTau are used to search for mid-infrared absorption bands of various molecules. These disks are good laboratories because absorption studies do not suffer from low line/continuum ratios that plague emission data. Simple LTE slab models are used to infer column densities (or upper limits) and excitation temperatures. Bands of HCN, C2H2 and CO2 are clearly detected toward both sources. The HCN and C2H2 absorption arises in warm gas with Tex of 400-700 K, whereas the CO2 absorption originates in cooler gas of app. 250 K (as in Lahuis 2006). No other absorption features are detected. Limits of those molecules are determined and compared with disk models. The inferred ratios wrt. C2H2 and HCN are roughly consistent with models of the chemistry in high-T gas. Models of UV irradiated disk surfaces generally agree better than pure X-ray models. The limit on NH3/HCN implies that evaporation of NH3 containing ices is only a minor contributor. The inferred ratios also compare well with those found in comets, suggesting that part of the cometary material may derive from warm inner disk gas. High resolution simulations show that future instruments on JWST, ELTs, SOFIA and SPICA can probe up to an order of magnitude lower ratios and put important new constraints on the models, especially if pushed to high S/N ratios.

We present measurements of the specific ultraviolet luminosity density from a sample of 483 galaxies at 6&lt;z&lt;8. These galaxies were selected from new deep near-infrared HST imaging from the CANDELS, HUDF09 and ERS programs. In contrast to the majority of previous analyses, which assume that the distribution of galaxy ultraviolet (UV) luminosities follows a Schechter distribution, and that the distribution continues to luminosities far below our observable limit, we investigate the contribution to reionization from galaxies which we can observe, free from these assumptions. We find that the observable population of galaxies can sustain a fully reionized IGM at z=6, if the average ionizing photon escape fraction (f<sub>esc</sub>) is ~30%. A number of previous studies have measured UV luminosity densities at these redshifts that vary by 5X, with many concluding that galaxies could not complete reionization by z=6 unless a large population of galaxies fainter than the detection limit were invoked, or extremely high values of f<sub>esc</sub> were present. The observed UV luminosity density from our observed galaxy samples at z=7-8 is not sufficient to maintain a fully reionized IGM unless f<sub>esc</sub>&gt;50%. Combining our observations with constraints on the emission rate of ionizing photons from Ly-alpha forest observations at z=6, we can constrain f<sub>esc</sub>&lt;34% (2-sigma) if the observed galaxies are the only contributors to reionization, or &lt;13% (2-sigma) if the luminosity function extends to M_UV = -13. These escape fractions are sufficient to complete reionization by z=6. These constraints imply that the volume ionized fraction of the IGM becomes less than unity at z&gt;7, consistent with a number of complementary reionization probes. If faint galaxies dominate reionization, future JWST observations will probe deep enough to see them, providing an indirect constraint on the ionizing photon escape fraction [abridged].

### 296) [1205.6464](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.6464v2): Ubiquitous seeding of supermassive black holes by direct collapse

<p> Bhaskar Agarwal, Sadegh Khochfar, Jarrett L. Johnson, Eyal Neistein, Claudio Dalla Vecchia, Mario Livio </p>
<p>
We study for the first time the environment of massive black hole (BH) seeds (~10^4-5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) formed via the direct collapse of pristine gas clouds in massive haloes (&gt;10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) at z&gt;6. Our model is based on the evolution of dark matter haloes within a cosmological N-body simulation, combined with prescriptions for the formation of BH along with both Pop III and Pop II stars. We calculate the spatially-varying intensity of Lyman Werner (LW) radiation from stars and identify the massive pristine haloes in which it is high enough to shut down molecular hydrogen cooling. In contrast to previous BH seeding models with a spatially constant LW background, we find that the intensity of LW radiation due to local sources, J_local, can be up to 10^6 times the spatially averaged background in the simulated volume and exceeds the critical value, J_crit, for the complete suppression of molecular cooling, in some cases by 4 orders of magnitude. Even after accounting for possible metal pollution in a halo from previous episodes of star formation, we find a steady rise in the formation rate of direct collapse (DC) BHs with decreasing redshift from 10^-3/Mpc^3/z at z=12 to 10^-2/Mpc^3/z at z=6. The onset of Pop II star formation at z~16 simultaneously marks the onset of the epoch of DCBH formation, as the increased level of LW radiation from Pop II stars is able to elevate the local levels of the LW intensity to J_local &gt; J_crit while Pop III stars fail to do so at any time. The number density of DCBHs is sensitive to the number of LW photons and can vary by an order of magnitude at z=6 after accounting for reionisation feedback. Haloes hosting DCBHs are more clustered than similar massive counterparts that do not host DCBHs, especially at redshifts z&gt;10. We also show that planned surveys with JWST should be able to detect the supermassive stellar precursors of DCBHs.

### 297) [1107.2921](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.2921v3): Mid-Infrared Determination of Total Infrared Luminosity and Star Formation Rates of Local and High-Redshift Galaxies

<p> W. Rujopakarn, G. H. Rieke, B. J. Weiner, P. Pérez-González, M. Rex, G. L. Walth, J. S. Kartaltepe </p>
<p>
We demonstrate estimating the total infrared luminosity, LIR, and star formation rates (SFRs) of star-forming galaxies at redshift 0 &lt; z &lt; 2.8 from single-band 24 micron observations, using local spectral energy distributions (SED) templates without introducing additional free parameters. Our method is based on characterizing the SEDs of galaxies as a function of their LIR surface density, which is motivated by the indications that the majority of IR luminous star-forming galaxies at 1 &lt; z &lt; 3 have extended star-forming regions, in contrast to the strongly nuclear concentrated, merger-induced starbursts in local luminous and ultraluminous IR galaxies. We validate our procedure for estimating LIR by comparing the resulting LIRs with those measured from far-IR observations at 0 &lt; z &lt; 2.8. AGNs were excluded using X-ray and 3.6-8.0 micron observations, which are generally available in deep cosmological survey fields. The Gaussian fits to the distribution of the discrepancies between the LIR measurements from single-band 24 micron and Herschel observations have sigma &lt; 0.1 dex, with ~10% of objects disagreeing by more than 0.2 dex. Since the 24 micron estimates are based on SEDs for extended galaxies, this agreement suggests that ~90% of IR galaxies at high z are indeed much more physically extended than local counterparts of similar LIR, consistent with recent independent studies of the fractions of galaxies forming stars in the main-sequence and starburst modes, respectively. Because we have not introduced empirical corrections to enhance these estimates, in principle, our method should be applicable to lower luminosity galaxies. This will enable use of the 21 micron band of the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on board the JWST to provide an extremely sensitive tracer of obscured SFR in individual star-forming galaxies across the peak of the cosmic star formation history.

### 298) [1004.3545](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.3545v2): The evolution of Lyman-break galaxies in CDM

<p> C. G. Lacey, C. M. Baugh, C. S. Frenk, A. J. Benson, . </p>
<p>
We make a detailed investigation of the properties of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) in the LambdaCDM model. We present predictions for two published variants of the GALFORM semi-analytical model: the Baugh et al. (2005) model, which has star formation at high redshifts dominated by merger-driven starbursts with a top-heavy IMF, and the Bower et al. (2006) model, which has AGN feedback and a standard Solar neighbourhood IMF throughout. We show predictions for the evolution of the rest-frame far-UV luminosity function in the redshift range z=3-20, and compare with the observed luminosity functions of LBGs at z=3-10. We find that the Baugh et al. model is in excellent agreement with these observations, while the Bower et al. model predicts too many high-luminosity LBGs. Dust extinction, which is predicted self-consistently based on galaxy gas contents, metallicities and sizes, is found to have a large effect on LBG luminosities. We compare predictions for the size evolution of LBGs at different luminosities with observational data for 2&lt;z&lt;7, and find the Baugh et al. model to be in good agreement. We present predictions for stellar, halo and gas masses, star formation rates, circular velocities, bulge-to-disk ratios, gas and stellar metallicities and clustering bias, as functions of far-UV luminosity and redshift. We find broad consistency with current observational constraints. We then present predictions for the abundance and angular sizes of LBGs out to very high redshift (z&lt;20), finding that planned deep surveys with JWST should detect objects out to z&lt;15. The typical UV luminosities of galaxies are predicted to be very low at high redshifts, which has implications for detecting the galaxies responsible for reionizing the IGM; for example, at z=10, 50% of the ionizing photons are expected to be produced by galaxies fainter than M_AB(1500A)-5logh ~ -15.

We perform a deep search for galaxies in the redshift range 6.5&lt;z&lt;7.5, to measure the evolution of the number density of luminous galaxies in this redshift range and derive useful constraints on the evolution of their Luminosity Function. We present here the first results of an ESO Large Program, that exploits the unique combination of area and sensitivity provided in the near-IR by the camera Hawk-I at the VLT. We have obtained two Hawk-I pointings on the GOODS South field for a total of 32 observing hours, covering ~90 arcmin2. The images reach Y=26.7 mags for the two fields. We have used public ACS images in the z band to select z-dropout galaxies with the colour criteria Z-Y&gt;1, Y-J&lt;1.5 and Y-K&lt;2. The other public data in the UBVRIJHK bands are used to reject possible low redshift interlopers. The output has been compared with extensive Monte Carlo simulations to quantify the observational effects of our selection criteria as well as the effects of photometric errors. We detect 7 high quality candidates in the magnitude range Y=25.5-26.7. This interval samples the critical range for M<sub>&sext;</sub> at z&gt;6 (M_1500 ~- 19.5 to -21.5). After accounting for the expected incompleteness, we rule out at a 99% confidence level a Luminosity Function constant from z=6 to z=7, even including the effects of cosmic variance. For galaxies brighter than M_1500=-19.0 we derive a luminosity density rho_UV=1.5^+2.0_-0.9 10^25 erg/s/Hz/Mpc3, implying a decrease by a factor 3.5 from z=6 to z~6.8. On the basis of our findings, we make predictions for the surface densities expected in future surveys surveys, based on ULTRA-VISTA, HST-WFC3 or JWST-NIRCam, evaluating the best observational strategy to maximise their impact.

[abridged] We propose a tiered, UV&ndash;near-IR, cosmological broad- and medium-band imaging and grism survey that covers ~10 deg<sup>2</sup> in two epochs to m_AB=28, ~3 deg<sup>2</sup> in seven epochs to m_AB=28, and ~1 deg<sup>2</sup> in 20 epochs to m_AB=30 mag. Such a survey is an essential complement to JWST surveys (&lt;~0.1 deg<sup>2</sup> to m_AB&lt;~31 mag at lambda&gt;1100nm and z&gt;~8). We aim to: (1) understand in how galaxies formed from perturbations in the primordial density field by studying faint Lyα-emitting and Lyman-break galaxies at 5.5&lt;~z&lt;~8 and trace the metal-enrichment of the IGM; (2) measure the evolution of the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function (LF) from z~8 to z~0 by mapping the ramp-up of PopII star formation, (dwarf) galaxy formation and assembly, and hence, the objects that likely completed the H-reionization at z~6; (3) directly study the lambda&lt;91.2nm escape fractions of galaxies and weak AGN from z~4.0&ndash;2.5, when the He reionization finished; (4) measure the mass- and environment-dependent galaxy assembly process from z~5 to z~0, combining accurate (sigma_z/(1+z) &lt;~ 0.02) photo-z's with spatially resolved stellar populations and kpc-scale structure for &gt;~5x10^6 galaxies; (5) trace the strongly epoch-dependent galaxy merger rate and constrain how Dark Energy affected galaxy assembly and the growth of SMBHs; (6) study &gt;~10^5 weak AGN/feeding SMBHs in the faint-end of the QSO LF, over 10 deg<sup>2</sup> and measure how the growth of SMBHs kept pace with galaxy assembly and spheroid growth, and how this process was shaped by various feedback processes over cosmic times since z~8. The proposed study is not feasible with current instrumentation but argues for a wide-field (&gt;~250 arcmin<sup>2</sup>), high-resolution (&lt;~0.02&ndash;0.11 [300&ndash;1700 nm]), UV&ndash;near-IR imaging facility on a 4m-class space observatory.
