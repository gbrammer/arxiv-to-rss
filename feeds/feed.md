### 1) [2502.12538](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12538v1): Bridging Theory and Observations: Insights into Star Formation Efficiency and Dust Attenuation in z &gt; 5 Galaxies

We investigate early galaxy evolution by modeling self-consistently their radially-resolved evolution of gas, stars, heavy elements, and dust content. Our model successfully reproduces various observed properties of JWST-identified galaxies at z &gt; 5, including sizes, stellar masses, star formation rates (SFR), metallicities, and dust-to-stellar mass ratios. We show that the star formation efficiency (SFE), f_\ast \equiv {\rm SFR}/(f_{\rm b} \dot{M}_{\rm h}), is regulated by the global equilibrium between cosmological gas inflows, star formation, and gas outflows. Our model predicts f_\ast \lesssim 20~&percnt; for galaxies with halo masses of M_{\rm h} ~ 10^{11-12}\, M_\odot down to z = 5, allowing them to reach intrinsic UV magnitudes of M_{\rm UV} \lesssim -22~{\rm mag}; when dust attenuation is ignored, the predicted UV luminosity function (LF) at z ~ 12 agrees well with observations. However, our model also suggests that these galaxies would be heavily obscured by dust, with high optical depths at 1500~&#8491;~of \tau_{1500} \gtrsim 10, causing the dust-attenuated UV LF to fall significantly below the observed one. This discrepancy highlights the need for mechanisms that mitigate strong dust attenuation, such as dust evacuation from star-forming regions and/or preferential production of large dust grains. Further exploration of these processes is essential for understanding the early stages of galaxy evolution.

We present the magnetic field in the dense material of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way, traced in 850 &mu;m polarized dust emission as part of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) B-fields In STar-forming Region Observations (BISTRO) Survey. We observe a highly ordered magnetic field across the CMZ between Sgr B2 and Sgr C, which is strongly preferentially aligned with the orbital gas flows within the clouds of the CMZ. We find that the observed relative orientations are non-random at a &gt;99% confidence level and are consistent with models in which the magnetic field vectors are aligned within 30^{o} to the gas flows in 3D. The deviations from aligned magnetic fields are most prominent at positive Galactic longitudes, where the CMZ clouds are more massive, denser, and more actively forming stars. Our observed strongly preferentially parallel magnetic field morphology leads us to hypothesize that in the absence of star formation, the magnetic field in the CMZ is entrained in the orbital gas flows around Sgr A^{*}, while gravitational collapse and feedback in star-forming regions can locally reorder the field. This magnetic field behavior is similar to that observed in the CMZ of the nuclear starburst galaxy NGC 253. This suggests that despite its current low star formation rate, the CMZ of the Milky Way is analogous to those of more distant, actively star-forming, galaxies.

The Athena mission entered a redefinition phase in July 2022, driven by the imperative to reduce the mission cost at completion for the European Space Agency below an acceptable target, while maintaining the flagship nature of its science return. This notably called for a complete redesign of the X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) cryogenic architecture towards a simpler active cooling chain. Passive cooling via successive radiative panels at spacecraft level is now used to provide a 50 K thermal environment to an X-IFU owned cryostat. 4.5 K cooling is achieved via a single remote active cryocooler unit, while a multi-stage Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator ensures heat lift down to the 50 mK required by the detectors. Amidst these changes, the core concept of the readout chain remains robust, employing Transition Edge Sensor microcalorimeters and a SQUID-based Time-Division Multiplexing scheme. Noteworthy is the introduction of a slower pixel. This enables an increase in the multiplexing factor (from 34 to 48) without compromising the instrument energy resolution, hence keeping significant system margins to the new 4 eV resolution requirement. This allows reducing the number of channels by more than a factor two, and thus the resource demands on the system, while keeping a 4' field of view (compared to 5' before). In this article, we will give an overview of this new architecture, before detailing its anticipated performances. Finally, we will present the new X-IFU schedule, with its short term focus on demonstration activities towards a mission adoption in early 2027.

### 4) [2502.10499](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10499v1): The JWST EXCELS survey: Probing strong-line diagnostics and the chemical evolution of galaxies over cosmic time using Te-metallicities

We present an analysis of the rest-frame optical spectra of 22 [OIII]\lambda4363 detected galaxies in the redshift range 1.65 &lt; z &lt; 7.92 (with \langle z \rangle = 4.05) from JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution observations taken as part of the EXCELS survey. To supplement these high-redshift sources, we also consider a sample of 782 local [OIII]\lambda4363 detected galaxies from the DESI Early Data Release. Our analysis demonstrates that many strong-line calibrations are biased in the early Universe due to the systematic evolution in ionization conditions with redshift. However, the recently introduced \widehat{R} calibration mostly removes the dependence on ionization state and can be considered a largely redshift-independent calibration. In a similar spirit, we introduce a new strong-line diagnostic, \widehat{RNe}, which can be used to robustly estimate metallicities when the [OIII]\lambda5007 is redshifted out of the wavelength range of JWST/NIRSpec at z &gt; 9.5. We also show that strong-line diagnostics using the [NII]\lambda6584 emission line are likely to be biased at high-redshift due to a moderate enhancement in the average N/O abundance ratios (at fixed O/H) in these sources. Finally, we discuss the location of our new [OIII]\lambda4363 detected galaxies at z ~eq 4 on the mass-metallicity plane and investigate the redshift evolution of the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR). We find tentative evidence for an increasing deviation from the FMR at z &gt; 4 which might indicate fundamental differences in the baryon cycle at these redshifts. However, more data are required as our high-redshift constraints are still based on a relatively small sample of galaxies and the significance of the deviation is strongly dependent on the assumed form of the fundamental metallicity relation.

### 5) [2502.10282](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10282v1): The impact of medium-width bands on the selection, and subsequent luminosity function measurements, of high-z galaxies

New, ultra-deep medium-width photometric coverage with JWST's NIRCam instrument provides the potential for much improved photo-z reliability at high redshifts. In this study, we conduct a systematic analysis of the JADES Origins Field, which contains 14 broad- and medium-width near-infrared bands, to assess the benefits of medium band photometry on high-z sample completeness and contamination rates. Using imaging with depths of AB mag 29.8-30.35, we conduct an experiment to observe how high-z selections differ when images are artificially degraded or bands are removed. In parallel, the same experiments are conducted on simulated catalogues from the JAGUAR semi-analytic model to examine if the behaviour from observations can be replicated. We find sample completeness is high (80&percnt;+) and contamination low (&lt;4&percnt;) when in the 10\sigma+ regime, even without the use of any medium-width bands. The addition of medium-width bands leads to notable increases in completeness (~10&percnt;) but multiple bands are required to improve contamination rates due to the small redshift ranges over which they probe strong emission lines. Incidents of Balmer-Lyman degeneracy increase in the 5-7\sigma regime and this can be replicated in both simulated catalogues and degraded real data. We measure the faint-end of the UV LF at 8.5&lt;z&lt;13.5, finding high number densities that agree with previous JWST observations. Overall, medium bands are effective at increasing completeness and reducing contamination, but investment in achieving at least comparable depths in the blue (&lt;1.5&mu;m) as achieved in the red is also found to be key to fully reducing contamination from high-z samples.

### 6) [2502.10271](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10271v1): MICONIC: JWST Unveils Shocked Hot Core Chemistry in the Western Nucleus of Arp 220

<p>
We present full 3-28 micron JWST MIRI/MRS and NIRSpec/IFU spectra of the western nucleus of Arp 220, the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxy. This nucleus has long been suggested to possibly host an embedded Compton-thick AGN. Millimeter observations of the dust continuum suggest the presence of a distinct 20 pc core with a dust temperature of T_\mathrm{d} \gtrsim 500~\mathrm{K}, in addition to a 100 pc circumnuclear starburst disk. However, unambiguously identifying the nature of this core is challenging, due to the immense obscuration, the nuclear starburst activity, and the nearby eastern nucleus. With the JWST integral field spectrographs, we can, for the first time, separate the two nuclei across this full wavelength range, revealing a wealth of molecular absorption features towards the western nucleus. We analyse the rovibrational bands detected at 4-22 micron, deriving column densities and rotational temperatures for 10 distinct species. Optically thick features of C_2H_2, HCN and HNC suggest that this molecular gas is hidden behind a curtain of cooler dust, and indicate that the column densities of C_2H_2 and HCN are an order of magnitude higher than previously derived from Spitzer observations. We identify a warm HCN component with rotational temperature T_\mathrm{rot} = 330~\mathrm{K}, which we associate with radiative excitation by the hot inner nucleus. We propose a geometry where the detected molecular gas is located in the inner regions of the starburst disk, directly surrounding the hot 20 parsec core. The chemical footprint of the western nucleus is reminiscent of that of hot cores, with additional evidence for shocks. No evidence for the presence of an AGN in the form of X-ray-driven chemistry or extreme excitation is found.

### 7) [2502.10123](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10123v1): Modelling methanol and hydride formation in the JWST Ice Age era

<p>
(Abridged) JWST observations have measured the ice composition toward two highly-extinguished field stars in the Chamaeleon I cloud. The observed extinction excess on the long-wavelength side of the H2O ice band at 3 micron has been attributed to a mixture of CH3OH with ammonia hydrates, which suggests that CH3OH ice could have formed in a water-rich environment with little CO depletion. Laboratory experiments and quantum chemical calculations suggest that CH3OH could form via the grain surface reactions CH3+OH and/or C+H2O in water-rich ices. However, no dedicated chemical modelling has been carried out thus far to test their efficiency and dependence on the astrochemical code employed. We model the ice chemistry in the Chamaeleon I cloud using a set of astrochemical codes (MAGICKAL, MONACO, Nautilus, UCLCHEM, and KMC simulations) to test the effects of the different code architectures and of the assumed ice chemistry. Our models show that the JWST ice observations are better reproduced for gas densities &gt;1e5 cm-3 and collapse times &gt;1e5 yr. CH3OH ice forms predominantly (&gt;99%) via CO hydrogenation. The contribution of reactions CH3+OH and C+H2O, is negligible. The CO2 ice may form either via CO+OH or CO+O depending on the code. However, KMC simulations reveal that both mechanisms are efficient despite the low rate constant of the CO+O surface reaction. CH4 is largely underproduced for all codes except for UCLCHEM, for which a higher amount of atomic C is available during the initial translucent cloud phase. Large differences in the ice abundances are found at Tdust&lt;12 K between diffusive and non-diffusive chemistry codes. This is due to the fact that non-diffusive chemistry takes over diffusive chemistry at such low Tdust. This could explain the rather constant ice chemical composition found in Chamaeleon I and other dense cores despite the different visual extinctions probed.

<p>
We leverage JWST data from the COSMOS-Web Survey in order to provide updated measurements on the auto-power spectrum of the now resolved Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) and its coherence with the unresolved soft Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB) observed by Chandra at z &gt; 6. Maps of the CIB in the F277W and F444W NIRCam filters are constructed with sources fainter than AB mag = 25 and cross-correlated with the CXB in the [0.5-2] keV band. We find that on scales between 1 and 1000'' the CIB-CXB cross-power in both NIRCam filters is statistically significant with signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) of 4.80 and 6.20 respectively from redshifts 0 &lt; z &lt; 13. In our high-z (6 &lt; z &lt; 13) interval we find coherence in both filters with a S/N of 7.32 and 5.39 respectively. These results suggest that there are X-ray emitting galaxies resolved by JWST, including star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We fit the large-scale biasing of the IR sources producing the CIB as a function of z with results consistent with prior measurements and place constraints on the CXB flux and biasing at low- and high-z. The CXB flux measurements presented in this study suggest that approximately 94% of the [0.5-2] keV CXB is resolved, and this value is consistent within 2\sigma with the complete resolution of the [0.5-2] keV CXB.

### 9) [2502.09384](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09384v1): Predicting the detectability of sulphur-bearing molecules in the solid phase with simulated spectra of JWST instruments

To date, gas phase observations of sulphur in dense interstellar environments have only constrained the molecular carriers of 1% of its predicted cosmic abundance. An additional 5% is known to be locked up in molecular solids in dense clouds, leaving the main reservoir of depleted sulphur in the solid phase unknown. The spectral resolution and sensitivity of the JWST could make a substantial difference in detecting part of this missing sulphur, with its wavelength coverage that includes vibrational absorption features of the S-carriers H2S, OCS, SO2, CS2, SO, CS, and S8. The aim of this study is to determine whether these molecules may be viable candidates for detection. We carried out new laboratory measurements of the IR absorption spectra of CS2 and S8 to update the IR band strength of the most intense CS2 absorption feature at 6.8 {&mu;}m, as well as to determine that of S8 at 20.3 {&mu;}m for the first time. These data, along with values previously reported in the literature, allow us to evaluate which S-bearing species could be potentially detected with JWST in interstellar ices. Taking the literature abundances of the major ice species determined by previous IR observations towards starless cores, LYSOs and MYSOs, we generated simulated IR spectra using the characteristics of the instruments on the JWST. Thus, we have been able to establish a case study for three stages of the star formation process. We conclude that the detection of S-bearing molecules remains challenging. Despite these obstacles, the detection of H2S and potentially SO2 should be possible in regions with favourable physical and chemical conditions. In contrast, S8 would remain undetected. Although the sensitivity of JWST is insufficient to determine the sulphur budget in the solid state, the detection of an additional icy sulphur compound (H2S, SO2) would enable us to elevate our knowledge of sulphur chemistry.

### 10) [2502.08885](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08885v1): Morphological Demographics of Galaxies at z~ 10-16: Log-Normal Size Distribution and Exponential Profiles Consistent with the Disk Formation Scenario

We homogeneously investigate the morphological properties of 169 galaxies at z~10-16 with deep JWST NIRCam images employing our established techniques of GALFIT modeling and uncertainty evaluation (systematics+statistics). We obtain effective radii r_{\rm e} ranging 20-500 pc, with a distribution significantly broader than the scatter made by the uncertainties. We find that the r_{\rm e} distribution is well described by a log-normal distribution with a mean of r_{\rm e}=133^{+13}_{-12} pc and a standard deviation of \sigma_{{\rm ln}r_{\rm e}} = 0.52 \pm 0.08. The standard deviation is comparable to that of local galaxies, indicating no significant evolution over z~ 0-10. We estimate the virial radius r_{\rm vir} from the stellar masses via the star-formation main sequence and stellar-to-halo mass relation, obtaining a stellar-to-halo size ratio r_{\rm e}/r_{\rm vir} = 0.015^{+0.015}_{-0.005}, which is comparable to those of star-forming galaxies in the local and low-z Universe. Our results of 1) the log-normal r_{\rm e} distribution, 2) the standard deviation value, and 3) a mean radial profile consistent with an exponential profile (n=1.3\pm0.6) suggest that galaxies at z~10-16 generally follow the classical galaxy disk formation scenario with a specific disk angular momentum fraction of j_{\rm d} / m_{\rm d} ~ 0.5-1. Interestingly, we identify two remarkable outliers GN-z11 (z_{\rm spec}=10.60) and GHZ2 (z_{\rm spec}=12.34) with r_{\rm e}=55^{+5}_{-6} pc and 39\pm11 pc, respectively, that may not be explained by disk structures but by AGN or compact star-forming galaxies merging underway in short periods of time, as reproduced in numerical simulations.

### 11) [2502.08701](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08701v1): Early Galaxies from Rare Inflationary Processes and JWST Observations

<p> Soubhik Kumar, Neal Weiner </p>
<p>
Rare Poisson processes (PP) during cosmic inflation can lead to signatures that are localized in position space and are not well captured by the standard two- or higher-point correlation functions of primordial density perturbations. As an example, PP can lead to localized overdense regions that are far denser than the ones produced through standard inflationary fluctuations. As a result, such overdense regions collapse earlier than expected based on the standard \LambdaCDM model and would host anomalously high-redshift galaxies. We describe some general aspects of such PP and consider a particular realization in the context of inflationary particle production. We then show that the masses and redshifts of the resulting galaxies can lie in a range discoverable by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and future surveys, while being consistent with existing constraints on the matter power spectrum and UV luminosity functions at lower redshifts.

In the centers of many galaxy clusters, the hot (~10^7 K) intracluster medium (ICM) can become dense enough that it should cool on short timescales. However, the low measured star formation rates in massive central galaxies and absence of soft X-ray lines from cooling gas suggest that most of this gas never cools - this is known as the "cooling flow problem." The latest observations suggest that black hole jets are maintaining the vast majority of gas at high temperatures. A cooling flow has yet to be fully mapped through all gas phases in any galaxy cluster. Here, we present new observations of the Phoenix cluster using the James Webb Space Telescope to map the [Ne VI] \lambda7.652&mu;m emission line, allowing us to probe gas at 10^{5.5} K on large scales. These data show extended [Ne VI] emission cospatial with (i) the cooling peak in the ICM, (ii) the coolest gas phases, and (iii) sites of active star formation. Taken together, these imply a recent episode of rapid cooling, causing a short-lived spike in the cooling rate which we estimate to be 5,000-23,000 M_\odot yr^{-1}. These data provide the first large-scale map of gas at temperatures between 10^5-10^6 K in a cluster core, and highlight the critical role that black hole feedback plays in not only regulating but also promoting cooling.

The methylidyne cation (CH^+) and the methyl cation (CH_3^+) are building blocks of organic molecules, yet their coupled formation and excitation mechanisms remain mainly unprobed. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its high spatial resolution and good spectral resolution, provides unique access to the detection of these molecules. Our goal is to use the first detection of CH^+ and CH_3^+ rovibrational emission in the Orion Bar and in the protoplanetary disk d203-506, irradiated by the Trapezium cluster, to probe their formation and excitation mechanisms and constrain the physico-chemical conditions. We use spectro-imaging acquired using both the NIRSpec and MIRI-MRS instruments to study the CH^+ and CH_3^+ spatial distribution at very small scales, and compare it to excited H_2 emission. CH^+ and CH_3^+ emissions originate from the same region as highly excited H_2. Our comparison between the Bar and d203-506 reveals that both CH^+ and CH_3^+ excitation and/or formation are highly dependent on gas density. The excitation temperature of the observed CH^+ and CH_3^+ rovibrational lines is around T ~ 1500 K in the Bar and T ~ 800 K in d203-506. Moreover, the column densities derived from the rovibrational emission are less than 0.1 % of the total known (CH^+) and expected (CH_3^+) column densities. These results show that CH^+ and CH_3^+ level populations strongly deviate from ETL. CH^+ rovibrational emission can be explained by chemical formation pumping with excited H_2 via C^+ + H_2^* = CH^+ + H. These results support a gas phase formation pathway of CH^+ and CH_3^+ via successive hydrogen abstraction reactions. However, we do not find any evidence of CH_2^+ emission in the JWST spectrum. Finally, observed CH^+ intensities coupled with chemical formation pumping model provide a diagnostic tool to trace the local density.

### 14) [2502.08113](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08113v1): Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon and the Ultraviolet Extinction Bump at the Cosmic Dawn

<p> Qi Lin, Xuejuan Yang, Aigen Li, Joris Witstok </p>
<p>
First detected in 1965, the mysterious ultraviolet (UV) extinction bump at 2175 Angstrom is the most prominent spectroscopic feature superimposed on the interstellar extinction curve. Its carrier remains unidentified over the past six decades ever since its first detection, although many candidate materials have been proposed. Widely seen in the interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way as well as several nearby galaxies, this bump was recently also detected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at the cosmic dawn in JADES-GS-z6-0, a distant galaxy at redshift z~6.71, corresponding to a cosmic age of just 800 million years after the Big Bang. Differing from that of the known Galactic and extragalactic interstellar sightlines which always peak at ~2175 Angstrom, the bump seen at z~6.71 in JADES-GS-z6-0 peaks at an appreciably longer wavelength of ~2263 Angstrom and is the narrowest among all known Galactic and extragalactic extinction bumps. Here we show that the combined electronic absorption spectra quantum-chemically computed for a number of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules closely reproduce the bump detected by JWST in JADES-GS-z6-0. This suggests that PAH molecules have already been pervasive in the Universe at an epoch when asymptotic giant branch stars have not yet evolved to make dust.

### 15) [2502.08112](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08112v1): What causes the ultraviolet extinction bump at the cosmic dawn?

<p> Qi Li, Xuejuan Yang, Aigen Li </p>
<p>
The enigmatic ultraviolet (UV) extinction bump at 2175 Angstrom, the strongest spectroscopic absorption feature superimposed on the interstellar extinction curve, has recently been detected at the cosmic dawn by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in JADES-GS-z6-0, a distant galaxy at redshift z=6.71, corresponding to a cosmic age of just 800 million years after the Big Bang. Although small graphite grains have historically long been suggested as the carrier of the 2175 Angstrom extinction bump and graphite grains are expected to have already been pervasive in the early Universe, in this work we demonstrate that small graphite grains are not responsible for the UV extinction bump seen at the cosmic dawn in JADES-GS-z6-0, as the extinction bump arising from small graphite grains is too broad and peaks at wavelengths that are too short to be consistent with what is seen in JADES-GS-z6-0.

### 16) [2502.07882](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07882v1): A Sizable Discrepancy in Ground-Based JAGB Distances to Nearby Galaxies

<p> Gagandeep S. Anand </p>
<p>
Recently, Freedman et al. (2024) report agreement of distances derived from the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) and the J-Region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) at the 1&percnt; level for both nearby galaxies with ground-based imaging (0.5-4 Mpc) as well distant galaxies with JWST imaging (7-23 Mpc). Here we compare the same ground-based JAGB distances to uniformly reduced space-based optical TRGB distances from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We uncover a significant offset between these two distance scales of \Delta&mu; = 0.17 \pm 0.04 (stat) \pm 0.06 (sys) mag (9&percnt; in distance), with the HST TRGB distances being further. Inspections of the HST color-magnitude diagrams make a compelling case that the issue lies in the underlying JAGB distances. The source of the disagreement may lie with the lower resolution or photometric calibration of the ground-based near-infrared data, a contrast to the general agreement found between JWST JAGB and other space-based, second-rung distance indicators (Cepheids, Miras, TRGB) presented within Riess et al. (2024). High-resolution, near-infrared observations from an ongoing HST program will enable the simultaneous measurement of Cepheid, JAGB, and TRGB distances in four of these nearby galaxies and allow us to investigate whether the discrepancy noted here is due to ground-based observational systematics, or something intrinsic to the JAGB method relevant for this particular sample. A resolution of this discrepancy is required if the JAGB is to be used to determine a highly precise local value of the Hubble constant.

### 17) [2502.07875](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07875v2): Investigating photometric and spectroscopic variability in the multiply-imaged Little Red Dot A2744-QSO1

<p>
JWST observations have uncovered a new population of red, compact objects at high redshifts dubbed 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs), which typically show broad emission lines and are thought to be dusty Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Some of their other features, however, challenge the AGN explanation, such as prominent Balmer breaks and extremely faint or even missing metal high-ionization lines, X-ray, or radio emission, including in deep stacks. Time variability is a unique test of AGN activity. Here, we exploit the z=7.045 multiply-imaged LRD A2744-QSO1, which offers a unique test of variability due to lensing-induced time delays between the three images spanning 22 yr (2.7 yr in the rest-frame), to investigate its photometric and spectroscopic variability. We find the equivalent widths (EWs) of the broad H\alpha and H\beta lines, which are independent of magnification and other systematics, to exhibit significant variations, up to 18\pm3 % for H\alpha and up to 22\pm8 % in H\beta, on a timescale of 875 d (2.4 yr) in the rest-frame. This suggests that A2744-QSO1 is indeed an AGN. We find no significant photometric variability beyond the limiting systematic uncertainties, so it currently cannot be determined whether the EW variations are due to line-flux or continuum variability. These results are consistent with a typical damped random walk (DRW) variability model for an AGN like A2744-QSO1 (M_{\mathrm{BH}}=4\times10^7 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}) given the sparse sampling of the light-curve with the available data. Our results therefore support the AGN interpretation of this LRD, and highlight the need for further photometric and spectroscopic monitoring in order to build a detailed and reliable light-curve.

<p>
Nearby blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCDs) share similar properties with objects from the Epoch of Reionization revealed by JWST, in terms of low stellar mass, low metallicity and high specific star-formation rate. Thus, they represent ideal local laboratories for detailed multi-wavelength studies to understand their properties and the mechanisms shaping them. We report the first JWST MIRI/MRS observations of the BCD SBS 0335-052 E, analyzing MIR emission lines tracing different levels of ionization (e.g., [NeII], [SIV], [NeIII], [OIV], [NeV]) of the ionized gas. SBS 0335-052 E MIR emission is characterized by a bright point source, located in one of the youngest and most embedded stellar clusters (t~3 Myr, A_V~20), and underlying extended high-ionization emission (i.e., [OIV], [NeV]) from the surroundings of the older and less dusty stellar clusters (t&lt; 20 Myr, A_V~8). From the comparison with state-of-the-art models, we can exclude shocks, X-ray binaries, and old stellar populations as the main sources of the high ionization. Interestingly, a 4-16% contribution of a ~10^5 M_\odot intermediate massive black hole (IMBH) is needed to justify the strong [NeV]/[NeII] and would be consistent with optical/UV line ratios from previous studies. However, even IMBH models cannot explain the strongest [OIV]/[NeIII]. Also, star-forming models (regardless of including X-ray binaries) struggle to reproduce even the lower ionization line ratios (e.g., [SIV]/[NeII]) typically observed in BCDs. Overall, while current models suggest the need to account for an accreting IMBH in this high-z analog, limitations still exist in predicting high-ionization emission lines (I.P. &gt;54 eV) when modeling these low-metallicity environments, thus other sources of ionization cannot be fully ruled out.

Aims: The relative roles of the physical mechanisms involved in quenching galaxy star formation are still unclear. We tackle this fundamental problem with our cosmological semi-empirical model DECODE (Discrete statistical sEmi-empiriCal mODEl), designed to predict galaxy stellar mass assembly histories, from minimal input assumptions. Methods: Specifically, in this work the star formation history of each galaxy is calculated along its progenitor dark matter halo by assigning at each redshift a star formation rate extracted from a monotonic star formation rate-halo accretion rate (SFR-HAR) relation derived from abundance matching between the (observed) SFR function and the (numerically predicted) HAR function, a relation that is also predicted by the TNG100 simulation. SFRs are integrated across cosmic time to build up the mass of galaxies, which may halt their star formation following input physical quenching recipes. Results: In this work we test the popular halo quenching scenario and we find that: 1) the assumption of a monotonic relation between SFR and HAR allows to reproduce the number densities of the bulk of star-forming galaxies in the local Universe; 2) the halo quenching is sufficient to reproduce the statistics of the quenched galaxies and flat (steep) high-mass end of the SMHM relation (SMF); and 3) to align with the observed steep (flat) low-mass end of the SMHM (SMF) additional quenching processes in the least massive haloes are needed. Conclusions: DECODE is an invaluable tool and will pave the way to investigate the origin of newly observed high-redshift objects from the latest ongoing facilities such as JWST and Euclid.

<p>
We present first results from James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec), Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), and Keck Cosmic Webb Imager (KCWI) integral field spectroscopy of the powerful but highly obscured host-galaxy of the jetted radio source Cygnus A. We detect 169 infrared emission lines at 1.7--27 micron and explore the kinematics and physical properties of the extended narrow-line region (NLR) in unprecedented detail. The density-stratified NLR appears to be shaped by the initial blow-out and ongoing interaction of the radio jet with the interstellar medium, creating a multi-phase bicone with a layered structure composed of molecular and ionized gas. The NLR spectrum, with strong coronal emission at kpc-scale, is well-modeled by AGN photoionization. We find evidence that the NLR is rotating around the radio axis, perhaps mediated by magnetic fields and driven by angular momentum transfer from the radio jet. The overall velocity field of the NLR is well described by 250 km/s outflow along biconical spiral flow lines, combining both rotation and outflow signatures. There is particularly bright [Fe II] 1.644 micron emission from a dense, high-velocity dispersion, photoionized clump of clouds found near the projected radio axis. Outflows of 600--2000 km/s are found in bullets and streamers of ionized gas that may be ablated by the radio jet from these clouds, driving a local outflow rate of 40 Msun/yr.

### 21) [2502.06254](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06254v1): Classifying merger stages with adaptive deep learning and cosmological hydrodynamical simulations

<p> Rosa de Graaff, Berta Margalef-Bentabol, Lingyu Wang, Antonio La Marca, William J. Pearson, Vicente Rodriguez-Gomez, Mike Walmsley </p>
<p>
Hierarchical merging of galaxies plays an important role in galaxy formation and evolution. Mergers could trigger key evolutionary phases such as starburst activities and active accretion periods onto supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies. We aim to detect mergers and merger stages (pre- and post-mergers) across cosmic history and test whether it is better to detect mergers and their merger stages simultaneously or hierarchically. In addition, we want to test the impact of merger time relative to the coalescence of merging galaxies. First, we generated realistic mock JWST images of simulated galaxies selected from the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Then we trained deep learning (DL) models in the Zoobot Python package to classify galaxies into merging/non-merging galaxies and their merger stages. We used two different set-ups: (i) two-stage, in which we classify galaxies into mergers and non-mergers and then classify the mergers into pre-mergers and post-mergers, and (ii) one-stage, in which merger/non-merger and merger stages are classified simultaneously. We found that the one-stage classification set-up moderately outperforms the two-stage set-up, offering better overall accuracy and precision, particularly for the non-merger class. Pre-mergers can be classified with the highest precision in both set-ups, possibly due to the more recognisable merging features and the presence of merging companions. The image signal-to-noise ratio affects the performance of the DL classifiers, but not much after a certain threshold is crossed. Both precision and recall of the classifiers depend strongly on merger time, finding it more difficult to identify true mergers observed at stages that are more distant to coalescence. For pre-mergers, we recommend selecting mergers which will merge in the next 0.4 Gyrs, to achieve a good balance between precision and recall.

<p>
At cosmic dawn, the first stars and galaxies are believed to form from and be deeply embedded in clouds of dense, pristine gas. Here we present a study of the JWST/NIRSpec data of the most distant, spectroscopically confirmed galaxy observed to date, JADES-GS-z14-0 (GS-z14 for short), at z=14.179, combined with recent far-infrared measurements of the [OIII]-88&mu;m and [CII]-158&mu;m line transitions and underlying dust-continuum emission. Based on the observed prominent damped Lyman-\alpha (DLA) absorption profile, we determine a substantial neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) column density, \log (N_{\rm HI} / {\rm cm^{-2}}) = 22.27^{+0.08}_{-0.09}, consistent with previous estimates though seemingly at odds with the dynamical and gas mass of the galaxy. Using various independent but complementary approaches, considering the implied neutral gas mass from the DLA measurement, the star-formation rate surface density, and the metal abundance, we demonstrate that the total gas mass of GS-z14 is of the order \log (M_{\rm gas} / M_\odot) = 9.8\pm 0.3. This implies a substantial gas mass fraction, f_{\rm gas} \gtrsim 0.9 and that the bulk of the interstellar medium (ISM) is in the form of HI. We show that the derived gas mass is fully consistent with the non-detection of [CII]-158&mu;m, assuming an appropriate scaling to the neutral gas. The low dust-to-gas ratio, A_V/N_{\rm HI} = (1.3\pm 0.6)\times 10^{-23}\,mag\,cm^2, derived in the line-of-sight through the DLA further indicates that the absorbing gas is more pristine than the central, star-forming regions probed by the [OIII]-88&mu;m emission. These results highlight the implications for far-infrared line-detection searchers attainable with ALMA and demonstrate that the bright, relatively massive galaxy GS-z14 at z=14.179 is deeply embedded in a substantial, pristine HI gas reservoir dominating its baryonic matter content.

### 23) [2502.05751](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05751v1): On The Very Bright Dropouts Selected Using the James Webb Space Telescope NIRCam Instrument

<p> Bangzheng Sun, Haojing Yan </p>
<p>
The selection of candidate high-redshift galaxies using the dropout technique targeting the Lyman-break signature sometimes results in very bright objects, which would be too luminous to be easily explained if they are indeed at the expected redshifts. Here we present a systematic study of very bright dropouts selected through successive bands of the NIRCam instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Using the public NIRCam data in four blank fields over 500~arcmin^2, 300 such objects were found. They have magnitudes in F356W &lt;25.1~mag or &lt;26.0~mag depending on the dropout passband, and the vast majority of them (&gt;80&percnt;) have very red F115W-F356W colors &gt; 2.0~mag, which make them qualify as ``extremely red objects'' (EROs). We focus on the 137 objects that also have mid-IR observations from the JWST MIRI instrument. The analysis of their spectral energy distributions shows that these very bright dropouts are dominated by low-redshift (z~ 1--4) galaxies (\gtrsim 67&percnt;). However, a non-negligible fraction (\gtrsim 7&percnt;) could be at high redshifts. Seven of our objects have secure spectroscopic redshifts from the JWST NIRSpec identifications, and the results confirm this picture: while six are low-redshift galaxies at z\approx 3, one is a known galaxy at z=8.679 recovered in our sample. If more objects from our sample are confirmed to be at high redshifts, they could pose a severe challenge in explaining their properties, such as the extremely high star formation rates and stellar masses.

### 24) [2502.05266](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05266v1): Radio Signatures of a Massive Black Hole in GHZ9 at z ~ 10

<p> Muhammad A. Latif, Daniel J. Whalen </p>
<p>
Synergies between the {\em James Webb Space Telescope} ({\em JWST}) and the {\em Chandra} X-ray observatory have advanced the observational frontier by detecting a handful of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) beyond z ~ 10. In particular, the recent discovery of a candidate \rm 8 \times 10^7~M_{\odot} black hole (BH) in the galaxy GHZ9 at z = 10.4 favors massive seed formation channels for these objects. Motivated by prospects for their detection in radio by recent studies, we estimate radio fluxes for GHZ9 and explore the possibility of their detection with the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) and next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA). We find that ngVLA should be able to detect radio emission from GHZ9 for integration times as short as 1 hr while SKA will require integration times of up to 100 hr. We also find that radio emission from the BH can be distinguished from that due to H II regions and supernovae in its host galaxy. The detection of a few hundred nJy radio signal at frequencies &gt; 2 GHz will be a smoking gun for the presence of a BH in GHZ9.

### 25) [2502.05259](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05259v2): JAGB 2.0: Improved Constraints on the J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch-based Hubble Constant from an Expanded Sample of JWST Observations

<p> Siyang Li, Adam G. Riess, Daniel Scolnic, Stefano Casertano, Gagandeep S. Anand </p>
<p>
The J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) is an overdensity of stars in the near-infrared, attributed to carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars, and recently used as a standard candle for measuring extragalactic distances and the Hubble constant. Using JWST in Cycle 2, we extend JAGB measurements to 6 hosts of 9 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) (NGC 2525, NGC 3147, NGC 3370, NGC 3447, NGC 5468, and NGC 5861), with two at D ~ 40 Mpc, all calibrated by the maser host NGC 4258. We investigate the effects of incompleteness and find that we are unable to recover a robust JAGB measurement in one of the two most distant hosts at R ~ 40 Mpc, NGC 3147. We compile all JWST JAGB observations in SNe Ia hosts, 15 galaxies hosting 18 SNe Ia, from the SH0ES and CCHP programs and employ all literature measures (mode, mean, median, model). We find no significant mean difference between these distances and those from HST Cepheids, -0.03\pm0.02 (stat) \pm 0.05 (sys) mag. We find a difference of 0.11 \pm 0.02 mag between JAGB mode measurements in the CCHP analyses of two fields in NGC 4258, a feature also seen in two SH0ES fields (see field-to-field variations in Li et al. 2024a), indicating significant field-to-field variation of JAGB measurements in NGC 4258 which produce a large absolute calibration uncertainty. Variations are also seen in the shape of the JAGB LF across galaxies so that different measures produce different values of the Hubble constant. We look for but do not (yet) find a standardizing relation between JAGB LF skew or color dependence and the apparent variation. Using the middle result of all JAGB measures to calibrate SNe Ia yields a Hubble constant of H_0 = 73.3 \pm 1.4 (stat) \pm 2.0 (sys) km/s/Mpc with the systematic dominated by apparent differences across NGC 4258 calibrating fields or their measures.

### 26) [2502.05061](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05061v1): Emission from multiple molecular isotopologues in a high-inclination protoplanetary disk

<p> Colette Salyk, Klaus M. Pontoppidan, Andrea Banzatti, Edwin Bergin, Nicole Arulanantham, Joan Najita, Geoffrey A. Blake, John Carr, Ke Zhang, Chengyan Xie </p>
<p>
We present a MIRI-MRS spectrum of the high-inclination protoplanetary disk around the solar-mass (K0) star MY Lup, obtained as part of the JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey (JDISCS). The spectrum shows an unusually weak water emission spectrum for a disk around a star of its spectral type, but strong emission from CO_2, HCN, and isotopologues of both molecules. This includes the first ever detection of C^{18}O^{16}O and H^{13}CN in an inner disk, as well as tentative detections of C^{17}O^{16}O and HC^{15}N. Slab modeling provides molecular temperatures, column densities and emitting areas of the detected molecules. The emitting molecular gas is cold compared to that of other observed protoplanetary disk spectra. We estimate the isotopologue ratios of CO_2 and HCN, albeit with significant uncertainty. We suggest that the unusual spectrum of MY Lup arises from a combination of inner disk clearing, which removes emission from warm water, and its nearly edge-on inclination, which enhances line-of-sight column densities, although unusual chemistry may also be required. MY Lup's spectrum highlights the potential to detect and measure trace isotopologues to study isotopic fractionation in protoplanetary disks; observations at higher spectral resolving power is needed to constrain the isotopologue ratios to greater precision.

### 28) [2502.04817](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04817v1): Potential Nitrogen Enrichment via Direct-Collapse Wolf-Rayet Stars in a z=4.7 Star-Forming Galaxy

<p> Yechi Zhang, Takahiro Morishita, Massimo Stiavelli </p>
<p>
We present analyses of a nitrogen-enriched star-forming galaxy, ID60001, at z=4.6928 based on JWST/NIRSpec MSA spectroscopy and NIRCam photometry. From rest-frame optical emission lines we derive the nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) abundance ratio of ID60001 to be \log({\rm N/O})=-0.76_{-0.03}^{+0.03} ([{\rm N/O}]=0.10_{-0.03}^{+0.03}), which is significantly elevated at the corresponding metallicity 12+\log({\rm O/H})=7.75_{-0.01}^{+0.01} (Z/Z_\odot = 0.12) compared to local counterparts. We discuss possible scenarios for elevated N/O abundance in ID60001, including pristine gas inflow, Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, and Oxygen depletion by Type II supernova winds. Based on the moderately broadened He{\sc ii}\lambda4686 emission line, galaxy morphology, and star-formation history, we conclude that the elevated N/O abundance of ID60001 is likely originated from massive (&gt;25\,M_\odot) WR stars that directly collapse into a black hole. We also stress the importance of reliable electron density measurements when deriving N/O abundance with rest-frame optical emission lines.

<p>
A distinct power-law break is apparent m_AB approximately 21 in the deep Near-Infrared PEARLS-JWST galaxy counts. The break becomes more pronounced at longer wavelengths, with the counts slope flattening smoothly with apparent magnitude in the shortest band used at 0.9 microns, trending towards an increasingly broken slope by the longest wavelength passband of JWST NIRCam, 4.4 microns. This behaviour is remarkably well predicted by the GALFORM semi-analytical model of galaxy formation. We use the model to diagnose the origin of this behaviour. We find that the features that are responsible for the break are: 1) the inherent break in the luminosity function; 2) the change in the volume element with redshift and 3) the redshift-dependent nature of the k-correction. We study the contribution to these effects by early and late-type galaxies, using as a proxy for morphology the bulge-to-total stellar mass ratio. We find that the way in which ellipticals populate the bright end of the luminosity function while spirals dominate the faint end is preserved in the galaxy number counts, with a characteristic stellar mass at the break of approximately 10^10 M_sun. We also find that the shape of the number counts is mainly driven by galaxies with relatively low redshift (z &lt; 2) for the PEARLS observational limit of m_AB &lt; 28. We give a comprehensive description of why the galaxy number counts in the near-infrared PEARLS-JWST observation look the way they do and which population of galaxies is dominant at each apparent magnitude.

### 30) [2502.04435](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04435v1): 1000-10,000 M_\odot Primordial Stars Created the Nitrogen Excess in the Galaxy GS 3073 at z = 5.55

<p> Devesh Nandal, Daniel J. Whalen, Muhammad A. Latif, Alexander Heger </p>
<p>
The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope has revealed a wealth of new galaxies just a few hundred Myr after the Big Bang. Some of these galaxies exhibit unusual elemental abundances that are difficult to explain with stellar populations today. While Wolf-Rayet stars in multiple-burst populations, very massive or rapidly-rotating primordial stars, general relativistic explosions of metal-enriched supermassive stars, or the precursors of globular clusters can in principle account for the supersolar nitrogen to oxygen ratios in the galaxies GN-z11 and CEERS 1019, no known stars or supernovae can explain the far higher N/O ratio of 0.46 in GS 3073 at redshift z = 5.55. Here we show that the extreme nitrogen abundances in GS 3073 can be produced by 1000 - 10,000 M_{\odot} primordial (Pop III) stars. We find that these are the only candidates that can account for its large N/O ratios and its C/O and Ne/O ratios. GS 3073 is thus the first conclusive evidence in the fossil abundance record of the existence of supermassive Pop III stars at cosmic Dawn.

### 31) [2502.03742](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03742v1): Radio emission from little red dots may reveal their true nature

<p> Muhammad A. Latif, Ammara Aftab, Daniel J. Whalen, Mar Mezcua </p>
<p>
The unprecedented sensitivity of the \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} (\textit{JWST}) has revolutionized our understanding of the early universe. Among the most intriguing \textit{JWST} discoveries are red, very compact objects showing broad line emission features nicknamed as little red dots (LRDs). The discovery of LRDs has triggered great interest about their origin as either extremely starbursting galaxies or highly-obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN). Their exact nature still remains unknown. The goal of this work is to estimate the radio emission from LRDs and predict which radio surveys would detect them. To achieve these objectives, we employ the fundamental plane of black hole (BH) accretion to estimate radio emission from AGN and the stellar radio fluxes from their host galaxies. We assume a range of BH mass, X-ray luminosity (\rm L_{X}) and star formation rate (SFR) to bracket the likely properties of LRDs. Our findings suggest that BH radio fluxes from LRDs are 10-100 times higher than the stellar fluxes from their host galaxies, depending on BH mass, \rm L_X and SFR. The detection of a ~ 500 nJy signal above 2 GHz at z \geq 5 or a ~ 2000 nJy flux at z = 3-4 would be a smoking gun for the presence of AGN provided that SFRs in the host galaxies are \rm &lt; 30~ M_{\odot} ~yr^{-1}. We find that LRDs are most likely radio quiet AGN otherwise would have been already detected in the current radio surveys. Our findings suggest that LRDs can be detected with the upcoming radio observatories such as ngVLA and SKA with integration times of 10-100 hrs, respectively.

### 32) [2502.03683](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03683v1): Ruling out AGNs as the dominant source of cosmic reionization with JWST

<p> Danyang Jiang, Linhua Jiang, Shengxiu Sun, Weiyang Liu, Shuqi Fu </p>
<p>
Cosmic reionization represents the latest phase transition of the intergalactic medium (IGM) in the Universe. It has long been debated whether galaxies or active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are the major source of Lyman continuum (LyC) photons responsible for reionization. Previous observations slightly favored galaxies as the major ionizing source. However, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) recently discovered an unexpectedly high density of AGN candidates at high redshift, which has largely enhanced the influence of AGNs. Here we derive a definitive upper bound on the AGN contribution to reionization using the latest JWST data, and conclusively rule out AGNs as the dominant ionizing source during the epoch of reionization (EoR). We build a sample of objects (including galaxies and AGNs) in a specific redshift range between 7.15 and 7.75 that has a high completeness. Each object is then decomposed into a point-source component and an extended component in their rest-frame far-UV JWST images. Assuming all point-source components are AGNs, we obtain an absolute upper limit for the density of the AGN population. This fiducial AGN sample reaches an unprecedentedly low luminosity of M_{\rm UV} \approx -15 mag. Based on this sample, we find that AGNs can contribute at most one third of the LyC photons required to ionize the Universe in this redshift range. Our result implies that galaxies dominate the ionizing source during the EoR.

<p> Peter Xiangyuan Ma, Keir K. Rogers, Ting S. Li, Renée Hložek, Jeremy Webb, Ruth Huang, Julian Meunier </p>
<p>
The phase space of stellar streams is proposed to detect dark substructure in the Milky Way through the perturbations created by passing subhalos - and thus is a powerful test of the cold dark matter paradigm and its alternatives. Using graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) data compression and simulation-based inference (SBI) on a simulated GD-1-like stream, we improve the constraint on the mass of a [10^8, 10^7, 10^6] M_\odot perturbing subhalo by factors of [11, 7, 3] with respect to the current state-of-the-art density power spectrum analysis. We find that the GCNN produces posteriors that are more accurate (better calibrated) than the power spectrum. We simulate the positions and velocities of stars in a GD-1-like stream and perturb the stream with subhalos of varying mass and velocity. Leveraging the feature encoding of the GCNN to compress the input phase space data, we then use SBI to estimate the joint posterior of the subhalo mass and velocity. We investigate how our results scale with the size of the GCNN, the coordinate system of the input and the effect of incomplete observations. Our results suggest that a survey with 10 \times fewer stars (300 stars) with complete 6-D phase space data performs about as well as a deeper survey (3000 stars) with only 3-D data (photometry, spectroscopy). The stronger constraining power and more accurate posterior estimation motivate further development of GCNNs in combining future photometric, spectroscopic and astrometric stream observations.

We use JWST Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) observations from the the Cosmic Evolution Early Release survey (CEERS), GLASS-JWST ERS (GLASS), and JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) to measure rest-frame optical emission-line ratios of 90 galaxies at z&gt;4. The stacked spectra of galaxies with and without a broad-line feature reveal a difference in the [OIII]\lambda 4363 and H\gamma ratios. This motivated our investigation of the [OIII]/H\gamma vs [NeIII]/[OII] diagram. We define two AGN/SF classification lines based on 1869 SDSS galaxies at z~0. After applying a redshift correction to the AGN/SF lines we find 76.8% of BLAGN continue to land in the AGN region of the diagnostic largely due to the [NeIII]/[OII] ratio. However, 40.2% of non-BLAGN land in the AGN region as well, this could be due to star forming galaxies having harder ionization of there are narrow line AGN which are not accounted for. This indicates the potential of the [NeIII]/[OII] ratio to continue classifying galaxies to z~6. We further inspect galaxies without broad emission lines in each region of [OIII]/H\gamma vs [NeIII]/[OII] diagram and found that they have slightly stronger CIII]\lambda1908 fluxes and equivalent width when landing in the BLAGN region. However, the cause of this higher ionization is unclear. Additionally, we find that BLAGN are characterized by a higher ionization (at constant electron temperature) compared to non-broad line galaxies.

<p>
Recent work with JWST has demonstrated its capability to identify and chemically characterize multiple populations in globular clusters down to the H-burning limit. In this study, we explore the kinematics of multiple populations in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae by combining data from JWST, HST, and Gaia. We analyzed velocity dispersion and anisotropy profiles from the cluster center out to ~10R_h. Our findings indicate that while 1G stars are isotropic, 2G stars are significantly radially anisotropic. These results align with the predictions of simulations of the dynamical evolution of clusters where 2G stars are initially more centrally concentrated than 1G stars. Furthermore, we subdivided the 2G population into two subpopulations: 2G_A and 2G_B, with the latter being more chemically extreme. We compared their dynamical profiles and found no significant differences. For the first time, we measured the degree of energy equipartition among the multiple populations of 47 Tucanae. Overall, within the analyzed radial range (~2-4R_h), both populations exhibit a low degree of energy equipartition. The most significant differences between 1G and 2G stars are observed in the tangential velocity component, where 2G stars are characterized by a stronger degree of energy equipartition than 1G stars. In the radial component, the behavior of 1G and 2G stars is more variable, with differences largely dependent on radius. Finally, our analysis reveals that the ratio of rotational velocity to velocity dispersion is larger for the 2G population, while 1G stars exhibit higher skewness in their tangential proper motions, providing further evidence of differences in the kinematic properties of the 1G and 2G populations.

Carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet binaries are a prominent source of carbonaceous dust that contribute to the dust budget of galaxies. The "textbook" example of an episodic dust producing WR binary, WR140 (HD193793), provides us with an ideal laboratory for investigating the dust physics and kinematics in an extreme environment. This study is among the first to utilize two separate JWST observations, from Cycle 1 ERS (July 2022) and Cycle 2 (Sept. 2023), to measure WR140's dust kinematics and confirm its morphology. To measure the proper motions and projected velocities of the dust shells, we performed a novel PSF subtraction to reduce the effects of the bright diffraction spikes and carefully aligned the Cycle 2 to the Cycle 1 images. At 7.7 &mu;m, through the bright feature common to 16 dust shells (C1), we find an average dust shell proper motion of 390\pm29 mas yr^{-1}, which equates to a projected velocity of 2714\pm188 km s^{-1} at a distance of 1.64 kpc. Our measured speeds are constant across all visible shells and consistent with previously reported dust expansion velocities. Our observations not only prove that these dusty shells are astrophysical (i.e., not associated with any PSF artifact) and originate from WR140, but also confirm the "clumpy" morphology of the dust shells, in which identifiable substructures within certain shells persist for at least 14 months from one cycle to the next. These results support the hypothesis that clumping in the wind collision region is required for dust production in WR binaries.

### 37) [2502.02647](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02647v1): Synergising semi-analytical models and hydrodynamical simulations to interpret JWST data from the first billion years

<p> Valentin Mauerhofer, Pratika Dayal, Martin G. Haehnelt, Taysun Kimm, Joakim Rosdahl, Romain Teyssier </p>
<p>
The field of high redshift galaxy formation has been revolutionised by JWST, which is yielding unprecedented insights on galaxy assembly at early times. Our key aim is to study the physical mechanisms that can explain the unexpected abundance of bright galaxies at z \geq 11, as well as their metal enrichment and spectral properties. We also use recent data to determine the key sources of reionisation. To do so, we implement cold gas fractions and star formation efficiencies derived from the SPHINX20 high-resolution radiation-hydrodynamics simulation into DELPHI, a semi-analytic model that tracks the assembly of dark matter halos and their baryonic components from z ~ 4.5-40. In addition, we explore two different methodologies to boost galaxy luminosities at z \geq 11: a stellar initial mass function (IMF) that becomes increasingly top-heavy with decreasing metallicity and increasing redshift (eIMF model), and star formation efficiencies that increase with increasing redshift (eSFE model). Our key findings are: (i) both the eIMF and eSFE models can explain the abundance of bright galaxies at z \geq 11; (ii) dust attenuation plays an important role for the bright-end of the UV LF at z \leq 11; (iii) the mass-metallicity relation is in place as early as z ~ 17 in all models although its slope is model-dependent; (iv) within the spread of both models and observations, all of our models are in good agreement with current estimates of \beta slopes at z ~ 5-17 and Balmer break strengths at z ~ 6-10; (v) in the eIMF model, galaxies at z\geq12 or with \rm{M_{UV}}\geq-18 show values of \xi_{\rm{ion}} ~ 10^{25.55}~{\rm [Hz~erg^{-1}]}, twice larger than in other models; (vi) star formation in galaxies below 10^{9}\rm{M_{\odot}} is the key driver of reionisation, providing the bulk (~ 85&percnt;) of ionising photons down to its midpoint at z ~ 7.

<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revolutionizing our understanding of the Universe by unveiling faint, near-infrared dropouts previously beyond our reach, ranging from exceptionally dusty sources to galaxies up to redshift z ~ 14. In this paper, we identify F200W-dropout objects in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey which are absent from existing catalogs. Our selection method can effectively identify obscured low-mass (\log \text{M}_* \leq 9) objects at z \leq 6, massive dust-rich sources up to z ~ 12, and ultra-high-redshift (z &gt; 15) candidates. Primarily relying on NIRCam photometry from the latest CEERS data release and supplementing with Mid-Infrared/(sub-)mm data when available, our analysis pipeline combines multiple SED-fitting codes, star formation histories, and CosMix - a novel tool for astronomical stacking. Our work highlights three 2&lt;z&lt;3 dusty dwarf galaxies which have larger masses compared to the typical dusty dwarfs previously identified in CEERS. Additionally, we reveal five faint sources with significant probability of lying above z&gt;15, with best-fit masses compatible with \LambdaCDM and a standard baryons-to-star conversion efficiency. Their bi-modal redshift probability distributions suggest they could also be z&lt;1.5 dwarf galaxies with extreme dust extinction. We also identify a strong line emitter galaxy at z ~ 5 mimicking the near-infrared emission of a z ~ 13 galaxy. Our sample holds promising candidates for future follow-ups. Confirming ultra high-redshift galaxies or lower-z dusty dwarfs will offer valuable insights into early galaxy formation, evolution with their central black holes and the nature of dark matter, and/or cosmic dust production mechanisms in low-mass galaxies, and will help us to understand degeneracies and contamination in high-z object searches.

### 39) [2502.01895](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01895v1): Turbulent gas-rich discs at high redshift: origin of thick stellar discs through 3D 'baryon sloshing'

<p> Joss Bland-Hawthorn, Thor Tepper-Garcia, Oscar Agertz, Christoph Federrath, Misha Haywood, Paola di Matteo, Timothy R Bedding, Takafumi Tsukui, Emily Wisnioski, Melissa Ness, Ken Freeman </p>
<p>
In response to recent observations from JWST and ALMA, we explore a new class of dynamically self-consistent models using our AGAMA/Ramses hydrodynamic N-body framework (Nexus) that mimics a plausible progenitor of the Milky Way over a wide range of disc gas fractions (f_{\rm gas} = 0-100&percnt;). The high gas surface densities encourage vigorous star formation, which in turn couples with the gas to drive turbulence. We show that this coupling through momentum recoil drives 'baryon sloshing,' i.e. a random walk of the baryonic potential minimum with respect to the centre of the total gravitational potential, \Phi_{\rm tot}. The amplitude of the bulk motion depends on the strength of the feedback, which in turn is directly associated with f_{\rm gas}. At its most extreme, when gas is the sole contributor to the disc potential (f_{\rm gas}=100%), the amplitude of the walk can reach up to R\approx 5 kpc and \vert z\vert \approx 1 kpc within \Phi_{\rm tot}(R,\phi,z). Consistent with observations, the disc dominates over dark matter (f_{\rm disc}\gtrsim 50%) within R_s=2.2 R_{\rm disc}, where R_{\rm disc} is the exponential disc scale length. For a lower f_{\rm disc} and/or f_{\rm gas}, the 3D sloshing amplitude and velocity are reduced. The combination of strong feedback (which unbinds the disc) and sloshing leads to the newly formed stars being dynamically heated and settling to a more spatially extended disc population. The 3D heating process is isotropic but its effects are more noticeable in \vert z\vert due to the initial dynamical coldness of the star-forming disc. Such a disc has enhanced [\alpha/Fe] stellar abundances and a vertical (but no radial) gradient in stellar age and metallicity, both consistent with the Milky Way's thick stellar disc. Contrary to earlier claims, star formation in a stationary turbulent disc does not produce thick stellar discs.

### 40) [2502.01868](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01868v1): ADF22-WEB: ALMA and JWST (sub)kpc-scale views of dusty star-forming galaxies in a z\approx3 proto-cluster

<p> Hideki Umehata, Mariko Kubo, Ian Smail, Bret D. Lehmer, Erik B. Monson, Kouichiro Nakanishi, Yuichi Matsuda </p>
<p>
We present a morphological analysis of ALMA and JWST NIRCam images of nine dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at zspec=3.09, all embedded within the cosmic web filaments at the SSA22 proto-cluster core. The ALMA 870um and 1.1mm images are obtained at spatial resolutions ranging from 0.5" to 0.05" (350 pc at z=3.09). The high-resolution images enable us to resolve inner structures traced by dust continuum, identifying compact dusty cores, clumps, and offset ridges within bars. Sersic profile fit was performed for both ALMA 870um and NIRCam F444W images at comparable resolutions (0.15"). The Sersic index measured for 870um, masking bright regions, indicates values close to unity, suggesting that dust emission arises from disks with superimposed compact core components. For the JWST F444W images (restframe 1um), the Sersic indices range between nF444W = 1-3, pointing to the coexistence of bulges and stellar disks in these DSFGs. A comparison of dust mass surface density, nF444W, and F200W-F444W color (restframe 0.5-1um) reveals diversity among the DSFGs, likely reflecting different evolutionary stages including some DSFGs with red cores, indicating ongoing rapid bulge growth phases heavily obscured by dust. The predominantly disk-like morphologies observed in most DSFGs in the proto-cluster core contrast sharply with early-type morphologies that dominate the highest density environment in the local universe. This suggests that we are witnessing the early formation of the morphology-density relation, as massive galaxies undergo rapid growth as late-type galaxies fueled by cosmic web gas filaments.

### 41) [2502.01840](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01840v1): Direct imaging of AGN outflows and their origin with the 23 m Large Binocular Telescope

<p>
Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are a key component of galaxy evolution due to feedback on the host from its supermassive black hole. The morphology of warm, in- and outflowing dusty material can reveal the nature of the onset of feedback, AGN feeding, and the unified model of AGN. Here we use the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) to image the dense, obscuring disk and extended dusty outflow region of NGC 1068. In Fizeau imaging mode the LBTI synthesizes the equivalent resolution of a 22.8 m telescope. The 8.7 &mu;m Fizeau images of NGC 1068 {have an effective resolution of 47\times90 mas (3.3\times6.2 pc)} in a 5" field of view after performing PSF deconvolution techniques described here. This is the only extragalactic source to be Fizeau imaged using the LBTI, and the images bridge the scales measured with the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI; 0.5-5 pc) and those of single telescopes such as JWST and Keck (&gt;15 pc). The images detect and spatially resolve the low surface brightness mid-infrared (MIR) features in the AGN disk/wind region that are over-resolved by the VLTI. The images show strong correlation between MIR dust emission and near-infrared (NIR) emission of highly excited atomic lines observed by SINFONI. Such LBTI imaging is a precursor to infrared imaging using the upcoming generation of extremely large telescopes, with angular resolutions up to 6x better than JWST, the largest space telescope in orbit.

<p>
We perform an MMT/Hectospec redshift survey of the North Ecliptic Pole Wide (NEPW) field covering 5.4 square degrees, and use it to estimate the photometric redshifts for the sources without spectroscopic redshifts. By combining 2572 newly measured redshifts from our survey with existing data from the literature, we create a large sample of 4421 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the NEPW field. Using this sample, we estimate photometric redshifts of 77755 sources in the band-merged catalog of the NEPW field with a random forest model. The estimated photometric redshifts are generally consistent with the spectroscopic redshifts, with a dispersion of 0.028, an outlier fraction of 7.3%, and a bias of -0.01. We find that the standard deviation of the prediction from each decision tree in the random forest model can be used to infer the fraction of catastrophic outliers and the measurement uncertainties. We test various combinations of input observables, including colors and magnitude uncertainties, and find that the details of these various combinations do not change the prediction accuracy much. As a result, we provide a catalog of 77755 sources in the NEPW field, which includes both spectroscopic and photometric redshifts up to z~2. This dataset has significant legacy value for studies in the NEPW region, especially with upcoming space missions such as JWST, Euclid, and SPHEREx.

### 43) [2502.00574](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00574v1): Predicting the number density of heavy seed massive black holes due to an intense Lyman-Werner field

<p> Hannah O'Brennan, John A. Regan, John Brennan, Joe McCaffrey, John H. Wise, Eli Visbal, Michael L. Norman </p>
<p>
The recent detections of a large number of candidate active galactic nuclei at high redshift (i.e. z \gtrsim 4) has increased speculation that heavy seed massive black hole formation may be a required pathway. Here we re-implement the so-called Lyman-Werner (LW) channel model of Dijkstra et al. (2014) to calculate the expected number density of massive black holes formed through this channel. We further enhance this model by extracting information relevant to the model from the \texttt{Renaissance} simulation suite. \texttt{Renaissance} is a high-resolution suite of simulations ideally positioned to probe the high-z universe. Finally, we compare the LW-only channel against other models in the literature. We find that the LW-only channel results in a peak number density of massive black holes of approximately \rm{10^{-4} \ cMpc^{-3}} at z ~ 10. Given the growth requirements and the duty cycle of active galactic nuclei, this means that the LW-only is likely incompatible with recent JWST measurements and can, at most, be responsible for only a small subset of high-z active galactic nuclei. Other models from the literature seem therefore better positioned, at present, to explain the high frequency of massive black holes at high z.

### 44) [2502.00394](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00394v1): An embedded Disk (eDisk) in the IceAge: Investigating the jet and outflow from CED 110 IRS4

<p> Mayank Narang, Nagayoshi Ohashi, John J. Tobin, M. K. McClure, Jes K. Jørgensen, Jinshi Sai </p>
<p>
We present a comprehensive study of the large-scale structure, jet and outflow morphology, and kinematics of the Class 0/I protostellar binary Ced 110 IRS4, using JWST NIRCam (F150W and F410M) and MIRI MRS observations from the JWST ERC program IceAge, along with ALMA data from the Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) program. NIRCam images, combined with ALMA continuum and CO data, reveal arc-like structures (~1100 au), suggesting a dense envelope around the protostars. We detect disk shadows from both protostars in F150W. The MIRI MRS IFU data reveal a jet from both protostars in multiple [Fe II] lines, [Ar II] 6.99 &mu;m and [Ne II] 12.81 &mu;m, marking the first detection of a jet from the system. The [Fe II] (5.34 &mu;m) jet from Ced 110 IRS4A has a width of \leq 51~au at the protostellar location, with a large opening angle of 23\arcdeg{} \pm 4\arcdeg. After inclination correction, the jet velocity is 124 km s^{-1}, corresponding to a dynamical timescale of 25 years. The molecular H_2 outflow displays a distinct morphology resembling two hemispheres placed back-to-back. The consistent H_2 emission extent across transitions, differing from previous observations of protostellar outflows detected with JWST, suggests that MHD disk winds may not drive the observed outflow. We find that the upper limit to the width of the outflow at the protostellar location is 130 \pm 10 au which is smaller than the disk diameter of 183.4 {\pm 0.4 au} but much larger than the width of the [Fe II] jet.

Rosolowsky, Karin Sandstrom, Sumit Sarbadhicary, Jiayi Sun, Leonardo 'Ubeda </p>
<p>
Radiation pressure is a key mechanism by which stellar feedback disrupts molecular clouds and drives HII region expansion. This includes direct radiation pressure exerted by UV photons on dust grains, pressure associated with photoionization, and infrared (IR) radiation pressure on grains due to dust-reprocessed IR photons. We present a new method that combines high resolution mid-IR luminosities from JWST-MIRI, optical attenuation and nebular line measurements from VLT-MUSE, and HST H\alpha-based region sizes to estimate the strength of radiation pressure in \approx 18,000 HII regions across 19 nearby star-forming galaxies. This is the most extensive and direct estimate of these terms beyond the Local Group to date. In the disks of galaxies, we find that the total reprocessed IR pressure is on average 5% of the direct UV radiation pressure. This fraction rises to 10% in galaxy centers. We expect reprocessed IR radiation pressure to dominate over UV radiation pressure in regions where L_{\rm F2100W}/L_{\rm H\alpha}^{\rm corr} \gtrsim 75. Radiation pressure due to H ionizations is lower than pressure on dust in our sample, but appears likely to dominate the radiation pressure budget in dwarf galaxies similar to the Small Magellanic Cloud. The contribution from all radiation pressure terms appears to be subdominant compared to thermal pressure from ionized gas, reinforcing the view that radiation pressure is most important in compact, heavily embedded, and young regions.

### 46) [2502.00104](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00104v1): Using Neural Networks to Automate the Identification of Brightest Cluster Galaxies in Large Surveys

<p> Patrick Janulewicz, Tracy M. A. Webb, Laurence Perreault-Levasseur </p>
<p>
Brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) lie deep within the largest gravitationally bound structures in existence. Though some cluster finding techniques identify the position of the BCG and use it as the cluster center, other techniques may not automatically include these coordinates. This can make studying BCGs in such surveys difficult, forcing researchers to either adopt oversimplified algorithms or perform cumbersome visual identification. For large surveys, there is a need for a fast and reliable way of obtaining BCG coordinates. We propose machine learning to accomplish this task and train a neural network to identify positions of candidate BCGs given no more information than multiband photometric images. We use both mock observations from The Three Hundred project and real ones from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and we quantify the performance. Training on simulations yields a squared correlation coefficient, R^2, between predictions and ground truth of R^2 \approx 0.94 when testing on simulations, which decreases to R^2 \approx 0.60 when testing on real data due to discrepancies between datasets. Limiting the application of this method to real clusters more representative of the training data, such those with a BCG r-band magnitude r_{\text{BCG}} \leq 16.5, yields R^2 \approx 0.99. The method performs well up to a redshift of at least z\approx 0.6. We find this technique to be a promising method to automate and accelerate the identification of BCGs in large datasets.

Probing PAH flux with MIRI imaging data has advantages in field of view, spatial resolution, and sensitivity compared with MIRI spectral maps, but comparisons with spectra are needed to calibrate these flux estimations over a wide variety of environments. For 267 MIRI/MRS spectra from independent regions in the four luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) in the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS) early release science program, we derive synthetic filter photometry and directly compare estimated PAH fluxes to those measured from detailed spectral fits. We find that for probing PAH 7.7 micron, the best combination of filters is F560W, F770W, and either F1500W or F2100W, and the best for PAH 11.3 micron is F560W, F1000W, F1130W, and F1500W. The prescription with these combinations yields predicted flux densities that typically agree with values from spectral decomposition within ~7% and ~5% for PAH 7.7 and 11.3 micron, respectively.

### 48) [2501.19384](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19384v1): Low dust mass and high star-formation efficiency at z&gt;12 from deep ALMA observations

Hathi, Ryota Ikeda, Anton M. Koekemoer, Jeyhan Kartaltepe, Kirsten K. Knudsen, Paola Santini, Toshiki Saito, Elena Terlevich, Roberto Terlevich </p>
<p>
We investigate the dust mass build-up and star formation efficiency of two galaxies at z&gt;12, GHZ2 and GS-z14-0, by combining ALMA and JWST observations with an analytical model that assumes dust at thermal equilibrium. We obtained 3\sigma constraints on dust mass of \log M_{\rm dust}/M_{\odot}&lt;5.0 and &lt;5.3, respectively. These constraints are in tension with a high dust condensation efficiency in stellar ejecta but are consistent with models with a short metal accretion timescale at z&gt;12. Given the young stellar ages of these galaxies (t_{\rm age}~10\,{\rm Myrs}), dust grain growth via accretion may still be ineffective at this stage, though it likely works efficiently to produce significant dust in galaxies at z~7. The star formation efficiencies, defined as the SFR divided by molecular gas mass, reach ~10\,{\rm Gyr}^{-1} in a 10\,Myr timescale, aligning with the expected redshift evolution of `starburst' galaxies with efficiencies that are ~0.5--1\,{\rm dex} higher than those in main-sequence galaxies. This starburst phase seems to be common in UV-bright galaxies at z&gt;12 and is likely associated with the unique conditions of the early phases of galaxy formation, such as bursty star formation and/or negligible feedback from super-Eddington accretion. Direct observations of molecular gas tracers like [C\,{\sc ii}] will be crucial to further understanding the nature of bright galaxies at z&gt;12.

### 49) [2501.18559](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18559v1): Variability of the UV luminosity function with SPICE

<p> Arghyadeep Basu, Aniket Bhagwat, Benedetta Ciardi, Tiago Costa </p>
<p>
We investigate the variability of the UV luminosity function (UVLF) at z &gt; 5 using the SPICE suite of cosmological, radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, which include three distinct supernova (SN) feedback models: bursty-sn, smooth-sn, and hyper-sn. The bursty-sn model, driven by intense and episodic SN explosions, produces the highest fluctuations in the star formation rate (SFR). Conversely, the smooth-sn model, characterized by gentler SN feedback, results in minimal SFR variability. The hyper-sn model, featuring a more realistic prescription that incorporates hypernova (HN) explosions, exhibits intermediate variability, closely aligning with the smooth-sn trend at lower redshifts. These fluctuations in SFR significantly affect the \rm{M_{UV} - M_{halo}} relation, a proxy for UVLF variability. Among the models, bursty-sn produces the highest UVLF variability, with a maximum value of 2.5. In contrast, the smooth-sn and hyper-sn models show substantially lower variability, with maximum values of 1.3 and 1.5, respectively. However, in all cases, UVLF variability strongly correlates with host halo mass, with lower-mass halos showing greater variability due to more effective SN feedback in their shallower gravitational wells. The bursty-sn model, though, results in higher amplitudes. Variability decreases in lower mass haloes with decreasing redshift for all feedback models. This study underscores the critical role of SN feedback in shaping the UVLF, and highlights the mass and redshift dependence of its variability, suggesting that UVLF variability may alleviate the bright galaxy tension observed by JWST at high redshifts.

<p>
Utilising JWST, ALMA and the VLA we present high angular resolution (0.06''- 0.42''), multi-wavelength (4 micron - 3cm) observations of the VLA 1623-2417 protostellar system to characterise the origin, morphology and, properties of the continuum emission. JWST observations at 4.4 micron reveal outflow cavities for VLA 1623 A and, for the first time, VLA 1623 B, as well as scattered light from the upper layers of the VLA 1623 W disk. We model the millimetre-centimetre spectral energy distributions to quantify the relative contributions of dust and ionised gas emission, calculate dust masses, and use spectral index maps to determine where optical depth hinders this analysis. In general, all objects appear to be optically thick down to ~90 GHz, show evidence for significant amounts (10's - 100's M_Earth) of large (&gt;1 mm) dust grains, and are dominated by ionised gas emission for frequencies ~&lt;15 GHz. In addition, we find evidence of unsettled millimetre dust in the inclined disk of VLA 1623 B possibly attributed to instabilities within the circumstellar disk, adding to the growing catalogue of unsettled Class 0/I disks. Our results represent some of the highest resolution observations possible with current instrumentation, particularly in the case of the VLA. However, our interpretation is still limited at low frequencies (~&lt;22 GHz) and thus motivates the need for next-generation interferometers operating at centimetre wavelengths.

<p>
Stellar feedback is an essential step in the baryon cycle of galaxies, but it remains unconstrained beyond Cosmic Noon. We study the ionized gas kinematics, dynamical mass and gas-flow properties of a sample of 16 sub-L^{\star} star-forming galaxies at 4\leq z\leq7.6, using high-resolution JWST/NIRSpec observations. The emission lines are resolved, with velocity dispersions (\sigma_{\rm gas}{\rm~(km~s^{-1})}~eq38-96) comparable to more massive galaxies at Cosmic Noon. From \sigma_{\rm gas} and the galaxy size (r_e=400-960~pc), we estimate the dynamical mass to be \log M_{\rm dyn}/M_{\odot}=9.25-10.25. Stellar-to-dynamical mass ratios are low (\log M_{\star}/M_{\rm dyn}\in[-0.5,-2]) and decrease with increasing SFR surface density (\Sigma_{\rm SFR}). We estimate the gas surface densities assuming a star-formation law, but the gas masses do not balance the baryon-to-dynamical mass ratios, which would require a decrease in the star-formation efficiency. We find evidence of ionized outflows in five out of the sixteen galaxies, based on the need of broad components to reproduce the emission-line wings. We only observe outflows from galaxies undergoing recent bursts of star formation {\rm SFR_{10}/SFR_{100}\geq1}, with elevated \Sigma_{\rm SFR} and low M_{\star}/M_{\rm dyn}. This links high gas surface densities to increased outflow incidence and lower M_{\star}/M_{\rm dyn}. With moderate outflow velocities (v_{\rm flow}{\rm~(km~s^{-1})}=150-250) and mass outflow rates (\dot{M}_{\rm flow}/{\rm M_{\odot} yr^{-1}}=0.2-5), these high-redshift galaxies appear more efficient at removing baryons than low-redshift galaxies with similar M_{\star}, showing mass loading-factors of \dot{M}_{\rm flow}/{\rm SFR}=0.04-0.4. For their given dynamical mass, the outflow velocities exceed the escape velocities, meaning that they may eventually enrich the Circumgalactic Medium.

### 52) [2501.17067](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17067v1): The CLASS Quasar Catalog: Coronal Line Activity in Type 1 SDSS Quasars

<p> Sara Doan, Shobita Satyapal, Michael Reefe, Remington O. Sexton, William Matzko, Jeffrey D. McKaig, Nathan J. Secrest, Jenna M. Cann, Ari Laor, Gabriela Canalizo </p>
<p>
We conduct the first systematic survey of a total of eleven optical coronal lines in the spectra of a large sample of low redshift (z &lt; 0.8) Type 1 quasars observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that strong coronal line emission is rare in SDSS even in Type 1 quasars; only 885 out of 19,508 (4.5%) galaxies show at least one coronal line, with higher ionization potential lines (&gt;100eV) being even rarer. The [Ne V] \lambda3426 line, which constitutes the majority of detections, is strongly correlated with the bolometric luminosity. These findings suggest that the optical coronal lines are significantly suppressed in the majority of local AGNs, possibly as a result of the presence of dust in the emitting regions. We find that the incidence of ionized outflows is significantly higher in coronal line emitters compared with non-coronal line emitters, possibly suggesting that dust destruction in outflows enhances coronal line emission in AGNs. Many coronal lines show line profiles that are broader than those of narrow lines, and are blue-shifted relative the lower ionization potential lines, suggesting outflows in the highly ionized gas. Given the limited number of detections, we do not find any statistically significant trends of detection statistics, or line ratios with black hole mass, Eddington ratio, or AGN bolometric luminosity. The catalog is publicly available and can provide a useful database of the coronal line properties of low redshift quasars that can be compared to the growing number of high-z AGNs discovered by JWST.

### 53) [2501.16438](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16438v1): The Formation of Globular Clusters

<p> J. M. Diederik Kruijssen </p>
<p>
Globular clusters (GCs) are among the oldest and most luminous stellar systems in the Universe, offering unique insights into galaxy formation and evolution. While the physical processes behind their origin have long remained elusive, major theoretical and observational developments in the past decade have led to a new understanding of GCs as the natural outcome of high-pressure star formation in high-redshift galaxies. This review synthesizes recent advancements in our understanding of GC formation and aims to provide a comprehensive point of reference for leveraging the revolutionary capabilities of the current and upcoming generation of telescopes. The latest generation of GC models combine our understanding of their formation and destruction with advanced galaxy formation simulations. The next decade will provide the first-ever opportunity to test such models across their full evolutionary history, from GC formation at high redshift as seen with the James Webb Telescope, to snapshots of GC demographics at intermediate redshifts obtained with 30m-class telescopes, and eventually to the well-characterized GC populations observed at the present day. We identify the major questions that we should expect to address this way.

### 54) [2501.16418](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16418v1): Temporarily quiescent galaxies at cosmic dawn: probing bursty star formation

<p> Viola Gelli, Andrea Pallottini, Stefania Salvadori, Andrea Ferrara, Charlotte Mason, Stefano Carniani, Michele Ginolfi </p>
<p>
The bursty, time-variable nature of star formation in the first billion years, as revealed by JWST, drives phases of temporary quiescence in low-mass galaxies that quench after starbursts. These galaxies provide unique probes of the burstiness of early star formation and its underlying physical processes. Using the SERRA cosmological zoom-in simulations, we analyze over 200 galaxies with M_\star&lt;10^{9.5}\rm M_\odot at z~ 6-8, finding that most experience quiescent phases driven by stellar feedback, with minimal influence from environmental effects. The fraction of temporarily quiescent galaxies increases with decreasing mass and luminosity, representing the dominant population at M_\star&lt;10^8\rm M_\odot and M_{UV}&gt;-17. By forward modeling their spectral energy distributions, we show that they are faint (\langle M_{UV}\rangle = -15.6 for M_\star=10^{8}\rm M_\odot), have strong Balmer breaks (&gt; 0.5) and no emission lines. Comparing our predicted fractions with JWST results, we find similar luminosity-dependent trends; however, the observed fractions of temporarily quiescent galaxies at M_{UV}~-20 to -19 are higher, suggesting that stronger feedback or additional mechanisms beyond supernovae may be at play. We propose searching for F200W drop-outs and satellites in the proximity (&lt;5^{\prime\prime}) of massive (&gt;10^{10}\rm M_\odot) galaxies as effective strategies to uncover the hidden majority of faint (M_{UV}&gt;-17), temporarily quiescent systems, crucial for constraining early feedback processes in low-mass galaxies.

### 55) [2501.14893](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14893v2): JWST Observations of Starbursts: Relations between PAH features and CO clouds in the starburst galaxy M 82

Lenkic, S. Lopez, D. S. Meier, J. Ott, M. Relano, J. D. Smith, E. Tarantino, S. Veilleux, P. van der Werf </p>
<p>
We present a study of new 7.7-11.3 &mu;m data obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope Mid-InfraRed Instrument in the starburst galaxy M 82. In particular, we focus on the dependency of the integrated CO(1-0) line intensity on the MIRI-F770W and MIRI-F1130W filter intensities to investigate the correlation between CO content and the 7.7 and 11.3 &mu;m features from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in M 82's outflows. To perform our analysis, we identify CO clouds using archival ^{12}CO(J=1-0) NOEMA moment 0 map within 2 kpc from the center of M 82, with sizes ranging between ~21 and 270 pc; then, we compute the CO-to-PAH relations for the 306 validated CO clouds. On average, the power-law slopes for the two relations in M 82 are lower than what is seen in local main-sequence spirals. In addition, there is a moderate correlation between I_{\rm CO(1-0)}-I_{\rm 7.7&mu; m} /I_{\rm 11.3&mu; m} for most of the CO cloud groups analyzed in this work. Our results suggest that the extreme conditions in M 82 translate into CO not tracing the full budget of molecular gas in smaller clouds, perhaps as a consequence of photoionization and/or emission suppression of CO molecules due to hard radiation fields from the central starburst.

<p> Ben Wang, Joseph F. Hennawi, Zheng Cai, Gordon T. Richards, Jan-Torge Schindler, Nadia L. Zakamska, Yuzo Ishikawa, Hollis B. Akins, Zechang Sun </p>
<p>
We analyze 23 spectroscopically confirmed Type-2 quasars (QSOs) selected from the WISE 22\rm &mu;m band in the SDSS Stripe 82 region, focusing on their multi-band photometry and spectral energy distributions (SEDs). These objects were selected to be IR-luminous (\rm flux_{W4} &gt; 5mJy, i.e., 12.62 &lt; W4 &lt; 14.62 \rm\ AB \, magnitude), optically faint (r &gt; 23) or with red color (r - W4 &gt;8.38). Gemini/GNIRS observations were conducted for all 24 candidates, and 18/24 were also observed with Keck/LRIS. The observations confirm 23 to be real Type-2 QSOs in the redshift range 0.88 - 2.99 (12 are at z&gt;2). We collect multi-band photometry and conduct SED fitting. The composite photometry probes the wavelength from 0.1\rm &mu;m to 10\rm &mu;m at the rest frame. The IR emission is dominated by dust torus implying an average torus luminosity for the sample of L_{\rm torus} 10^{46.84} \rm erg/s. The origin of the rest-UV/optical light is not definitive, but we present three possible scenarios: scattered light, stellar emission, and the reddened accretion disk. Assuming an obscured:unobscured ratio of approximately 1:1, our targets have L_{\rm bol} = 10^{46.28} \rm erg \,s^{-1} - 10^{47.49} \rm erg \,s^{-1} and around SMBH masses \rm 10^{8.18} M_{\odot} - 10^{9.39} M_{\odot}, assuming they accreate at the Eddington limit. Compared to previous Type-2 AGN SEDs, our targets have a brighter dust torus and redder optical-IR color. By comparing the SED to the results from JWST `little red dots' (LRDs), we find that these IR-selected Type-2 QSOs have similar SED shapes to the LRDs. This pilot Type-2 QSO survey demonstrates that mid-IR selection is an efficient way to find luminous Type-2 QSOs at z&gt;2. Finally, the composite photometry and Type-2 QSOs SED model generated by this sample provide a guide for finding more Type-2 QSOs at higher redshift.

### 57) [2501.13899](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13899v1): The Pitfalls of Using Lyman Alpha Damping Wings in High-z Galaxy Spectra to Measure the Intergalactic Neutral Hydrogen Fraction

<p> Mason Huberty, Claudia Scarlata, Matthew J. Hayes, Simon Gazagnes </p>
<p>
The Lyman Alpha damping wing is seen in absorption against the spectra of high-redshift galaxies. Modeling of this wing is a way to measure the volume neutral hydrogen fraction of the Universe, as well as to measure the strength of HI absorption in the form of a damped Ly{\alpha} absorber (DLA). We use very high-quality ultraviolet spectra of low-z galaxies to create mock high-redshift, low-resolution spectra complete with a damping wing resulting from the IGM and HI absorption from local, dense gas to mimic current James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of the early universe. The simulated spectra are used to test the ability to recover the "true" values of the column density of the DLA (N_DLA) and the volume neutral hydrogen fraction (x_HI) of the IGM through modified stellar continuum fitting. We find that the ability to recover the true values of N_DLA and x_HI simultaneously is compromised by degeneracies between these two parameters, and the spectral shape itself at low-resolution (R~100). The root mean squared error between the recovered and true column density of the DLAs is on the order of 1 dex. This error somewhat decreases with improved resolution (R~1000), but systematically underestimates N_DLA when Ly{\alpha} emission is present in the mock spectra. The recovered values of x_HI are poorly constrained and do not improve substantially with the higher resolution. We recommend accounting for these sources of uncertainty and biases when using galaxies' Ly{\alpha} damping wings to measure the intergalactic neutral hydrogen fraction.

<p>
Recent observations from JWST have revealed an abundant population of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and so-called ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) at 2\lesssim z \lesssim 11, many of which are characterized by V-shaped UV-to-optical continua with turnovers around the Balmer limit. The physical nature of these LRDs is unclear, and it remains debated whether the peculiar spectral shape originates from AGN, compact galaxies, or both. We present the analysis of new NIRSpec-IFU data from the BlackTHUNDER JWST Large Programme and archival NIRSpec-MSA data of a lensed LRD at z=7.04. The spectra confirm the presence of a smooth Balmer break and a broad H\beta tracing the Broad Line Region (BLR) of an AGN. The small velocity dispersion of the H\beta narrow component indicates a small dynamical mass of the host galaxy of M_{\rm dyn}&lt;4 \times 10^8~M_{\odot}, which implies that the stellar population cannot contribute more than 10% to the optical continuum. We show that the Balmer break can be well described by an AGN continuum absorbed by very dense (n_{\rm H}~ 10^{10}~{\rm cm^{-3}}) and nearly dust-free gas along our line-of-sight (possibly gas in the BLR or its surrounding). The same gas is expected to produce H\beta absorption, at a level consistent with a tentative detection (3\sigma) in the high-resolution spectrum. Such a non-stellar origin of the Balmer break may apply to other LRDs, and would alleviate the issue of extremely high stellar mass surface densities inferred in the case of a stellar interpretation of the Balmer break. We note that this is a rare case of a black hole that is overmassive relative to both the host galaxy stellar and dynamical masses. We finally report indications of variability and the first attempt of AGN reverberation mapping at such an early epoch.

<p>
X-ray observations of the optically selected z=6.025 QSO CFHQS J164121+375520 (hereafter J1641) revealed that its flux dropped by a factor \gtrsim7 from 2018, when it was a bright and soft X-ray source, to 2021. Such a strong variability amplitude has not been observed before among z&gt;6 QSOs, and the underlying physical mechanism was unclear. We carried out a new X-ray and rest-frame UV monitoring campaign of J1641 over 2022-2024. We detected J1641 with Chandra in the 2-7 keV band, while no significant emission is detected at softer X-ray energies, making J1641 an X-ray changing look QSO at z&gt;6. Comparing with the 2018 epoch, the 0.5-2 keV flux dropped dramatically by a factor &gt;20. We ascribe this behaviour to intervening, and still ongoing, obscuration by Compton-thick gas intercepting our line of sight between 2018 and 2021. The screening material could be an inner disk or a failed nuclear wind that increased their thickness. Another possibility is that we have witnessed an occultation event due to dust-free clouds located at sub-pc/pc scales, similar to those recently invoked to explain the remarkable X-ray weakness of AGN discovered by JWST. These interpretations are also consistent with the lack of strong variations of the QSO rest-frame UV lightcurve over the same period. Future monitoring of J1641 and the possible discovery of other X-ray changing look QSOs at z&gt;6 will provide us with precious information about the physics of rapid supermassive black-hole growth at high redshift.

### 60) [2501.12223](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12223v1): The Structure of the Molecular Envelope of the Ring Nebula (NGC 6720)

<p>
We present the first interferometric imaging of molecular line emission from the Ring Nebula, NGC~6720, in the form of Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations of CO J=2\rightarrow 1 emission. The SMA ^{12}CO(2--1) mapping data, with ~3'' spatial resolution and 2 km s^{-1} velocity resolution, provide an unprecedentedly detailed, 3D view of the Ring's clumpy molecular envelope. The morphology of the velocity-integrated SMA ^{12}CO(2--1) image closely resembles those of near-IR H_2 and PAH emission in JWST/NIRCam imaging of NGC~6720, with the molecular gas forming a geometrically thin layer surrounding the ionized gas imaged by HST and JWST. A simple, geometrical model of the ^{12}CO(2--1) data shows that the intrinsic structure of NGC~6720's molecular envelope closely resembles a truncated, triaxial ellipsoid that is viewed close to pole-on, and that the dynamical age of the molecular envelope is ~6000 yr. The SMA ^{12}CO(2--1) data furthermore reveal that filamentary features seen projected in the Ring's interior in JWST imaging are in fact fast-moving polar knots or bullets with radial velocities of \pm45--50 km s^{-1} relative to systemic, and that the hot progenitor star remnant is positioned at the precise geometric center of the clumpy, ellipsoidal molecular shell. We assert that the Ring's molecular envelope was formed via a relatively sudden, AGB-terminating mass ejection event ~6000 yr ago, and that this ellipsoidal envelope was then punctured by fast, collimated polar outflows resulting from interactions between the progenitor and one or more companion stars. Such an evolutionary scenario may describe most molecule-rich, ``Ring-like'' planetary nebulae.

### 61) [2501.12138](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12138v1): Globular cluster formation from inertial inflows: accreting extremely massive stars as the origin of abundance anomalies

<p> Mark Gieles, Paolo Padoan, Corinne Charbonnel, Jorick S. Vink, Laura Ramírez-Galeano </p>
<p>
We use the inertial-inflow model of massive star formation to describe the formation of globular clusters (GCs) in turbulent molecular clouds. A key aspect of this model is that the maximum stellar mass scales linearly with cloud mass, such that extremely massive stars (EMSs, 10^{3-4}\,{\rm M}_\odot) form in massive GCs (\gtrsim10^5\,M_\odot). The total wind mass loss is dominated by accreting EMSs (aEMSs), whose wind mass-loss rates become comparable to their accretion rates (\gtrsim10^{-2}\,{\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}). These winds pollute the intra-cluster medium with hot-hydrogen burning yields during GC formation. We propose a parameterised model for the evolution of the stellar mass function during GC formation (~ 1-2\,{\rm Myr}), accounting for gas inflow, wind mass loss and mixing of aEMS yields with pristine gas that has initial proto-GC abundances. Low-mass stars (\lesssim1\,{\rm M}_\odot) form continuously from this mixed gas and their abundances resemble observed abundance trends with GC mass and metallicity, specifically: (i) the helium spread in a typical GC is small (\Delta Y ~eq 0.01) and increases with GC mass; (ii) the fraction of polluted stars increases with GC mass and metallicity; (iii) the extent of the Mg-Al anticorrelations is more pronounced in metal-poor and massive GCs. We conclude that GCs formed with a population of EMSs, that may leave behind black holes with masses above the pair-instability gap (\gtrsim120\,{\rm M}_\odot) and that the nitrogen-rich galaxies found by the James Webb Space Telescope ({\it JWST}) are in the first phase of galaxy evolution, when a large fraction of star formation occurs in the form of GCs.

### 62) [2501.12008](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12008v2): The mass-dependent UVJ diagram at cosmic noon: A challenge for galaxy evolution models and dust radiative transfer

<p> Andrea Gebek, Benedikt Diemer, Marco Martorano, Arjen van der Wel, Lara Pantoni, Maarten Baes, Austen Gabrielpillai, Anand Utsav Kapoor, Calvin Osinga, Angelos Nersesian, Kosei Matsumoto, Karl Gordon </p>
<p>
Context. The UVJ color-color diagram is a widely used diagnostic to separate star-forming and quiescent galaxies. Observational data from photometric surveys reveal a strong stellar mass trend, with higher-mass star-forming galaxies being systematically more dust-reddened. Aims. We analyze the UVJ diagram in the TNG100 cosmological simulation at cosmic noon (z\approx2). Specifically, we focus on the trend between UVJ colors and mass which has not been reproduced in any cosmological simulation thus far. Methods. We applied the SKIRT dust radiative transfer code to the TNG100 simulation to generate rest-frame UVJ fluxes. These UVJ colors were then compared to observational data from several well-studied extragalactic fields from the CANDELS/3D-HST programs, augmented by recent JWST/NIRCam photometry. Results. Quiescent and low-mass (M_\star\lesssim10^{10.5}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot) galaxies at cosmic noon do not require significant levels of dust reddening, as opposed to massive (M_\star\gtrsim10^{11}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot) star-forming galaxies. An extensive range of possible dust models fall short of the required dust reddening in V-J color for massive star-forming galaxies, with the simulated galaxies being too blue by \approx0.9\,\mathrm{mag}. Conclusions. We find that only variations in the star-to-dust geometries of the simulated galaxies can yield V-J colors that are red enough to match the observations. A toy model with isolated dust screens around younger stellar populations (with ages below ~1\,\mathrm{Gyr}) can reproduce the observational data, while all conventional dust radiative transfer models (where the dust distribution follows the metals in the interstellar medium) fail to achieve the required V-J colors.

### 63) [2501.11879](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11879v1): Metallicity Scatter Originating from Sub-kiloparsec Starbursting Clumps in the Core of a Protocluster at z=7.88

<p>
We present new JWST NIRSpec integral field unit (IFU) G395H/F290LP observations of a merging galaxy system at z=7.88, part of A2744-z7p9, the most distant protocluster to date. The IFU cube reveals [OIII] emissions in two previously known galaxies (ZD3 and ZD6) and a newly identified galaxy, ZD12, at z_{\rm spec}=7.8762. One of the detected \oiii-emitting regions has a detection of the auroral [OIII]4363, line, allowing us to derive a direct metallicity of \log(O/H)+12=7.4\pm0.2, while metallicities in other regions are measured using strong line calibration methods. We find large deviations within the measured metallicity (\Delta \log {\rm (O/H)}~1), which suggests a fast chemical enrichment from intense star formation and merger-driven growth, as expected in early galaxies. Our analysis shows that metal-poor regions could easily be outshone by more enriched regions, posing a challenge for spectroscopic analysis based on integrated light (i.e., NIRSpec MSA) against identifying metal-free star formation in the early universe. NIRCam imaging reveals seven UV-bright clumps in ZD12, in the range of stellar mass \log M_*/M_\odot~7.6--8.9. Four of them are unresolved (&lt; 100pc) and intensely star-forming (&gt;30 M_\odot {\rm yr^{-1} kpc^{-2}}), likely contributing to the scatter in metallicity by producing an ideal environment for rapid chemical cycles. Lastly, we revisit the nature of the host protocluster by including new member galaxies identified here and in the literature, and obtain local overdensity factor \delta=44_{-31}^{+89}, total halo mass M_{\rm h} = 5.8_{-0.3}^{+0.2}\times10^{11}\,M_\odot, and a formal velocity dispersion of 1100\pm500 km s^{-1}.

### 64) [2501.11702](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11702v1): Constraints on the z~6-13 intergalactic medium from JWST spectroscopy of Lyman-alpha damping wings in galaxies

<p> Charlotte A. Mason, Zuyi Chen, Daniel P. Stark, Ting-Yi Lu, Michael Topping, Mengtao Tang </p>
<p>
JWST provides a unique dataset to study reionization's earliest stages, promising insights into the first galaxies. Many JWST/NIRSpec prism spectra reveal smooth Lyman-alpha breaks in z&gt;5 galaxies, implying damping wing scattering by neutral hydrogen. We investigate what current prism spectra imply about the intergalactic medium (IGM), and how best to use NIRSpec spectra to recover IGM properties. We use a sample of 99 z~5.5-13 galaxies with high S/N prism spectra in the public archive, including 12 at z&gt;10. We analyse these spectra using damping wing sightlines from inhomogeneous reionizing IGM simulations, mapping between the distance of a source from neutral IGM and the mean IGM neutral fraction. We marginalise over absorption by local HI around galaxies, and Lyman-alpha emission. We observe a decline in the median and variance of flux around the Lyman-alpha break with increasing redshift, consistent with an increasingly neutral IGM, as ionized regions become smaller and rarer. At z\gtrsim9 the spectra become consistent with an almost fully neutral IGM. We find S/N&gt;15 per pixel is required to robustly estimate IGM properties from prism spectra. We fit a sub-sample of high S/N spectra and infer mean neutral fractions \overline{x}_\mathrm{HI}=0.33^{+0.18}_{-0.27}, 0.64^{+0.17}_{-0.23} (&gt;0.70 excluding GNz11) at z \approx 6.5, 9.3. We also investigate local HI absorption, finding median column density \log_{10}N_\mathrm{HI}\approx10^{20.8} cm^{-2}, comparable to z~3 Lyman-break galaxies, with no significant redshift evolution. We find galaxies showing the strongest absorption are more likely to be in close associations (&lt;500 pkpc), implying enhanced absorption in massive dark matter halos. Future deep prism and grating spectroscopy of z&gt;9 sources will provide tighter constraints on the earliest stages of reionization, key for understanding the onset of star formation.

<p>
Detecting the first generation of stars, Population III (PopIII), has been a long-standing goal in astrophysics, yet they remain elusive even in the JWST era. Here we present a novel NIRCam-based selection method for PopIII galaxies, and carefully validate it through completeness and contamination simulations. We systematically search ~500 arcmin^{2} across JWST legacy fields for PopIII candidates, including GLIMPSE which, assisted by gravitational lensing, has produced JWST's deepest NIRCam imaging thus far. We discover one promising PopIII galaxy candidate (GLIMPSE-16043) at z=6.50^{+0.03}_{-0.24}, a moderately lensed galaxy (mu=2.9) with an intrinsic UV magnitude of M_{UV}=-15.89. It exhibits key PopIII features: strong H\alpha emission (rest-frame EW 2810\pm550&#8491;); a Balmer jump; no dust (UV slope \beta=-2.34\pm0.36); and undetectable metal lines (e.g., [OIII]; [OIII]/H\beta&lt;0.44) implying a gas-phase metallicity of Zgas/Zsun&lt;0.5%. These properties indicate the presence of a nascent, metal-deficient young stellar population (&lt;5Myr) with a stellar mass of ~eq10^{5}M_{\odot}. Intriguingly, this source deviates significantly from the extrapolated UV-metallicity relation derived from recent JWST observations at z=4-10, consistent with UV enhancement by a top-heavy PopIII initial mass function or the presence of an extremely metal-poor AGN. We also derive the first observational constraints on the PopIII UV luminosity function at z~6-7. The volume density of GLIMPSE-16043 (\approx10^{-4} cMpc^{-3}) is in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions, independently reinforcing its plausibility. This study demonstrates the power of our novel NIRCam method to finally reveal distant galaxies even more pristine than the Milky Way's most metal-poor satellites, thereby promising to bring us closer to the first generation of stars than we have ever been before.

We explore the evolving relationship between galaxies and their dark matter halos from z ~ 0.1 to z ~ 12 using mass-limited angular clustering measurements in the 0.54 deg^2 of the COSMOS-Web survey. This study provides the first measurements of the mass-limited two-point correlation function at z \ge 10 and a consistent analysis spanning 13.4 Gyr of cosmic history, setting new benchmarks for future simulations and models. Using a halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework, we derive characteristic halo masses and the stellar-to-halo mass relationship (SHMR) across redshifts and stellar mass bins. Our results first indicate that HOD models fit data at z \ge 2.5 best when incorporating a non-linear scale-dependent halo bias, boosting clustering at non-linear scales (r = 10-100 kpc). We find that galaxies at z &gt; 10.5 with \log(M_\star / M_\odot) \ge 8.85 are hosted by halos with M_{\rm h} ~ 10^{10.5}\,M_\odot, achieving a star formation efficiency (SFE) M_\star / (f_b M_{\rm h}) up to 1 dex higher than at z \le 1. The high galaxy bias at z \ge 8 suggests that these galaxies reside in massive halos with intrinsic high SFE. Our SHMR evolves significantly with redshift, starting high at z \ge 10.5, decreasing until z ~ 2 - 3, then increasing again until the present. Current simulations fail to reproduce both massive high-z galaxies and this evolution, while semi-empirical models linking SFE to halo mass, accretion rates, and redshift align with our findings. We propose that z &gt; 8 galaxies experience bursty star formation without significant feedback altering their growth, driving the rapid growth of massive galaxies observed by JWST. Over time, increasing feedback efficiency and exponential halo growth suppress star formation. At z ~ 2 - 3 and after, halo growth slows down while star formation continues, supported by gas reservoirs in halos.

### 67) [2501.11670](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11670v1): Less Wound and More Asymmetric: JWST Confirms the Evolution of Spiral Structure in Galaxies at z \lesssim 3

<p> Ilia V. Chugunov, Alexander A. Marchuk, Aleksandr V. Mosenkov </p>
<p>
Spiral galaxies are ubiquitous in the local Universe. However the properties of spiral arms in them are still not well studied, and there is even less information concerning spiral structure in distant galaxies. We aim to measure the most general parameters of spiral arms in remote galaxies and trace their changes with redshift. We perform photometric decomposition, including spiral arms, for 159 galaxies from the HST COSMOS and JWST CEERS and JADES surveys, which are imaged in optical and near-infrared rest-frame wavelengths. We confirm that, in our representative sample of spiral galaxies, the pitch angles increase, and the azimuthal lengths decrease with increasing redshift, implying that the spiral structure becomes more tightly wound over time. For the spiral-to-total luminosity ratio and the spiral width-to-disc scale length ratio, we find that band-shifting effects can be as significant as, or even stronger than, evolutionary effects. Additionally, we find that spiral structure becomes more asymmetric at higher redshifts.

We present 450&mu;m and 850&mu;m James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) observations of the Corona Australis (CrA) molecular cloud taken as part of the JCMT Gould Belt Legacy Survey (GBLS). We present a catalogue of 39 starless and protostellar sources, for which we determine source temperatures and masses using SCUBA-2 450&mu;m/850&mu;m flux density ratios for sources with reliable 450&mu;m detections, and compare these to values determined using temperatures measured by the Herschel Gould Belt Survey (HGBS). In keeping with previous studies, we find that SCUBA-2 preferentially detects high-volume-density starless cores, which are most likely to be prestellar (gravitationally bound). We do not observe any anti-correlation between temperature and volume density in the starless cores in our sample. Finally, we combine our SCUBA-2 and Herschel data to perform SED fitting from 160-850&mu;m across the central Coronet region, thereby measuring dust temperature T, dust emissivity index \beta and column density N({\rm H}_2) across the Coronet. We find that \beta varies across the Coronet, particularly measuring \beta = 1.55 \pm 0.35 in the colder starless SMM-6 clump to the north of the B star R CrA. This relatively low value of \beta is suggestive of the presence of large dust grains in SMM-6, even when considering the effects of T-\beta fitting degeneracy and ^{12}CO contamination of SCUBA-2 850&mu;m data on the measured \beta values.

We combine the deepest X-ray survey from the Chandra Deep Field-South (CDF-S) `7-Ms' survey with the deepest mid-infrared (5.6 &mu; m) image from the JWST/MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) in the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF) to study the infrared counterparts and point-source emission of 31 X-ray sources with a median, intrinsic, rest-frame X-ray luminosity of \log_{10}(L_{\rm Xc}^{\rm 0.5-7keV})=42.04\pm0.22 erg \rm s^{-1}. The sample includes 24 AGN with a redshift range, as set by the X-ray detectability, of z ~eq 0.5-3. Through a multi-wavelength morphological decomposition, employing three separate classifications (visual, parametric and non-parametric) we separate (where present) the luminosity of the point-like AGN component from the remainder of the host-galaxy emission. The unprecedented mid-infrared sensitivity and imaging resolution of MIRI allows, in many cases, the direct characterisation of point-like (i.e. unresolved) components in the galaxies' emission. We establish a broad agreement between the three morphological classifications. At least 70% of the X-ray sources, including some classified as galaxies, show unresolved emission in the MIRI images, with the unresolved-to-total flux fraction at rest-frame 2&mu; m ranging from ~0.2 to ~0.9. At high X-ray luminosities (\log_{10}(L_{\rm Xc})&gt;43 erg \rm s^{-1}) we derive a consistent rest-frame near-infrared 2 &mu; m point-source luminosity to that derived for local AGN, whilst at lower X-ray luminosity we identify an excess in the 2 &mu; m emission compared to pre-JWST studies. We speculate this offset may be driven by a combination of Compton-thick AGN components and nuclear starburst, merger driven activity. Our observations highlight the complex nature of X-ray sources in the distant Universe and demonstrate the power of JWST/MIRI in quantifying their nuclear infrared emission. (Abridged)

### 70) [2501.11103](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11103v1): Explaining JWST star formation history at z ~ 17 by modifying ΛCDM

<p> Oleksii Sokoliuk </p>
<p>
Recent cosmological observations indicate a 5\sigma discrepancy between the values of the Hubble constant H_0 derived from late and early universe probes. A further possible tension at the ~ 3\sigma level arises from different measurements of \sigma_8. These measurements suggest the existence of new physics. Here, we explore several theories of modified gravity that may help to resolve these cosmological tensions. These include a family of phenomenological modified theories, where only Newton's gravitational constant and the Einstein-Boltzmann equations are affected. We consider one particular class of these theories: cosmologies with varying growth index \gamma and varying dark energy Equation of State (EoS) w_\Lambda. We also consider the normal branch of the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (nDGP) model as well as k-mouflage gravity, which involves a non-trivially coupled scalar field. Our main aim is to narrow down the modified gravity landscape by constraining each model using high-redshift JWST data. Several probes are considered in this work: Stellar Mass Function (SMF), Stellar Mass Density (SMD), Star Formation Rate Density (SFRD) and Ultra-Violet Luminosity Function (UVLF) along with the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). We find that generally, the choice of r_c\gtrsim 10^{3.5} Mpc is preferred for nDGP, while \beta~0.1, K_0\gtrsim 0.9 is favored for k-mouflage. Moreover, in the context of phenomenological gravity, phantom-like dark energy EoS w_\Lambda\lesssim -1 is preferred over the quintessence.

<p>
We present an analysis of the rest-frame optical (\lambda ~eq 3100-5600 \,\r{A}) spectrum of a \mathrm{log}_{10}(M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot}) = 8.6 star-forming galaxy at z=8.271 (EXCELS-63107) from JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution observations taken as part of the EXCELS survey. EXCELS-63107 is a compact object consistent with the size of local star-forming cluster complexes (r_e &lt; 200 \, \rm{pc}) and has an extremely steep UV continuum measured from JWST/NIRCam photometry (\beta=-3.3\pm0.3). The JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectrum of EXCELS-63107 is notable for its strong [OIII]\lambda4363 auroral-line emission relative to the [OIII]\lambda5007 forbidden line. Via a detailed emission-line and photoionization-modelling analysis, we find that the the observed properties of EXCELS-63107 are consistent with the presence of an ionizing source with an effective temperature of T_{\rm eff} \gtrsim 80 \, 000\,\rm{K} heating ionized gas with a density of n_e &lt; 10^4 \, \rm{cm}^{-3} to a volume-averaged electron temperature of T_e ~eq 34 \, 000\,\rm{K}. Crucially, we find that stellar population models assuming a standard IMF are not capable of producing the required heating. We determine an oxygen abundance of {12+\mathrm{log(O/H)}= 6.89^{+0.26}_{-0.21}} which is one of the lowest directly constrained oxygen abundances measured in any galaxy to date, and ~eq 10 \times lower than is typical for z~eq8 galaxies with the same stellar mass. The extremely low metallicity of EXCELS-63107 places it in a regime in which theoretical models expect a transition to a top-heavy IMF, and we speculate that a ~eq 10-30 \, \times excess of M &gt; 50 \, \rm{M}_{\odot} stars is one plausible explanation for its observed properties. However, more exotic scenarios, such as Pop III star formation within a mildly enriched halo, are also consistent with the observations.

<p>
Metallicity is a crucial tracer of galaxy evolution, providing insights into gas accretion, star formation, and feedback. At high redshift, these processes reveal how early galaxies assembled and enriched their interstellar medium. In this work, we present rest-frame optical spectroscopy of 12 massive (\log(M_*/\mathrm{M_{\odot}})&gt;9) galaxies at z~ 6-8 from the REBELS ALMA large program, observed with JWST NIRSpec/IFU in the prism mode. These observations span emission lines from [OII]\lambda3727,9 to [SII]\lambda6716,31, providing key information on nebular dust attenuation, ionisation states, and chemical abundances. We find lower O32 ratios (average ~3.7) and [OIII]\lambda5007 equivalent widths (average {EW_{[OIII]}}~390&#8491;) than are generally found in existing large spectroscopic surveys at z&gt;6, indicating less extreme ionising conditions. Strong-line diagnostics suggest that these systems are some of the most metal-rich galaxies observed at z&gt;6 (average Z_{\mathrm{gas}}~ 0.4 Z_{\odot}), including sources with near-solar oxygen abundances, in line with their high stellar masses (average \log{M_*/\mathrm{M_{\odot}}}~9.5). Supplementing with literature sources at lower masses, we investigate the mass-metallicity and fundamental metallicity relations (MZR and FMR, respectively) over a 4 dex stellar mass range at 6&lt;z&lt;8. In contrast to recent studies of lower-mass galaxies, we find no evidence for negative offsets to the z=0 FMR for the REBELS galaxies. This work demonstrates the existence of chemically-enriched galaxies just ~1 Gyr after the Big Bang, and indicates that the MZR is already in place at these early times, in agreement with other recent z&gt;3 studies.

### 73) [2501.07119](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07119v2): Can Dark Stars account for the star formation efficiency excess at very high redshifts?

<p> Lei Lei, Yi-Ying Wang, Guan-Wen Yuan, Tong-Lin Wang, Martin A. T. Groenewegen, Yi-Zhong Fan </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently conducted observations of massive galaxies at high redshifts, revealing a notable anomaly in their star formation efficiency (SFE). Motivated by the recent identification of three ~ 10^{6}M_\odot dark star candidates, we investigate whether dark stars can be the origin of the SFE excess. It turns out that the excess can be reproduced by a group of dark stars with M \gtrsim 10^{3}\, \rm M_{\odot}, because of their domination in generating primary UV radiation in high-redshift galaxies. The genesis of these dark stars is attributed to the capture of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) within a mass range of tens of GeV to a few TeV. However, if the top-heavy initial mass function of dark stars holds up to ~ 10^{5}M_\odot, the relic black holes stemming from their collapse would be too abundant to be consistent with the current observations of Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). We thus suggest that just a small fraction of SFE excess may be contributed by the very massive dark stars and the majority likely originated from other reasons such as the Population III stars in view of their rather similar UV radiation efficiencies.

<p> Eduardo A. Hartmann, Ignacio Martín-Navarro, Marc Huertas-Company, João P. V. Benedetti, Patricia Iglesias-Navarro, Alexandre Vazdekis, Mireia Montes </p>
<p>
The formation time scales of quiescent galaxies can be estimated in two different ways: by their star formation history and by their chemistry. Previously, the methods yielded conflicting results, especially when considering \alpha-enhanced objects. This is primarily due to the time resolution limitations of very old stellar populations, which prevent accurately constraining their star formation histories. We analysed the JWST observations of the extremely massive galaxy ZF-UDS-7329 at z~3.2 and show that the higher time resolution necessary to match the chemical formation time scales using stellar population synthesis can be achieved by studying galaxies at high redshift. We compare the massive galaxy to the well-known relic galaxy NGC~1277, arguing that ZF-UDS-7329 is an early Universe example of the cores of present-day massive elliptical galaxies or, if left untouched, a relic galaxy.

<p>
Transient astronomy in the early, high-redshift (z &gt; 3) Universe is an unexplored regime that offers the possibility of probing the first stars and the Epoch of Reionization. During Cycles 1 and 2 of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program enabled one of the first searches for transients in deep images (~30 AB mag) over a relatively wide area (25 arcmin^2). One transient, AT 2023adsv, was discovered with an F200W magnitude of 28.04 AB mag, and subsequent JWST observations revealed that the transient is a likely supernova (SN) in a host with z_spec = 3.613 +/- 0.001 and an inferred metallicity at the position of the SN of Z_* = 0.3 +/- 0.1 Z_{\odot}. At this redshift, the first detections in F115W and F150W show that AT 2023adsv had bright rest-frame ultraviolet flux at the time of discovery. The multi-band light curve of AT 2023adsv is best matched by a template of an SN IIP with a peak absolute magnitude of M_B ~ -18.3 AB mag. We find a good match to a 20 M_{\odot} red supergiant progenitor star with an explosion energy of 2.0x10^51 ergs, likely higher than normally observed in the local Universe, but consistent with SNe IIP drawn from local, lower metallicity environments. AT 2023adsv is the most distant photometrically classified SN IIP yet discovered with a spectroscopic redshift measurement, and may represent a global shift in SNe IIP properties as a function of redshift.

We present a structural analysis of 521 galaxy candidates at 6.5 &lt; z &lt; 12.5, with SNR &gt; 10\sigma in the F444W filter, taken from the EPOCHS v1 sample, consisting of uniformly reduced deep JWST NIRCam data, covering the CEERS, JADES GOOD-S, NGDEEP, SMACS0723, GLASS and PEARLS surveys. We use standard software to fit single S\'ersic models to each galaxy in the rest-frame optical and extract their parametric structural parameters (S\'ersic index, half-light radius and axis-ratio), and \texttt{Morfometryka} to measure their non-parametric concentration and asymmetry parameters. We find a wide range of sizes for these early galaxies, but with a strong galaxy-size mass correlation up to z ~ 12 such that galaxy sizes continue to get progressively smaller in the high-redshift regime, following R_{e} = 2.74 \pm 0.49 \left( 1 + z \right) ^{-0.79 \pm 0.08} kpc. Using non-parametric methods we find that galaxy merger fractions, classified through asymmetry parameters, at these redshifts remain consistent with those in literature, maintaining a value of f_{m} ~ 0.12 \pm 0.07 showing little dependence with redshift when combined with literature at z &gt; 4. We find that galaxies which are smaller in size also appear rounder, with an excess of high axis-ratio objects. Finally, we artificially redshift a subsample of our objects to determine how robust the observational trends we see are, determining that observed trends are due to real evolutionary effects, rather than being a consequence of redshift effects.

### 77) [2412.14685](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14685v2): The JWST/NIRSpec view of the nuclear region in the prototypical merging galaxy NGC 6240

<p>
Merger events are thought to be an important phase in the assembly of massive galaxies. At the same time, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) play a fundamental role in the evolution of their star formation histories. Both phenomena can be observed at work in NGC 6240, a local prototypical merger, classified as an UltraLuminous InfraRed Galaxy (ULIRG) thanks to its elevated infrared luminosity. Interestingly, NGC 6240 hosts two AGN separated by 1.5''(~ 735 pc), detected in both X-ray and radio band. Taking advantage of the unprecedented sensitivity and wavelength coverage provided by the Integral Field Unit (IFU) of the NIRSpec instrument onboard JWST, we observed the nuclear region of NGC 6240 in a FoV of 3.7'' x 3.7''(1.9 x 1.9 kpc^2), to investigate gas kinematics and InterStellar Medium (ISM) properties with a high spatial resolution of ~ 0.1'' (or ~ 50 pc). We separated the different gas kinematic components through multi-Gaussian fitting and studied the excitation properties of the ISM from the NIR diagnostic diagram based on the H_2 1-0 S(1)/BrGamma and [Fe II]1.257micron/PaBeta lines ratios. We isolated the ionization cones of the two nuclei, and detected coronal lines emission from both of them. Using H_2 line ratios, we found that the molecular hydrogen gas is excited mostly by thermal processes. We computed a hot molecular gas mass of 1.3 x 10^5 M_sun and an ionized gas mass in the range of 10^5 - 10^7 M_sun. We studied with unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity the kinematics of the molecular and ionized gas phases. We revealed the complex structure of the molecular gas and found a blueshifted outflow near the Southern nucleus, together with filaments connecting a highly redshifted H_2 cloud with the two nuclei. We speculate on the possible nature of this H_2 cloud and propose two possible scenarios: either outflowing gas, or a tidal cloud falling onto the nuclei.

<p> Jianwei Lyu, George H. Rieke, Meredith Stone, Jane Morrison, Stacey Alberts, Xiangyu Jin, Yongda Zhu, Weizhe Liu, Jinyi Yang </p>
<p>
The majority of most luminous quasars during the epoch of reionization accrete near or above the Eddington limit, marking the vigorous growth of primitive supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, their subsequent evolution and environmental impact remain poorly characterized. We present JWST/NIRSpec prism IFU observations of HSC J2239+0207, a low-luminosity quasar at z~6.25 likely in a late stage of mass assembly with an overmassive SMBH relative to its host galaxy. Using H\beta and H\alpha broad emission lines, we estimate an SMBH mass M_{\rm BH}~3\times10^8~M_{\odot} and confirm its sub-Eddington accretion at \lambda_{\rm Edd}~0.4. Strong FeII emission and a proximity zone of typical size suggest a metal-rich, highly evolved system. In the far-UV, this quasar presents strong broad-absorption-line features, indicative of high-velocity winds (\nu~10^4~{\rm km/s}). Meanwhile, minimal dust reddening is inferred from the quasar continuum and broad-line Balmer decrement, suggesting little dust along the polar direction. Most interestingly, we identify a gas companion ~5 kpc from the quasar with a high [OIII]/H\beta ratio (\gtrsim10), likely representing outflowing gas blown away by AGN feedback. These results highlight HSC J2239+0207 as a likely fading quasar in transition, providing rare insights into SMBH evolution, AGN feedback, and AGN-galaxy interactions in the early Universe.

<p> I. Kolesnikov, V. M. Sampaio, R. R. de Carvalho, C. Conselice </p>
<p>
Morphological classification of galaxies becomes increasingly challenging with redshift. We apply a hybrid supervised-unsupervised method to classify ~ 14,000 galaxies in the CANDELS fields at 0.2 \leq z \leq 2.4 into spheroid, disk, and irregular systems. Unlike previous works, our method is applied to redshift bins of width 0.2. Comparison between models applied to a wide redshift range versus bin-specific models reveals significant differences in galaxy morphology beyond z \geq 1 and a consistent ~ 25&percnt; disagreement. This suggests that using a single model across wide redshift ranges may introduce biases due to the large time intervals involved compared to galaxy evolution timescales. Using the FERENGI code to assess the impact of cosmological effects, we find that flux dimming and smaller angular scales may lead to the misclassification of up to 18&percnt; of disk galaxies as spheroids or irregulars. Contrary to previous studies, we find an almost constant fraction of disks (~ 60&percnt;) and spheroids (~ 30&percnt;) across redshifts. We attribute discrepancies with earlier works, which suggest a decreasing fraction of disks beyond z ~ 1, to the biases introduced by visual classification. Our claim is further strengthened by the striking agreement to the results reported by Lee et al. (2024) using an objective, unsupervised method applied to James Webb Space Telescope data. Exploring mass dependence, we observe a ~ 40&percnt; increase in the fraction of massive (M_{\rm stellar} \geq 10^{10.5}{\rm M}_{\odot}) spheroids with decreasing redshift, well balanced with a decrease of ~ 20&percnt; in the fraction of M_{\rm stellar} \geq 10^{10.5}{\rm M}_{\odot} disks, suggesting that merging massive disk galaxies may form spheroidal systems.

<p> Muhammad A. Latif, Sadegh Khochfar </p>
<p>
Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations have unveiled that the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) were in place at z \geq 10, a few hundred Myrs after the Big Bang. These discoveries are providing strong constraints on the seeding of BHs and the nature of the first objects in the Universe. Here, we study the impact of the freeze-out electron fractions (f_e) at the end of the epoch of cosmic recombination on the formation of the first structures in the Universe. At f_e below the current fiducial cosmic values of \rm ~ 10^{-4}, the baryonic collapse is delayed due to the lack of molecular hydrogen cooling until the host halo masses are increased by one to two orders of magnitude compared to the standard case and reach the atomic cooling limit. This results in an enhanced enclosed gas mass by more than an order of magnitude and higher inflow rates of up to 0.1~M_{\odot}/{yr}. Such conditions are conducive to the formation of massive seed BHs with ~ 10^{4} M_{\odot}. Our results reveal a new pathway for the formation of massive BH seeds which may naturally arise from free

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed an unexpectedly high abundance of UV luminous galaxies at redshifts z\gtrsim 10, challenging `standard' galaxy formation models. This study investigates the role of rapidly rotating (massive) stars undergoing chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) in reconciling this potential tension. These stars are more compact, hotter, and exhibit enhanced UV emission. We find that the rest-frame UV luminosity of star-forming galaxies can be significantly enhanced by a factor of ~ 3-6 when CHE stars above a minimum initial mass of m_{\star,\min}^{\rm CHE}~ 2-10\ \rm M_\odot account for more than half of the total stellar mass following a Salpeter initial mass function. As a result, the UV luminosity functions observed at z~ 12-16 can be reproduced with less extreme values of star formation efficiency and UV luminosity stochastic variability. Our results highlight the potential of CHE in explaining the UV-bright galaxy populations detected by JWST and call for future work to explore the broader astrophysical implications of CHE and its associated phenomena in the early universe, such as gamma-ray bursts, compact object binaries, and metal enrichment.

### 82) [2411.17007](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17007v3): Simulating High-redshift Galaxies: Enhancing UV Luminosity with Star Formation Efficiency and a Top-heavy IMF

<p> Tae Bong Jeong, Myoungwon Jeon, Hyunmi Song, Volker Bromm </p>
<p>
Recent findings from photometric and spectroscopic JWST surveys have identified examples of high-redshift galaxies at z \gtrsim 10. These high-z galaxies appear to form much earlier and exhibit greater UV luminosity than predicted by theoretical work. In this study, our goal is to reproduce the brightness of these sources by simulating high-redshift galaxies with virial masses M_{\rm vir} = 10^{9} - 10^{10} M_{\odot} at z &gt; 10. To achieve this, we conduct cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations, modifying baryonic sub-grid physics, and post-process our simulation results to confirm the observability of our simulated galaxies. Specifically, we enhanced star formation activity in high-redshift galaxies by either increasing the star formation efficiency up to 100&percnt; or adopting a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF). Our simulation results indicate that both increasing star formation efficiency and adopting a top-heavy IMF play crucial roles in boosting the UV luminosity of high-redshift galaxies, potentially exceeding the limiting magnitude of JWST surveys in earlier epochs. Especially, the episodic starburst resulting from enhanced star formation efficiency may explain the high-redshift galaxies observed by JWST, as it evacuates dust from star-forming regions, making the galaxies more observable. We demonstrate this correlation between star formation activity and dust mass evolution within the simulated galaxies. Also, adopting a top-heavy IMF could enhance observability due to an overabundance of massive stars, although it may also facilitate rapid metal enrichment. Using our simulation results, we derive several observables such as effective radius, UV slope, and emission line rates, which could serve as valuable theoretical estimates for comparison with existing spectroscopic results and forthcoming data from the JWST NIRSpec and MIRI instruments.

<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) is opening new frontiers of transient discovery and follow-up at high-redshift. Here we present the discovery of a spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernova (SN Ia; SN 2023aeax) at z=2.15 with JWST, including a NIRCam multi-band light curve. SN 2023aeax lands at the edge of traditional low-z cosmology cuts because of its blue color (peak rest-frame B-V~-0.3) but with a normal decline rate (\Delta m_{15}(B)~1.25), and applying a fiducial standardization with the BayeSN model we find the SN 2023aeax luminosity distance is in ~0.1\sigma agreement with \LambdaCDM. SN 2023aeax is only the second spectroscopically confirmed SN Ia in the dark matter-dominated Universe at z&gt;2 (the other is SN 2023adsy), giving it rare leverage to constrain any potential evolution in SN Ia standardized luminosities. Similar to SN 2023adsy (B-V~0.8), SN 2023aeax has a fairly extreme (but opposite) color, which may be due to the small sample size or a secondary factor, such as host galaxy properties. Nevertheless, the SN 2023aeax spectrum is well-represented by normal low-z SN Ia spectra and we find no definitive evolution in SN Ia standardization with redshift. Still, the first two spectroscopically confirmed z&gt;2 SNe Ia have peculiar colors and combine for a ~1\sigma distance slope relative to \LambdaCDM, though in agreement with recent SN Ia cosmological measurements.

<p>
We present an analysis of eight star-forming galaxies with \langle z \rangle = 4.0 from the JWST EXCELS survey for which we obtain robust chemical abundance estimates for the \alpha-elements O, Ne and Ar. The \alpha-elements are primarily produced via core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) which should result in \alpha-element abundance ratios that do not vary significantly across cosmic time. However, Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) models predict an excess production of Ar relative to O and Ne. The Ar/O abundance ratio can therefore be used as a tracer of the relative enrichment of CCSNe and SNe Ia in galaxies. Our sample significantly increases the number of sources with measurements of {\rm Ar/O} at z &gt; 2, and we find that our sample exhibits sub-solar Ar/O ratios on average, with \rm{Ar/O} = 0.65 \pm 0.10 \, (\rm{Ar/O})_{\odot}. In contrast, the average Ne/O abundance is fully consistent with the solar ratio, with \rm{Ne/O} = 1.07 \pm 0.12 \, (\rm{Ne/O})_{\odot}. Our results support a scenario in which Ar has not had time to build up in the interstellar medium of young high-redshift galaxies, which are dominated by CCSNe enrichment. We show that these abundance estimates are in good agreement with recent Milky Way chemical evolution models, and with Ar/O trends observed for planetary nebulae in the Andromeda galaxy. These results highlight the potential for using multiple element abundance ratios to constrain the chemical enrichment pathways of early galaxies with JWST.

We determine the spectroscopic properties of ~1000 ostensibly star-forming galaxies at redshifts (z=4-10) using prism spectroscopy from JWST/NIRSpec. With rest-wavelength coverage between Lya and [S II] in the optical, we stack spectra as a function of nebular conditions, and compare UV spectral properties with stellar age. This reveals UV lines of N III], N IV], C III], C IV, He II, and O III] in the average high-z galaxy. All UV lines are more intense in younger starbursts. We measure electron temperatures from the collisionally excited [O III] line ratios, finding Te=18000-22000 K for the O++ regions. We also detect a significant nebular Balmer Jump from which we estimate only Te=8000-13000 K. Accounting for typical temperature offsets between zones bearing doubly and singly ionized oxygen, these two temperatures remain discrepant by around 40%. We use the [O III] temperatures to estimate abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. We find that log(C/O) is consistently ~-1, with no evolution of C/O with metallicity or stellar age. The average spectra are mildly enhanced in Nitrogen, with higher N/O than low-z starbursts, but are less enhanced than samples of high-z galaxies with visible UV N III] and N IV]. Whatever processes produce the N-enhancement in the individual galaxies must also be ongoing, at lower levels, in the median galaxy in the early Universe. The strongest starbursts are a source of significant ionizing emission: ionizing photon production efficiencies reach 10^25.7 Hz/erg, and show multiple signatures of high Lyman continuum escape, including Mg II escape fractions nearing 100%, significant deficits in [S II] emission, high degrees of ionization, and blue UV colors.

Galaxy mergers are a key driver of galaxy formation and evolution, including the triggering of AGN and star formation to a still unknown degree. We thus investigate the impact of galaxy mergers on star formation and AGN activity using a sample of 3,330 galaxies at z = [4.5, 8.5] from eight JWST fields (CEERS, JADES GOODS-S, NEP-TDF, NGDEEP, GLASS, El-Gordo, SMACS-0723, and MACS-0416), collectively covering an unmasked area of 189 arcmin^2. We focuses on star formation rate (SFR) enhancement, AGN fraction, and AGN excess in major merger (&mu; &gt; 1/4) close-pair samples, defined by \Delta z &lt; 0.3 and projected separations r_p &lt; 100 kpc, compared to non-merger samples. We find that SFR enhancement occurs only at r_p &lt; 20 kpc, with values of 0.25 \pm 0.10 dex and 0.26 \pm 0.11 dex above the non-merger medians for z = [4.5, 6.5] and z = [6.5, 8.5]. No other statistically significant enhancements in galaxy sSFR or stellar mass are observed at any projected separation or redshift bin. We also compare our observational results with predictions from the SC-SAM simulation and find no evidence of star formation enhancement in the simulations at any separation range. Finally, we examine the AGN fraction and AGN excess, finding that the fraction of AGNs in AGN-galaxy pairs, relative to the total AGN population, is 3.25^{+1.50}_{-1.06} times greater than the fraction of galaxy pairs relative to the overall galaxy population at the same redshift. We find that nearly all AGNs have a companion within 100 kpc and observe an excess AGN fraction in close-pair samples compared to non-merger samples. This excess is found to be 1.26 \pm 0.06 and 1.34 \pm 0.06 for AGNs identified via the inferred BPT diagram and photometric SED selection, respectively.

### 87) [2411.03184](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03184v2): The Soltan argument at z=6: UV-luminous quasars contribute less than 10% to early black hole mass growth

<p> Knud Jahnke </p>
<p>
We combine stellar mass functions and the recent first JWST-based galaxy--black hole scaling relations at z=6 to for the first time compute the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass volume density at this epoch, and compare this to the integrated SMBH mass growth from the population of UV-luminous quasars at z&gt;6. We show that even under very conservative assumptions almost all growth of supermassive black hole mass at z&gt;6 does not take place in these UV-luminous quasars, but must occur in systems obscured through dust and/or with lower radiative efficiency than standard thin accretion disks. The `Soltan argument' is not fulfilled by the known population of bright quasars at z&gt;6: the integrated SMBH mass growth inferred from these largely unobscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early Universe is by a factor \ge10 smaller than the total black hole mass volume density at z=6. This is valid under a large range of assumption about luminosity and mass functions as well as accretion modes, and is likely still at least a factor &gt;2 smaller when accounting for the known obscuration fractions at this epoch. The resulting consequences are: &gt;90%, possibly substantially more, of SMBH-buildup in the early Universe does not take place in luminous unobscured quasar phases, but has to occur in obscured systems, with dust absorbing most of the emitted UV--visible AGN emission, potentially with accretion modes with super-Eddington specific accretion rates. This is consistent with short lifetime arguments for luminous quasar phases from quasar proximity zone studies and clustering. This would remove the empirical need for slow SMBH growth and hence exotic `high-mass seed' black holes at early cosmic time. It also predicts a large population of luminous but very obscured lower-mass quasars at z&gt;6, possibly the JWST `Little Red Dots'.

<p>
We use JWST/NIRISS slitless spectroscopy from the Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public (NGDEEP) Survey to investigate the physical condition of star-forming galaxies at 1.7 &lt; z &lt; 3.4. At these redshifts, the deep NGDEEP NIRISS slitless spectroscopy covers the [O II]\lambda\lambda3726,3729, [O III]\lambda\lambda4959,5007, H\beta and H\alpha emission features for galaxies with stellar masses \log(\mathrm{M_\ast/M_\odot}) \gtrsim 7, nearly a factor of a hundred lower than previous studies. We focus on the [O III]/[O II] (O_{32}) ratio which is primarily sensitive to the ionization state and with a secondary dependence on the gas-phase metallicity of the interstellar medium. We find significant (\gtrsim5\sigma) correlations between the O_{32} ratio and galaxy properties as O_{32} increases with decreasing stellar mass, decreasing star formation rate (SFR), increasing specific SFR (sSFR\equiv \mathrm{SFR}/M_*), and increasing equivalent width (EW) of H\beta and H\alpha. These trends suggest a tight connection between the ionization parameter and these galaxy properties. Galaxies at z~2-3 exhibit a higher O_{32} than local normal galaxies with the same stellar masses and SFRs, indicating that they have a higher ionization parameter and lower metallicity than local normal galaxies. In addition, we observe a mild evolutionary trend in the O_{32} -- EW(H\beta) relation from z~0 to z\gtrsim5, where higher redshift galaxies show increased O_{32} and EW, with possibly higher O_{32} at fixed EW. We argue that both the enhanced recent star formation activity and the higher star formation surface density may contribute to the increase in O_{32} and the ionization parameter.

<p>
We present a joint analysis of high-resolution CO(2-1) and Paschen-\alpha emission lines to trace gas dynamics and spatially resolved star formation in ASPECS-LP.3mm.06, a z=1.1 main sequence galaxy. Utilizing data from the ALMA and JWST NIRCam Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS), we explore both ionized gas and molecular gas within this galaxy. With a substantial molecular gas fraction (f_\mathrm{mol} = 0.44 \pm 0.02), ASPECS-LP.3mm.06 remains on the star-forming main sequence and adheres to the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, indicating typical gas-to-star conversion efficiency. Our analysis reveals extended structures across multiple wavelengths, suggesting regulated star formation within a stable disk. The spatially resolved star formation efficiency (SFE) and kinematic analysis indicate that ASPECS-LP.3mm.06 features a smooth mass assembly process across bulge and disk. Additionally, the galaxy exhibits modest dust extinction (A_\mathrm{V} = 0.8), potentially linked to self-regulation during bulge formation. These findings position ASPECS-LP.3mm.06 as a prototypical galaxy, offering valuable insights into the mechanisms governing normal disk galaxy growth at z~1.

### 90) [2410.10993](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10993v2): Direct high-resolution observation of feedback and chemical enrichment in the circumgalactic medium at redshift z ~ 2.8

<p> Bo Peng, Fabrizio Arrigoni Battaia, Amit Vishwas, Mingyu Li, Edoardo Iani, Fengwu Sun, Qiong Li, Carl Ferkinhoff, Gordon Stacey, Zheng Cai, Rob Ivison </p>
<p>
The circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a vital role in galaxy evolution, however, studying the emission from CGM is challenging due to its low surface brightness and the complexities involved in interpreting resonant lines such as Ly\alpha. The near-infrared coverage, unprecedented sensitivity, and high spatial resolution of JWST enable us to study the optical strong lines associated with the extended Ly\alpha "nebulae" at redshifts of 2--3. These lines serve as diagnostic tools to infer the physical conditions in the CGM gas reservoir of these systems. In deep medium-band images taken by the JWST, we serendipitously discovered the [O III] emission from the CGM around a massive interacting galaxy system at a redshift z~2.8, known to be embedded in a bright extended (100 kpc) Ly\alpha "nebula." This is the first time that the [O III] lines have been detected from a Ly\alpha "nebula." The JWST images reveal that the CGM gas actually resides in narrow (~ 2.5 kpc) filamentary structures with strong [O III] emission, tracing the same extent as the Ly\alpha emission. An analysis of the [O III] suggests that the emitting CGM is fully ionized and is energetically dominated by mechanical heating. We also find that the density and pressure are higher than those commonly predicted by simulations of the CGM. We conclude that the observed CGM emission originates from the gas expelled by the episodic feedback processes, cooling down and enriching the CGM, while traveling a distance of at least 60 kpc. These observations demonstrate how intensive feedback processes shape gas distribution and properties in the CGM around massive halos. While access to such deep, high-resolution imaging opens up a new discovery space for investigating the CGM, it also challenges numerical simulations with respect to explaining and reproducing the exquisitely complex structures revealed by the observations.

<p>
Accurately quantifying the ionizing photon production efficiency (\xi_\rm{ion}) of z&gt;6 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is necessary to understand their contribution to reionization. We investigate the ionizing properties of N=279 SFGs selected at z=6.9-7.6 from the JWST Cycle-1 imaging programmes; PRIMER and JADES. We use BAGPIPES to consistently infer the equivalent widths of their [OIII]+\rm{H\beta} emission lines (W_\lambda) and their physical properties. To supplement our high-redshift galaxies, we measure W_\lambda photometrically for a sample of N=253 z=3.2-3.6 SFGs selected from the VANDELS spectroscopic survey. Comparing these samples, we find a strong apparent redshift evolution in their median W_\lambda, increasing from W_\lambda =310\pm25\,\r{A} in VANDELS to W_\lambda =540\pm25\,\r{A} in our JWST-based sample. In the JWST sample at z&gt;7, we find that W_\lambda correlates with both stellar mass and UV luminosity, with high-mass, M_{ UV}-faint galaxies producing systematically weaker emission lines. Moreover, we discover a departure from the standard log-normal shape of the W_\lambda distribution, characterised by a more pronounced tail at lower W_\lambda, consistent with increasingly bursty star formation. Using W_\lambda as a proxy for \xi_\rm{ion}, and UV spectral slope as a proxy for LyC escape fraction (f_\rm{esc}), we find a minority of galaxies with high \xi_\rm{ion} and f_\rm{esc} (e.g., \rm{log(\xi_{ion}/erg^{-1}Hz})~25.6 and f_\rm{esc}~0.15). However, we find that the LyC photon budget at z&gt;7 is dominated by galaxies with more moderate output, close to the sample median of \rm{log(\xi_{ion}/erg^{-1}Hz})~25.3 and f_\rm{esc}~0.05. This is consistent with estimates for the number of LyC photons required to power reionization at z&gt;7, with no evidence for over or under-production.

We present results of cosmological zoom-in simulations of a massive protocluster down to redshift z\approx4 (when the halo mass is \approx10^{13} M_\odot) using the SWIFT code and the EAGLE galaxy formation model, focusing on supermassive black hole (BH) physics. The BH was seeded with a mass of 10^4 M_\odot at redshift z\approx17. We compare the base model that uses an Eddington limit on the BH accretion rate and thermal isotropic feedback by the AGN, with one where super-Eddington accretion is allowed, as well as two other models with BH spin and jets. In the base model, the BH grows at the Eddington limit from z=9 to z=5.5, when it becomes massive enough to halt its own and its host galaxy's growth through feedback. We find that allowing super-Eddington accretion leads to drastic differences, with the BH going through an intense but short super-Eddington growth burst around z\approx7.5, during which it increases its mass by orders of magnitude, before feedback stops further growth (of both the BH and the galaxy). By z\approx4 the galaxy is only half as massive in the super-Eddington cases, and an order of magnitude more extended, with the half-mass radius reaching values of a few physical kpc instead of a few hundred pc. The BH masses in our simulations are consistent with the intrinsic BH mass-stellar mass relation inferred from high-redshift observations by JWST. This shows that galaxy formation models using the \LambdaCDM cosmology are capable of reproducing the observed massive BHs at high redshift. Allowing jets, either at super- or sub-Eddington rates, has little impact on the host galaxy properties, but leads to lower BH masses as a consequence of higher feedback efficiencies.

### 93) [2410.06960](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06960v4): Blowing star formation away in AGN Hosts (BAH) -- II. Investigating the origin of the H2 emission excess in nearby galaxies with JWST MIRI

We use James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) medium-resolution spectrometer (MRS) observations of 3C 293 (UGC 8782), CGCG 012-070 and NGC 3884 to investigate the origin of the H_2 emission. These three nearby Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) hosts are known to present H_2 emission excess relative to star-forming galaxies, as traced by the H_2 S(3)/PAH_{\rm 11.3&mu; m} line ratio. We define the kinematically disturbed region (KDR) by the AGN and the virially dominated region (VDR) based on the H_2 line widths, using the W{\rm 80} parameter. From the correlations between W{\rm 80} and H_2 S(3)/PAH{\rm 11.3&mu; m}, as well as the higher H2 S(5)/H2 S(3) and [Fe II]{\rm 5.34 &mu; m}/PAH{\rm 11.3&mu; m} ratios and flatter power-law temperature distributions observed in the KDR, we conclude that the H_2 emission in the KDR is primarily driven by shock-heated gas. For 3C 293, the KDR is co-spatial with the radio core, indicating that the origin of the shocks is the interaction of the radio jet with the interstellar medium, which is also responsible for the observed molecular and ionized gas outflows in this source. The other galaxies are weak radio sources; however, due to the lack of high-resolution radio images, we cannot rule out low-power jets as the origin of the shock-heated H_2. Our results indicate that the excess H_2 emission excess is associated to shock heating of the gas, generated by outflows or by the interaction of the radio jet with the ambient gas.

We present a detailed analysis of JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam observations of ZF-UDS-7329, a massive, quiescent galaxy at redshift z=3.2, which has been put forward to challenge cosmology and galaxy formation physics. We study on the impact of different star formation history (SFH) priors, stellar libraries, metallicity, and initial mass function assumptions. Our results show that ZF-UDS-7329, with a formed stellar mass of M_{\star} \approx 10^{11.4}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot} (surviving mass M_{\star\mathrm{,surv}} \approx 10^{11.2}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}) and a specific star-formation rate of \mathrm{sSFR} \approx 0.03 Gyr^{-1}, formed efficiently in the first billion years of the Universe. In agreement with previous work, we find that the spectrum is consistent with mass-weighted stellar ages of 1.3-1.8 Gyr, depending on the SFH prior used. A physically motivated rising SFH prior makes the formation history of ZF-UDS-7329 compatible with stellar mass and star-formation rate estimates of z&gt;6 galaxies. Using NIRCam imaging, we identify a colour gradient indicative of an old, quiescent bulge and a younger disc component, as expected from a complex formation history. The inferred SFH is consistent a high stellar fraction of f_{\star}=M_{\star}/(f_b \cdot M_{\rm h}) \approx 100&percnt; at z=7-12, implying an extremely high integrated star-formation efficiency. However, when considering cosmic variance and possible mergers as expected in over-dense environments -- as traced by ZF-UDS-7329 -- the stellar fractions could be reduced to f_{\star} \approx 50&percnt;, which is more consistent with galaxy formation models and the stellar-to-halo mass relation at lower redshifts. We conclude that ZF-UDS-7329 forms extremely efficient in the early universe, but does not necessitate unseen galaxies at higher redshifts since the inferred SFR of ancestors are consistent with those seen in z&gt;6 galaxies.

<p>
Among the remarkable strides made by JWST is the discovery of the earliest star clusters found to date. These have been proposed as early progenitors of globular clusters, which are known to come from the early stages of star formation in the Universe. This is an exciting development in modern astronomy, as it offers an opportunity to connect theoretical models of globular cluster formation to actual observations of these high-redshift structures. In this work, we aim to develop observational signatures of a star cluster formation route known as supersonically induced gas objects, which are dark matter-less gas clouds in the early Universe proposed as a potential origin of some globular clusters. For the first time, we follow the star formation process of these early Universe objects using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, including mechanical feedback. Our results suggest that the first dark matter-less star clusters are top-heavy, with a higher abundance of massive stars compared to today's clusters and extremely high stellar mass surface densities compared to the local Universe.

We present the formation histories of 19 massive (&gt;3X10^{10}M_\odot) quiescent (sSFR&lt;0.15Gyr^{-1}) galaxy candidates at z~3.0-4.5 observed using JWST/NIRSpec. This completes the spectroscopic confirmation of the 24 K-selected quiescent galaxy sample from the ZFOURGE and 3DHST surveys (Schreiber et al. 2018a). Utilizing Prism 1-5&mu; m spectroscopy, we confirm that all 12 sources that eluded confirmation by ground-based spectroscopy lie at z&gt;3, resulting in a spectroscopically confirmed number density of ~1.4X10^{-5}Mpc^{-3} between z~3-4. Rest-frame U-V vs V-J color selections show high effectiveness in identifying quiescent galaxies, with a purity of~90%. Our analysis shows that parametric star-formation histories (SFHs) from FAST++ and binned SFHs from Prospector on average yield consistent results, revealing diverse formation and quenching times. The oldest galaxy formed ~6X10^{10}M_\odot by z~10 and has been quiescent for over 1 Gyr at z~3.2. We detect two galaxies with ongoing star formation and six with active galactic nuclei (AGN). We demonstrate that the choice of stellar population models, stellar libraries, and nebular or AGN contributions does not significantly affect the derived average SFHs of the galaxies. We demonstrate that extending spectral fitting beyond the rest-frame optical regime reduces the inferred average star formation rates in the earliest time bins of the SFH reconstruction. The assumed SFH prior influences the star formation rate at early times, where spectral diagnostic power is limited. Simulated z~3 quiescent galaxies from IllustrisTNG, SHARK, and Magneticum broadly match the average SFHs of the observed sample but struggle to capture the full diversity, particularly at early stages. Our results emphasize the need for mechanisms that rapidly build stellar mass and quench star formation within the first billion years of the Universe.

<p> Berta Margalef-Bentabol, Lingyu Wang, Antonio La Marca, Vicente Rodriguez-Gomez </p>
<p>
Identifying active galactic nuclei (AGN) is extremely important for understanding galaxy evolution and its connection with the assembly of supermassive black holes (SMBH). With the advent of deep and high angular resolution imaging surveys such as those conducted with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), it is now possible to identify galaxies with a central point source out to the very early Universe. In this study, we develop a fast, accurate and precise method to identify galaxies which host AGNs and recover the intrinsic AGN contribution to the observed total light (f_{AGN}). We trained a deep learning (DL) based method Zoobot to estimate the fractional contribution of a central point source to the total light. Our training sample comprises realistic mock JWST images of simulated galaxies from the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We injected different amounts of the real JWST point spread function (PSF) models to represent galaxies with different levels of f_{AGN}. We analyse the performance of our method and compare it with results obtained from the traditional light profile fitting tool GALFIT. We find excellent performance of our DL method in recovering the injected AGN fraction f_{AGN}, both in terms of precision and accuracy. The mean difference between the predicted and true injected f_{AGN} is -0.002 and the overall root mean square error (RMSE) is 0.013. The relative absolute error (RAE) is 0.076 and the outlier (defined as predictions with RAE &gt;20%) fraction is 6.5%. In comparison, using GALFIT on the same dataset, we achieve a mean difference of -0.02, RMSE of 0.12, RAE of 0.19 and outlier fraction of 19%. We applied our trained DL model to real JWST observations and found that 33% of X-ray-selected AGN and 15% of MIR-selected AGN are also identified as AGN using a cut at f_{\rm AGN} &gt; 0.1.

We present the properties of a massive, large, dusty, metal-rich, star-forming galaxy at z_spec=6.73. GOODSN-100182 was observed with JWST/NIRSpec as part of the AURORA survey, and is also covered by public multi-wavelength HST and JWST imaging. While the large stellar mass of GOODSN-100182 (~10^10 M_sun) was indicated prior to JWST, NIRCam rest-optical imaging now reveals the presence of an extended disk (r_eff~1.5 kpc). In addition, the NIRSpec R~1000 spectrum of GOODSN-100182 includes the detection of a large suite of rest-optical nebular emission lines ranging in wavelength from [OII]3727 up to [NII]6583. The ratios of Balmer lines suggest significant dust attenuation (E(B-V)_gas=0.40+0.10/-0.09), consistent with the red rest-UV slope inferred for GOODSN-100182 (beta=-0.50+/-0.09). The star-formation rate based on dust-corrected H-alpha emission is log(SFR(H-alpha)/ M_sun/yr)=2.02+0.13/-0.14, well above the z~7 star-forming main sequence in terms of specific SFR. Strikingly, the ratio of [NII]6583/H-alpha emission suggests almost solar metallicity, as does the ratio ([OIII]5007/H-beta)/([NII]6583/H-alpha) and the detection of the faint [FeII]4360 emission feature. Overall, the excitation and ionization properties of GOODSN-100182 more closely resemble those of typical star-forming galaxies at z~2-3 rather than z~7. Based on public spectroscopy of the GOODS-N field, we find that GOODSN-100182 resides within a significant galaxy overdensity, and is accompanied by a spectroscopically-confirmed neighbor galaxy. GOODSN-100182 demonstrates the existence of mature, chemically-enriched galaxies within the first billion years of cosmic time, whose properties must be explained by galaxy formation models.

### 99) [2409.18194](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18194v2): Gravitational Wave Forecasts Constrained by JWST AGN Observations for Early Massive Black Hole Mergers

<p> Hanpu Liu, Kohei Inayoshi </p>
<p>
Massive black holes (BHs) grow by gas accretion and mergers, observable through electromagnetic (EM) and gravitational wave (GW) emission. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has detected faint active galactic nuclei (AGNs), revealing an abundant population of accreting BHs with masses of M_\bullet~ 10^{6-8}~M_\odot. This mass range overlaps with the detection scopes of space-based GW interferometers and approaches the upper bounds of the predicted mass of seed BHs. We model BH mass assembly in light of the new JWST findings to investigate their formation channels and predict merger events. Two types of seed BHs are considered: heavy seeds (M_\bullet~ 10^{2-5}~M_\odot) formed in rare and overdense cosmic regions, and light seeds (M_\bullet~ 10^{1-3}~M_\odot) formed as stellar remnants in less massive dark-matter halos. The BHs grow through episodic accretion and merger events, which we model by fitting the AGN luminosity function to observational data including JWST-identified AGNs at z~ 5. We find that heavy seeds alone struggle to explain quasars and faint JWST-selected AGNs simultaneously, requiring the more abundant light seeds. The observed merger rate of BHs from heavy seeds alone is limited to \lesssim 10^{-1}~{\rm yr}^{-1} for major mergers at z\geq5. However, the presence of light seeds increases the major merger rate by several orders of magnitude, which peaks at a total BH mass of M_\bullet~eq 2\times 10^3~M_\odot over 5&lt;z&lt;10 at a rate of ~ 30~{\rm yr}^{-1}. These events are detectable by future GW observatories such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Precise sky localization and distance measurement of those GW events, with solid angle and luminosity distance uncertainties \Delta\Omega\Delta\log D_L\lesssim 10^{-4}~\rm deg^2, will enable EM identification of mergers at z\geq5 and multi-messenger follow-up observations.

### 100) [2409.16347](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16347v2): TRINITY VI: Connection between Galaxy Star Formation Rates and Supermassive Black Hole Accretion Rates from z=0-10

<p> Haowen Zhang, Peter Behroozi, Marta Volonteri, Joseph Silk, Xiaohui Fan, James Aird, Jinyi Yang, Feige Wang, Philip F. Hopkins </p>
<p>
We infer supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion rates and Eddington ratios as a function of SMBH/host galaxy mass and redshift with the empirical TRINITY model of dark matter halo--galaxy--SMBH connection. The galaxy--SMBH mass and growth rate connection from TRINITY matches galaxy observables from 0&lt;z&lt;13 and SMBH observables from 0&lt;z&lt;6.5. Key findings include: 1) the ratio between cosmic SMBH accretion rate and galaxy star formation rate stays constant at ~ 2\times 10^{-3} from z=0-4, and decreases by 2 orders of magnitude from z=4-10; 2) the average SMBH Eddington ratio \overline{\eta} increases towards higher redshifts, nearly reaching \overline{\eta}=1 at z~ 10; 3) at fixed redshift for z&lt;3, SMBHs/galaxies with higher masses have lower \overline{\eta}, consistent with AGN downsizing; 4) the average ratio of specific SMBH accretion rate (\overline{\mathrm{SBHAR}}) to average specific star formation rate (\overline{\mathrm{SSFR}}) is nearly mass-independent, with a value \overline{\mathrm{SBHAR}}/\overline{\mathrm{SSFR}}~ 1, which decreases slightly from z=10 to z=0; 5) similar to galaxies, SMBHs reach their peak efficiency to convert baryons into mass when host halos reach 10^{12} M_\odot; 6) given galaxy and SMBH growth histories from TRINITY, the local descendants of 1&lt;z&lt;11 overmassive JWST AGNs will remain outliers from the local SMBH mass--galaxy mass relation. These findings combine to give a simple explanation for massive (10^9-10^{10}M_\odot) quasars at z&gt;6: at these redshifts, dark matter halos grow with an e-folding time of ~ 45 Myrs, driving similar growth rates in both galaxies and SMBHs.

<p> Kohei Inayoshi, Roberto Maiolino </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at high redshifts of z\gtrsim 4-7, powered by accreting black holes (BHs) with masses of ~ 10^{6-8}~M_\odot. One remarkable distinction of these JWST-identified AGNs, compared to their low-redshift counterparts, is that at least ~ 20&percnt; of them present H\alpha and/or H\beta absorption, which must be associated with extremely dense (\gtrsim 10^9~{\rm cm}^{-3}) gas in the broad-line region or its immediate surroundings. These Balmer absorption features unavoidably imply the presence of a Balmer break caused by the same dense gas. In this Letter, we quantitatively demonstrate that a Balmer break can form in AGN spectra without stellar components, when the accretion disk is heavily embedded in dense neutral gas clumps with densities of ~ 10^{9-11}~{\rm cm}^{-3}, where hydrogen atoms are collisionally excited to the n=2 states and effectively absorb the AGN continuum at the bluer side of the Balmer limit. The non-stellar origin of a Balmer break offers a potential solution to the large stellar masses and densities inferred for little red dots (LRDs) when assuming that their continuum is primarily due to stellar light. Our calculations indicate that the observed Balmer absorption blueshifted by a few hundreds {\rm km~s}^{-1} suggests the presence of dense outflows in the nucleus at rates exceeding the Eddington value. Other spectral features such as higher equivalent widths of broad H\alpha emission and presence of OI lines observed in high-redshift AGNs including LRDs align with the predicted signatures of a dense super-Eddington accretion disk.

The external environments surrounding molecular clouds vary widely across galaxies such as the Milky Way, and statistical samples of clouds are required to understand them. We present the Perseus Arm Molecular Survey (PAMS), a James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) survey combining new and archival data of molecular-cloud complexes in the outer Perseus spiral arm in ^{12}CO, ^{13}CO, and C^{18}O (J=3-2). With a survey area of ~8 deg^2, PAMS covers well-known complexes such as W3, W5, and NGC 7538 with two fields at \ell \approx 110^{\circ} and \ell \approx 135^{\circ}. PAMS has an effective resolution of 17 arcsec, and rms sensitivity of T_\mathrm{mb} = 0.7-1.0 K in 0.3 km s^{-1} channels. Here we present a first look at the data, and compare the PAMS regions in the Outer Galaxy with Inner Galaxy regions from the CO Heterodyne Inner Milky Way Plane Survey (CHIMPS). By comparing the various CO data with maps of H_2 column density from Herschel, we calculate representative values for the CO-to-H_2 column-density X-factors, which are X_{^{12}\mathrm{CO (3-2)}}=4.0\times10^{20} and X_{^{13}\mathrm{CO (3-2)}}=4.0\times10^{21}cm^{-2} (K km s^{-1})^{-1} with a factor of 1.5 uncertainty. We find that the emission profiles, size-linewidth and mass-radius relationships of ^{13}CO-traced structures are similar between the Inner and Outer Galaxy. Although PAMS sources are slightly more massive than their Inner Galaxy counterparts for a given size scale, the discrepancy can be accounted for by the Galactic gradient in gas-to-dust mass ratio, uncertainties in the X-factors, and selection biases. We have made the PAMS data publicly available, complementing other CO surveys targeting different regions of the Galaxy in different isotopologues and transitions.

The Virgo Cluster is the nearest substantial cluster of galaxies to the Milky Way and a cornerstone of the extragalactic distance scale. Here, we present JWST/NIRCam observations that simultaneously cover the cores and halos of ten galaxies in and around the Virgo Cluster and are designed to perform simultaneous measurements of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) and surface brightness fluctuations (SBF). Seven of the targets are within the Virgo Cluster and where we are able to resolve some of the cluster's substructure, while an additional three provide important constraints on Virgo infall. The seven galaxies within Virgo itself all have SBF measurements from the Advanced Camera for Surveys Virgo Cluster Survey (ACSVCS). After adjusting the ACSVCS measurements for the offset from our new JWST TRGB measurements, we determine a distance to the Virgo Cluster of d = 16.17 \pm 0.25 (stat) \pm 0.47 (sys) Mpc. The work presented here is part of a larger program to develop a Population II distance scale through the TRGB and SBF that is completely independent of the prominent Cepheid + Type Ia supernova ladder. The TRGB distances to the galaxies presented here, when combined with future SBF measurements, will provide a crucial step forward for determining whether or not systematic errors can explain the well-known "Hubble tension'' or if there is significant evidence for cracks in the \LambdaCDM model.

<p>
\require{mediawiki-texvc}Cosmic Reionisation commenced when ultraviolet (UV) radiation produced in the first galaxies began illuminating the cold, neutral gas that filled the primordial Universe. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have shown that surprisingly UV-bright galaxies were in place beyond redshift z = 14, when the Universe was less than 300 \, \mathrm{Myr} old. Smooth turnovers of their UV continua have been interpreted as damping-wing absorption of Lyman-\alpha (Ly\alpha), the principal hydrogen transition. However, spectral signatures encoding crucial properties of these sources, such as their emergent radiation field, largely remain elusive. Here we report spectroscopy from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) of a galaxy at redshift z = 13.0 that reveal a singular, bright emission line unambiguously identified as Ly\alpha, in addition to a smooth turnover. We observe an equivalent width of \text{EW}_\mathrm{Ly\alpha} &gt; 40 \, &#8491; (rest frame), previously only seen at z &lt; 9 where the intervening intergalactic medium (IGM) becomes increasingly ionised. Together with an extremely blue UV continuum, the unexpected Ly\alpha emission indicates the galaxy is a prolific producer and leaker of ionising photons. This suggests massive, hot stars or an active galactic nucleus (AGN) have created an early reionised region to prevent complete extinction of Ly\alpha, thus shedding new light on the nature of the earliest galaxies and the onset of Reionisation only 330 \, \mathrm{Myr} after the Big Bang.

<p>
The James Webb Space telescope has discovered an abundant population of broad line emitters, typical signposts for Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Many of these sources have red colors and a compact appearance that has led to naming them `Little Red Dots'. In this paper we develop a detailed framework to estimate the photometry of AGN embedded in galaxies extracted from the \Obelisk{} cosmological simulation to understand the properties of color-selected Little Red Dots (cLRDs) in the context of the full AGN and massive black hole population. We find that using realistic spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and attenuation for AGN we can explain the shape of the cLRD SED as long as galaxies host a sufficiently luminous AGN that is not too much or too little attenuated. When attenuation is too low or too high, AGN do not enter the cLRD selection, because the AGN dominates over the host galaxy too much in blue filters, or it does not contribute to photometry anywhere, respectively. cLRDs are also characterized by high Eddington ratios, possibility super-Eddington, and/or high ratios between black hole and stellar mass.

### 106) [2408.10980](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10980v2): Accelerated Emergence of Evolved Galaxies in Early Overdensities at z~5.7

<p>
We report the identification of two galaxy overdensities at z~5.7 in the sightline of the galaxy cluster Abell 2744. These overdensities consist of 25 and 17 member galaxies, spectroscopically confirmed with JWST NIRSpec/MSA and NIRCam/WFSS. Each overdensity has a total stellar mass of ~2\times10^{10} M_\odot and a star formation rate of ~200 M_\odot/yr within a central region of radius R=2 Mpc (physical). The sensitive PRISM spectra allow us to identify six galaxies that show weak Ha+[NII] emissions within the overdensities (27\pm6&percnt;), whereas the fraction of such galaxies is found significantly lower (6\pm2&percnt;) in field samples of the equivalent redshift range. These weak emission line galaxies, dubbed as wELGs, exhibit a strong continuum break at 4000AA rest-frame, a characteristic feature of evolved stellar populations. The high observed fraction of wELGs in the two overdensities is consistent with the idea that high-density environments are an ideal site where galaxies can accelerate their evolutionary pace compared to field analogs. Our study pinpoints an early onset of environmental effects, already important within one billion years after the Big Bang, and provides a complementary perspective on the emergence of quenched, massive galaxies at lower redshifts. Potential contributions from black hole accretion feedback to the reduction of star formation activity are discussed, but the connection to the local environments remains unclear.

<p> Caleb R. Choban, Samir Salim, Dušan Kereš, Christopher C. Hayward, Karin M. Sandstrom </p>
<p>
Over the last decade, the Atacama Large Millimeter Array has revealed massive, dusty star-forming galaxies at z\gtrsim5, and the James Webb Space Telescope is primed to uncover even more information about them. These observations need dust evolution theory to provide context and are excellent benchmarks to test this theory. Here, we investigate the evolution of galactic dust budget at cosmic dawn using a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations of moderately massive, high-redshift (M_{\rm star}\gtrsim10^9 M_{\odot}; z\gtrsim5) galaxies from the FIRE project, the highest resolution (m_{\rm b} \approx 7100\, M_{\odot}) of such simulations to date. Our simulations incorporate a dust evolution model that accounts for the dominant sources of dust production, growth, and destruction and follows the evolution of specific dust species, allowing it to replicate a wide range of present-day observations. We find, similar to other theoretical works, that dust growth via gas-dust accretion is the dominant producer of dust mass for these massive, z\gtrsim 5 galaxies. However, our fiducial model produces M_{\rm dust} that fall {\gtrsim}1 dex below observations at any given M_{\rm star} (typical uncertainties are {~}1 dex), which we attribute to reduced accretion efficiencies caused by a combination of low galactic metallicities and extremely bursty star formation. Modest enhancements (i.e., within observational/theoretical uncertainties) to accretion and SNe II dust creation raise M_{\rm dust} by {\lesssim}1 dex, but this still falls below observations which assume T_{\rm dust}~25 K. One possibility is that inferred dust masses for z\gtrsim4 galaxies are overestimated, and recent observational/analytical works that find T_{\rm dust}~50 K along with metallicity constraints tentatively support this.

We present the design and observations of low resolution JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy from the Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) Cycle 1 JWST Treasury program. Targets are selected using JWST/NIRCam photometry from UNCOVER and other programs, and cover a wide range of categories and redshifts to ensure the legacy value of the survey. These categories include the first galaxies at z\gtrsim10, faint galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization (z~6-8), high redshift AGN (z\gtrsim6), Population III star candidates, distant quiescent and dusty galaxies (1\lesssim{}z\lesssim 6), and filler galaxies sampling redshift--color--magnitude space from z~0.1-13. Seven NIRSpec MSA masks across the extended Abell 2744 cluster were observed, along with NIRCam parallel imaging in 8 filters (F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M, F444W, F480M) over a total area of ~26 arcmin^2, overlapping existing HST coverage from programs including the Hubble Frontier Fields and BUFFALO. We successfully observed 553 objects down to m_{\mathrm{F444W}}~30\mathrm{AB}, and by leveraging mask overlaps, we reach total on-target exposure times ranging from 2.4-16.7h. We demonstrate the success rate and distribution of confirmed redshifts, and also highlight the rich information revealed by these ultradeep spectra for a subset of our targets. An updated lens model of Abell 2744 is also presented, including 14 additional spectroscopic redshifts and finding a total cluster mass of M_{\mathrm{SL}}=(2.1\pm0.3)\times10^{15}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}. We publicly release reduced 1D and 2D spectra for all objects observed in Summer 2023 along with a spectroscopic redshift catalog and the updated lens model of the cluster (https://jwst-uncover.github.io/DR4.html).

We present a detailed JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam analysis of a gravitationally-lensed galaxy (\rm &mu;=17-21) at redshift 6.14 magnified by the Hubble Frontier Field galaxy cluster MACS J0416. The target galaxy is overall a typical compact and UV-faint (\rm M_{UV}=-17.8) Lyman-\alpha emitter, yet the large magnification allows the detailed characterization of structures on sub-galactic scales (down to a few parsecs). Prominent optical \rm H\alpha, \rm H\beta and [OIII]\lambda\lambda4959,5007 lines are spatially resolved with the high spectral resolution grating (G395H, R~2700), with large equivalent widths, EW(\rm H\beta+[OIII])\gtrsim1000 &#8491;, and elevated ionising photon production efficiencies \rm log(\xi_{ion}/erg^{-1}Hz)=25.2-25.7. NIRCam deep imaging reveals the presence of compact rest-UV bright regions along with individual star clusters of \rm R_{eff}=3-8~pc in size and \rm M~2\cdot10^5-5\cdot10^{6}~M_\odot in mass. These clusters are characterised by steep UV slopes, \rm\beta_{UV}\lesssim-2.5, which in some cases are associated with a dearth of line emission, indicating possible leaking of the ionizing radiation, as also supported by a Lyman-\rm \alpha emission peaking at \rm ~100~km~s^{-1} from the systemic redshift. While the entire system is characterised by low-metallicity, ~0.1~Z_\odot, the NIRSpec-IFU map also reveals the presence of a low-luminosity, metal-poor region with \rm Z\lesssim2&percnt;~Z_\odot, barely detected in NIRCam imaging; this region is displaced by \rm &gt;200~pc from one of the brightest structures of the system in UV, and would have been too faint to detect if not for the large magnification of the system.

<p>
In this study, we present a detailed multiphase analysis of HZ4, a main-sequence star-forming galaxy at z ~ 5.5, known for being a turbulent rotating disk and having a detection of a [CII] outflow in the ALMA observations. We exploit JWST/NIRSpec observations in the integral field spectroscopy mode with low- and high-spectral resolution that allow us for the first time to spatially resolve the rest-frame UV and optical emission of the galaxy to investigate the galaxy properties. In particular, the high-resolution dataset allows us to study the kinematics of the ionized gas phase, and the conditions of the interstellar medium, such as the excitation mechanism, dust attenuation, and metallicity. The lower-spectral resolution observations allow us to study the continuum emission and infer the stellar populations' ages and properties. Our findings suggest that HZ4 is a galaxy merger rather than a rotating disk as previously inferred from lower resolution [CII] data. The merger is associated with an extended broad, blueshifted emission, potentially indicative of an outflow originating from a region of intense star formation and extending up to 4 kpc. In light of these new observations we reanalyzed the ALMA data to compare the multiphase gas properties. If we interpret the broad components seen in [CII] and [OIII]\lambda5007\.A as outflows, the neutral and ionized components are co-spatial, the mass loading factor of the ionized phase is significantly lower than that of the neutral phase, aligning with trends observed in multi-phase systems at lower redshifts. Nonetheless, additional observations and larger statistical samples are essential to determine the role of mergers and outflows in the early Universe and to clarify the origin of the broad emission components observed in this system.

### 111) [2407.10760](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10760v2): Little Red Dots: Rapidly Growing Black Holes Reddened by Extended Dusty Flows

<p> Zhengrong Li, Kohei Inayoshi, Kejian Chen, Kohei Ichikawa, Luis C. Ho </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have revolutionized extragalactic research, particularly with the discovery of little red dots (LRD), which we propose are dust-reddened broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Their unique v-shape spectral feature observed through JWST/NIRCam challenges us to discern the relative contributions of the galaxy and AGN. We study a spectral energy distribution (SED) model for LRDs from rest-frame UV to infrared bands. We hypothesize that the incident radiation from an AGN, characterized by a typical SED, is embedded in an extended dusty medium with an extinction law similar to those seen in dense regions such as Orion Nebula or certain AGN environments. The UV-optical spectrum is described by dust-attenuated AGN emission, featuring a red optical continuum at \lambda&gt;4000 A and a flat UV spectral shape established through a gray extinction curve at \lambda&lt;3000 A, due to the absence of small-size grains. There is no need for additional stellar emission or AGN scattered light. In the infrared, the SED is shaped by an extended dust and gas distribution (\gamma&lt;1; \rho\propto r^{-\gamma}) with a characteristic gas density of ~eq 10-10^3~{\rm cm}^{-3}, which allows relatively cool dust temperatures to dominate the radiation, thereby shifting the energy peak from near- to mid-infrared bands. This model, unlike the typical AGN hot torus models, can produce an infrared SED flattening that is consistent with LRD observations through JWST MIRI. Such a density structure can arise from the coexistence of inflows and outflows during the early assembly of galactic nuclei. This might be the reason why LRDs emerge preferentially in the high-redshift universe younger than one billion years.

<p>
We present results on the emission-line properties of z=1.4-7.5 star-forming galaxies in the Assembly of Ultradeep Rest-optical Observations Revealing Astrophysics (AURORA) Cycle 1 JWST/NIRSpec program. Based on its depth, continuous wavelength coverage from 1--5 microns, and medium spectral resolution (R~1000), AURORA includes detections of a large suite of nebular emission lines spanning a broad range in rest wavelength. We investigate the locations of AURORA galaxies in multiple different emission-line diagrams, including traditional "BPT" diagrams of [OIII]/Hbeta vs. [NII]/Halpha, [SII]/Halpha, and [OI]/Halpha, and the "ionization-metallicity" diagram of [OIII]/[OII] (O32) vs. ([OIII]+[OII])/Hbeta (R23). We also consider a bluer rest-frame "ionization-metallicity" diagram introduced recently to characterize z&gt;10 galaxies: [NeIII]/[OII] vs. ([NeIII]+[OII])/Hdelta; as well as longer-wavelength diagnostic diagrams extending into the rest-frame near-IR: [OIII]/Hbeta vs. [SIII]/[SII] (S32); and HeI/Pagamma and [SIII]/Pagamma vs. [FeII]/Pabeta. With a significant boost in signal-to-noise and large, representative samples of individual galaxy detections, the AURORA emission-line diagrams presented here definitively confirm a physical picture in which chemically-young, alpha-enhanced, massive stars photoionize the ISM in distant galaxies with a harder ionizing spectrum at fixed nebular metallicity than in their z~0 counterparts. We also uncover previously unseen evolution prior to z~2 in the [OIII]/Hbeta vs. [NII]/Halpha diagram, which motivates deep NIRSpec observations at even higher redshift. Finally, we present the first statistical sample of rest-frame near-IR emission-line diagnostics in star-forming galaxies at high redshift. In order to truly interpret rest-frame near-IR line ratios including [FeII], we must obtain better constraints on dust depletion in the high-redshift ISM.

<p>
We analyze ionized gas emission lines in deep rest-frame optical spectra of 16 quiescent galaxies at redshift 1.7&lt;z&lt;3.5 observed with JWST/NIRSpec by the Blue Jay survey. Robust detection of emission lines in 75&percnt; of the sample indicates the presence of ongoing ionizing sources in this passive population. The H\alpha line luminosities confirm that the population is quiescent, with star formation rates that are at least ten times lower than the main sequence of star formation. The quiescent sample is clearly separate from the star-forming population in line diagnostic diagrams, and occupies a region usually populated by active galactic nuclei (AGN). Analysis of the observed line ratios, equivalent widths, and velocity dispersions leads us to conclude that in most cases the gas is ionized by AGN activity, despite the lack of X-ray detections. A subset of the sample also hosts ionized and/or neutral outflows. Our results show, for the first time using a representative sample, that low luminosity AGN are extremely common among quiescent galaxies at high redshift. These low luminosity AGN may play a key role in quenching star formation and in maintaining massive galaxies quiescent from Cosmic Noon to z~0.

<p> Emma Jane Weller, Fabio Pacucci, Yueying Ni, Lars Hernquist, Minjung Park </p>
<p>
Recent JWST observations have uncovered an unexpectedly large population of massive quiescent galaxies at z&gt;3. Using the cosmological simulations IllustrisTNG and ASTRID, we identify analogous galaxies and investigate their abundance, formation, quenching mechanisms, and post-quenching evolution for stellar masses 9.5 &lt; \log_{10}{(M_\star/{\rm M}_\odot)} &lt; 12. We apply three different quenching definitions and find that both simulations significantly underestimate the comoving number density of quenched massive galaxies at z \gtrsim 3 compared to JWST observations by up to ~ 2 dex. In both simulations, the high-z quenched massive galaxies often host overmassive central black holes above the local M_{BH}-M_\star relation, implying that AGN feedback is key in quenching galaxies in the early Universe. The typical quenching timescales for these galaxies are ~ 200-600 Myr. IllustrisTNG primarily employs AGN kinetic feedback, while ASTRID relies on AGN thermal feedback at z &gt; 2.3, which is less effective and has a longer quenching timescale. Although these simulations differ in many aspects, making a direct comparison challenging, our findings suggest the need for improved physical models of AGN feedback in galaxy formation simulations. At lower stellar masses, the quenched galaxies have denser local environments than the star-forming galaxies, suggesting that environmental quenching helps quench less massive galaxies. We also study the post-quenching evolution of the high-z massive quiescent galaxies and find that many experience subsequent reactivation of star formation, evolving into primary progenitors of z=0 brightest cluster galaxies.

### 115) [2405.09720](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09720v2): Inferring the Ionizing Photon Contributions of High-Redshift Galaxies to Reionization with JWST NIRCam Photometry

<p> Nicholas Choustikov, Richard Stiskalek, Aayush Saxena, Harley Katz, Julien Devriendt, Adrianne Slyz </p>
<p>
JWST is providing constraints on the history of reionization owing to its ability to detect faint galaxies at z\gg6. Modeling this history requires understanding both the ionizing photon production rate (\xi_{\rm ion}) and the fraction of those photons that escape into the intergalactic medium (f_{\rm esc}). Observational estimates of these quantities generally rely on spectroscopy for which large samples with well-defined selection functions are limited. To overcome this challenge, we present and release an implicit likelihood inference pipeline, PHOTONIOn, trained on mock photometry to predict the escaped ionizing luminosity of individual galaxies (\dot{N}_{\rm ion}) based on photometric magnitudes and redshifts. We show that PHOTONIOn is able to reliably infer \dot{N}_{\rm ion} from photometry. This is in contrast to traditional SED-fitting approaches which rely on f_{\rm esc} prescriptions that often over-predict \dot{N}_{\rm ion} for LyC-dim galaxies, even when given access to spectroscopic data. We have deployed PHOTONIOn on a sample of 4,559 high-redshift galaxies from the JADES Deep survey, finding gentle redshift evolutions of \log_{10}(\dot{N}_{\rm ion}) = (0.08\pm0.01)z + (51.60\pm0.06) and \log_{10}(f_{\rm esc}\xi_{\rm ion}) = (0.07\pm0.01)z + (24.12\pm0.07). Late-time values for the ionizing photon production rate density are consistent with theoretical models and observations. We measure the evolution of the IGM ionized fraction to find that observed populations of star-forming galaxies are capable of driving reionization in GOODS-S to completion by z~ 5.3 without the need for AGN or other exotic sources, consistent with other studies of the same field. The 20&percnt; of UV-brightest galaxies (M_{\rm UV}&lt;-18.5) reionize 35&percnt; of the survey volume, demonstrating that UV faint LyC emitters are crucial for reionization.

<p> Linhua Jiang, Shuqi Fu, Feige Wang, Sarah E. I. Bosman, Zheng Cai, Hyunsung D. Jun, Zhiwei Pan, Fengwu Sun, Jinyi Yang, Huanian Zhang </p>
<p>
We present constraints on the spacetime variation of the fine-structure constant \alpha at redshifts 2.5\le z&lt;9.5 using JWST emission-line galaxies. The galaxy sample consists of 621 high-quality spectra with strong and narrow [O III] \lambda\lambda4959,5007 doublet emission lines from 578 galaxies, including 232 spectra at z&gt;5. The [O III] doublet lines are arguably the best emission lines to probe the variation in \alpha. We divide our sample into six subsamples based on redshift and calculate the relative variation \Delta\alpha/\alpha for the individual subsamples. The calculated \Delta\alpha/\alpha values are consistent with zero within 1\sigma at all redshifts, suggesting no time variation in \alpha above a level of (1-2) \times10^{-4} (1\sigma) in the past 13.2 billion years. When the whole sample is combined, the constraint is improved to be \Delta\alpha/\alpha = (0.2\pm0.7) \times10^{-4}. We further test the spatial variation in \alpha using four subsamples of galaxies in four different directions on the sky. The measured \Delta\alpha/\alpha values are consistent with zero at a 1\sigma level of ~ 2\times10^{-4}. While the constraints in this work are not as stringent as those from lower-redshift quasar absorption lines in previous studies, this work uses an independent tracer and provides the first constraints on \Delta\alpha/\alpha at the highest redshifts. With the growing number of emission-line galaxies from JWST, we expect to achieve stronger constraints in the future.

### 117) [2405.05319](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05319v2): Is the James Webb Space Telescope detecting too many AGN candidates?

<p> Melanie Habouzit </p>
<p>
In less than two years of operation, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has already accelerated significantly our quest to identify active massive black holes (BHs) in the first billion years of the Universe's history. At the time of writing, about 50 AGN detections and candidates have been identified through spectroscopy, photometry, and/or morphology. Broad-line AGN are about a hundred times more numerous than the faint end of the UV-bright quasar population at z~5-6. In this paper, we compare the observational constraints on the abundance of these AGN at z~5 to the populations of AGN produced in large-scale cosmological simulations. Assuming a null fraction of obscured simulated AGN, we find that while some simulations produce more AGN than discovered so far, some others produce a similar abundance or even fewer AGN in the bolometric luminosity range probed by JWST. Keeping in mind the large uncertainty on the constraints, we discuss the implications for the theoretical modeling of BH formation and evolution in case similar constraints continue to accumulate. At the redshift of interest, the simulated AGN populations diverge the most at Lbol~1e44 erg/s (by more than a dex in the bolometric luminosity function). This regime is most affected by incompleteness in JWST surveys. However, it holds significant potential for constraining the physical processes determining the assembly of BHs (e.g., seeding, feedback from supernova and AGN) and the current abundance of broad-line AGN with &gt;1e44.5 erg/s.

### 118) [2404.02956](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02956v2): Multi-messenger Probes of Asteroid Mass Primordial Black Holes: Superradiance Spectroscopy, Hawking Radiation, and Microlensing

<p> James B. Dent, Bhaskar Dutta, Tao Xu </p>
<p>
Superradiance provides a unique opportunity for investigating dark sectors as well as primordial black holes, which themselves are candidates for dark matter over a wide mass range. Using axion-like particles as an example, we show that line signals emerging from a superradiated axion cloud combined with black hole Hawking radiation in extragalactic and galactic halos, along with microlensing observations lead to complementary constraints on parameter space combinations including the axion-photon coupling, axion mass, black hole mass, and its dark matter fraction, f_{\rm PBH}. For the asteroid mass range ~10^{16}-10^{22}~{\rm g}, where primordial black holes can provide the totality of dark matter, we demonstrate that ongoing and upcoming observations such as SXI, JWST, and AMEGO-X will be sensitive to possible line and continuum signals, respectively, providing probes of previously inaccessible regions of f_{\rm PBH} parameter space. Further complementarity from a stochastic gravitational-wave background emerging from the black hole formation mechanism is also considered.

<p>
We present JWST NIRCam imaging of B14-65666 ("Big Three Dragons"), a bright Lyman-break galaxy system (M_\text{UV}=-22.5 mag) at z=7.15. The high angular resolution of NIRCam reveals the complex morphology of two galaxy components: galaxy E has a compact core (E-core), surrounded by diffuse, extended, rest-frame optical emission, which is likely to be tidal tails; and galaxy W has a clumpy and elongated morphology with a blue UV slope (\beta_\text{UV}=-2.2\pm0.1). The flux excess, F356W-F444W, peaks at the E-core (1.05^{+0.08}_{-0.09} mag), tracing the presence of strong [OIII] 4960,5008 \r{A} emission. ALMA archival data show that the bluer galaxy W is brighter in dust continua than the redder galaxy E, while the tails are bright in [OIII] 88 \mathrm{&mu; m}. The UV/optical and sub-mm SED fitting confirms that B14-65666 is a major merger in a starburst phase as derived from the stellar mass ratio (3:1 to 2:1) and the star-formation rate, ~eq1 dex higher than the star-formation main sequence at the same redshift. The galaxy E is a dusty (A_\text{V}=1.2\pm0.1 mag) starburst with a possible high dust temperature (\ge63-68 K). The galaxy W would have a low dust temperature (\le27-33 K) or patchy stellar-and-dust geometry, as suggested from the infrared excess (IRX) and \beta_\text{UV} diagram. The high optical-to-FIR [OIII] line ratio of the E-core shows its lower gas-phase metallicity (~eq0.2-0.4 Z_{\odot}) than the galaxy W. These results agree with a scenario where major mergers disturb morphology and induce nuclear dusty starbursts triggered by less-enriched inflows. B14-65666 shows a picture of complex stellar buildup processes during major mergers in the epoch of reionization.

### 120) [2403.12132](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12132v4): The haloes that reionized the Universe

<p> Nachiket Joshi, Mahavir Sharma </p>
<p>
We study the reionization of the Universe due to haloes that host galaxies undergoing bursts of star formation. By comparing the recent results from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation EAGLE at z\ge 6, we find that bursty galaxies have specific star formation rate, sSFR &gt;10^{-2} Myr^{-1}, and magnitude, M_{\rm UV}\leq -17. Most of them reside in haloes of mass ~ 10^9 M_\odot and some in more massive haloes. We then construct the models of escape fraction and find that a skewed Gaussian function with a flat tail towards the high mass end best describes the mean dependence of escape fraction on halo mass, considering the haloes hosting bursty galaxies as the primary drivers of reionization. We implement the models of escape fraction in the code 21cmFAST to study the progress of reionization and derive the evolution of the mean ionized fraction that agrees well with observations. We also calculate the brightness temperature, spin temperature, and kinetic temperature and further study the spatial fluctuations in these quantities to gain insights into the progress of reionization. We compute the 21 cm power spectrum and predict a peak in power at 180 MHz corresponding to redshift, z\approx 6.8, that is testable by the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Our findings suggest that the Universe was reionized by the haloes of \gtrsim 10^{9} M_\odot.

<p>
The search for dual supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is of immense interest in modern astrophysics. Galaxy mergers may fuel and produce SMBH pairs. Actively accreting SMBH pairs are observed as a dual quasar, which are vital probes of SMBH growth. Dual quasars at cosmic noon are not well characterized. Gaia observations have enabled a novel technique to identify dual quasars at kpc scales, based on the small jitters of the light centroid as the two quasars vary stochastically. We present the first detailed study of a z=2.17, 0.46'', 3.8 kpc separation dual quasar, J0749+2255, using JWST/NIRSpec integral field unit spectroscopy. Identified by Gaia, J0749+2255 is one of the most distant, small separation dual quasars known. We detect the faint ionized gas of the host galaxy, traced by the narrow Ha emission. Line ratios indicate ionization from the two quasars and from intense star formation. Spectral analysis of the two quasars suggests that they have similar black hole properties, hinting at the possible synchronized accretion activity or lensed quasar images. Surprisingly, the ionized gas kinematics suggest a rotating disk rather than a disturbed system expected in a major gas-rich galaxy merger. Numerical simulations show that this is a plausible outcome of a major gas-rich galaxy merger several tens of Myr before coalescence. Whether J0749+2255 reflects an interesting phase of dual quasar evolution or is a lensed quasar remains unclear. Thus, this study underscores the challenges in definitively distinguishing between a dual and lensed quasars, with observations supporting either scenario.

<p>
We utilize deep JWST NIRCam observations for the first direct constraints on the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function (GSMF) at z&gt;10. Our EPOCHS v1 sample includes 1120 galaxy candidates at 6.5&lt;z&lt;13.5 taken from a consistent reduction and analysis of publicly available deep JWST NIRCam data covering the PEARLS, CEERS, GLASS, JADES GOOD-S, NGDEEP, and SMACS0723 surveys, totalling 187 arcmin^2. We investigate the impact of SED fitting methods, assumed star formation histories (SFH), dust laws, and priors on galaxy masses and the resultant GSMF. Whilst our fiducial GSMF agrees with the literature at z&lt;13.5, we find that the assumed SFH model has a large impact on the GSMF and stellar mass density (SMD), finding a 0.75~dex increase in the SMD at z=10.5 between a flexible non-parametric and standard parametric SFH. Overall, we find a flatter SMD evolution at z \geq 9 than some studies predict, suggesting a rapid buildup of stellar mass in the early Universe. We find no incompatibility between our results and those of standard cosmological models, as suggested previously, although the most massive galaxies may require a high star formation efficiency. We find that the "Little Red Dot" galaxies dominate the z=7 GSMF at high-masses, necessitating a better understanding of the relative contributions of AGN and stellar emission. We show that assuming a theoretically motivated top-heavy IMF reduces stellar mass by 0.5~dex without affecting fit quality, but our results remain consistent with existing cosmological models with a standard IMF.

<p>
The identity of dark matter has been a mystery in astronomy, cosmology, and particle theory for about a century. Bessho, Ikeda, and Yin (2022), three of the current authors, proposed using the state-of-the-art infrared spectrographs, including WINERED at 6.5m Magellan Clay telescope and NIRSpec at James Webb Space Telescope, as efficient detectors for the indirect detection of dark matter with the mass around eV by measuring the line photons from the dark matter two body decays. Applying this concept, we have performed spectrographic observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) Leo V and Tucana II using WINERED by utilizing an object-sky-object nodding observation technique for background subtraction. We present the first result from this dark matter search. Employing zero consistent flux data after the sky subtraction, we have established one of the most stringent limits to date on dark matter decaying into line photons in the mass range of 1.8-2.7\,eV. Our data can also be applied to constrain other spectra of photons from the dSphs.

<p> Boris S. Kalita, John D. Silverman, Emanuele Daddi, Wilfried Mercier, Luis C. Ho, Xuheng Ding </p>
<p>
Resolved stellar morphology of z&gt;1 galaxies was inaccessible before JWST. This limitation, due to the impact of dust on rest-frame UV light, had withheld major observational conclusions required to understand the importance of clumps in galaxy evolution. Essentially independent of this issue, we use the rest-frame near-IR for a stellar-mass dependent clump detection method and determine reliable estimations of selection effects. We exploit publicly available JWST/NIRCam and HST/ACS imaging data from CEERS, to create a stellar-mass based picture of clumps in a mass-complete sample of 418 galaxies within a wide wavelength coverage of 0.5-4.6\,&mu;m and a redshift window of 1 &lt; z &lt; 2. We find that a near-IR detection gives access to a larger, and possibly different, set of clumps within galaxies, with those also detected in UV making up only 28&percnt;. Whereas, 85&percnt; of the UV clumps are found to have a near-IR counterpart. These near-IR clumps closely follow the UVJ classification of their respective host galaxies, with these hosts mainly populating the star-forming regime besides a fraction of them (16&percnt;) that can be considered quiescent. The mass of the detected clumps are found to be within the range of 10^{7.5-9.5}\,\rm M_{\odot}, therefore expected to drive gas into galaxy cores through tidal torques. The clump stellar mass function is found to have a slope of -1.50 \pm 0.14, indicating a hierarchical nature similar to that of star-forming regions in the local Universe. Finally, we observe a radial gradient of increasing clump mass towards the centre of galaxies.

We present the identification of 42 narrow-line active galactic nuclei (type-2 AGN) candidates in the two deepest observations of the JADES spectroscopic survey with JWST/NIRSpec. The spectral coverage and the depth of our observations allow us to select narrow-line AGNs based on both rest-frame optical and UV emission lines up to z=10. Due to the metallicity decrease of galaxies, at z&gt;3 the standard optical diagnostic diagrams (N2-BPT or S2-VO87) become unable to distinguish many AGN from other sources of photoionisation. Therefore, we also use high ionisation lines, such as HeII\lambda4686, HeII\lambda1640, NeIV\lambda2422, NeV\lambda3420, and NV\lambda1240, also in combination with other UV transitions, to trace the presence of AGN. Out of a parent sample of 209 galaxies, we identify 42 type-2 AGN (although 10 of them are tentative), giving a fraction of galaxies in JADES hosting type-2 AGN of about 20\pm3&percnt;, which does not evolve significantly in the redshift range between 2 and 10. The selected type-2 AGN have estimated bolometric luminosities of 10^{41.3-44.9} erg s^{-1} and host-galaxy stellar masses of 10^{7.2-9.3} M_{\odot}. The star formation rates of the selected AGN host galaxies are consistent with those of the star-forming main sequence. The AGN host galaxies at z=4-6 contribute ~8-30 &percnt; to the UV luminosity function, slightly increasing with UV luminosity.

We identify 30 out of the 130 galaxies with broad components of FWHM~200-700 km s^{-1} in the emission lines of H{\alpha} and [OIII] that trace ionized outflows, and find no excesses from the star-formation main sequence. Four out of the 30 outflowing galaxies are Type-1 AGN whose H{\alpha} emission lines include line profile components as broad as FWHM&gt;1000 km s^{-1} while one galaxy is identified as a Type-2 AGN by high ionization emission lines. With the velocity shift and line widths of the outflow broad lines, we obtain ~80-500 km s^{-1} for the outflow velocities. We find that the outflow velocities are slower than low-z galaxies with similar SFRs, which may be explained by the low stellar masses of high-z galaxies. The outflow velocities of AGNs are large but not significantly different from the others. Interestingly, these outflow velocities are typically not high enough to escape from the galactic potentials, suggestive of fountain-type outflows. We estimate mass loading factors {\eta} to be 0.1-1 that are not particularly large, but comparable with those of z~1 outflows. The large fraction of galaxies with outflows (30% with high resolution data) provides constraints on outflow parameters, suggesting a wide opening angle of &gt;45 deg and a large duty-cycle of &gt;30%, which gives a picture of more frequent and spherical outflows in high-z galaxies.

Dual-phase xenon time projection chamber (TPC) detectors offer heightened sensitivities for dark matter detection across a spectrum of particle masses. To broaden their capability to low-mass dark matter interactions, we investigated the light and charge responses of liquid xenon (LXe) to sub-keV nuclear recoils. Using neutron events from a pulsed Adelphi Deuterium-Deuterium neutron generator, an in situ calibration was conducted on the LUX detector. We demonstrate direct measurements of light and charge yields down to 0.45 keV and 0.27 keV, respectively, both approaching single quanta production, the physical limit of LXe detectors. These results hold significant implications for the future of dual-phase xenon TPCs in detecting low-mass dark matter via nuclear recoils.

### 128) [2208.05975](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05975v2): Indirect Detection of eV Dark Matter via Infrared Spectroscopy

Infrared spectroscopy has been developed significantly. In particular, infrared photons can be measured with high spectral and angular resolution in state-of-art spectrographs. They are sensitive to monochromatic photons due to the decay and annihilation of particles beyond the Standard Model, such as dark matter (DM), while insensitive to background photons that form a continuous spectrum. In this paper, we study the indirect detection of the DM decaying into infrared light using infrared spectrographs. In particular, we show that serious thermal and astrophysical noises can be overcome. As concrete examples, the Warm INfrared Echelle spectrograph to Realize Extreme Dispersion and sensitivity (WINERED) installed at the Magellan Clay 6.5m telescope and Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) at the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are discussed. We show that a few hours of measurements of a faint dwarf spheroidal galaxy with WINERED (NIRSpec-like spectrograph) in the Magellan telescope (JWST) can probe an axion-like particle DM in the mass range m_\phi=1.8 - 2.7\,eV (0.5-4\,eV) with a photon coupling g_{\phi\gamma\gamma}\gtrsim 10^{-11}{\rm GeV}^{-1}. Complemental approaches, taking advantage of the high resolutions, such as the measurement of the Doppler shift of the signal photon lines and the possible search of the DM decay around the Milky Way galaxy center with Infrared Camera and Spectrograph (IRCS) at 8.2m Subaru telescope, are also presented.
