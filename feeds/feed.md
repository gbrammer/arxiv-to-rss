### 1) [2412.15027](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15027v1): GA-NIFS: interstellar medium properties and tidal interactions in the evolved massive merging system B14-65666 at z = 7.152

We present JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of the z=7.152 galaxy system B14-65666, as part of the GA-NIFS survey. Line and continuum emission in this massive system (log10(M*/Msol)=9.8+/-0.2) is resolved into two strong cores, two weaker clumps, and a faint arc, as seen in recent JWST/NIRCam imaging. Our dataset contains detections of [OII]3727,3729, [NeIII]3869,3968, Balmer lines (HBeta, HGamma, HDelta, HEpsilon, HZeta), [OIII]5007, and weak [OIII]4363. Each spectrum is fit with a model that consistently incorporates interstellar medium conditions (i.e., electron temperature, T_e, electron density, n_e, and colour excess, E(B-V)). The resulting line fluxes are used to constrain the gas-phase metallicity (~0.3-0.4 solar) and HBeta-based SFR (310+/-40 Msol/yr) for each region. Common line ratio diagrams (O32-R23, R3-R2, Ne3O2-R23) reveal that each line-emitting region lies at the intersection of local and high-redshift galaxies, suggesting low ionisation and higher metallicity compared to the predominantly lower-mass galaxies studied with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU so far at z&gt;5.5. Spaxel-by-spaxel fits reveal evidence for both narrow (FWHM&lt;400 km/s) and broad (FWHM &gt;500 km/s) line emission, the latter of which likely represents tidal interaction or outflows. Comparison to ALMA [CII]158um and [OIII]88um data shows a similar velocity structure, and optical-far infrared diagnostics suggest regions of high Lyman continuum escape fraction and n_e. This source lies on the mass-metallicity relation at z&gt;4, suggesting an evolved nature. The two core galaxies show contrasting properties (e.g., SFR, M*, gas-phase metallicity), suggesting distinct evolutionary pathways. Combining the NIRSpec IFU and ALMA data sets, our analysis opens new windows into the merging system B14-65666.

<p>
We present a structural analysis of 521 galaxy candidates at 6.5 &lt; z &lt; 12.5, with SNR &gt; 10\sigma in the F444W filter, taken from the EPOCHS v1 sample, consisting of uniformly reduced deep JWST NIRCam data, covering the CEERS, JADES GOOD-S, NGDEEP, SMACS0723, GLASS and PEARLS surveys. We use standard software to fit single S\'ersic models to each galaxy in the rest-frame optical and extract their parametric structural parameters (S\'ersic index, half-light radius and axis-ratio), and \texttt{Morfometryka} to measure their non-parametric concentration and asymmetry parameters. We find a wide range of sizes for these early galaxies, but with a strong galaxy-size mass correlation up to z ~ 12 such that galaxy sizes continue to get progressively smaller in the high-redshift regime, following R_{e} = 2.74 \pm 0.49 \left( 1 + z \right) ^{-0.79 \pm 0.08} kpc. Using non-parametric methods we find that galaxy merger fractions, classified through asymmetry parameters, at these redshifts remain consistent with those in literature, maintaining a value of f_{m} ~ 0.12 \pm 0.07 showing little dependence with redshift when combined with literature at z &gt; 4. We find that galaxies which are smaller in size also appear rounder, with an excess of high axis-ratio objects. Finally, we artificially redshift a subsample of our objects to determine how robust the observational trends we see are, determining that observed trends are due to real evolutionary effects, rather than being a consequence of redshift effects.

### 3) [2412.14707](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14707v1): MICONIC: Dual active galactic nuclei, star formation, and ionised gas outflows in NGC 6240 seen with MIRI/JWST

<p>
As part of the guaranteed time observations program Mid-Infrared Characterization Of Nearby Iconic galaxy Centers (MICONIC), we used the medium-resolution spectrometer (MRS) of the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on board of the JWST to study the nearby merger NGC6240. We aim to characterise the dual active galactic nuclei (AGN), the ionised gas outflows and the main properties of the interstellar medium over a mapped area of 6.6"x7.7". We obtained integral field spectroscopic mid-infrared data of NGC6240, resolving both nuclei for the first time in the full 5-28{&mu;}m spectral range. We modelled the emission lines through a kinematic decomposition, finding that the fine-structure lines in the southern (S) nucleus are broader than for the northern (N) nucleus (full width at half maximum of \geq1500 vs ~700 km s^{-1} on average). High excitation lines, such as [NeV], [NeVI], and [MgV], are clearly detected in the N nucleus. In the S nucleus, the same lines can be detected but only after a decomposition of the PAH features in the integrated spectrum, due to a combination of a strong mid-IR continuum, the broad emission lines, and the intense star formation (SF). The SF is distributed all over the mapped FoV of 3.5kpc x 4.1kpc (projected), with the maximum located around the S nucleus. Both nuclear regions appear to be connected by a bridge region detected with all the emission lines. Based on the observed MRS line ratios and the high velocity dispersion ({\sigma}~600 km s^{-1}), shocks are also dominating the emission in this system. We detected the presence of outflows as a bubble north-west from the N nucleus and at the S nucleus. We estimated a ionised mass outflow rate of 1.4\pm0.3 M yr^{-1} and 1.8\pm0.2 M yr^{-1}, respectively. Given the derived kinetic power of these outflows, both the AGN and the starburst could have triggered them. [Abridged]

### 4) [2412.14685](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14685v1): The JWST/NIRSpec view of the nuclear region in the prototypical merging galaxy NGC 6240

Merger events are thought to be an important phase in the assembly of massive galaxies. At the same time, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) play a fundamental role in the evolution of their star formation histories. Both phenomena can be observed at work in NGC 6240, a local prototypical merger, classified as an UltraLuminous InfraRed Galaxy (ULIRG) thanks to its elevated infrared luminosity. Interestingly, NGC 6240 hosts two AGN separated by 1.5''(~ 735 pc), detected in both X-ray and radio band. Taking advantage of the unprecedented sensitivity and wavelength coverage provided by the Integral Field Unit (IFU) of the NIRSpec instrument onboard JWST, we observed the nuclear region of NGC 6240 in a FoV of 3.7'' x 3.7''(1.9 x 1.9 kpc^2), to investigate gas kinematics and InterStellar Medium (ISM) properties with a high spatial resolution of ~ 0.1'' (or ~ 50 pc). We separated the different gas kinematic components through multi-Gaussian fitting and studied the excitation properties of the ISM from the NIR diagnostic diagram based on the H_2 1-0 S(1)/BrGamma and [Fe II]1.257micron/PaBeta lines ratios. We isolated the ionization cones of the two nuclei, and detected coronal lines emission from both of them. Using H_2 line ratios, we found that the molecular hydrogen gas is excited mostly by thermal processes. We computed a hot molecular gas mass of 1.3 x 10^5 M_sun and an ionized gas mass in the range of 10^5 - 10^7 M_sun. We studied with unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity the kinematics of the molecular and ionized gas phases. We revealed the complex structure of the molecular gas and found a blueshifted outflow near the Southern nucleus, together with filaments connecting a highly redshifted H_2 cloud with the two nuclei. We speculate on the possible nature of this H_2 cloud and propose two possible scenarios: either outflowing gas, or a tidal cloud falling onto the nuclei.

### 5) [2412.14676](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14676v1): Predicting Lyα Emission from Distant Galaxies with Neural Network Architecture

<p>
The Ly\alpha emission line is a characteristic feature found in high-z galaxies, serving as a probe of cosmic reionization. While previous works present various correlations between Ly\alpha emission and physical properties of host galaxies, it is still unclear which characteristics predominantly determine the Ly\alpha emission. In this study, we introduce a neural network approach to simultaneously handle multiple properties of galaxies. The neural-network-based prediction model that identifies Ly\alpha emitters (LAEs) from six physical properties: star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass, UV absolute magnitude M_\mathrm{UV}, age, UV slope \beta, and dust attenuation E(B-V), obtained by the SED fitting. The network is trained with galaxy samples from the VANDELS and MUSE spectroscopic surveys and achieves the performance of 77% true positive rate and 14% false positive rate. The permutation feature importance method shows that \beta, M_\mathrm{UV}, and M_* are important for the prediction of LAEs. As an independent validation, we find that 91% of LAEs spectroscopically confirmed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have a probability of LAE higher than 70% in this model. This prediction model enables the efficient construction of a large LAE sample in a wide and continuous redshift space using only photometric data. We apply the prediction model to the JWST photometric galaxy sample and obtain Ly\alpha fraction consistent with previous studies. Moreover, we demonstrate that the difference between the distributions of LAEs predicted by the model and the spectroscopically identified LAEs provides a strong constraint on the HII bubble size.

### 6) [2412.14378](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14378v1): A first taste of MEAD (Measuring Extinction and Abundances of Dust) -- I. Diffuse Milky Way interstellar dust extinction features in JWST infrared spectra

<p> Marjorie Decleir, Karl D. Gordon, Karl A. Misselt, Burcu Günay, Julia Roman-Duval, Sascha T. Zeegers </p>
<p>
We present the initial results of MEAD (Measuring Extinction and Abundances of Dust), with a focus on the dust extinction features observed in our JWST near- and mid-infrared spectra of nine diffuse Milky Way sightlines (1.2 \leq A(V) \leq 2.5). For the first time, we find strong correlations between the 10 &mu;m silicate feature strength and the column densities of Mg, Fe and O in dust. This is consistent with the well-established theory that Mg- and Fe-rich silicates are responsible for this feature. We obtained an average stoichiometry of the silicate grains in our sample of Mg:Fe:O = 1.1:1:11.2, constraining the grain composition. We find variations in the feature properties, indicating that different sightlines contain different types of silicates. In the average spectrum of our sample, we tentatively detect features around 3.4 and 6.2 &mu;m, which are likely caused by aliphatic and aromatic/olefinic hydrocarbons, respectively. If real, to our knowledge, this is the first detection of hydrocarbons in purely diffuse sightlines with A(V) \leq 2.5, confirming the presence of these grains in diffuse environments. We detected a 3 &mu;m feature toward HD073882, and tentatively in the sample average, likely caused by water ice (or solid-state water trapped on silicate grains). If confirmed, to our knowledge, this is the first detection of ice in purely diffuse sightlines with A(V) \leq 2.5, supporting previous findings that these molecules can exist in the diffuse ISM.

### 7) [2412.14248](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14248v1): Episodic super-Eddington accretion as a clue to Overmassive Black Holes in the early Universe

<p> Alessandro Trinca, Rosa Valiante, Raffaella Schneider, Ignas Juodžbalis, Roberto Maiolino, Luca Graziani, Alessandro Lupi, Priyamvada Natarajan, Marta Volonteri, Tommaso Zana </p>
<p>
Early JWST observations are providing growing evidence for a ubiquitous population of accreting supermassive black holes (BHs) at high redshift, many of which appear overmassive compared to the empirically-derived local scaling relation between black hole mass and host galaxy stellar mass. In this study, we leverage predictions from the semi-analytical Cosmic Archaeology Tool (CAT) to reconstruct the evolutionary pathways for this overmassive BH population, investigating how they assemble over cosmic time and interact with their host galaxies. We find that the large M_{\rm BH}-M_{\rm star} ratios can be explained if light and heavy BH seeds grow by short, repeated episodes of super-Eddington accretion, triggered by major galaxy mergers. On average, we find that BH-galaxy co-evolution starts in earnest only at z &lt; 8, when ~eq 30&percnt; of the final galaxy stellar mass has formed outside the massive black hole host. Our model suggests that super-Eddington bursts of accretion last between 0.5-3 Myr, resulting in a duty cycle of 1-4 &percnt; for the target BH sample. The boost in luminosity of BHs undergoing super-Eddington accretion helps explaining the luminosity function of Active Galactic Nuclei observed by JWST. At the same time, a large population of these overmassive BHs are predicted to be inactive, with Eddington ratio \lambda_{\rm Edd} &lt; 0.05, in agreement with recent observations.

``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) are an abundant high-redshift population newly discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). They are characterized by a red color in the rest-frame optical band, compact morphology, and broad Balmer emission lines ({\rm FWHM} \gtrsim 1000~{\rm km\,s^{-1}}) that suggest an AGN nature. Using a method of pixel-by-pixel color selection and relaxing the compactness criteria, we identify three of the first dual LRD candidates in the COSMOS-Web survey with projected separations of 0.\!\!^{\prime\prime}2-0.\!\!^{\prime\prime}4 (1-2 pkpc at their photometric redshifts). A comparison between existing LRD samples and mock data reveals that the projected separations of these dual LRD candidates are unlikely to result from chance projections of objects at different redshifts. In one case (CW-B5-15958), the dual LRD includes two bright sources (m_{\rm F444W}=24.3 and 24.8) with characteristic V-shape spectral energy distribution (SEDs) and photometric redshifts consistent with each other. We find that CW-B5-15958 has a faint off-centered component and a companion galaxy. In the other two dual systems, the brighter LRD exhibits a V-shape SED, while the fainter LRD (m_{\rm F444W}\gtrsim26) is undetected in both F115W and F150W. These discoveries suggest that the angular auto-correlation function (ACF) of LRDs exhibits a significant excess (~3\times10^2 times) on sub-arcsec (kilo-parsec) separations compared to the extrapolation of a power-law ACF of JWST-found AGNs measured over 10^{\prime\prime}-100^{\prime\prime}. Follow-up spectroscopic confirmation of their redshifts and the construction of a larger sample are essential to advance our understanding of the evolution of supermassive black holes and the importance of mergers in the early universe.

We report the discovery of an ultra-massive grand-design red spiral galaxy, named Zh\'ul\'ong (Torch Dragon), at z_{\rm phot} = 5.2^{+0.3}_{-0.2} in the JWST PANORAMIC survey, identified as the most distant bulge+disk galaxy with spiral arms known to date. Zh\'ul\'ong displays an extraordinary combination of properties: 1) a classical bulge centered in a large, face-on exponential stellar disk (half-light radius of R_{\rm e} = 3.7 \pm 0.1 \, \mathrm{kpc}), with spiral arms extending across 19 kpc; 2) a clear transition from the red, quiescent core (F150W-F444W=3.1 mag) with high stellar mass surface density (\log(\Sigma M_{\star}/M_{\odot} \, \mathrm{kpc}^{-2}) = 9.91_{-0.09}^{+0.11}) to the star-forming outer regions, as revealed by spatially resolved SED analysis, which indicates significant inside-out galaxy growth; 3) an extremely high stellar mass at its redshift, with \log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot})=11.03_{-0.08}^{+0.10} comparable to the Milky Way, and an implied baryon-to-star conversion efficiency (\epsilon ~ 0.3) that is 1.5 times higher than even the most efficient galaxies at later epochs; 4) despite an active disk, a relatively modest overall star formation rate (\mathrm{SFR} =66_{-46}^{+89} ~M_{\odot} \, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}), which is &gt;0.5 dex below the star formation main sequence at z ~ 5.2 and &gt;10 times lower than ultra-massive dusty galaxies at z=5-6. Altogether, Zh\'ul\'ong shows that mature galaxies emerged much earlier than expected in the first billion years after the Big Bang through rapid galaxy formation and morphological evolution. Our finding offers key constraints for models of massive galaxy formation and the origin of spiral structures in the early universe.

<p> Peizhi Du, Rouven Essig, Bernard J. Rauscher, Hailin Xu </p>
<p>
Direct-detection searches for dark matter are insensitive to dark matter particles that have large interactions with ordinary matter, which are stopped in the atmosphere or the Earth's crust before reaching terrestrial detectors. We use ``dark'' calibration images taken with the HgCdTe detectors in the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to derive novel constraints on sub-GeV dark matter candidates that scatter off electrons. We supplement the JWST analysis pipeline with additional masks to remove pixels with high-energy background events. For a 0.4% subcomponent of dark matter that interacts with an ultralight dark photon, we disfavor all previously allowed parameter space at high cross sections, and constrain some parameter regions for subcomponent fractions as low as ~0.01%.

### 11) [2412.13064](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13064v1): Color profiles of disk galaxies at z=1-3 observed with JWST: Implications for outer-disk formation histories

<p> Si-Yue Yu, Dewang Xu, Boris S. Kalita, Sijia Li, John D. Silverman, Xinyue Liang, Taotao Fang </p>
<p>
We investigate the deconvolved color profiles of 223 disk galaxies at redshifts of z=1-3 observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as part of the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science survey (CEERS). The filters were selected to approximate the rest-frame B-Y color, which is used to identify U-shaped color profiles -- those becoming progressively bluer with increasing radius, then turning redder beyond a specific point. We find that 36% of Type II (down-bending) disks exhibit U-shaped color profiles with a minimum at or near the disk break. In contrast, no Type I (single-exponential) disks and only 9% of Type III (up-bending) disks show such a profile. The presence of U-shaped color profiles in Type II disks likely arises from the interplay between a star-formation threshold and spiral- or bar-driven secular radial migration of older stars outward. The fraction of Type II disks exhibiting a U-shaped color profile remains almost consistent across two redshift bins, z=1-2 and z=2-3, but is significantly lower than that observed in the local Universe, likely because the secular process of radial migration at high redshift may not have had sufficient time to significantly influence the disk structure. The absence of U-shaped color profiles in Type II disks could point to rapid rather than secular radial star migration potentially caused by violent clump instabilities, transporting both younger and older stars to the outer disk. Our results provide useful constraints on the formation and evolution models of disk galaxies in the early Universe.

This paper presents a deep MIRI/JWST medium resolution spectroscopy (MRS) covering the rest-frame optical spectrum of the GN-z11 galaxy. The [OIII]5008 and H\alpha emission lines are detected and spectroscopically resolved. The line profiles are well-modeled by a narrow Gaussian component with intrinsic FWHMs of 189\pm25 and 231\pm52 kms^{-1}, respectively. We do not find any evidence of a dominant broad H\alpha emission line component tracing a Broad Line Region in a type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, a broad (~430-470 kms^{-1}) and weak (&lt; 20-30%) H\alpha line component, tracing a minor AGN contribution in the optical, cannot be ruled out completely with the sensitivity of the present data. The physical and excitation properties of the ionized gas are consistent with a low-metallicity starburst forming stars at a rate of SFR(H\alpha)=24 \pm3M_{\odot}yr^{-1}. The electron temperature of the ionized gas is T_{\mathrm{e}}(O^{++})=14000\pm2100K, while the direct-T_{\mathrm{e}} gas-phase metallicity is 12+\log(O/H)=7.91\pm0.07 (Z=0.17\pm0.03Z_{\odot}). The optical line ratios locate GN-z11 in the starburst or AGN region but more consistent with those of local low-metallicity starbursts and high-z luminous galaxies detected at redshifts similar to GN-z11. We conclude that the MRS optical spectrum of GN-z11 is consistent with that of a massive, compact, and low-metallicity starburst galaxy. Due to its high SFR and stellar mass surface densities, close to that of the densest stellar clusters, we speculate that GN-z11 could be undergoing a feedback-free, highly efficient starburst phase. Additional JWST data are needed to validate this scenario, and other recently proposed alternatives, to explain the existence of bright compact galaxies in the early Universe.

<p>
We present a study of a double-peaked Ly\alpha emitter, named LAE-11, found in the proximity zone of QSO J0910-0414 at z~6.6. We use a combination of deep photometric data from Subaru Telescope, HST, and JWST with spectroscopic data from Keck/DEIMOS, NIRCam WFSS and NIRSpec MSA to characterise the ionising and general properties of the galaxy, as well as the quasar environment surrounding it. We detect Ly\alpha, H\beta, [OIII] doublet, and H\alpha emission lines in the various spectral datasets. The presence of a double-peaked Ly\alpha line in the spectrum allows us to characterise the opening angle and lifetime of the QSO as \theta_Q&gt;49.62{\deg} and t_Q &gt; 3.8\times10^5 years. LAE-11 is a fairly bright (M_\rm{UV} = -19.84^{+0.14}_{-0.16}), blue galaxy with a UV slope of \beta = -2.61^{+0.06}_{-0.08}. Since the galaxy is located in a quasar-ionised region, we have a unique opportunity to measure the escape fraction of Lyman Continuum photons using the un-attenuated double-peaked Ly\alpha emission profile and its equivalent width at such high redshift. We employ diagnostics which do not rely on the detection of Ly\alpha for comparison, and find that all tracers of ionising photon leakage agree within 1\sigma uncertainty. We measure a moderate escape of Lyman Continuum photons from LAE-11 of f_\rm{esc}^\rm{LyC} = (8 - 33)&percnt;. Detections of both H\alpha and H\beta emission lines allow for separate measurements of the ionising photon production efficiency, resulting with \log(\xi_\rm{ion}/\rm{Hz~erg^{-1}}) = 25.59\pm0.08 and 25.65\pm0.09, for H\alpha and H\beta, respectively. The total ionising output of LAE-11, \log(f_\rm{esc}^\rm{LyC}\xi_\rm{ion, H\alpha}/\rm{Hz~erg^{-1}}) = 24.85^{+0.24}_{-0.34}, is higher than the value of 24.3 - 24.8 which is traditionally assumed as needed to drive Reionisation forward.

### 14) [2412.12060](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12060v1): To model or not to model: nebular continuum in galaxy spectra

<p>
The neglect of modelling both stellar and nebular emission significantly affects the derived physical properties of galaxies, particularly those with high star formation rates. While this issue has been studied, it has not been established a clear threshold for a significant impact on the estimated physical properties of galaxies due to accounting for both stellar and nebular emission. We analyse galaxies from SDSS-DR7 across a wide range of star-forming activity levels, comparing the results obtained from two spectral fitting tools: FADO (which considers both stellar and nebular continuum) and STARLIGHT (only considers the stellar continuum). A strong linear correlation is found between the rest-frame H\alpha and H\beta equivalent widths (EWs) and the optical nebular contribution, identifying these as reliable tracers. The results show that when the nebular contribution exceeds 8% (corresponding to EW(H\alpha)~eq500 \r{A} and EW(H\beta)~eq110 \r{A}), there is a significant impact on the estimation of galaxy properties, namely stellar mass, age and metallicity. Our results highlight the importance of taking into account both the stellar and nebular continuum when analysing the optical spectra of star-forming galaxies. In particular, this is a fundamental aspect for galaxies with a rest-frame EW(H\alpha)\gtrsim500 \r{A} (or the scaled value of 375 \r{A} for pseudo-continuum measures). At low redshifts, this mostly impacts extreme emission line galaxies, while at higher redshifts it becomes a dominant aspect given the higher star-forming activity in the younger Universe. In light of current JWST observations and future instruments designed for high-redshift observations, such as MOONS, this reveals as a critical issue to take into consideration.

We present a detailed investigation into the abundance and morphology of high redshift quenched galaxies at 3 &lt; z &lt; 7 using James Webb Space Telescope data in the NEP, CEERS and JADES fields. Within these fields, we identify 90 candidate passive galaxies using specific star formation rates modelled with the BAGPIPES SED fitting code, which is more effective at identifying recently quenched systems than the classical UVJ method. With this sample of galaxies, we find number densities broadly consistent with other works and a rapidly evolving passive fraction of high mass galaxies (\log_{10}{(M_{\star}/M_{\odot})} &gt; 9.5) between 3 &lt; z &lt; 5. We find that the fraction of galaxies with low star formation rates and mass 9.5 &lt; \log_{10}{(M_{\star}/M_{\odot})} &lt; 10.5 decreases from ~25% at 3 &lt; z &lt; 4 to ~2% at 5 &lt; z &lt; 7. Our passive sample of galaxies is shown to exhibit more compact light profiles compared to star-forming counterparts and some exhibit traces of AGN activity through detections in either the X-ray or radio. At the highest redshifts (z &gt; 6.5) passive selections start to include examples of 'little red dots' which complicates any conclusions until their nature is better understood.

### 16) [2412.10983](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10983v1): The JWST-NIRCam View of Sagittarius C. II. Evidence for Magnetically Dominated HII Regions in the CMZ

<p>
We present JWST-NIRCam narrow-band, 4.05 &mu;m Brackett-\alpha images of the Sgr C HII region, located in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Galaxy. Unlike any HII region in the Solar vicinity, the Sgr C plasma is dominated by filamentary structure in both Brackett-\alpha and the radio continuum. Some bright filaments, which form a fractured arc with a radius of about 1.85 pc centered on the Sgr C star-forming molecular clump, likely trace ionization fronts. The brightest filaments form a `\pi-shaped' structure in the center of the HII region. Fainter filaments radiate away from the surface of the Sgr C molecular cloud. The filaments are emitting optically thin free-free emission, as revealed by spectral index measurements from 1.28 GHz (MeerKAT) to 97 GHz (ALMA). But, the negative in-band 1 to 2 GHz spectral index in the MeerKAT data alone reveals the presence of a non-thermal component across the entire Sgr C HII region. We argue that the plasma flow in Sgr C is controlled by magnetic fields, which confine the plasma to rope-like filaments or sheets. This results in the measured non-thermal component of low-frequency radio emission plasma, as well as a plasma \beta (thermal pressure divided by magnetic pressure) below 1, even in the densest regions. We speculate that all mature HII regions in the CMZ, and galactic nuclei in general, evolve in a magnetically dominated, low plasma \beta regime.

### 17) [2412.10759](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10759v1): Ultra Diffuse Dwarf Galaxies Hosting Pseudo-bulges

<p> Yu Rong, Hong-Xin Zhang, Cheng Cheng, Qi Guo, Weiyu Ding, Zichen Hua, Huiyuan Wang, Xu Kong </p>
<p>
By analyzing data from DESI Legacy Imaging Survey of the dwarf galaxies in the Arecibo Legacy Fast Alfa Survey, we have identified five ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) featuring central pseudo-bulges. These UDGs display blue pseudo-bulges with S\'ersic indices n&lt;2.5 and effective radii spanning 300-700 pc, along with bluer thin stellar disks exhibiting low surface brightness and expansive effective radii that align with the UDG definition. The rotation velocities of these UDGs, determined using HI line widths and optical inclinations, exceed those of most dwarf galaxies of similar mass, suggesting the high halo spins or substantial dark matter halos. We propose that these UDGs likely formed through mergers of dwarf galaxies lacking old stars in their progenitors, resulting in the development of central bulge-like structures during starbursts triggered by the mergers, while also enhancing their halo spin. Subsequent gas accretion facilitated the formation of extended stellar disks. It is also worth noting the possibility that these UDGs could alternatively represent ``failed L^{\star} galaxies'' with massive dark matter halos but reduced star formation efficiencies. If future high-resolution HI observations confirm the presence of massive halos around these UDGs, they may have formed due to intense AGN feedback in the early universe, and may be the descendants of ``little red dots'' observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, which are characterized by heightened central black hole masses and intensified accretion and feedback processes in the early universe.

<p>
We present a spectroscopic analysis of two star-forming galaxies at z~5 observed with JWST/NIRSpec as part of the Early eXtragalactic Continuum and Emission Line Science (EXCELS) survey. The detection of the C III]\lambda\lambda1906,09, [O II]\lambda\lambda3726,29, [O III]\lambda\lambda4363,5007, and [N II]\lambda6584 nebular emission lines enables investigation of the C/O, N/O, and C/N abundance ratios using the temperature-sensitive method. The two galaxies have stellar masses of log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot} ) = 8.13\pm0.09 and log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot} )=8.52\pm0.13 and corresponding metallicities of Z~0.2Z_{\odot} and Z~0.3Z_{\odot}. These metallicities are somewhat higher than is typical for other z&gt;5 galaxies with similar stellar mass and are in fact comparable to high-redshift analogue galaxies at z~0. Both galaxies display evidence for N/O enhancement with respect to the z~0 sample, with log(N/O)=-1.07\pm0.17 and log(N/O)=-0.86\pm0.15 respectively. In contrast, we find low C abundances, with log(C/O)=-0.82\pm0.22 and log(C/O)=-1.02\pm0.22, consistent with the predicted yields of core-collapse supernovae. Following the trend observed in other high-redshift sources, we find that the C/N ratios are lower at fixed O/H compared to the majority of local galaxies. In contrast to the top-heavy IMF invoked in some studies to explain low C/N ratios in metal-poor galaxies, we find, via comparison to chemical evolution models, that a standard or bottom-heavy IMF better explains the observed abundance ratios in more enriched systems due to an increase in N-enrichment from intermediate mass (4-7M_{\odot}) stars. Our results demonstrate that robust measurements of CNO abundances with JWST can reveal unique enrichment pathways in galaxies as a function of both metallicity and redshift.

<p>
Previous Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of the star-forming cluster NGC 346 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) had revealed a large population of pre-main sequence (PMS) candidates, characterised by Halpha excess emission in their photometry. However, without access to spectroscopy, the nature of these objects remained unclear. Using the NIRSpec instrument on board JWST, we studied a sample of these stars, with masses in the range ~0.9-1.8 Msun, effective temperatures in the range 4,500-8,000 K, and PMS ages between ~0.1 and 30 Myr. Here we present the first spectra of solar-mass PMS stars in the metal-poor SMC (Z=1/8 Zsun) and discuss the physical properties of ten representative sources with good signal-to-noise ratio. The observations indicate that even the oldest of these PMS candidates are still accreting gas with typical rates of ~10^{-8} Msun/yr for stars older than ~10 Myr, confirming their PMS nature. The spectra also reveal near-infrared excess and molecular hydrogen excitation lines consistent with the presence of discs around these stars. These findings suggest that in a low-metallicity environment circumstellar discs can live longer than previously thought.

Most of the baryonic matter of the Universe resides in a highly-ionized gaseous intergalactic medium. This gas flows along dark-matter filaments toward galaxy superclusters, clusters, and groups until it pools around the galaxies into a circumgalactic medium. Eventually, the gas settles into the interstellar medium of the galaxies, where it fuels the successive generations of star formation that ultimately produce the stars and heavy elements that make up galaxies today. The gas has been studied for decades using absorption lines produced by Hydrogen and various ions of heavy elements in the spectra of background quasi-stellar objects (QSOs). But directly imaging the extremely faint glow of this "cosmic web" of intergalactic and circumgalactic gas has remained an elusive goal of observational cosmology. Some recent progress has been made by using imaging spectrographs to record high-redshift Ly\alpha emission, although over only very narrow fields of view. Here we report direct images of intergalactic and circumgalactic gas in the distant Universe obtained using the Condor Array Telescope that we purposely built to reach extremely low-surface-brightness sensitivities over very wide fields of view. We show that these images directly detect and characterize the imprint of Ly\alpha emission from the cosmic web at an overwhelming statistical significance. By stacking portions of the images centered on tens of thousands of galaxies of known redshift, we show that they also reveal extremely faint emission from H^0, C^{3+}, and Mg^+ and absorption from cosmic dust in the tenuous outskirts of the galaxies. Our results demonstrate that sensitive imaging observations can now detect and characterize emission (and absorption) from the cosmic web of intergalactic and circumgalactic gas (and dust).

We present the results of a study investigating the galaxy stellar-mass function (GSMF), size-mass relations and morphological properties of star-forming and quiescent galaxies over the redshift range 0.25&lt;z&lt;2.25, using the JWST PRIMER survey. The depth of the PRIMER near-IR imaging allows us to confirm the double Schechter function shape of the quiescent GSMF out to z~eq2.0, via a clear detection of the upturn at \mathrm{log}_{10}(M_{\star}/ M_{\odot}) \leq 10 thought to be induced by environmental quenching. In addition to the GSMF, we confirm that quiescent galaxies can be split into separate populations at \mathrm{log}_{10}(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) ~eq 10, based on their size-mass relations and morphologies. We find that low-mass quiescent galaxies have more disk-like morphologies (based on S\'ersic index, Gini coefficient and M_{20} metrics) and follow a shallower size-mass relation than their high-mass counterparts. Indeed, the slope of the size-mass relation followed by low-mass quiescent galaxies is indistinguishable from that followed by star-forming galaxies, albeit with a lower normalization. Moreover, within the errors, the evolution in the median size of low-mass quiescent galaxies is indistinguishable from that followed by star-forming galaxies (R_{e}\propto(1+z)^{-0.25\pm0.03}), and significantly less rapid than that displayed by high-mass quiescent galaxies (R_{e}\propto (1+z)^{-1.14\pm 0.03}). Overall, our results are consistent with low and high-mass quiescent galaxies following different quenching pathways. The evolution of low-mass quiescent galaxies is qualitatively consistent with the expectations of external/environmental quenching (e.g. ram-pressure stripping). In contrast, the evolution of high-mass quiescent galaxies is consistent with internal/mass quenching (e.g. AGN feedback) followed by size growth driven by minor mergers.

Optically dark dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) play an essential role in massive galaxy formation at early cosmic time, however their nature remains elusive. Here we present a detailed case study of all the baryonic components of a z=4.821 DSFG, XS55. Selected from the ultra-deep COSMOS-XS 3GHz map with a red SCUBA-2 450&mu;m/850&mu;m colour, XS55 was followed up with ALMA 3mm line scans and spectroscopically confirmed to be at z=4.821 via detections of the CO(5-4) and [CI](1-0) lines. JWST/NIRCam imaging reveals that XS55 is a F150W-dropout with red F277W/F444W colour, and a complex morphology: a compact central component embedded in an extended structure with a likely companion. XS55 is tentatively detected in X-rays with both Chandra and XMM-Newton, suggesting an active galactic nucleus (AGN) nature. By fitting a panchromatic SED spanning NIR to radio wavelengths, we revealed that XS55 is a massive main-sequence galaxy with a stellar mass of M_\ast=(5\pm1)\times10^{10}\,{\rm M_\odot} and a star formation rate of {\rm SFR}=540\pm177~{\rm M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}. The dust of XS55 is optically thick in the far infrared (FIR) with a surprisingly cold dust temperature of T_{\rm dust}=33\pm2\,{\rm K}, making XS55 one of the coldest DSFGs at z&gt;4 known to date. This work unveils the nature of a radio-selected F150W-dropout, suggesting the existence of a population of DSFGs hosting active black holes embedded in optically thick dust.

<p>
We use hierarchical Bayesian modelling to calibrate a network of 32 all-sky faint DA white dwarf (DA WD) spectrophotometric standards (16.5 &lt; V &lt; 19.5) alongside the three CALSPEC standards, from 912 \r{A} to 32 &mu;m. The framework is the first of its kind to jointly infer photometric zeropoints and WD parameters (\log g, T_{\text{eff}}, A_V, R_V) by simultaneously modelling both photometric and spectroscopic data. We model panchromatic HST/WFC3 UVIS and IR fluxes, HST/STIS UV spectroscopy and ground-based optical spectroscopy to sub-percent precision. Photometric residuals for the sample are the lowest yet yielding &lt;0.004 mag RMS on average from the UV to the NIR, achieved by jointly inferring time-dependent changes in system sensitivity and WFC3/IR count-rate nonlinearity. Our GPU-accelerated implementation enables efficient sampling via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, critical for exploring the high-dimensional posterior space. The hierarchical nature of the model enables population analysis of intrinsic WD and dust parameters. Inferred SEDs from this model will be essential for calibrating the James Webb Space Telescope as well as next-generation surveys, including Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

### 24) [2412.08609](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08609v1): Dust and gas modelling in radiative transfer simulations of disc-dominated galaxies with RADMC-3D

<p>
Bridging theory and observations is a key task to understand galaxy formation and evolution. With the advent of state-of-the-art observational facilities, an accurate modelling of galaxy observables through radiative transfer simulations coupled to hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation must be performed. We present a novel pipeline, dubbed RTGen, based on the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RADMC-3D , and explore the impact of the physical assumptions and modelling of dust and gas phases on the resulting galaxy observables. In particular, we address the impact of the dust abundance, composition, and grain size, as well as model the atomic-to-molecular transition and study the resulting emission from molecular gas. We apply Monte Carlo radiative transfer a posteriori to determine the dust temperature in six different hydrodynamic simulations of isolated galaxies. Afterwards, we apply ray tracing to compute the spectral energy distribution, as well as continuum images and spectral line profiles. We find our pipeline to predict accurate spectral energy distribution distributions of the studied galaxies, as well as continuum and CO luminosity images, in good agreement with literature results from both observations and theoretical studies. In particular, we find the dust modelling to have an important impact on the convergence of the resulting predicted galaxy observables, and that an adequate modelling of dust grains composition and size is required. We conclude that our novel framework is ready to perform high-accuracy studies of the observables of the ISM, reaching few tens percent convergence under the studied baseline configuration. This will enable robust studies of galaxy formation, and in particular of the nature of massive clumps in high-redshift galaxies, through the generation of mock images mimicking observations from state-of-the-art facilities such as JWST and ALMA.

<p>
Recently, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a new class of high redshift (high-z, z&gt;4) compact galaxies which are red in the rest-frame optical and blue in the rest-frame UV as V-shaped spectral energy distributions (SEDs), referred to as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). It is very likely that LRDs host obscured broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In the meanwhile, Green pea galaxies (GPs), which are compact dwarf galaxies at low redshift, share various similar properties with high redshift star-forming galaxies. Here we aim to find the connection between the LRDs and GPs hosting broad-line AGNs (BLGPs). With a sample of 19 BLGPs obtained from our previous work, we further identify 7 GPs with V-shaped rest-frame UV-to-optical SEDs that are likely local analogs to LRDs. These V-shaped BLGPs exhibit faint UV absolute magnitudes and sub-Eddington rates similar to those of LRDs. Three of them occupy a similar region as LRDs in the BPT diagram, suggesting they have similar ionization conditions and gas-phase metallicities to LRDs. These similarities suggest that V-shaped BLGPs can be taken as local analogs of high-redshift LRDs. In addition, most (16/19) BLGPs, including 6 V-shaped BLGPs, host over-massive black holes above the local M_{\rm BH}-M_{*} relation, making it the first sample of galaxies hosting over-massive black holes at z&lt;0.4. These findings will help us learn more about the formation and co-evolution of early galaxies and black holes.

### 26) [2412.08395](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08395v1): Lyman Continuum Leakers at z&gt;3 in the GOODS-S Field: Mergers Dominated

<p> Shuairu Zhu, Zhen-ya Zheng, Fang-Ting Yuan, Chunyan Jiang, Ruqiu Lin </p>
<p>
Understanding the ionizing photon escape from galaxies is essential for studying Cosmic Reionization. With a sample of 23 Lyman Continuum (LyC) leakers at 3&lt;z&lt;4.5 in the GOODS-S field, we investigate their morphologies using high-resolution data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We find that 20 of the 23 LyC leakers show merging signatures, while the remaining 3 are starbursts. Based on our previous finding that LyC leakers are not necessarily starbursts while some are in the star formation main sequence, we further find that those in the main sequence show merger signatures. Our results suggest that LyC leakers are either starbursts or mergers, both of which can facilitate the LyC photon escape, in addition to generating more LyC photons. Furthermore, we show that high-z LyC leakers are statistically more extended than those selected at low redshift, which exhibits a higher merger fraction as size increases. This is likely due to the observational bias that the spatial resolution limits the detection of high-z compact galaxies, while low redshift LyC leakers are more selected as compact starbursts.

<p>
The electron density ({n_{\rm e}}) of the interstellar medium (ISM) in star-forming galaxies is intimately linked to star formation and ionization condition. Using the high-resolution spectra obtained from the JWST NIRSpec micro shutter assembly (MSA) as part of the GLASS-JWST program, we have assembled the largest sample to date (34 galaxies) with individual {n_{\rm e}} measurements derived from the [OII] \lambda\lambda3726,29 and/or [SII] \lambda\lambda6718,32 doublets at 0.7\lesssim z\lesssim 9.3. The gravitational lensing magnification by the foreground Abell~2744 cluster allows us to probe {n_{\rm e}} in galaxies with stellar masses (M_{*}) down to ~eq 10^{7.5} M_\odot across the entire redshift range. Our analysis reveals that the [OII] flux ratios are marginally anti-correlated with specific star formation rate (sSFR) within a 1-\sigma confidence interval, whereas the [SII] flux ratios show no significant correlation with sSFR. Despite clear correlation between sSFR and redshift within our sample, we find no apparent redshift evolution of {n_{\rm e}} at z ~eq 1-9. Our dataset also includes 13 galaxies where {n_{\rm e}} can be measured from both [OII] and [SII]. Contrary to findings at lower redshifts, we observe considerable scatter in {n_{\rm e}} measurements from [OII] and [SII], indicating a complex gaseous environment with significant variations in {n_{\rm e}} in high-redshift galaxies. This work highlights the unique capability of JWST NIRSpec/MSA high-resolution spectroscopy to characterize the detailed physical properties of the ISM in individual high-redshift galaxies.

<p>
The earliest stages of star and cluster formation are hidden within dense cocoons of gas and dust, limiting their detection at optical wavelengths. With the unprecedented infrared capabilities of JWST, we can now observe dust-enshrouded star formation with ~10 pc resolution out to ~20 Mpc. Early findings from PHANGS-JWST suggest that 3.3 &mu;m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission can identify star clusters in their dust-embedded phases. Here, we extend this analysis to 19 galaxies from the PHANGS-JWST Cycle 1 Treasury Survey, providing the first characterization of compact sources exhibiting 3.3&mu;m PAH emission across a diverse sample of nearby star-forming galaxies. We establish selection criteria, a median color threshold of F300M-F335M=0.67 at F335M=20, and identify of 1816 sources. These sources are predominantly located in dust lanes, spiral arms, rings, and galaxy centers, with ~87% showing concentration indices similar to optically detected star clusters. Comparison with the PHANGS-HST catalogs suggests that PAH emission fades within ~3 Myr. The H\alpha equivalent width of PAH emitters is 1-2.8 times higher than that of young PHANGS-HST clusters, providing evidence that PAH emitters are on average younger. Analysis of the bright portions of luminosity functions (which should not suffer from incompleteness) shows that young dusty clusters may increase the number of optically visible \leq 3 Myr-old clusters in PHANGS-HST by a factor between ~1.8x-8.5x.

### 29) [2412.07853](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07853v1): Probing the gas that builds planets: Results from the JWST MINDS program

<p> E. F. van Dishoeck, the MINDS team </p>
<p>
Infrared observations with JWST open up a new window into the chemical composition of the gas in the inner disk (&lt;few au) where planets are built. Results from the MIRI GTO program MINDS (PI: Th. Henning, co-PI: I. Kamp) are presented for several disks around T Tauri and lower-mass stars. A large diversity in spectra is found. Some disks are very rich in H2O lines whereas other disks show prominent CO2. The spectra of disks around very low-mass stars (&lt;0.3 MSun, late-M type stars like Trappist-1) are dominated by C2H2 and other hydrocarbon features including those of benzene, suggesting volatile C/O&gt;1. Together these data point to a rich chemistry in the inner regions that is linked to the physical structure of these disks (e.g., dust traps) and that may be affected by processes such as radial drift of icy pebbles from the outer to the inner disk.

### 30) [2412.07598](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07598v1): Radiation-driven dusty outflows from early galaxies

<p> Yurina Nakazato, Andrea Ferrara </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered an overabundance of UV-bright (M_{\rm UV} \lesssim -20), massive galaxies at z \gtrsim 10 in comparison to pre-JWST theoretical predictions. Among the proposed interpretations, such excess has been explained by negligible dust attenuation conditions following radiation-driven outflows developing when a galaxy goes through a super-Eddington phase. Dust opacity decreases the classical Eddington luminosity by a (boost) factor A, thus favoring the driving of outflows by stellar radiation in compact, initially dusty galaxies. Here, we compute A as a function of the galaxy stellar mass, gas fraction, galaxy size, and metallicity (a total of 8 parameters). We find that the main dependence is on metallicity and, for the fiducial model, A ~ 1800(Z/Z_\odot)/(1+N_{\rm H}/10^{23.5}\, {\rm cm^2}). We apply such results to 20 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at z \gtrsim 10 and evaluate their modified Eddington ratio. We predict that three galaxies are in the outflow phase. Their outflows have relatively low velocities (60 -100 \,{\rm km\ s^{-1}}), implying that they are unlikely to escape from the system. For the remaining 17 galaxies that are not currently in the outflow phase, we calculate the past evolution of the modified Eddington ratio from their star formation history. We find that 15 of them experienced an outflow phase prior to observation during which they effectively displaced their dust to larger radii. Thus, radiation-driven outflows appear to be a common phenomenon among early galaxies, strongly affecting their visibility.

### 31) [2412.07070](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07070v1): Not just PAH_{3.3}: why galaxies turn red in the Near-Infrared

<p>
We measure the spectral properties of a sample of 20 galaxies at z~0.35 selected for having surprisingly red JWST/NIRCAM F200W-F444W colors. 19 galaxies were observed with JWST/NIRSpec in the PRISM configuration, while one galaxy was observed with the high resolution gratings. 17/20 galaxies in our sample exhibit strong 3.3 &mu; m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH_{3.3}) emission (equivalent width EW(PAH_{3.3})&gt;0.03&mu; m). In these galaxies, the strength of the color excess does not depend on environment and it correlates with EW(PAH_{3.3}). Nonetheless, the presence of the PAH_{3.3} alone can not fully explain the color excess, as an equivalent width of ~0.1&mu; m is able to increase the color of galaxies by only 0.13 mag. A contribution from a hot dust component is required to explain the excess. Both the EW(PAH_{3.3}) and flux correlate with the H\alpha equivalent width and flux, suggesting that they are produced by the same mechanism. 5/20 galaxies showing PAH would be classified as passive based on broad band rest frame colors ((B-V) and/or UVJ diagrams) and are hence "faux-passive". Of these, 3 galaxies have a significantly lower EW(PAH_{3.3}) given their color and also have low EW(H\alpha) and we tentatively conclude this behaviour is due to the presence of an AGN. The three galaxies with no PAH_{3.3} in emission have passive spectra, as do the 8 galaxies in our sample with normal F200W-F444W colors. We therefore conclude that the PAH_{3.3} feature is linked to dust-enshrouded star formation. The dust corrected SFR from PAH_{3.3} is a factor of 3.5 higher than the SFR obtained from H\alpha, suggesting that these galaxies are characterized by significant amounts of dust.

<p>
We study the rest-frame optical and ultraviolet morphology of galaxies in the first billion years of the Universe. Using JWST data from the UNCOVER and MegaScience surveys targeting the lensing cluster Abell 2744 we present multi-band morphological measurements for a sample of 995 galaxies selected using 20-band NIRCam photometry and 35 using NIRSpec Prism spectroscopy over the redshift range of 4&lt;z&lt;8. The wavelength-dependent morphology is measured using pysersic by simultaneously modeling the images in 6 NIRCam wide filters covering the rest-frame UV to optical. The joint modeling technique increases the precision of measured radii by 50&percnt;. Galaxies in our sample show a wide range of Sersic indices, with no systematic difference between optical and UV morphology. We model the size-mass relation in a Bayesian manner using a continuity model to directly fit the redshift evolution while accounting for observational uncertainties. We find the average size of galaxies at \log M_*/M_\odot=8.5 grows rapidly, from 400 pc at z=8 to 830 pc at z=4. This is faster evolution than expected from power law scalings of the Hubble parameter or scale factor that describe well previous results at z&lt;2. This suggests that different and/or much stronger processes affect low mass systems during the epoch of reionization. The measured logarithmic slope (0.25) and scatter (0.23 dex) are non-evolving. We discuss the remarkable consistency of the slope and scatter over cosmic time in the context of the galaxy-halo connection.

### 33) [2412.06903](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06903v1): Time to Sparkler. Accurate ages of lensed globular clusters at z=1.4 with JWST photometry

<p> Elena Tomasetti, Michele Moresco, Carmela Lardo, Frédéric Courbin, Raul Jimenez, Licia Verde, Martin Millon, Andrea Cimatti </p>
<p>
Determining reliable ages for old stellar objects at different redshifts offers a powerful means to constrain cosmology without relying on a specific cosmological model: this is known as the cosmic clocks method. Globular clusters (GCs), long recognised as hosts of the Universe's oldest stars, have served as the archetypical cosmic clocks. However, their age estimates have traditionally been confined to redshift z=0, limiting their role to constraining the present-day age of the Universe. Here we explore how to measure reliable ages of GCs well beyond z=0, leveraging their potential to extend cosmic clock measurements to earlier epochs. Specifically, we use 6-band JWST/NIRCam high-precision photometry of candidate stellar clusters in the Sparkler galaxy, located at redshift z=1.378 and strongly lensed by the galaxy cluster SMACS J0723.3-7327. By employing stellar population models within a Bayesian inference framework, we constrain the GCs' ages, star formation histories, metallicities, and dust attenuation. The five compact sources previously identified as GCs, based on their red spectral energy distributions being consistent with the colours of old stellar systems, yield a formation age of 1.9\pm0.4 Gyr on average. This result implies a total age of the Universe that aligns well with the \LambdaCDM model derived from Planck18 data. Recent space-based observations have uncovered a wealth of lensed GCs as well as globulars within the member galaxies of the clusters themselves. These findings suggest that the pool of objects available for cosmic clock studies is enormous. A systematic multi-band photometric survey of GCs in and behind galaxy clusters, using facilities like Euclid and JWST, would therefore be a powerful tool for estimating cluster ages across a large range of redshifts, allowing the Universe to be dated across an unprecedented range of epochs.

<p>
We present a stringent measurement of the dust-obscured star-formation rate density (SFRD) at z=4-6 from the ASPIRE JWST Cycle-1 medium and ALMA Cycle-9 large program. We obtained JWST/NIRCam grism spectroscopy and ALMA 1.2-mm continuum map along 25 independent quasar sightlines, covering a total survey area of ~35 arcmin^2 where we search for dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at z = 0 - 7. We identify eight DSFGs in seven fields at z=4-6 through the detection of H\alpha or [O III] \lambda5008 lines, including fainter lines such as H\beta, [O III] \lambda4960, [N II] \lambda6585, [S II] \lambda\lambda6718,6733 for six sources. With this spectroscopically complete DSFG sample at z=4-6 and negligible impact from cosmic variance (shot noise), we measure the infrared luminosity function (IRLF) down to L_\mathrm{IR} ~ 2\times10^{11} L_\odot. We find flattening of IRLF at z=4-6 towards the faint end (power-law slope \alpha = 0.59_{-0.45}^{+0.39}). We determine the dust-obscured cosmic SFRD at this epoch as \log[\rho_\mathrm{SFR,IR} / (\mathrm{M}_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3})] = -1.52_{-0.13}^{+0.14}. This is significantly higher than previous determination using ALMA data in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, which is void of DSFGs at z=4-6 because of strong cosmic variance (shot noise). We conclude that the majority (66\pm7%) of cosmic star formation at z ~ 5 is still obscured by dust. We also discuss the uncertainty of SFRD propagated from far-IR spectral energy distribution and IRLF at the bright end, which will need to be resolved with future ALMA and JWST observations.

### 35) [2412.06763](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06763v1): New Ionization Models and the Shocking Nitrogen Excess at z &gt; 5

<p> Sophia R. Flury, Karla Z. Arellano-Córdova, Edward C. Moran, Alaina Einsig </p>
<p>
The new era of galaxy evolution studies hearkened in by JWST has led to the discovery of z &gt; 5 galaxies exhibiting excess nitrogen with log(N/O)~1 dex or more than expected from log(N/O) vs 12+log(O/H) trends in the local Universe. A variety of novel enrichment pathways have been presented to explain the apparent nitrogen excess, invoking a wide range of processes from very massive stars to stripped binaries to fine-tuned star-formation histories. However, understanding the excitation mechanism responsible for the observed nebular emission is necessary to accurately infer chemical abundances. As of yet, the ionization sources of these galaxies have not been thoroughly explored, with radiative shocks left out of the picture. We present a suite of homogeneous excitation models for star-forming galaxies, active galactic nuclei, and radiative shocks, with which we explore possible explanations for the apparent nitrogen excess. We propose new BPT-style diagnostics to classify galaxies at z &gt; 5, finding that, when combined with O iii] 1660,66 and He ii 1640, N iii] 1747-54 / C iii] 1907,09 best selects shock-dominated galaxies while N iv] 1483,86 / C iii] 1907,09 best distinguishes between active black holes and star forming galaxies. From our diagnostics, we find that slow/intermediate radiative shocks (v = 75-150 km/s) are most consistent with observed UV emission line flux ratios in nitrogen-bright galaxies. Accounting for the effects of shocks can bring nitrogen estimates into better agreement with abundance patterns observed in the local Universe and may be attributable to Wolf Rayet populations actively enriching these galaxies with nitrogen and possibly driving winds responsible for these shocks.

<p>
We present measurements of the gas-phase Oxygen and Nitrogen abundances obtained by applying the direct method to JWST NIRspec R~1000 spectroscopy for 6 galaxies at redshift greater than 3. Our measurements are based on rest-frame optical Nitrogen [N II]_{\lambda\lambda6548,6583} lines and are complemented by 6 additional objects from the literature at 3\leq z \leq 6. We find that 9 out of 12 objects have values of log(N/O) that are compatible with those found for low-redshift, metal-poor, dwarf galaxies and for HII regions of more luminous local galaxies. However, 3 out of 12 objects have log(N/O) values that are overabundant compared to what is expected on the basis of their Oxygen abundance. We explore a few standard scenarios to explain the observations and conclude that, within the limited statistics available to us, none of them can be definitely excluded even though we prefer dilution by pristine gas infall in between star formation bursts as this is predicted by simulations to take place as a natural part of bursty star formation.

### 37) [2412.06495](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06495v2): Feedback from intermediate mass black holes on dwarf galaxy morphology at z=2

<p> Da Bi, Dominik R. G. Schleicher, Andres Escala </p>
<p>
This study investigates the influence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) on galactic morphology, focusing on their evolution within dwarf galaxies at high redshift (z~2). Using high-resolution zoom-in cosmological simulations, we explore how IMBH properties, including seed masses, formation times, and feedback mechanisms, shape the morphology and properties of central dwarf galaxies. The simulations analyze galaxies in both high- and low-spin dark matter halos, under varying conditions of AGN feedback and black hole seeding methods, to assess their effects on gas fractions, star formation, and structural characteristics. Results indicate that AGN feedback, particularly wind strength, significantly impacts galactic properties. Strong feedback results in lower stellar masses, flatter morphologies, and intermediate rotational support, along with prominent central structures and low Sersic indices (n &lt; 2). These findings challenge the applicability of low-redshift diagnostics like Gini-M20 at high redshift. Synthetic JWST observations reveal that pixelation effects may overestimate galaxy sizes, highlighting the complexity of linking IMBH evolution with dwarf galaxy formation and morphology. This study provides new insights into the typical environments of IMBHs in dwarf galaxies and their role in shaping early galactic structures.

### 38) [2412.06155](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06155v1): Why do some Ultra Diffuse Galaxies have Rich Globular Cluster Systems?

<p> Duncan A. Forbes, Maria Luisa Buzzo, Anna Ferre-Mateu, Aaron J. Romanowsky, Jonah Gannon, Jean P. Brodie, Michelle Collins </p>
<p>
Some ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs) reveal many more globular clusters (GCs) than classical dwarf galaxies of the same stellar mass. These UDGs, with a mass in their GC system (M_{GC}) approaching 10&percnt; of their host galaxy stellar mass (M_{\ast}), are also inferred to have high halo mass to stellar mass ratios (M_{halo}/M_{\ast}). They have been dubbed Failed Galaxies. It is unknown what role high GC formation efficiencies and/or low destruction rates play in determining the high M_{GC}/M_{\ast} ratios of some UDGs. Here we present a simple model, which is informed by recent JWST observations of lensed galaxies and by a simulation in the literature of GC mass loss and tidal disruption in dwarf galaxies. With this simple model, we aim to constrain the effects of GC efficiency/destruction on the observed GC richness of UDGs and their variation with the integrated stellar populations of UDGs. We assume no ongoing star formation (i.e. quenching at early times) and that the disrupted GCs contribute their stars to those of the host galaxy. We find that UDGs, with high M_{GC}/M_{\ast} ratios today, are most likely the result of very high GC formation efficiencies combined with modest rates of GC destruction. The current data loosely follow the model that ranges from the mean stellar population of classical dwarfs to that of metal-poor GCs as M_{GC}/M_{\ast} increases. As more data becomes available for UDGs, our simple model can be refined and tested further.

### 39) [2412.06100](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06100v1): Exploring Barred Galaxies in the Young Universe at z~2 Using \textit{JWST} CEERS Data

<p> Keith Pritchett Jr., Shardha Jogee, Yuchen Guo </p>
<p>
Studying barred galaxies at early epochs can shed light on the early evolution of stellar bars, their impact on secular evolution and the star formation activity of young galaxies, and the origins of present-day barred galaxies like the Milky Way. We analyze data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey to explore the impact of rest-frame wavelength and spatial resolution on detecting and characterizing some of the youngest barred galaxies known to date. We apply both visual classification and ellipse-fitting to JWST F115W, F200W, and F444W images of the barred galaxy CEERS-30155 at z~2.136, an epoch when the universe was only ~22&percnt; of its current age. We find that the stellar bar in CEERS-30155 is not visible in the F115W image, which traces rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) light at z~2, a rest-frame wavelength highly obscured by dust. The stellar bar is visible in the F200W image, but is most prominent in the F444W image, likely due to the F444W image tracing rest-frame near-infrared (NIR) light at z~2. Rest-frame NIR light is not obscured by dust and traces low-mass, long-lived stars that dominate the stellar mass in galaxies. However, ellipse fits of the F444W image only robustly detect stellar bars whose semimajor axis are at least one PSF (~ 0.16" or ~ 1.4 kpc at z~2). At z~2, stellar bars smaller than 1.5 kpc will be more robustly detected in the sharper F200W image (PSF ~ 0.08" or ~0.7 kpc at z~2), provided that the rest-frame optical light it traces is not overly impacted by dust and can still unveil the bar structure. Using a combination of both JWST F200W and F444W images can improve the detection of barred galaxies at z~2 to 4. At even higher redshifts (z &gt; 4), the Giant Magellan Telescope will be a cornerstone facility to explore young barred galaxies.

### 40) [2412.05946](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05946v1): Evaluating the Predictive Capacity of FLARES Simulations for High Redshift "Little Red Dots"

<p> Louis M. T. Arts </p>
<p>
The recent discovery of little red dots - a population of extremely compact and highly dust-reddened high redshift galaxies - by the James Webb Space Telescope presents a new challenge to the fields of astrophysics and cosmology. Their remarkably high luminosities at redshifts 5 &lt; z &lt; 10, appear to challenge LambdaCDM cosmology and galaxy formation models, as they imply stellar masses and star formation rates that exceed the upper limits set by these models. LRDs are currently subjects of debate as the mechanisms behind their high luminosities are not yet fully understood. LRD energy outputs are thought to be either dominated by star formation or their energy output results from the hosting of active galactic nuclei. We investigate the starburst hypothesis by attempting to replicate the stellar properties of LRDs using output data from the FLARES simulation suite. Comparative analysis of galactic properties such as galactic number density, stellar mass and star formation rate yield significant tension between simulated and observed galaxies. The FLARES simulation overestimates the number densities of galaxies with stellar masses similar to observed LRDs by several orders of magnitude. Additionally, the simulation shows an overestimation of star formation rates. These tensions suggest a potential underestimation by the FLARES model of stellar feedback mechanisms such as active galactic nuclei feedback. These results suggest that the starburst hypothesis may be insufficient to explain the observed properties of these galaxies. Instead, the AGN scenario should be further investigated by repeating the methods in this study with a hydrodynamic galaxy simulation suite that models a higher influence of AGN feedback mechanisms on stellar activity in high redshift galaxies.

<p>
We present new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) observations of the nearby ultra-luminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) F08572+3915 NW. These integral field spectroscopic (IFS) data reveal a kpc-scale warm-molecular rotating disk and biconical outflow traced by the H_2 \nu = 0-0 S(1), S(2), S(3), and S(5) rotational transitions. The outflow maintains a relatively constant median (maximum) projected velocity of 1100 km s^{-1} (3000 km s^{-1}) out to ~ 1.4 kpc from the nucleus. The outflowing H_2 material is slightly warmer (640 - 700 K) than the rotating disk material (460 - 520 K), perhaps due to shock heating in the highly turbulent outflowing material. This outflow shares the same kinematics and orientation as the sub-kpc scale warm-H_2 outflow traced by the ro-vibrational H_2 lines in Keck AO near-infrared IFS data. However, this warm-H_2 outflow is significantly faster than the sub-kpc scale cold-molecular outflow derived from multi-transition far-infrared OH observations with Herschel and the \gtrsim kpc-scale cold-molecular outflow mapped by mm-wave interferometric CO 1-0 observations with IRAM-PdBI and NOEMA. The new JWST data bolster the scenario where the buried quasar in this ULIRG is excavating the dust screen, accelerating perhaps as much as 60&percnt; of the dusty warm-molecular material to velocities beyond the escape velocity, and thus influencing the evolution of the host galaxy.

### 42) [2412.05668](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05668v2): Kinematic evidence of magnetospheric accretion for Herbig Ae stars with JWST NIRSpec

<p> Ciarán Rogers, Bernhard Brandl, Guido de Marchi </p>
<p>
Hydrogen emission lines are routinely used to estimate the mass accretion rate of pre-main-sequence stars. Despite the clear correlation between the accretion luminosity of a star and hydrogen line luminosities, the physical origin of these lines is still unclear, with magnetospheric accretion and magneto-centrifugal winds as the two most often invoked mechanisms. Using a combination of HST photometry and new JWST NIRSpec spectra, we have analysed the SED and emission line spectra of five sources in order to determine their underlying photospheric properties, and to attempt to reveal the physical origin of their hydrogen emission lines. These sources reside in NGC 3603, a Galactic massive star forming region. We have fitted the SED of the five sources employing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo exploration to estimate T_{eff}, R_{*}, M_{*} and A(V) for each source. We have performed a kinematic analysis across three spectral series of hydrogen lines, Paschen, Brackett, and Pfund, totalling \ge 15 lines. The FWHM and optical depth of the spectrally resolved lines have been studied in order to constrain the emission origin. The five sources all have SEDs consistent with young intermediate-mass stars. We have classified three of these sources as Herbig Ae type stars based on their effective temperature. Their hydrogen lines show broad profiles with FWHMs \ge 200 km s^{-1}. Hydrogen lines with high upper energy levels n_{up} tend to be significantly broader than lines with lower n_{up}. The optical depth of the emission lines is also highest for the high velocity component of each line, becoming optically thin in the low velocity component. This is consistent with emission from a magnetospheric accretion flow, and cannot be explained as originating in a magneto-centrifugal wind, or other line emission mechanisms thought to be present in protoplanetary disks.

<p> Ciarán Rogers, Guido de Marchi, Bernhard Brandl </p>
<p>
NGC 3603 is the optically brightest massive star forming region (SFR) in the Milky Way, representing a small scale starburst region. Studying young stars in regions like this allows us to assess how star and planet formation proceeds in a dense clustered environment with high levels of UV radiation. JWST provides the sensitivity, unbroken wavelength coverage, and spatial resolution required to study individual pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars in distant massive SFRs in detail for the first time. Using the Micro-Shutter Assembly (MSA) onboard the Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec), multi-object spectroscopy was performed, yielding 100 stellar spectra. We fit the PMS spectra to derive their photospheric properties, extinction, and NIR veiling. From this, we determined the masses and ages of our sources by placing them on the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram (HRD). Their accretion rates were determined by converting the luminosity of hydrogen emission lines to an accretion luminosity. We have classified 42 as actively accreting. Our sources span a range of masses from 0.5 to 7 M_{\odot}. Twelve of these accreting sources have ages consistent with \ge 10 Myrs, with four having ages of \ge 15 Myrs. Their mass accretion rates span 5 orders of magnitude and are systematically higher for a given stellar mass than for a comparative sample taken from low-mass SFRs. We report an environmental relationship between \dot{M}_{acc} and the density of ambient molecular gas as traced by nebular H_2 emission.

<p>
We present a JWST MIRI/MRS spectrum of the inner disk of WISE J044634.16-262756.1B (hereafter J0446B), an old (~34 Myr) M4.5 star but with hints of ongoing accretion. The spectrum is molecule-rich and dominated by hydrocarbons. We detect 14 molecular species (H_2, CH_3, CH_4, C_2H_2, ^{13}CCH_2, C_2H_4, C_2H_6, C_3H_4, C_4H_2, C_6H_6, HCN, HC_3N, CO_2 and ^{13}CO_2) and 2 atomic lines ([Ne II] and [Ar II]), all observed for the first time in a disk at this age. The detection of spatially unresolved H_2 and Ne gas strongly supports that J0446B hosts a long-lived primordial disk, rather than a debris disk. The marginal H_2O detection and the high C_2H_2/CO_2 column density ratio indicate that the inner disk of J0446B has a very carbon-rich chemistry, with a gas-phase C/O ratio \gtrsim2, consistent with what have been found in most primordial disks around similarly low-mass stars. In the absence of significant outer disk dust substructures, inner disks are expected to first become water-rich due to the rapid inward drift of icy pebbles, and evolve into carbon-rich as outer disk gas flows inward on longer timescales. The faint millimeter emission in such low-mass star disks implies that they may have depleted their outer icy pebble reservoir early and already passed the water-rich phase. Models with pebble drift and volatile transport suggest that maintaining a carbon-rich chemistry for tens of Myr likely requires a slowly evolving disk with \alpha-viscosity \lesssim10^{-4}. This study represents the first detailed characterization of disk gas at ~30 Myr, strongly motivating further studies into the final stages of disk evolution.

<p> F. Rizzuti, F. Matteucci, P. Molaro, G. Cescutti, R. Maiolino </p>
<p>
Recent observations by JWST have revealed supersolar ^{14}N abundances in galaxies at very high redshift. On the other hand, these galaxies show subsolar metallicity. The observed N/O ratios are difficult to reproduce in the framework of chemical evolution models for the Milky Way. Our aim is to reproduce these high N/O ratios with chemical evolution models assuming different histories of star formation triggering galactic winds coupled with detailed nucleosynthesis prescriptions for ^{14}N, ^{12}C, ^{16}O and ^{56}Fe. We compute several models for small galaxies (10^{9}\text{ - }10^{10}\text{ M}_{\odot}) with high star formation efficiency and strong galactic winds. These winds are assumed to be differential, carrying out mainly the products of the explosion of core-collapse supernovae. We find that only models with high star formation rates, normal initial mass function, and differential galactic winds can reproduce the observed chemical abundances. We also find that with the same assumptions about star formation and galactic winds, but with a very rapid formation resulting from fast gas infall, we can also reproduce the estimated ages of these objects. We find no necessity to invoke peculiar nucleosynthesis from Population III stars, very massive stars and supermassive stars.

### 46) [2412.05242](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05242v1): Lack of Rest-frame UV Variability in Little Red Dots Based on HST and JWST Observations

<p> Wei Leong Tee, Xiaohui Fan, Feige Wang, Jinyi Yang </p>
<p>
Variability is a fundamental signature for active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity, and serve as an unbiased indicator for rapid instability happened near the center supermassive black hole (BH). Previous studies showed that AGN variability does not have strong redshift evolution, and scales with their bolometric luminosity and BH mass, making it a powerful probe to identify low-mass, low-luminosity AGNs at high redshift. JWST has discovered a new population of high-redshift galaxies likely hosting moderate accreting BHs (10^6\,M_\odot) -- the little red dots (LRDs, z=4-10). In this paper, we study the variability of a sample of 21 LRDs with V-shaped SEDs in three JWST deep fields that also have reliable HST observations in closely paired filters at 1-2 um (rest-frame UV), with the time difference between 6 and 11 years. This LRD sample covers a redshift range of 3&lt;z&lt;8 with median -21.3&lt;M_\mathrm{UV}&lt;-18.4. Based on both photometry and imaging difference analyses, we find a mean magnitude difference of 0.12\pm0.24 mag, with none of the LRDs showing photometric variability at 3\sigma significance. Extrapolation of SDSS quasar variability predicts a magnitude change of order 0.3 mag for our LRD sample. This suggests an upper limit of about 30&percnt; AGN contribution to the total observed UV light in our sample of LRDs.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently discovered a new population of objects at high redshift referred to as `Little Red Dots' (LRDs). Their nature currently remains elusive, despite their surprisingly high inferred number densities. This emerging population of red point-like sources is reshaping our view of the early Universe and may shed light on the formation of high-redshift supermassive black holes. Here we present a spectroscopically confirmed LRD CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 at z_{\rm spec}=8.6319\pm 0.0005 hosting an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), using JWST data. This source shows the typical spectral shape of an LRD (blue UV and red optical continuum, unresolved in JWST imaging), along with broad H\beta line emission, detection of high-ionization emission lines (CIV, NIV]) and very high electron temperature indicative of the presence of AGN. This is also combined with a very low metallicity (Z&lt;0.1 Z_\odot). The presence of all these diverse features in one source makes CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 unique. We show that the inferred black hole mass of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 (M_{\rm BH}=1.0^{+0.6}_{-0.4}\times 10^{8}\rm ~M_\odot) strongly challenges current standard theoretical models and simulations of black hole formation, and forces us to adopt `ad hoc' prescriptions. Indeed if massive seeds, or light seeds with super-Eddington accretion, are considered, the observed BH mass of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 at z=8.6 can be reproduced. Moreover, the black hole is over-massive compared to its host, relative to the local M_{\rm BH}-M_* relations, pointing towards an earlier and faster evolution of the black hole compared to its host galaxy.

### 48) [2412.04834](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04834v1): A grand-design spiral galaxy 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang with JWST

<p> Rashi Jain, Yogesh Wadadekar </p>
<p>
We report the discovery of a large (~ 10 kpc diameter), massive (\log(M_\star/M_\odot) = 10.15^{+0.01}_{-0.01}), grand-design spiral galaxy with photometric redshift z_{\text{phot}} = 4.03 in the UNCOVER and Medium Band Mega Science surveys with JWST. This is the highest redshift spiral galaxy discovered with JWST so far. In the rest-frame near-UV and far-UV, we clearly see the beads-on-a-string pattern of star formation; in the rest-frame visible bands, each string appears as an arm. Spectral energy distribution modeling using the Bagpipes code is strongly constrained by detections and flux measurements in 21 JWST and HST filters. The stellar mass-weighted age is 228 Myr, implying that 50% of the stars in the galaxy formed after z ~ 4.5. This is a highly star-forming galaxy with a star formation rate (SFR) of 57.57^{+1.80}_{-1.90} \, M_\odot\, \text{yr}^{-1}. We detect strong H-\alpha + [NII] emission from the entire disk. The detection of a spiral galaxy at z ~ 4 indicates that massive and large spiral galaxies and disks were already in place merely 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang.

### 49) [2412.04548](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04548v1): Fading Light, Fierce Winds: JWST Snapshot of a Sub-Eddington Quasar at Cosmic Dawn

<p> Jianwei Lyu, George H. Rieke, Meredith Stone, Jane Morrison, Stacey Alberts, Xiangyu Jin, Yongda Zhu, Weizhe Liu, Jinyi Yang </p>
<p>
The majority of most luminous quasars during the epoch of reionization accrete near or above the Eddington limit, marking the vigorous growth of primitive supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, their subsequent evolution and environmental impact remain poorly characterized. We present JWST/NIRSpec prism IFU observations of HSC J2239+0207, a low-luminosity quasar at z~6.25 likely in a late stage of mass assembly with an overmassive SMBH relative to its host galaxy. Using H\beta and H\alpha broad emission lines, we estimate an SMBH mass M_{\rm BH}~3\times10^8~M_{\odot} and confirm its sub-Eddington accretion at \lambda_{\rm Edd}~0.4. Strong FeII emission and a proximity zone of typical size suggest a metal-rich, highly evolved system. In the far-UV, this quasar presents strong broad-absorption-line features, indicative of high-velocity winds (\nu~10^4~{\rm km/s}). Meanwhile, minimal dust reddening is inferred from the quasar continuum and broad-line Balmer decrement, suggesting little dust along the polar direction. Most interestingly, we identify a gas companion ~5 kpc from the quasar with a high [OIII]/H\beta ratio (\gtrsim10), likely representing outflowing gas blown away by AGN feedback. These results highlight HSC J2239+0207 as a likely fading quasar in transition, providing rare insights into SMBH evolution, AGN feedback, and AGN-galaxy interactions in the early Universe.

### 50) [2412.04542](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04542v1): Efficient Ionizers with Low H\boldsymbolβ+[OIII] Equivalent Widths: JADES Spectroscopy of a Peculiar High-z Population

Cameron, Stefano Carniani, Mirko Curti, Zhiyuan Ji, Pierluigi Rinaldi, Aayush Saxena, Sandro Tacchella, Chris Willott, Joris Witstok, Yongda Zhu </p>
<p>
Early JWST photometric studies discovered a population of UV faint (\rm &lt;L^{*}_{UV}) z ~ 6.5-8 Lyman break galaxies with spectral energy distributions implying young ages (~10 Myr) yet relatively weak H\beta+[OIII] equivalent widths (\rm EW_{H\beta+[OIII]} \approx 400\r{A}). These galaxies seemingly contradict the implicit understanding that young star-forming galaxies are ubiquitously strong H\beta+[OIII] emitters, i.e., extreme emission line galaxies (EW \rm \gtrsim 750\r{A}). Low metallicities, high Lyman continuum escape fractions, and rapidly declining star-formation histories have been proposed as primary drivers behind low H\beta+[OIII] equivalent widths, but the blend of H\beta+[OIII] in photometric studies makes proving one of these scenarios difficult. We aim to characterize this peculiar population with deep spectroscopy from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). We find that a significant subset of these galaxies at z\gtrsim2 with modest H\beta+[OIII] equivalent widths (\rm \approx 300-600\r{A}) have high ionization efficiencies (\rm \log \xi_{ion} \gtrsim 25.5~[Hz~erg^{-1}]). Suppressed [OIII] EW values yet elevated H\alpha and H\beta EW values imply that the level of chemical enrichment is the primary culprit, supported by spectroscopic measurements of metallicities below 12+log(O/H)\rm \approx 7.70~(10&percnt;Z_{\odot}). We demonstrate that integrated H\beta+[OIII] selections (e.g., H\beta+[OIII] EW &gt; 700\r{A}) exclude the most metal-poor efficient ionizers and favor 1) more chemically enriched systems with comparable extreme radiation fields and 2) older starbursting systems. In contrast, metallicity degeneracies are reduced in H\alpha space, enabling the identification of these metal-poor efficient ionizers by their specific star-formation rate.

### 51) [2412.04348](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04348v1): Influence of mergers on LyC escape of high redshift galaxies

<p> Ivan Kostyuk, Benedetta Ciardi </p>
<p>
Aims: We investigate the impact of galaxy mergers on the Lyman Continuum (LyC) radiation escape, fesc, from high-redshift galaxies. Methods: We post-process ~ 6e5 galaxies (redshift 5.2 &lt; z &lt; 10) extracted from the TNG50 cosmological simulation using a physically motivated analytic model for LyC escape. Results: Galaxies that have not experienced a merger for the last ~ 700 Myr have an average fesc ~ 3%, which increases to up to 14% immediately following a merger. The strongest effect can be observed in galaxies with stellar masses of ~ 1e7 Msun. We attribute the increase in the escape fraction to two main factors: (i) accretion of metal-poor gas onto the central region of a galaxy, which feeds star formation and LyC emission; and (ii) displacement of neutral gas relative to star-forming regions, which reduces the optical depth to LyC photons. We additionally examine how proximity to other galaxies influences LyC escape, finding that galaxies with more neighbors tend to have more frequent mergers, and thus a higher LyC leakage. However, galaxies in overdense regions tend to have a larger LyC escape fraction independently from mergers, because of their higher gas inflow, and consequent increase in the star formation rate. The increase in both mergers and gas inflow could contribute to low-mass galaxies ionizing proximity zones of high-z Ly-alpha leakers recently observed with JWST.

<p>
We explore the radio emission of spectroscopically confirmed, X-ray weak, Broad Line AGN (BLAGN, or type 1) selected with JWST in the GOODS-N field, one of the fields with the best combination of deep radio observations and statistics of JWST-selected BLAGN. We use deep radio data at different frequencies (144\,MHz, 1.5\,GHz, 3\,GHz, 5.5\,GHz, 10\,GHz), and we find that none of the 22 sources investigated is detected at any of the aforementioned frequencies. Similarly, the radio stacking analysis does not reveal any detection down to an rms of ~ 0.2&mu;Jy beam^{-1}, corresponding to a 3\sigma upper limit at rest frame 5 GHz of L_{5GHz}=2\times10^{39} erg s^{-1} at the mean redshift of the sample z~ 5.2. We compared this and individual sources upper limits with expected radio luminosities estimated assuming different AGN scaling relations. For most of the sources the radio luminosity upper limits are still compatible with expectations for radio-quiet (RQ) AGN; nevertheless, the more stringent stacking upper limits and the fact that no detection is found would suggest that JWST-selected BLAGN are weaker than standard AGN even at radio frequencies. We discuss some scenarios that could explain the possible radio weakness, such as free-free absorption from a dense medium, or the lack of either magnetic field or a corona, possibly as a consequence of super-Eddington accretion. These scenarios would also explain the observed X-ray weakness. We also conclude that ~1 dex more sensitive radio observations are needed to better constrain the level of radio emission (or lack thereof) for the bulk of these sources. The Square Kilometer Array Observatory (SKAO) will likely play a crucial role in assessing the properties of this AGN population.

<p>
We introduce the Bias-free Extragalactic Analysis for Cosmic Origins with NIRCam (BEACON) survey, a JWST Cycle2 program allocated up to 600 pure-parallel hours of observations. BEACON explores high-latitude areas of the sky with JWST/NIRCam over ~100 independent sightlines, totaling ~0.3deg^2, reaching a median F444W depth of \approx28.2AB mag (5\sigma). Based on existing JWST observations in legacy fields, we estimate that BEACON will photometrically identify 25--150 galaxies at z&gt;10 and 500--1000 at z~7--10 uniquely enabled by an efficient multiple filter configuration spanning 0.9--5.0&mu;m. The expected sample size of z&gt;10 galaxies will allow us to obtain robust number density estimates and to discriminate between different models of early star formation. In this paper, we present an overview of the survey design and initial results using the first 19 fields. We present 129 galaxy candidates at z&gt;7 identified in those fields, including 11 galaxies at z&gt;10 and several UV-luminous (M_{\rm UV}&lt;-21mag) galaxies at z~8. The number densities of z&lt;13 galaxies inferred from the initial fields are overall consistent with those in the literature. Despite reaching a considerably large volume (~10^5Mpc^3), however, we find no galaxy candidates at z&gt;13, providing us with a complimentary insight into early galaxy evolution with minimal cosmic variance. We publish imaging and catalog data products for these initial fields. Upon survey completion, all BEACON data will be coherently processed and distributed to the community along with catalogs for redshift and other physical quantities.

<p> Philipp S. Joschko, J. M. Diederik Kruijssen, Sebastian Trujillo-Gomez, Joel L. Pfeffer, Nate Bastian, Robert A. Crain, Marta Reina-Campos </p>
<p>
We present a comprehensive analysis of globular cluster (GC) formation and evolution across the 34^3 Mpc^3 volume of the E-MOSAICS galaxy formation simulations. Defining GCs as surviving, high-mass (&gt;10^5 M_\odot) clusters, we analyse their formation histories as a function of their metallicity and host galaxy mass, also distinguishing between central and satellite galaxies. The redshift of peak GC formation rate increases weakly with galaxy mass, decreases with metallicity, and does not differ between centrals and satellites. The epoch of peak GC formation precedes that of the stars by a factor of 1.1{-}1.6, primarily due to `downsizing', i.e. low-mass galaxies form their stars later. Consequently, this offset decreases with galaxy mass, leading to nearly coeval stellar and GC populations in massive galaxies (&gt;10^{11} M_\odot). GCs themselves do not exhibit strong downsizing, because they predominantly formed at early cosmic epochs conducive to the formation (through high gas pressures) and survival (through high galaxy merger and GC migration rates) of massive, compact stellar systems. The total GC formation rate in the volume peaks at z\approx 2.5, shortly before star formation peaks at z\approx 2, but well after the general cluster formation rate at z\approx 4, reflecting a survivor bias where surviving GCs formed more recently. We find that GC formation commenced early, at z&gt;10, such that the results of this work may provide a framework for interpreting direct observations of proto-GC formation with the JWST, especially as these observations accumulate to enable statistical studies.

<p> I. Kolesnikov, V. M. Sampaio, R. R. de Carvalho, C. Conselice </p>
<p>
Morphological classification of galaxies becomes increasingly challenging with redshift. We apply a hybrid supervised-unsupervised method to classify ~ 14,000 galaxies in the CANDELS fields at 0.2 \leq z \leq 2.4 into spheroid, disk, and irregular systems. Unlike previous works, our method is applied to redshift bins of width 0.2. Comparison between models applied to a wide redshift range versus bin-specific models reveals significant differences in galaxy morphology beyond z \geq 1 and a consistent ~ 25&percnt; disagreement. This suggests that using a single model across wide redshift ranges may introduce biases due to the large time intervals involved compared to galaxy evolution timescales. Using the FERENGI code to assess the impact of cosmological effects, we find that flux dimming and smaller angular scales may lead to the misclassification of up to 18&percnt; of disk galaxies as spheroids or irregulars. Contrary to previous studies, we find an almost constant fraction of disks (~ 60&percnt;) and spheroids (~ 30&percnt;) across redshifts. We attribute discrepancies with earlier works, which suggest a decreasing fraction of disks beyond z ~ 1, to the biases introduced by visual classification. Our claim is further strengthened by the striking agreement to the results reported by Lee et al. (2024) using an objective, unsupervised method applied to James Webb Space Telescope data. Exploring mass dependence, we observe a ~ 40&percnt; increase in the fraction of massive (M_{\rm stellar} \geq 10^{10.5}{\rm M}_{\odot}) spheroids with decreasing redshift, well balanced with a decrease of ~ 20&percnt; in the fraction of M_{\rm stellar} \geq 10^{10.5}{\rm M}_{\odot} disks, suggesting that merging massive disk galaxies may form spheroidal systems.

<p> A. J. Battisti, I. Shivaei, H. -J. Park, M. Decleir, D. Calzetti, J. Mathew, E. Wisnioski, Elisabete da Cunha </p>
<p>
The 2175{&#8491;} bump is a prominent absorption feature at ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths in dust extinction and attenuation curves. Understanding the relative strength of this feature is important for accurate dust corrections at both low- and high-redshift. This feature is postulated to arise from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) dust grains; however, the carrier has not been definitively established. We present results on the correlation between the 2175{&#8491;} feature and PAH abundances in a spatially-resolved manner for 15 local galaxies in the PHANGS-JWST survey that have NUV and mid-IR imaging data from Swift/UVOT and JWST/MIRI, respectively. We find a moderate positive correlation between the 2175{&#8491;} feature strength and PAH abundance, albeit with large intrinsic scatter. However, most of this trend can be attributed to a stronger negative correlation of both quantities with SFR surface density and specific-SFR (proxies of ionising radiation). The latter trends are consistent with previous findings that both the 2175{&#8491;} carrier and PAHs are small grains that are easily destroyed by UV photons, although the proxy for PAH abundance could also be influenced by dust heating. When controlling for SFR surface density, we find weaker correlations between the 2175{&#8491;} feature and PAH abundances, disfavouring a direct link. However, analyses based on spectroscopic measurements of the 2175{&#8491;} feature and PAH features are required to verify our findings. No significant trends with gas-phase metallicity are found for the 2175{&#8491;} feature and PAHs, however the metallicity range of our sample is limited. We provide prescriptions for the strength of the 2175{&#8491;} feature and PAHs in local massive (metal-rich) galaxies with SFR surface density and specific-SFR, however the former should be used with caution since bump strengths measured from Swift/UVOT are expected to be underestimated.

### 57) [2412.03653](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03653v1): Weakness of X-rays and Variability in High-redshift AGNs with Super-Eddington Accretion

<p> Kohei Inayoshi, Shigeo Kimura, Hirofumi Noda </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations enable the exploration of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with broad-line emission in the early universe. Despite their clear radiative and morphological signatures of AGNs in rest-frame optical bands, complementary evidence of AGN activity -- such as X-ray emission and UV/optical variability -- remains rarely detected. The weakness of X-rays and variability in these broad-line emitters challenges the conventional AGN paradigm, indicating that the accretion processes or environments around the central black holes (BHs) differ from those of low-redshift counterparts. In this work, we study the radiation spectra of super-Eddington accretion disks enveloped by high-density coronae. Radiation-driven outflows from the disk transport mass to the poles, resulting in moderately optically-thick, warm coronae formed through effective inverse Comptonization. This mechanism leads to softer X-ray spectra and larger bolometric correction factors for X-rays compared to typical AGNs, while being consistent with those of JWST AGNs and low-redshift super-Eddington accreting AGNs. In this scenario, UV/optical variability is suppressed due to photon trapping within super-Eddington disks, while X-ray emissions remain weak yet exhibit significant relative variability. These characteristics are particularly evident in high-redshift AGNs powered by lower-mass BHs with \lesssim 10^{7-8}~M_\odot, which undergo rapid mass accretion following overmassive evolutionary tracks relative to the BH-to-stellar mass correlation in the local universe.

<p> J. W. Moffat </p>
<p>
Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed the presence of bright and well-formed galaxies at high redshifts, challenging the predictions of the standard Lambda-Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) cosmological model. This paper explores the potential of Modified Gravity (MOG), specifically Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG), to account for the rapid formation of these galaxies in the early universe. By enhancing the gravitational constant through a dimensionless parameter \alpha and incorporating a massive vector field \phi_&mu;, MOG predicts deeper gravitational wells that can accelerate the collapse of baryonic matter. We present theoretical insights demonstrating how MOG can facilitate the increase in star formation rate and early formation of galaxies, offering a compelling alternative to LCDM. Our findings suggest that MOG provides a viable framework for understanding the rapid growth of galaxies observed by JWST.

<p> Bingcheng Jin, Luis C. Ho, Wen Sun </p>
<p>
We study the rest-frame ultraviolet-optical color gradients of 669 galaxies at 4&lt;z&lt;8 by characterizing the wavelength dependence of their structural parameters derived from simultaneously fitting the seven-band NIRCam images acquired with the James Webb Space Telescope. Distinct from trends observed at lower redshifts, where most galaxies exhibit negative color gradients whereby galaxy centers are redder than their outskirts, in high-redshift galaxies positive color gradients match or even outnumber negative color gradients. The color gradients principally reflect radial variations in stellar population instead of dust reddening or contamination from active galactic nuclei. The sign and magnitude of the color profile depend systematically on the global properties of the galaxy: positive color gradients, characteristic of centrally concentrated star formation or outside-in growth, preferentially inhabit galaxies of lower stellar mass, smaller size, and bluer spectral energy distribution.

We report integral field spectroscopy observations with the Near-Infrared Spectrograph on board JWST targeting the 60 kpc environment surrounding the most luminous quasar known at z=4.6. We detect ionized gas filaments on 40 kpc scales connecting a network of merging galaxies likely to form a cluster. We find regions of low ionization consistent with large-scale shock excitation surrounding the central dust-obscured quasar, out to distances nearly eight times the effective stellar radius of the quasar host galaxy. In the nuclear region, we find an ionized outflow driven by the quasar with velocities reaching 13,000 km s^{-1}, one of the fastest discovered to date with an outflow rate of 2000 M_\odot yr^{-1} and a kinetic luminosity of 6\times10^{46} erg s^{-1} resulting in coupling efficiency between the bolometric luminosity of the quasar and the outflow of 5%. The kinetic luminosity of the outflow is sufficient to power the turbulent motion of the gas on galactic and circumgalactic scales and is likely the primary driver of the radiative shocks on interstellar medium and circumgalactic medium scales. This provides compelling evidence supporting long-standing theoretical predictions that powerful quasar outflows are a main driver in regulating the heating and accretion rate of gas onto massive central cluster galaxies.

JWST observations have unveiled faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) at high-redshift that provide insights on the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their coevolution with galaxies. However, disentangling stellar from AGN light in these sources is challenging. Here, we use an empirical approach to infer the average stellar mass of 6 faint broad line (BL) Halpha emitters at z = 4 - 5 with BH masses ~ 6 (4 - 15)x10^6 Msun, with a method independent of their spectral energy distribution (SED). We use the deep JWST/NIRcam grism survey ALT to measure the over-densities around BL-Halpha emitters and around a spectroscopic reference sample of ~300 galaxies. In our reference sample, we find that Mpc-scale over-density correlates with stellar mass, while pair counts are flat below ~50 kpc due to satellites. Their large-scale environments suggest that BL-Halpha emitters are hosted by galaxies with stellar masses ~5x10^7 Msun, ~40 times lower than those inferred from galaxy-only SED fits. Adding measurements around more luminous z~6 AGNs, we find tentative correlations between line width, BH mass and the over-density, suggestive of a steep BH to halo mass relation. The main implications are (1) when BH masses are taken at face value, we confirm extremely high BH to stellar mass ratios of ~10 %, (2) the low stellar mass galaxies hosting growing SMBHs are in tension with typical hydrodynamical simulations, except those without feedback, (3) a 1 % duty cycle implied by the host mass hints at super-Eddington accretion, which may imply over-estimated SMBH masses, (4) the masses are at odds with a high stellar density interpretation of the line broadening, (5) our results imply a diversity of galaxy masses, environments and SEDs among AGN samples, depending on their luminosity.

### 62) [2412.02763](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02763v1): Massive black holes or stars first: the key is the residual cosmic electron fraction

<p> Muhammad A. Latif, Sadegh Khochfar </p>
<p>
Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations have unveiled that the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) were in place at z \geq 10, a few hundred Myrs after the Big Bang. These discoveries are providing strong constraints on the seeding of BHs and the nature of the first objects in the Universe. Here, we study the impact of the freeze-out electron fractions (f_e) at the end of the epoch of cosmic recombination on the formation of the first structures in the Universe. At f_e below the current fiducial cosmic values of \rm ~ 10^{-4}, the baryonic collapse is delayed due to the lack of molecular hydrogen cooling until the host halo masses are increased by one to two orders of magnitude compared to the standard case and reach the atomic cooling limit. This results in an enhanced enclosed gas mass by more than an order of magnitude and higher inflow rates of up to 0.1~M_{\odot}/{yr}. Such conditions are conducive to the formation of massive seed BHs with ~ 10^{4} M_{\odot}. Our results reveal a new pathway for the formation of massive BH seeds which may naturally arise from free

<p>
Distant quasars (QSOs) in galaxy overdensities are considered key actors in the evolution of the early Universe. In this work, we studied the kinematic and physical properties of the BR1202-0725 system at z=4.7, one of the most overdense fields known in the early Universe, consisting of a QSO, a submillimeter galaxy (SMG), and three Lyman-\alpha emitters. We used data from the JWST/NIRSpec Integral Field Unit (IFU) to analyze the rest-frame optical emission of each source in the system. We estimated a bolometric luminosity of log(L_{\rm bol}/[erg/s]) = 47.2 \pm 0.4 and a black hole mass of log(M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot) = 10.1 \pm 0.5 for the QSO, which are consistent with previous measurements obtained with ground-based observations. The NIRSpec spectra of the SMG revealed instead unexpected [OIII] and H\alpha+[NII] profiles. The overall [OIII] line profile is blue-shifted by more than 700 km/s relative to the systemic velocity of the galaxy. Additionally, both the [OIII] and H\alpha+[NII] lines show prominent broad (1300 km/s), blueshifted wings associated with outflowing ionized gas. The analysis of NIRSpec and X-ray observations indicates that the SMG likely hosts an accreting supermassive black hole as supported by the following results: (i) the excitation diagnostic diagram is consistent with ionization from an active galactic nucleus (AGN); (ii) the X-ray luminosity is higher than 10^{44} erg/s; and (iii) it hosts a fast outflow (v_{\rm out} = 5000 km/s), comparable to those observed in luminous QSOs. Therefore, the QSO-SMG pair represents one of the highest-redshift double AGN to date, with a projected separation of 24 kpc. Finally, we investigated the environment of this system and found four new galaxies at the same redshift of the QSO and within a projected distance of 5 kpc from it. This overdense system includes at least ten galaxies in only 980 kpc^2.

### 64) [2412.02622](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02622v1): High-z stellar masses can be recovered robustly with JWST photometry

<p> R. K. Cochrane, H. Katz, R. Begley, C. C. Hayward, P. N. Best </p>
<p>
Robust inference of galaxy stellar masses from photometry is crucial for constraints on galaxy assembly across cosmic time. Here, we test a commonly-used Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting code, using simulated galaxies from the SPHINX20 cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulation, with JWST NIRCam photometry forward-modelled with radiative transfer. Fitting the synthetic photometry with various star formation history models, we show that recovered stellar masses are, encouragingly, generally robust to within a factor of ~3 for galaxies in the range M*~10^7-10^9M_sol at z=5-10. These results are in stark contrast to recent work claiming that stellar masses can be underestimated by as much as an order of magnitude in these mass and redshift ranges. However, while &gt;90% of masses are recovered to within 0.5dex, there are notable systematic trends, with stellar masses typically overestimated for low-mass galaxies (M*&lt;~10^8M_sol) and slightly underestimated for high-mass galaxies (M*&gt;~10^9M_sol). We demonstrate that these trends arise due to the SED fitting code poorly modelling the impact of strong emission lines on broadband photometry. These systematic trends, which exist for all star formation history parametrisations tested, have a tilting effect on the inferred stellar mass function, with number densities of massive galaxies underestimated (particularly at the lowest redshifts studied) and number densities of lower-mass galaxies typically overestimated. Overall, this work suggests that we should be optimistic about our ability to infer the masses of high-z galaxies observed with JWST (notwithstanding contamination from AGN) but careful when modelling the impact of strong emission lines on broadband photometry.

<p>
Recent observations reveal a rapid dust build-up in high-redshift galaxies (z &gt; 4), challenging current models of galaxy formation. While our understanding of dust production and destruction in the interstellar medium (ISM) is advancing, probing baryonic processes in the early Universe remains a complex task. We characterize the evolution of 98 z~5 star-forming galaxies observed as part of the ALPINE survey by constraining the physical processes underpinning the gas and dust production, consumption, and destruction in their ISM. We make use of chemical evolution models to simultaneously reproduce the observed dust and gas content. For each galaxy, we estimate initial gas mass, inflows and outflows, and efficiencies of dust growth and destruction. We test the models with the canonical Chabrier and top-heavy initial mass functions (IMFs), with the latter enabling rapid dust production on shorter timescales. Our models successfully reproduce gas and dust content in older galaxies (&gt; 600 Myr) regardless of the IMF, with Type II SNe as the primary dust source and no dust growth in ISM with moderate inflow of primordial gas. In case of intermediate-age galaxies (300 - 600 Myr), we reproduce the gas and dust content through Type II SNe and dust growth in ISM, though we observe an over-prediction of dust mass in older galaxies, potentially indicating an unaccounted dust destruction mechanism and/or an overestimation of the observed dust masses. The number of young galaxies (&lt; 300 Myr) reproduced, increases for models assuming top-heavy IMF but with maximal prescriptions of dust production. Galactic outflows are necessary to reproduce observed gas and dust masses. The Chabrier IMF models reproduce 65% of galaxies, while top-heavy IMF models improve this to 93%, easing tensions with observations. Upcoming JWST data will refine these models by resolving degeneracies in intrinsic galaxy properties.

### 66) [2412.02002](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02002v1): Signatures of Rapidly Rotating Stars with Chemically Homogeneous Evolution in the First Galaxies

<p> Boyuan Liu, Yves Sibony, Georges Meynet, Volker Bromm </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed an unexpectedly high abundance of UV luminous galaxies at redshifts z\gtrsim 10, challenging `standard' galaxy formation models. This study investigates the role of rapidly rotating (massive) stars undergoing chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) in reconciling this potential tension. These stars are more compact, hotter, and exhibit enhanced UV emission. We find that the rest-frame UV luminosity of star-forming galaxies can be significantly enhanced by a factor of ~ 3-6 when CHE stars above a minimum initial mass of m_{\star,\min}^{\rm CHE}~ 2-10\ \rm M_\odot account for more than half of the total stellar mass following a Salpeter initial mass function. As a result, the UV luminosity functions observed at z~ 12-16 can be reproduced with less extreme values of star formation efficiency and UV luminosity stochastic variability. Our results highlight the potential of CHE in explaining the UV-bright galaxy populations detected by JWST and call for future work to explore the broader astrophysical implications of CHE and its associated phenomena in the early universe, such as gamma-ray bursts, compact object binaries, and metal enrichment.

<p> Shikhar Asthana, Girish Kulkarni, Martin G. Haehnelt, James S. Bolton, Laura C. Keating, Charlotte Simmonds </p>
<p>
Recent JWST observations have allowed for the first time to obtain comprehensive measurements of the ionizing photon production efficiency \xi_\text{ion} for a wide range of reionization-epoch galaxies. We explore implications for the inferred UV luminosity functions and escape fractions of ionizing sources in our suite of simulations. These are run with the GPU-based radiative transfer code ATON-HE and are calibrated to the XQR-30 Lyman-alpha forest data at 5&lt;z&lt;6.2. For our fiducial source model, the inferred ionizing escape fractions increase from (6.1, 5.4, 4.9)% at z=6 to (14.4, 23.8, 29.4)% at z=10 for our (Fiducial, Early, Extremely Early) models in good agreement with extrapolations of lower redshift escape fraction measurements. Extrapolating observed luminosity functions beyond the resolution limit of the simulations to faint sources with M_\text{UV}=-11 increases the inferred escape fractions by a factor ~ 1.5 at z=10. For our oligarchic source model, where no ionizing photons are emitted in faint sources, the inferred escape fractions increase from 10% at z=6 to uncomfortably large values &gt;50% at z&gt; 10, disfavouring the oligarchic source model at very high redshift. The inferred effective clumping factors in our simulations are in the range of 3-6, suggesting consistency between the observed ionizing properties of reionization-epoch galaxies and the ionizing photon budget in our simulations.

<p> Thorbjørn Clausen, Charles L. Steinhardt, Arden Shao, Gaurav Senthil Kumar </p>
<p>
JWST has allowed the discovery of a significant population of galaxies at z &gt; 10. Our understanding of the astrophysical properties of these ultra-high redshift galaxies relies on fitting templates, developed using astrophysical models representing our current understanding of high-redshift galaxies. In this work, the highest confidence recent JWST spectroscopic observations are used to evaluate the performance of several high-redshift templates based on two tests: (1) comparing photometric redshifts against spectroscopic redshifts; and (2) comparing the reconstructed spectral energy distributions against observed SEDs. Strict sample selection and error-propagation by bootstrapping is employed to make results robust towards future JWST systematics mitigation. It is shown that some templates perform adequately at high redshift prediction, given a sample selection by observational filters and depth. Other templates work better for SED fitting, but a few objects remain unrepresented in their spectra. We conclude that although templates are usable, models are not yet able to reliably extract astrophysical properties.

<p>
JWST has revealed a population of compact `Little Red Dots' (LRDs) at z\gtrsim4, with red rest-frame optical and blue UV colors. These objects are likely compact dusty starbursts or heavily reddened AGNs, playing a pivotal role in early black hole growth, dust production, and stellar assembly. We introduce a new photometric selection to identify LRDs over a broad range in redshifts and rest-frame UV-to-NIR colors enabling a more complete census of the population. This method identifies 248 LRDs with F444W&lt;27 mag over 263 arcmin^2 in the JADES, PRIMER-COSMOS, and UDS fields with MIRI coverage, increasing the number density by \times1.7 compared to previous samples, suggesting that previous census were underestimated. Most LRDs are detected in MIRI/F770W but only 7% (17) are detected in F1800W. We use MIRI-based rest-frame [1-3 &mu;m] colors to trace dust emission. F1800W-detected LRDs have a median [1-3 &mu;m]=1.5 mag, with a broad scatter indicative of diverse dust emission properties. About 20% exhibit [1-3 &mu;m]&lt;1 mag colors consistent with negligible dust emission, but the majority show significant dust emission at 3 &mu;m (f^{\rm dust}_{3&mu; m}\lesssim0.8) from the galaxy ISM or a hot-dust-deficient AGN torus. A correlation between bluer UV-to-NIR colors and stronger IR emission suggests that the bluest LRDs may resemble unobscured QSOs. We report a LRD at z_{\rm spec}=3.1386, detected in MIRI, Spitzer/MIPS, and Herschel/PACS. Its IR SED rises steeply at \lambda_{\rm rest}&gt;6~&mu;m and peaks near ~40~&mu;m, providing the first direct evidence of warm dust emission (T=50-100 K) in a LRD.

<p> Jonathan C. Tan, Jasbir Singh, Vieri Cammelli, Mahsa Sanati, Maya Petkova, Devesh Nandal, Pierluigi Monaco </p>
<p>
The origin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is a key open question for contemporary astrophysics and cosmology. Here we review the features of a cosmological model of SMBH formation from Pop III.1 seeds, i.e., remnants of metal-free stars forming in locally-isolated minihalos, where energy injection from dark matter particle annihilation alters the structure of the protostar allowing growth to supermassive scales (Banik et al. 2019; Singh et al. 2023; Cammelli et al. 2024). The Pop III.1 model explains the paucity of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) via a characteristic SMBH seed mass of ~10^5\:M_\odot that is set by the baryonic content of minihalos. Ionization feedback from supermassive Pop III.1 stars sets the cosmic number density of SMBHs to be n_{\rm SMBH}\lesssim 0.2\:{\rm Mpc}^{-3}. The model then predicts that all SMBHs form by z~20 with a spatial distribution that is initially unclustered. SMBHs at high redshifts z\gtrsim7 should all be single objects, with SMBH binaries and higher order multiples emerging only at lower redshifts. We also discuss the implications of this model for SMBH host galaxy properties, occupation fractions, gravitational wave emission, cosmic reionization, and the nature of dark matter. These predictions are compared to latest observational results, especially from HST, JWST and pulsar timing array observations.

<p> Alexandros Maragkoudakis, Christiaan Boersma, Pasquale Temi, Jesse D. Bregman, Louis J. Allamandola, Vincent Esposito, Alessandra Ricca, Els Peeters </p>
<p>
We have conducted a sensitivity analysis on the mid-infrared spectral decomposition of galaxies and the modeling of the PAH emission spectrum with the NASA Ames PAH Infrared Spectroscopic Database (PAHdb) to assess the variance on the average galaxy PAH population properties under a grid of different modeling parameters. We find that the SL and SL+LL Spitzer-IRS decomposition with PAHFIT provides consistent modeling and recovery of the 5-15 &mu;m PAH emission spectrum. For PAHdb modeling, application of a redshift to the calculated spectra to account for anharmonic effects introduces a 15&percnt;-20&percnt; variance on the derived parameters, while its absence improves the fits by ~13&percnt;. The 4.00-\alpha release of PAHdb achieves the complete modeling of the 6-15 &mu;m PAH spectrum, including the full 6.2 &mu;m band, improving the average fitting uncertainty by a factor of 2. The optimal PAHdb modeling configuration requires selection of pure PAHs without applying a redshift to the bands. Although quantitatively the PAHdb-derived parameters change under different modeling configurations or database versions, their variation follows a linear scaling, with previously reported trends remaining qualitatively valid. PAHdb modeling of JWST observations, and JWST observations smoothed and resampled to the Spitzer-IRS resolution and dispersion have consistent PAHdb derived parameters. Decomposition with different codes, such as PAHFIT and CAFE, produce PAH emission spectra with noticeable variation in the 11-15~&mu;m region, driving a ~7&percnt; difference in the neutral PAH fraction under PAHdb modeling. A new library of galaxy PAH emission templates is delivered to be utilized in galaxy SED modeling.

### 72) [2412.01797](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01797v1): The Newly Discovered Nova Super-Remnant Surrounding Recurrent Nova T Coronae Borealis: Will it Light Up During the Coming Eruption?

A century or less separates the thermonuclear-powered eruptions of recurrent novae in the hydrogen-rich envelopes of massive white dwarfs. The colliding ejecta of successive recurrent nova events are predicted to always generate very large (tens of parsecs) super-remnants; only two examples are currently known. T CrB offers an excellent opportunity to test this prediction. As it will almost certainly undergo its next, once-in ~80-year recurrent nova event between 2024 and 2026, we carried out very deep narrowband and continuum imaging to search for the predicted, piled-up ejecta of the past millenia. While nothing is detected in continuum or narrowband [OIII] images, a ~30-parsec-diameter, faint nebulosity surrounding T CrB is clearly present in deep Halpha, [NII] and [SII] narrowband Condor Array Telescope imagery. We predict that these newly detected nebulosities, as well as the recent ejecta that have not yet reached the super-remnant, are far too optically-thin to capture all but a tiny fraction of the photons emitted by RN flashes. We thus predict that fluorescent light echoes will NOT be detectable following the imminent nova flash of T CrB. Dust may be released by the T CrB red giant wind in pre-eruption outbursts, but we have no reliable estimates of its quantity or geometrical distribution. While we cannot predict the morphology or intensity of dust-induced continuum light echoes following the coming flash, we encourage multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope optical imaging as well as James Webb Space Telescope infrared imaging of T CrB during the year after it erupts.

### 73) [2412.01623](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01623v2): Evolution of the UV slope of galaxies at cosmic morning (z &gt; 4): the properties of extremely blue galaxies

We present an analysis of the UV continuum slope, beta, using a sample of 733 galaxies selected from a mixture of JWST ERS/GTO/GO observational programs and with z &gt; 4. We consider spectroscopic data obtained with the low resolution PRISM/CLEAR NIRSpec configuration. Studying the correlation of beta with M_UV we find a decreasing trend of beta = (-0.056 +- 0.017) M_UV - (3.01 +- 0.34), consistent with brighter galaxies having redder beta as found in previous works. However, analysing the trend in separate redshift bins, we find that at high redshift the relation becomes much flatter, consistent with a flat slope. Furthermore, we find that beta decreases with redshift with an evolution as beta = (-0.075 +- 0.010) z - (1.496 +- 0.056), consistent with most previous results that show a steepening of the spectra going at higher z. We then select a sample of galaxies with extremely blue slopes (beta &lt; -2.6): such slopes are steeper than what is predicted by stellar evolution models, even for dust free, young, metal poor populations, when the contribution of nebular emission is included. We select 51 extremely blue galaxies (XBGs) and we investigate the possible physical origin of their steep slopes, comparing them to a sub-sample of redder galaxies (matched in redshift and M_UV). We find that XBGs have younger stellar populations, stronger ionization fields, lower dust attenuation, and lower but not pristine metallicity (~ 10% solar) compared to red galaxies. However, these properties alone cannot explain the extreme beta values. By using indirect inference of Lyman continuum escape, using the most recent models, we estimate escape fractions f_esc &gt; 10% in at least 25% of XBGs, while all the red sources have smaller f_esc. A reduced nebular continuum contribution as due to either a high escape fraction or to a bursty star-formation history is likely the origin of the extremely blue slopes.

<p>
Investigating the ionizing emission of star-forming galaxies is critical to understanding their contribution to reionization and their impact on the surrounding environment. The number of ionizing photons available to reionize the intergalactic medium (IGM) depends not only on the abundance of galaxies but also on their efficiency in producing ionizing photons (\xi_{ion}). We aim to estimate the \xi_{ion} using Balmer lines in a sample of 731 galaxies at 4\leq z \leq 10 selected from different JWST surveys. We used the available HST and JWST photometry to perform a SED fitting in the sample to determine their physical properties. We used the BAGPIPES code and assumed a delayed exponential model for the star formation history. We used the NIRSpec spectra from prism or grating configurations to estimate Balmer luminosities and then constrained \xi_{ion} values after dust correction. We find a mean value of 10^{25.23}Hz erg^{-1} for \xi_{ion} in the sample with an observed scatter of 0.42dex. We find an increase in the median values of \xi_{ion} which confirms the redshift evolution of \xi_{ion} found in other works. Regarding the relation with physical properties, we find a decrease of \xi_{ion} with increasing stellar mass, indicating that low-mass galaxies are efficient producers of ionizing photons. We also find an increase of \xi_{ion} with increasing specific star formation rate (sSFR) and increasing UV absolute magnitude, which indicates that faint galaxies and with high sSFR are also efficient producers. We also investigated the relation of \xi_{ion} with the EW([OIII]\lambda5007) and find that galaxies with the higher EW([OIII]) are the more efficient producers of ionizing photons. Similarly, we find that galaxies with higher O32 ratios and lower gas-phase metallicities (based on the R23 calibration) show higher \xi_{ion} values.

### 75) [2412.00799](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00799v1): Percent-level timing of reionization: self-consistent, implicit-likelihood inference from XQR-30+ Lyα forest data

<p>
The Lyman alpha (Lya) forest in the spectra of z&gt;5 quasars provides a powerful probe of the late stages of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). With the recent advent of exquisite datasets such as XQR-30, many models have struggled to reproduce the observed large-scale fluctuations in the Lya opacity. Here we introduce a Bayesian analysis framework that forward-models large-scale lightcones of IGM properties, and accounts for unresolved sub-structure in the Lya opacity by calibrating to higher-resolution hydrodynamic simulations. Our models directly connect physically-intuitive galaxy properties with the corresponding IGM evolution, without having to tune "effective" parameters or calibrate out the mean transmission. The forest data, in combination with UV luminosity functions and the CMB optical depth, are able to constrain global IGM properties at percent level precision in our fiducial model. Unlike many other works, we recover the forest observations without evoking a rapid drop in the ionizing emissivity from z~7 to 5.5, which we attribute to our sub-grid model for recombinations. In this fiducial model, reionization ends at z=5.44\pm0.02 and the EoR mid-point is at z=7.7\pm0.1. The ionizing escape fraction increases towards faint galaxies, showing a mild redshift evolution at fixed UV magnitude, Muv. Half of the ionizing photons are provided by galaxies fainter than Muv~-12, well below direct detection limits of optical/NIR instruments including JWST. We also show results from an alternative galaxy model that does not allow for a redshift evolution in the ionizing escape fraction. Despite being decisively disfavored by the Bayesian evidence, the posterior of this model is in qualitative agreement with that from our fiducial model. We caution however that our conclusions regarding the early stages of the EoR and which sources reionized the Universe are more model-dependent.

### 76) [2412.00188](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00188v2): Evolution of the star formation rate surface density main sequence. Insights from a semi-analytic simulation since z = 12

<p> Jakub Nadolny, Michał J. Michałowski, Massimiliano Parente, Martín Solar, Przemysław Nowaczyk, Oleh Ryzhov, Aleksandra Leśniewska </p>
<p>
Recent high-redshift (z&gt;4) spatially resolved observations with the James Webb Space Telesescope have shown the evolution of the star formation rate (SFR) surface density (\Sigma_{\rm SFR}) and its main sequence in the \Sigma_{\rm SFR}-M_* diagram (\Sigma_{\rm SFR}{\rm MS}). The \Sigma_{\rm SFR}{\rm MS}\ is already observed at cosmic morning (z~7.5). The use of \Sigma_{\rm SFR}\ is physically motivated because it is normalized by the area in which the star formation occurs, and this indirectly considers the gas density. The \Sigma_{\rm SFR}-M_* diagram has been shown to complement the widely used (specific) SFR-M_*, particularly when selecting passive galaxies. We establish the \Sigma_{\rm SFR}\ evolution since z=12 in the framework of the L-Galaxies2020 semi-analytical model (SAM), and we interpret recent observations. We estimated \Sigma_{\rm SFR}(-M_*) and the cosmic star formation rate density (CSFRD) for the simulated galaxy population and for the subsamples, which were divided into stellar mass bins in the given redshift. The simulated \Sigma_{\rm SFR}\ decreases by ~3.5 dex from z=12 to z=0. We show that galaxies with different stellar masses have different paths of \Sigma_{\rm SFR}\ evolution. We find that \Sigma_{\rm SFR}{\rm MS}\ is already observed at z~11. The simulated \Sigma_{\rm SFR}{\rm MS}\ agrees with the observed one at z=0, 1, 2, 5, and 7.5 and with individual galaxies at z&gt;10. We show that the highest \Sigma_{\rm SFR}{\rm MS}\ slope of 0.709\pm0.005 is at z~3 and decreases to ~0.085\pm0.003 at z=0. This is mostly driven by a rapid decrease in SFR with an additional size increase for the most massive galaxies in this redshift range. This coincides with the dominance of the most massive galaxies in the CSFRD from the SAM.

### 77) [2412.00182](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00182v1): Investigating cosmic strings using large-volume hydrodynamical simulations in the context of JWST's massive UV-bright galaxies

<p> Sonja M. Koehler, Hao Jiao, Rahul Kannan </p>
<p>
Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered an unexpectedly large abundance of massive, UV-bright galaxies at high redshifts z \gtrsim 10, presenting a significant challenge to established galaxy formation models within the standard \LambdaCDM cosmological framework. Cosmic strings, predicted by a wide range of particle physics theories beyond the Standard Model, provide a promising potential explanation for these observations. They may act as additional gravitational seeds in the early universe, enhancing the process of high-redshift structure formation, potentially resulting in a more substantial population of massive, efficiently star-forming galaxies. We numerically investigate this prediction in large-volume hydrodynamical simulations using the moving-mesh code AREPO and the well-tested IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model. We evaluate the simulation results in the context of recent JWST data and find that sufficiently energetic cosmic strings produce UV luminosity and stellar mass functions that are in slightly to substantially better agreement with observations at high redshifts. Moreover, we observe that the halos seeded by cosmic strings exhibit a greater efficiency of star formation and enhanced central concentrations. Interestingly, our findings indicate that the simulations incorporating cosmic strings converge with those from a baseline \LambdaCDM model by redshift z ~ 6. This convergence suggests that the modified cosmological framework effectively replicates the successful predictions of the standard \LambdaCDM model at lower redshifts, where observational constraints are significantly stronger. Our results provide compelling evidence that cosmic strings may play a crucial role in explaining the galaxy properties observed by JWST at high redshifts while maintaining consistency with well-established models at later epochs.

<p>
We investigate UV continuum slopes \beta of 974 galaxies at z=4-14 using archival JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectra obtained from major JWST GTO, ERS, and GO programs, including JADES, CEERS, and UNCOVER. Among these galaxies, we identify a remarkable galaxy at z=9.25, dubbed EBG-1, with a significantly blue UV slope \beta=-2.99\pm0.15, unlike the rest of the galaxies that exhibit red continua or ambiguous blue continua hindered by large uncertainties. We confirm that the \beta value negligibly changes by the data reduction and fitting wavelength ranges for UV emission/absorption line masking. The extreme blue slope, \beta=-3.0, rules out significant contributions from dust extinction or AGN activity. Comparing with stellar and nebular emission models, we find that such a blue UV slope cannot be reproduced solely by stellar models even with very young, metal-poor, or top-heavy contiguous star formation associated with strong nebular continua making the UV slopes red, but with a high ionizing photon escape fraction, f_\mathrm{esc}^\mathrm{ion} \gtrsim 0.5, for a weak nebular continuum. While the H\beta emission line is not detected, likely due to the limited sensitivity of the spectrum, we find moderately weak [O III] \lambda\lambda4959,5007 emission lines for the given star-formation rate (3\, \mathrm{M_\odot} yr^{-1}) and stellar mass (10^{8.0} \, \mathrm{M_\odot}) that are about three times weaker than the average emission lines, again suggestive of the high ionizing photon escape fraction, f_\mathrm{esc}^\mathrm{ion} ~ 0.7 or more. EBG-1 would provide crucial insights into stellar and nebular continuum emission in high-redshift galaxies, serving as an example of the ionizing photon escaping site at the epoch of reionization.

<p> L. Huang, P. Zong, Z. X. Chang, N. Chang, F. He </p>
<p>
We use the star formation rate-stellar mass relation (SFR - {M_ * }) of galaxies to measure their luminosity distances as well as estimate cosmological parameters. We obtain a sample of 341 high-redshift galaxies at 5 &lt; z &lt; 14, and 51 others at 1.8 &lt; z &lt; 3.5 from the JWST observations, which can be used to investigate the correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass, and determine their cosmological distance. The relation SFR \propto {\kern 1pt} {({M_ * }/{M_ \odot })^\gamma } can be applied to check the nonlinear correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass {M_ * } of galaxies and give their distance. On the other hand, it also can be used to test if the SFR - {M_ * } relation depends on the absolute UV magnitude {M_{UV}}, and the data suggest that the SFR is positively correlated with stellar mass, the SFR - {M_ * } relation of the high-redshift galaxies has an absolute magnitude dependence. Finally, we apply a combination of galaxies and Type Ia supernova (SNIa) Pantheon to test the property of dark energy concerning whether or not its density deviates from the constant, and give the statistical results.

The recently launched James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is opening new observing windows on the distant universe. Among JWST's instruments, the Mid Infrared Instrument (MIRI) offers the unique capability of imaging observations at wavelengths \lambda &gt; 5&mu;m. This enables unique access to the rest frame near infra-red (NIR, \lambda \ge 1&mu;m) emission from galaxies at redshifts z&gt;4 and the visual (\lambda \gtrsim 5000&#8491;) rest frame for z&gt;9. We here report on the guaranteed time observations (GTO) from the MIRI European Consortium, of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), forming the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS), consisting of an on source integration time of ~41 hours in the MIRI/F560W (5.6 &mu;m) filter. To our knowledge, this constitutes the longest single filter exposure obtained with JWST of an extragalactic field as yet.

This work focuses on the ice features toward the binary protostellar system Ced 110 IRS 4A and 4B, and observed with JWST as part of the Early Release Science Ice Age collaboration. We aim to explore the JWST observations of the binary protostellar system Ced~110~IRS4A and IRS4B to unveil and quantify the ice inventories toward these sources. We compare the ice abundances with those found for the same molecular cloud. The analysis is performed by fitting or comparing laboratory infrared spectra of ices to the observations. Spectral fits are carried out with the ENIIGMA fitting tool that searches for the best fit. For Ced~110~IRS4B, we detected the major ice species H_2O, CO, CO_2 and NH_3. All species are found in a mixture except for CO and CO_2, which have both mixed and pure ice components. In the case of Ced~110~IRS4A, we detected the same major species as in Ced~110~IRS4B, as well as the following minor species CH_4, SO_2, CH_3OH, OCN^-, NH_4^+ and HCOOH. Tentative detection of N_2O ice (7.75~&mu;m), forsterite dust (11.2~&mu;m) and CH_3^+ gas emission (7.18~&mu;m) in the primary source are also presented. Compared with the two lines of sight toward background stars in the Chameleon I molecular cloud, the protostar has similar ice abundances, except in the case of the ions that are higher in IRS4A. The clearest differences are the absence of the 7.2 and 7.4~&mu;m absorption features due to HCOO^- and icy complex organic molecules in IRS4A and evidence of thermal processing in both IRS4A and IRS4B as probed by the CO_2 ice features. We conclude that the binary protostellar system Ced~110~IRS4A and IRS4B has a large inventory of icy species. The similar ice abundances in comparison to the starless regions in the same molecular cloud suggest that the chemical conditions of the protostar were set at earlier stages in the molecular cloud.

<p>
The relationship between B-field orientation and density structure in molecular clouds is often assessed using the Histogram of Relative Orientations (HRO). We perform a plane-of-the-sky geometrical analysis of projected B-fields, by interpreting HROs in dense, spheroidal, prestellar and protostellar cores. We use James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) POL-2 850 &mu;m polarisation maps and Herschel column density maps to study dense cores in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud complex. We construct two-dimensional core models, assuming Plummer column density profiles and modelling both linear and hourglass B-fields. We find high-aspect-ratio ellipsoidal cores produce strong HRO signals, as measured using the shape parameter \xi. Cores with linear fields oriented &lt; 45^{\circ} from their minor axis produce constant HROs with -1 &lt; \xi &lt; 0, indicating fields are preferentially parallel to column density gradients. Fields parallel to the core minor axis produce the most negative value of \xi. For low-aspect-ratio cores, \xi \approx 0 for linear fields. Hourglass fields produce a minimum in \xi at intermediate densities in all cases, converging to the minor-axis-parallel linear field value at high and low column densities. We create HROs for six dense cores in Ophiuchus. \rho Oph A and IRAS 16293 have high aspect ratios and preferentially negative HROs, consistent with moderately strong-field behaviour. \rho Oph C, L1689A and L1689B have low aspect ratios, and \xi \approx 0. \rho Oph B is too complex to be modelled using a simple spheroidal field geometry. We see no signature of hourglass fields, agreeing with previous findings that dense cores generally exhibit linear fields on these size scales.

### 83) [2411.17007](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17007v1): Simulating high-redshift galaxies: Enhancing UV luminosity with star formation efficiency and a top-heavy IMF

<p> Tae Bong Jeong, Myoungwon Jeon, Hyunmi Song, Volker Bromm </p>
<p>
Recent findings from photometric and spectroscopic JWST surveys have identified examples of high-redshift galaxies at z \gtrsim 10. These high-z galaxies appear to form much earlier and exhibit greater UV luminosity than predicted by theoretical work. In this study, our goal is to reproduce the brightness of these sources by simulating high-redshift galaxies with virial masses M_{\rm vir} = 10^{9} - 10^{10} M_{\odot} at z &gt; 10. To achieve this, we conduct cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations, modifying baryonic sub-grid physics, and post-process our simulation results to confirm the observability of our simulated galaxies. Specifically, we enhanced star formation activity in high-redshift galaxies by either increasing the star formation efficiency up to 100&percnt; or adopting a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF). Our simulation results indicate that both increasing star formation efficiency and adopting a top-heavy IMF play crucial roles in boosting the UV luminosity of high-redshift galaxies, potentially exceeding the limiting magnitude of JWST surveys in earlier epochs. Especially, the episodic starburst resulting from enhanced star formation efficiency may explain the high-redshift galaxies observed by JWST, as it evacuates dust from star-forming regions, making the galaxies more observable. We demonstrate this correlation between star formation activity and dust mass evolution within the simulated galaxies. Also, adopting a top-heavy IMF could enhance observability due to an overabundance of massive stars, although it may also facilitate rapid metal enrichment. Using our simulation results, we derive several observables such as effective radius, UV slope, and emission line rates, which could serve as valuable theoretical estimates for comparison with existing spectroscopic results and forthcoming data from the JWST NIRSpec and MIRI instruments.

We present the luminosity functions (LFs) and angular correlation functions (ACFs) derived from 18,960 Ly\alpha emitters (LAEs) at z=2.2-7.3 over a wide survey area of \lesssim24 {\rm deg^2} that are identified in the narrowband data of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) and the Cosmic HydrOgen Reionization Unveiled with Subaru (CHORUS) surveys. Confirming the large sample with the 241 spectroscopically identified LAEs, we determine Ly\alpha LFs and ACFs in the brighter luminosity range down to 0.5L_{\star}, and confirm that our measurements are consistent with previous studies but offer significantly reduced statistical uncertainties. The improved precision of our ACFs allows us to clearly detect one-halo terms at some redshifts, and provides large-scale bias measurements that indicate hosting halo masses of ~ 10^{11} M_\odot over z~eq 2-7. By comparing our Ly\alpha LF (ACF) measurements with reionization models, we estimate the neutral hydrogen fractions in the intergalactic medium to be x_{\rm \HI}&lt;0.05 (={0.06}^{+0.12}_{-0.03}), 0.15^{+0.10}_{-0.08} ({0.21}^{+0.19}_{-0.14}), 0.18^{+0.14}_{-0.12}, and 0.75^{+0.09}_{-0.13} at z=5.7, 6.6, 7.0, and 7.3, respectively. Our findings suggest that the neutral hydrogen fraction remains relatively low, x_{\rm \HI} \lesssim 0.2, at z=5-7, but increases sharply at z &gt; 7, reaching x_{\rm \HI} ~ 0.9 by z ~eq 8-9, as indicated by recent JWST studies. The combination of our results from LAE observations with recent JWST observations suggests that the major epoch of reionization occurred around z ~ 7-8, likely driven by the emergence of massive sources emitting significant ionizing photons.

The UV continuum slope of galaxies, \beta, is a powerful diagnostic. Understanding the redshift evolution of \beta and its dependence on key galaxy properties can shed light on the evolution of galaxy physical properties over cosmic time. In this study, we present \beta measurements for 295 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at 5.5&lt;z&lt;14.3 selected primarily from JADES, where \beta has been measured from high quality JWST NIRSpec/PRISM spectra. We find a median \beta=-2.3 across our full sample, and find mild increase in blueness of \beta with increasing redshift and fainter UV magnitudes. Interestingly, we find evidence for the average \beta at z &gt; 9.5 to begin to redden, deviating from the trend observed at z &lt; 9.5. By producing stacked spectra in bins of redshift and \beta, we derive trends between \beta and dust attenuation, metallicity, ionization parameter, and stellar age indicators directly from spectra, finding a lack of dust attenuation to be the dominant driver of bluer \beta values. We further report six galaxies with \beta&lt;-3.0, which show a range of spectroscopic properties and signs of significant LyC photon leakage. Finally, we show that the redder \beta values at z &gt; 9.5 may require rapid build-up of dust reservoirs in the very early Universe or a significant contribution from the nebular continuum emission to the observed UV spectra, with the nebular continuum fraction depending on the gas temperatures and densities. Our modeling shows that in the absence of dust, nebular emission at T &gt; 15,000 K can reproduce the range of \beta that we see in our sample. Higher gas temperatures driven by hot, massive stars can boost the fraction of nebular continuum emission, potentially explaining the observed \beta values as well as bright UV magnitudes seen across galaxies at z &gt; 10.

We report the discovery of five galaxy candidates at redshifts between 15.9&lt;z&lt;18.6 in JWST observations from the GLIMPSE survey. These robust sources were identified using a combination of Lyman-break selection and photometric redshift estimates. The ultra-deep NIRCam imaging from GLIMPSE, combined with the strong gravitational lensing of the Abell S1063 galaxy cluster, allows us to probe an intrinsically fainter population (down to M_{\rm UV}=-17.5 mag) than previously achievable. These galaxies have absolute magnitudes ranging from M_{\rm UV}= -17.7 to -18.0 mag, with UV continuum slopes between \beta ~eq -2.3 and \beta ~eq -3.0, consistent with young, dust-free stellar populations. The number density of these objects, log_{\rm 10} (\phi/[Mpc^{-3} mag^{-1}])=-3.43^{+0.28}_{-0.64} at M_{\rm UV}=-18 is in clear tension with pre-JWST theoretical predictions, extending the over-abundance of galaxies from z~10 to z~ 18.6. These results, together with the scarcity of brighter galaxies in other public surveys, suggest a steep decline in the bright-end of the UV luminosity function at z ~ 17, implying efficient star formation and possibly a close connection to the halo mass function at these redshifts. Testing a variety of star formation histories suggests that these sources are plausible progenitors of the unusually UV-bright galaxies that JWST now routinely uncovers at z = 10-14. Overall, our results indicate that the luminosity distribution of the earliest star-forming galaxies could be shifting towards fainter luminosities, implying that future surveys of cosmic dawn will need to explore this faint luminosity regime.

<p>
HeH^+ was the first heteronuclear molecule to form in the metal-free Universe after the Big Bang. The molecule gained significant attention following its first circumstellar detection in the young and dense planetary nebula NGC 7027. We target some hydride ions associated with the noble gases (HeH^+, ArH^+, and NeH^+) to investigate their formation in harsh environments like the nova outburst region. We use a photoionization modeling (based on previously published best-fit physical parameters) of the moderately fast ONe type nova, QU Vulpeculae 1984, and the CO type novae, RS Ophiuchi and V1716 Scorpii. Our steady-state modeling reveals a convincing amount of HeH^+, especially in the dense clump of RS Ophiuchi and V1716 Scorpii. The calculated upper limit on the surface brightness of HeH^+ transitions suggests that the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) could detect some of them, particularly in sources like RS Ophiuchi and V1716 Scorpii, which have similar physical and chemical conditions and evolution. It must be clearly noted that the sources studied are used as templates, and not as targets for observations. The detection of these lines could be useful for determining the physical conditions in similar types of systems and for validating our predictions based on new electron-impact ro-vibrational collisional data at temperatures of up to 20,000 K.

### 88) [2410.14846](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14846v3): Early Bright Galaxies from Helium Enhancements in High-Redshift Star Clusters

<p> Harley Katz, Alexander P. Ji, O. Grace Telford, Peter Senchyna </p>
<p>
The first few cycles of JWST have identified an overabundance of UV-bright galaxies and a general excess of UV luminosity density at z\gtrsim10 compared to expectations from most (pre-JWST) theoretical models. Moreover, some of the brightest high-redshift spectroscopically confirmed galaxies exhibit peculiar chemical abundance patterns, most notably extremely high N/O ratios. Since N/O has been empirically shown to scale strongly with He/H, as expected for hot hydrogen burning, these same bright high-redshift galaxies are likely also helium-enhanced. Under simplistic assumptions for stellar evolution, the bolometric luminosity of a star scales as L\propto(2-\frac{5}{4}Y)^{-4}(2-Y)^{-1} -- hence a higher He/H leads to brighter stars. In this Letter, we evolve a series of MESA models to the zero-age main-sequence and highlight that the helium enhancements at the levels measured and inferred for high-redshift galaxies can boost the 1500 \mathring{\rm A} UV luminosity by up to ~50&percnt;, while simultaneously increasing the stellar effective temperature. The combination of helium enhancements with nebular continuum emission expected for intense bursts of star formation have the potential to help reduce the tension between JWST observations and certain galaxy formation models.

### 89) [2410.14284](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14284v2): Atomic and molecular gas as traced by [C II] emission

<p> Benedetta Casavecchia, Umberto Maio, Céline Péroux, Benedetta Ciardi </p>
<p>
The latest ALMA and JWST observations provide new information on the birth and evolution of galaxies in the early Universe, at the epoch of reionization. Of particular importance are measurements at redshift z &gt; 5 of their cold-gas budget, which is known to be the main fuel for star formation. A powerful tool for probing the physics characterising galaxies at high redshift is the \CII\ 158\,\rm &mu; m emission line. Due to its low excitation potential, \CII\ emission can be produced in photodissociation regions, neutral atomic gas and molecular clouds. To properly capture the cold-gas processes taking place in such environments (molecule formation, self-shielding, dust grain catalysis, photoelectric and cosmic-ray heating), we make use of a new set of state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations (\coldsim) including time-dependent non-equilibrium chemistry, star formation, stellar evolution, metal spreading and feedback mechanisms. We are able to accurately track the evolution of \HI, \HII\ and H_2 in a cosmological context and predict the contribution of each gas phase to \CII\ luminosity. We provide formulas that can be used to estimate the mass of molecular and atomic gas from \CII\ detections. Furthermore, we analyse how conversion factors evolve with galactic properties, such as stellar metallicity, star formation rate and stellar mass. We demonstrate that \CII\ emission is dominated by \HI\ gas and most of the \CII\ luminosity is generated in warm, dense star-forming regions. Importantly, we conclude that, despite \CII\ tracing predominantly atomic rather than molecular gas, the \CII\ luminosity remains a robust indicator of the H_2 mass.

### 90) [2410.08707](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08707v2): The nature of low-luminosity AGNs discovered by JWST based on clustering analysis: progenitors of low-z quasars?

<p> Junya Arita, Nobunari Kashikawa, Masafusa Onoue, Takehiro Yoshioka, Yoshihiro Takeda, Hiroki Hoshi, Shunta Shimizu </p>
<p>
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered many faint AGNs at high-z by detecting their broad Balmer lines. However, their high number density, lack of X-ray emission, and overly high black hole masses with respect to their host stellar masses suggest that they are a distinct population from general type-1 quasars. Here, we present clustering analysis of 27 low-luminosity broad-line AGNs found by JWST (JWST AGNs) at 5&lt;z&lt;6 based on cross-correlation analysis with 679 photometrically-selected galaxies to characterize their host dark matter halo (DMH) masses. From the angular and projected cross-correlation functions, we find that their typical DMH mass is \log (M_\mathrm{halo}/h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot) = 11.46_{-0.25}^{+0.19}, and 11.53_{-0.20}^{+0.15}, respectively. This result implies that the host DMHs of these AGNs are ~1 dex smaller than those of luminous quasars. The DMHs of the JWST AGNs at 5&lt;z&lt;6 are predicted to grow to 10^{12\unicode{x2013}13}\,h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot at z\lesssim3, which is comparable to that of a more luminous quasar at the same epoch. Applying the empirical stellar-to-halo mass ratio to the measured DMH mass, we evaluate their host stellar mass as \log(M_*/\mathrm{M}_\odot)=9.48_{-0.41}^{+0.31}, and 9.60_{-0.33}^{+0.24}, which are higher than some of those estimated by the SED fitting. We also evaluate their duty cycle as f_\mathrm{duty}=0.37_{-0.15}^{+0.19} per cent, corresponding to ~4\times10^6 yr as the lifetime of the JWST AGNs. While we cannot exclude the possibility that the JWST AGNs are simply low-mass type-1 quasars, these results suggest that the JWST AGNs are a different population from type-1 quasars and the progenitors of quasars at z\lesssim3.

### 91) [2410.07498](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07498v2): Comparing E-MOSAICS predictions of high-redshift proto-globular clusters with JWST observations in lensed galaxies

<p>
High-resolution imaging and strong gravitational lensing of high-redshift galaxies have enabled the detection of compact sources with properties similar to nearby massive star clusters. Often found to be very young, these sources may be globular clusters detected in their earliest stages. In this work, we compare predictions of high-redshift (z ~ 1--10) star cluster properties from the E-MOSAICS simulation of galaxy and star cluster formation with those of the star cluster candidates in strongly lensed galaxies from James Webb (JWST) and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging. We select galaxies in the simulation that match the luminosities of the majority of lensed galaxies with star cluster candidates observed with JWST. We find that the luminosities, ages and masses of the brightest star cluster candidates in the high-redshift galaxies are consistent with the E-MOSAICS model. In particular, the brightest cluster ages are in excellent agreement. The results suggest that star clusters in both low- and high-redshift galaxies may form via common mechanisms. However, the brightest clusters in the lensed galaxies tend to be \approx 1--1.5 mag brighter and \approx 0.5 dex more massive than the median E-MOSAICS predictions. We discuss the large number of effects that could explain the discrepancy, including simulation and observational limitations, stellar population models, cluster detection biases and nuclear star clusters. Understanding these limitations would enable stronger tests of globular cluster formation models.

### 92) [2410.00730](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00730v2): Astraeus X: Indications of a top-heavy initial mass function in highly star-forming galaxies from JWST observations at z&gt;10

<p> Anne Hutter, Elie R Cueto, Pratika Dayal, Stefan Gottlöber, Maxime Trebitsch, Gustavo Yepes </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered an abundance of z&gt;10 galaxies bright in the ultraviolet (UV) that has challenged traditional theoretical models at high redshifts. Recently, various new models have emerged to address this discrepancy by refining their description of star formation. Here we investigate whether modifications to the stellar initial mass function (IMF) alone can reproduce the z&gt;10 UV luminosity functions (UV LFs) when the star formation rate is used as a proxy for the fraction of massive stars. We incorporate an Evolving IMF into the {\sc astraeus} galaxy evolution and reionisation simulation framework, which becomes increasingly top-heavy as the gas density in a galaxy rises above a given threshold. Our implementation accounts for the IMF's effects on supernova (SN) feedback, metal enrichment, and the UV and ionising emissivities. For this Evolving IMF model, we find that (i) the maximum UV luminosity enhancement is twice as large in massive galaxies (\Delta M_\mathrm{UV}~eq2.6) than those where star formation is strongly limited by SN feedback (\Delta M_\mathrm{UV}~eq1.3); (ii) it successfully reproduces the observed UV LFs at z=5-15; (iii) galaxies with top-heavy IMFs exhibit the highest star formation rates, driven by their location in local density peaks, which facilitates higher gas accretion rates; (iv) the 1\sigma variances in the UV luminosity are only slightly higher compared to when assuming a Salpeter IMF, but the 2\sigma variances are significantly increased by a factor of 1.4-2 boosting the abundance of UV-bright galaxies at z&gt;10; (v) reionisation begins earlier with more extended large ionised regions and fewer smaller ones during its initial stages, though these differences diminish at lower redshifts, leading to a similar end of reionisation at z~eq5.6.}

<p>
Recently, a large number of compact sources at z &gt; 4 with blue UV slopes and extremely red rest-frame optical slopes have been found in James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) extragalactic surveys. As a subsample of these sources, commonly called ``little red dots'' (LRDs), have been spectroscopically observed to host a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN), they have been the focus of multiple recent studies in an attempt to understand the origin of their UV and optical emission. Here, we assemble a sample of 123 LRDs from the literature along with spectroscopic and photometric JWST-identified samples of AGNs to compare their colors and spectral slopes. We find that while obscured AGNs at z &lt; 6 have highly dissimilar colors to LRDs, unobscured AGNs at z &lt; 6 span a wide range of colors, with only a subsample showing colors similar to LRDs. At z &gt; 6, the majority of the unobscured AGNs that have been found in these samples are LRDs, but this may be related to the fact that these sources are at large bolometric luminosities. Because LRDs occupy a unique position in galaxy color space, they are more straightforward to target, and the large number of broad-line AGNs that do not have LRD colors and slopes are therefore underrepresented in many spectroscopic surveys because they are more difficult to pre-select. Current LRD selection techniques return a large and disparate population, including many sources having 2-5&mu;m colors impacted by emission line flux boosting in individual filters.

Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered massive galaxies at high redshifts, with their abundance significantly surpassing expectations. This finding poses a substantial challenge to both galaxy formation models and our understanding of cosmology. Additionally, discrepancies between the Hubble parameter inferred from high-redshift cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations and those derived from low-redshift distance ladder methods have led to what is known as the ``Hubble tension''. Among the most promising solutions to this tension are Early Dark Energy (EDE) models. In this study, we employ an axion-like EDE model in conjunction with a universal Salpeter initial mass function to fit the luminosity function derived from JWST data, as well as other cosmological probes, including the CMB, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and the SH0ES local distance ladder. Our findings indicate that JWST observations favor a high energy fraction of EDE, f_\text{EDE} ~ 0.2 \pm 0.03 , and a high Hubble constant value of H_0 ~ 74.6 \pm 1.2 km/s/Mpc, even in the absence of SH0ES data. This suggests that EDE not only addresses the H_0 tension but also provides a compelling explanation for the observed abundance of massive galaxies identified by JWST.

<p>
The removal of angular momentum from protostellar systems drives accretion onto the central star and may drive the dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Winds and jets can contribute to removing angular momentum from the disk, though the dominant process remain unclear. To date, observational studies of resolved disk winds have mostly targeted highly inclined disks. We report the detection of extended H2 and [Ne II] emission toward the young stellar object SY Cha with the JWST Mid-InfraRed Instrument Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI-MRS). This is one of the first polychromatic detections of extended H2 toward a moderately inclined, i=51.1 degrees, Class II source. We measure the semi-opening angle of the H2 emission as well as build a rotation diagram to determine the H2 excitation temperature and abundance. We find a wide semi-opening angle, high temperature, and low column density for the H2 emission, all of which are characteristic of a disk wind. We derive a molecular wind mass loss rate of 3+-2e-9 Msun/yr, which is high compared to the previously derived stellar accretion rate of 6.6e-10 Msun/yr. This suggests either that the stellar accretion and the disk wind are driven by different mechanisms or that accretion onto the star is highly variable. These observations demonstrate MIRI-MRS's utility in expanding studies of resolved disk winds beyond edge-on sources.

<p>
The absolute flux calibration of the Mid-Infrared Instrument Imaging and Coronagraphy is based on observations of multiple stars taken during the first 2.5 years of JWST operations. The observations were designed to ensure that the flux calibration is valid for a range of flux densities, different subarrays, and different types of stars. The flux calibration was measured by combining observed aperture photometry corrected to infinite aperture with predictions based on previous observations and models of stellar atmospheres. A subset of these observations were combined with model point-spread-functions to measure the corrections to infinite aperture. Variations in the calibration factor with time, flux density, background level, type of star, subarray, integration time, rate, and well depth were investigated, and the only significant variations were with time and subarray. Observations of the same star taken approximately every month revealed a modest time-dependent response loss seen mainly at the longest wavelengths. This loss is well characterized by a decaying exponential with a time constant of ~200 days. After correcting for the response loss, the band-dependent scatter around the corrected average (aka repeatability) was found to range from 0.1 to 1.2%. Signals in observations taken with different subarrays can be lower by up to 3.4% compared to FULL frame. After correcting for the time and subarray dependencies, the scatter in the calibration factors measured for individual stars ranges from 1 to 4% depending on the band. The formal uncertainties on the flux calibration averaged for all observations are 0.3 to 1.0%, with longer-wavelength bands generally having larger uncertainties.

### 97) [2409.08326](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08326v2): Growth of Light-Seed Black Holes in Gas-Rich Galaxies at High Redshift

<p> Daxal Mehta, John A. Regan, Lewis Prole </p>
<p>
Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope confirm the existence of massive black holes (&gt;10^6 \rm{M_{\odot}}) beyond the redshift of z=10. However, their formation mechanism(s) still remain an open question. Light seed black holes are one such formation pathway, forming as the end stage of metalfree (Population III) stars. Light seed black holes can grow into massive black holes as long as they accrete near the Eddington limit for substantial periods or undergo several bursts of super-Eddington accretion. In this work, our aim is to ascertain if light seeds can grow in gas rich galaxies - similar to those expected at high redshift (z \gtrsim 10). Using the Arepo code, we follow self-consistently the formation of Population III stars and black holes in galaxies with total masses in the range 10^8 \rm{M_{\odot}}. We find that in the absence of feedback, black holes can grow to 10^5 \rm{M_{\odot}} in just 10^4 years. These black holes do not decouple from the gas clumps in which they are born and are able to accrete at hyper-Eddington rates. In the presence of supernova feedback, the number of actively growing black holes diminishes by an order of magnitude. However, we still observe hyper-Eddington accretion in approximately 1 % of the black hole population despite supernova feedback. This (idealised) work lays the foundation for future works, where we will test our models in a cosmological framework. In this work, we neglect radiative feedback processes from stellar evolution and from accretion onto the growing black holes. This likely means that our results represent an upper limit to light seed growth. We will address these shortcomings in future work.

<p>
Ly\alpha is the transition to the ground state from the first excited state of hydrogen (the most common element). Resonant scattering of this line by neutral hydrogen greatly impedes its emergence from galaxies, so the fraction of galaxies emitting Ly\alpha is a tracer of the neutral fraction of the intergalactic medium (IGM), and thus the history of reionisation. In previous works, we used early JWST/NIRSpec data from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) to classify and characterise Ly\alpha emitting galaxies (LAEs). This survey is approaching completion, and the current sample is nearly an order of magnitude larger. From a sample of 795 galaxies in JADES at 4.0&lt;z&lt;14.3, we find evidence for Ly\alpha emission in 150sources. We reproduce the previously found correlation between Ly\alpha escape fraction (f_{esc}^{Ly\alpha}) - Ly\alpha rest-frame equivalent width (REW_{Ly\alpha}) and the negative correlation between Ly\alpha velocity offset - f_{esc}^{Ly\alpha}. Both f_{esc}^{Ly\alpha} and REW_{Ly\alpha} decrease with redshift (z\gtrsim5.5), indicating the progression of reionisation on a population scale. Our data are used to demonstrate an increasing IGM transmission of Ly\alpha from z~14-6. We measure the completeness-corrected fraction of LAEs (\xlya) from z=4-9.5. An application of these \xlya values to the results of previously utilised semi-analytical models suggests a high neutral fraction at z=7 (X_{HI}~0.8-0.9). Using an updated fit to the intrinsic distribution of REW_{Ly\alpha} results in a lower value in agreement with current works (X_{HI}=0.64_{-0.21}^{+0.13}). This sample of LAEs will be paramount for unbiased population studies of galaxies in the EoR.

The radial gradient of gas-phase metallicity is a powerful probe of the chemical and structural evolution of star-forming galaxies, closely tied to disk formation and gas kinematics in the early universe. We present spatially resolved chemical and dynamical properties for a sample of 25 galaxies at 0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 1.7 from the \msasd survey. These innovative observations provide 3D spectroscopy of galaxies at a spatial resolution approaching JWST's diffraction limit and a high spectral resolution of R~eq2700. The metallicity gradients measured in our galaxy sample range from -0.03 to 0.02 dex~kpc^{-1}. Most galaxies exhibit negative or flat radial gradients, indicating lower metallicity in the outskirts or uniform metallicity throughout the entire galaxy. We confirm a tight relationship between stellar mass and metallicity gradient at z~1 with small intrinsic scatter of 0.02 dex~kpc^{-1}. Our results indicate that metallicity gradients become increasingly negative as stellar mass increases, likely because the more massive galaxies tend to be more ``disky". This relationship is consistent with the predictions from cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations with strong stellar feedback. This work presents the effort to harness the multiplexing capability of JWST NIRSpec/MSA in slit-stepping mode to map the chemical and kinematic profiles of high-redshift galaxies in large samples and at high spatial and spectral resolution.

### 100) [2409.00471](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00471v2): Ejective feedback as a quenching mechanism in the 1.5 billion years of the universe: detection of neutral gas outflow in a z=4 recently quenched galaxy

<p> Po-Feng Wu </p>
<p>
The confirmation of massive quiescent galaxies emerging within the first billion years of the universe poses intriguing questions about the mechanisms of galaxy formation. There must be highly efficient processes at work to shut down star formation in galaxies at cosmic dawn. I present the detection of neutral outflowing gas in a massive recently quenched galaxy at z=4, showing ejective back as a quenching mechanism. Based on JWST spectrum, the star formation rate of this has been declining with a rapid e-folding timescale of ~50 Myrs. The current specific star formation rate is 5\times10^{-11} yr^{-1}, roughly 40 times lower than that of the star-forming main sequence at comparable redshifts. Emission line ratios of [NeIII]/[OII] and [OIII]/H\beta are similar to AGN at comparable redshifts. A series of FeII and MgII absorption lines appear blueshifted by ~250~km~s^{-1} relative to the stellar continuum, suggesting an outflow of neutral gas. The estimated mass outflow rate is approximately 7 times greater than the star formation rate derived from the stellar continuum, implying that the suppression of star formation is likely due to gas being depleted by the outflow. If the emission lines are AGN-driven, the AGN can also provide sufficient energy to launch the outflow observed. This galaxy represents the most distant example of its kind known to date. This study offers a compelling explanation for the existence of massive quiescent galaxies in the first billion years of the universe.

<p> Hamsa Padmanabhan, Abraham Loeb </p>
<p>
We use the inferred evolution of Lyman-\alpha luminosities of galaxies in the redshift range of z ~ 9-16 from the {James \ Webb \ Space \ Telescope} (JWST) data to predict the power spectrum of Loeb-Rybicki haloes formed by the scattering of Lyman-\alpha photons from neutral hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium expanding with the Hubble flow, until they Doppler shift out of resonance and escape towards the observer. This leads to the formation of the so-called Loeb-Rybicki intergalactic haloes, which are expected to be prominent even before the epoch of reionization. We find excellent prospects for a statistical detection of the intensity mapping signal from the clustering of these haloes, with current and future experiments such as the JWST, SPHEREx and CDIM. We also describe the detectability of the signal in cross-correlation with the 21-cm emission from the neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium at these redshifts. We find that the cross-correlation signal should be detectable at a significance of a few to a few tens of standard deviations out to z ~ 13 and marginally out to z ~ 16, using the above experiments in combination with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA)-LOW and its pathfinder, the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA).

<p>
\require{mediawiki-texvc}Cosmic Reionisation commenced when ultraviolet (UV) radiation produced in the first galaxies began illuminating the cold, neutral gas that filled the primordial Universe. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have shown that surprisingly UV-bright galaxies were in place beyond redshift z = 14, when the Universe was less than 300 \, \mathrm{Myr} old. Smooth turnovers of their UV continua have been interpreted as damping-wing absorption of Lyman-\alpha (Ly\alpha), the principal hydrogen transition. However, spectral signatures encoding crucial properties of these sources, such as their emergent radiation field, largely remain elusive. Here we report spectroscopy from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) of a galaxy at redshift z = 13.0 that reveal a singular, bright emission line unambiguously identified as Ly\alpha, in addition to a smooth turnover. We observe an equivalent width of \text{EW}_\mathrm{Ly\alpha} &gt; 40 \, &#8491; (rest frame), previously only seen at z &lt; 9 where the intervening intergalactic medium (IGM) becomes increasingly ionised. Together with an extremely blue UV continuum, the unexpected Ly\alpha emission indicates the galaxy is a prolific producer and leaker of ionising photons. This suggests massive, hot stars or an active galactic nucleus (AGN) have created an early reionised region to prevent complete extinction of Ly\alpha, thus shedding new light on the nature of the earliest galaxies and the onset of Reionisation only 330 \, \mathrm{Myr} after the Big Bang.

<p>
We present star formation rates (SFR), the mass-metallicity relation (MZR), and the SFR-dependent MZR across redshifts 4 to 10 using 81 star-forming galaxies observed by the JWST NIRSpec employing both low-resolution PRISM and medium-resolution gratings, including galaxies from the JADES GOODS-N and GOODS-S fields, the JWST-PRIMAL Legacy Survey, and additional galaxies from the literature in Abell 2744, SMACS-0723, RXJ2129, BDF, COSMOS, and MACS1149 fields. These galaxies span a 3 dex stellar mass range of 10^7 &lt; M_{\ast}/M_{\odot} &lt; 10^{10}, with an average SFR of 7.2 \pm 1.2 M_{\odot} {\rm yr}^{-1} and an average metallicity of 12+{\rm log(O/H)} = 7.91 \pm 0.08. Our findings align with previous observations up to z=8 for the MZR and indicate no deviation from local universe FMR up to this redshift. Beyond z=8, we observe a significant deviation ~ 0.27 dex) in FMR, consistent with recent JWST findings. We also integrate CEERS (135 galaxies) and JADES (47 galaxies) samples with our data to study metallicity evolution with redshift in a combined sample of 263 galaxies, revealing a decreasing metallicity trend with a slope of 0.067 \pm 0.013, consistent with IllustrisTNG and EAGLE, but contradicts with FIRE simulations. We introduce an empirical mass-metallicity-redshift (MZ-z relation): 12+{\rm log(O/H)}=6.29 + 0.237 \times{\rm log}(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot}) - 0.06 \times (1+z), which accurately reproduces the observed trends in metallicity with both redshift and stellar mass. This trend underscores the ``Grand Challenge'' in understanding the factors driving high-redshift galactic metallicity trends, such as inflow, outflow, and AGN/stellar feedback -- and emphasizes the need for further investigations with larger samples and enhanced simulations.

### 104) [2408.07745](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07745v2): The Small Sizes and High Implied Densities of `Little Red Dots' with Balmer Breaks Could Explain Their Broad Emission Lines Without an AGN

<p>
Early JWST studies found an apparent population of massive, compact galaxies at redshifts z\gtrsim7. Recently three of these galaxies were shown to have prominent Balmer breaks, demonstrating that their light at \lambda_{\rm rest} ~ 3500 \r{A} is dominated by a stellar population that is relatively old (~200 Myr). All three also have broad H\beta emission with \sigma &gt; 1000 \,\rm km s^{-1}, a common feature of such `little red dots'. From S\'ersic profile fits to the NIRCam images in F200W we find that the stellar light of galaxies is extremely compact: the galaxies have half-light radii of r_{\rm e}~ 100 pc, in the regime of ultra compact dwarfs in the nearby Universe. Their masses are uncertain, as they depend on the contribution of possible light from an AGN to the flux at \lambda_{\rm rest}&gt;5000 \r{A}. If the AGN contribution is low beyond the Balmer break region, the masses are M_* ~ 10^{10}-10^{11}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}, and the central densities are higher than those of any other known galaxy population by an order of magnitude. Interestingly, the implied velocity dispersions of ~1500 kms^{-1} are in very good agreement with the measured H\beta line widths. We suggest that some of the broad lines in `little red dots' are not due to AGNs but simply reflect the kinematics of the galaxies, and speculate that the galaxies are observed in a short-lived phase where the central densities are much higher than at later times. We stress, however, that the canonical interpretation of AGNs causing the broad H\beta lines also remains viable.

<p> Akash Vani, Mohammadreza Ayromlou, Guinevere Kauffmann, Volker Springel </p>
<p>
We present a comprehensive examination of the three latest versions of the L-Galaxies semi-analytic galaxy formation model, focusing on the evolution of galaxy properties across a broad stellar mass range (10^7\:{\rm M}_{\odot}\lesssim{M_\star}\lesssim10^{12}\:{\rm M}_{\odot}) from z=0 to z~eq10. This study is the first to compare predictions of L-Galaxies with high-redshift observations well outside the original calibration regime, utilising multiband data from surveys such as SDSS, CANDELS, COSMOS, HST, JWST, and ALMA. We assess the models' ability to reproduce various time-dependent galaxy scaling relations for star-forming and quenched galaxies. Key focus areas include global galaxy properties such as stellar mass functions, cosmic star formation rate density, and the evolution of the main sequence of star-forming galaxies. Additionally, we examine resolved morphological properties such as the galaxy mass-size relation, alongside core (R&lt;1\,{\rm{kpc}}) and effective (R&lt;R_{\rm{e}}) stellar-mass surface densities as a function of stellar mass. This analysis reveals that the L-Galaxies models are in qualitatively good agreement with observed global scaling relations up to z~eq10. However, significant discrepancies exist at both low and high redshifts in accurately reproducing the number density, size, and surface density evolution of quenched galaxies. These issues are most pronounced for massive central galaxies, where the simulations underpredict the abundance of quenched systems at z\geq1.5, reaching a discrepancy of a factor of 60 by z\approx3, with sizes several times larger than observed. Therefore, we propose that the physical prescriptions governing galaxy quenching, such as AGN feedback and processes related to merging, require improvement to be more consistent with observational data.

<p> Miriam Golubchik, Charles L. Steinhardt, Adi Zitrin, Ashish K. Meena, Lukas J. Furtak, Doron Chelouche, Shai Kaspi </p>
<p>
Mass estimates of black holes (BHs) in the centers of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) often rely on the radius-luminosity relation. However, this relation, usually probed by reverberation mapping (RM), is poorly constrained in the high-luminosity and high-redshift ends due to the very long expected RM lag times. Multiply imaged AGN may offer a unique opportunity to explore the radius-luminosity relation at these ends. In addition to comprising several magnified images enabling a more efficient light-curve sampling, the time delay between multiple images of strongly lensed quasars can also aid in making such RM measurements feasible on reasonable timescales: If the strong-lensing time delay is, for example, of the order of the expected RM time lag, changes in the emission lines in the leading image can be observed around the same time as the changes in the continuum in the trailing image. In this work we probe the typical time-delay distribution in galaxy-cluster lenses and estimate the number of both high-mass (~10^9-10^{10} M_{\odot}), and high-redshift (z\gtrsim4-12) quasars that are expected to be strongly lensed by clusters. We find that up to several dozen thousand M_{BH}~10^{6}-10^{8} M_{\odot} broad-line AGN at z&gt;4 should be multiply imaged by galaxy clusters and detectable with JWST, hundreds with Euclid and several thousands with the Roman Space Telescope, across the whole sky. These could supply an important calibration for the BH mass scaling in the early Universe.

### 107) [2408.00065](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00065v3): Tip of the Red Giant Branch Distances with JWST. II. I-band Measurements in a Sample of Hosts of 10 SN Ia Match HST Cepheids

The Hubble Tension, a &gt;5 sigma discrepancy between direct and indirect measurements of the Hubble constant (H0), has persisted for a decade and motivated intense scrutiny of the paths used to infer H0. Comparing independently-derived distances for a set of galaxies with different standard candles, such as the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) and Cepheid variables, can test for systematics in the middle rung of the distance ladder. The I band is the preferred filter for measuring the TRGB due to constancy with color, a result of low sensitivity to population differences in age and metallicity supported by stellar models. We use James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations with the maser host NGC 4258 as our geometric anchor to measure I-band (F090W vs F090W-F150W) TRGB distances to 8 hosts of 10 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) within 28 Mpc: NGC 1448, NGC 1559, NGC 2525, NGC 3370, NGC 3447, NGC 5584, NGC 5643, and NGC 5861. We compare these with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Cepheid-based relative distance moduli for the same galaxies and anchor. We find no evidence of a difference between their weighted means, 0.01 +/- 0.04 (stat) +/- 0.04 (sys) mag. We produce fourteen variants of the TRGB analysis, altering the smoothing level and color range used to measure the tips to explore their impact. For some hosts, this changes the identification of the strongest peak, but this causes little change to the sample mean difference producing a full range of 0.01 to 0.03 mag, all consistent at 1 sigma with no difference. The result matches past comparisons of I-band TRGB and Cepheids when both use HST. SNe and anchor samples observed with JWST are too small to yield a measure of H0 that is competitive with the HST sample of 42 SNe Ia and 4 anchors; however, they already provide a vital systematic crosscheck to HST measurements of the distance ladder.

### 108) [2407.17110](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17110v2): The Extreme Low-mass End of the Mass-Metallicity Relation at z~7

<p>
The mass-metallicity relation (MZR) provides crucial insights into the baryon cycle in galaxies and provides strong constraints on galaxy formation models. We use \jwst\ NIRSpec observations from the UNCOVER program to measure the gas-phase metallicity in a sample of eight galaxies during the epoch of reionization at z=6-8. Thanks to the strong lensing of the galaxy cluster Abell 2744, we are able to probe extremely low stellar masses between 10^{6} and 10^{8}\msol. Using strong lines diagnostics and the most recent \jwst\ calibrations, we derive extremely-low oxygen abundances ranging from 12+log(O/H) = 6.7 to 7.8. By combining this sample with more massive galaxies at similar redshifts, we derive a best-fit relation of 12+{\rm log(O/H)} = -0.076_{-0.03}^{+0.03} \times ({\rm log}(M_{\star}))^2+ 1.61_{-0.52}^{+0.52}\times {\rm log}(M_{\star})-0.26_{-0.10}^{+0.10}, which becomes steeper than determinations at z ~ 3-6 towards low-mass galaxies. Our results show a clear redshift evolution in the overall normalization of the relation, galaxies at higher redshift having significantly lower metallicities at a given mass. A comparison with theoretical models provides important constraints on which physical processes, such as metal mixing, star formation or feedback recipes, are important in reproducing the observations. Additionally, these galaxies exhibit star formation rates that are higher by a factor of a few to tens compared to extrapolated relations at similar redshifts or theoretical predictions of main-sequence galaxies, pointing to a recent burst of star formation. All these observations are indicative of highly stochastic star formation and ISM enrichment, expected in these low-mass systems, suggesting that feedback mechanisms in high-z dwarf galaxies might be different from those in place at higher masses.

Galaxy protoclusters are sites of rapid growth, with a high density of massive galaxies driving elevated rates of star formation and accretion onto supermassive black holes. Here, we present new JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of the J1000+0234 group at z=4.54, a dense region of a protocluster hosting a massive, dusty star forming galaxy (DSFG). The new data reveal two extended, high-equivalent-width (EW_0&gt;1000\r{A}) [O III] nebulae that appear at both sides of the DSFG along its minor axis (namely O3-N and O3-S). On one hand, the spectrum of O3-N shows a broad and blueshifted component with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 1300 km/s, suggesting an outflow origin. On the other hand, O3-S stretches over 8.6 kpc, and has a velocity gradient that spans 800 km/s, but shows no evidence of a broad component. However, both sources seem to be powered by an active galactic nucleus (AGN), so we classified them as extended emission-line regions (EELRs). The strongest evidence comes from the detection of the high-ionization [Ne V] \lambda 3427 line toward O3-N, which paired with the lack of hard X-rays implies an obscuring column density above the Compton-thick regime. The [Ne V] line is not detected in O3-S, but we measure a He II \lambda 4687/H\beta=0.25, which is well above the expectation for star formation. Despite the remarkable alignment of O3-N and O3-S with two radio sources, we do not find evidence of shocks from a radio jet that could be powering the EELRs. We interpret this as O3-S being externally irradiated by the AGN, akin to the famous Hanny's Voorwerp object in the local Universe. In addition, classical line ratio diagnostics (e.g., [O III]/H\beta vs [N II]/H\alpha) put the DSFG itself in the AGN region of the diagrams, and therefore suggest it to be the most probable AGN host. These results showcase the ability of JWST to unveil obscured AGN at high redshifts.

### 110) [2407.12122](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12122v2): Observable and ionizing properties of star-forming galaxies with very massive stars and different IMFs

<p> D. Schaerer, J. Guibert, R. Marques-Chaves, F. Martins </p>
<p>
The presence of very massive stars (VMS, masses &gt;100 M_{\odot}) is now firmly established in the local group, nearby galaxies, and out to cosmological distances. If present, these stars could boost the UV luminosity and ionizing photon production of galaxies, helping thus to alleviate the overabundance of UV-bright galaxies found with the JWST at high-redshift. Combing consistent stellar evolution and atmosphere models tailored to VMS we compute spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for a large set of models. We find that VMS contribute significantly to the UV luminosity and Lyman continuum of young stellar populations, and they are characterized by strong stellar HeII1640 emission, with EW(HeII) up to 4-8 Ang at young ages or ~ 2.5-4 Ang for constant SFR. For IMFs with a Salpeter slope, the boost of the UV luminosity is relatively modest. However, small changes in the IMF slope (e.g.~from \alpha_2=-2.35 to -2) lead to large increases in L_{UV} and the ionizing photon production Q. Emission line strengths and the ionizing photon efficiency \xi_{\rm ion} are also increased with VMS. Interestingly, SEDs including VMS show smaller Lyman breaks, and the shape of the ionizing spectra remain unaltered up to ~ 35 eV, but becomes softer at higher energies. We derive and discuss the maximum values quantities such as L_{UV} per stellar mass or unit SFR, and \xi_{\rm ion}, Q can reach when VMS are included, and we show that these values become essentially independent of the IMF. We propose observational methods to test for VMS and constrain the IMF. Finally, using JWST observations, we examine if high-redshift galaxies show some evidence of the presence of VMS and signs of non-standard IMFs. Very top-heavy IMFs can be excluded on average, but the IMF could well extend into the regime of VMS and be flatter than Salpeter in the bulk of high-z galaxies. (abridged)

<p>
We present a full analysis of galaxy major merger pair fractions, merger rates, and mass accretion rates, thus uncovering the role of mergers in galaxy formation at the earliest previously unexplored epoch of 4.5&lt;z&lt;11.5. We target galaxies with masses \log_{10}(\mathrm{M}_*/\mathrm{M}_\odot) = 8.0 - 10.0, utilizing data from eight JWST Cycle-1 fields (CEERS, JADES GOODS-S, NEP-TDF, NGDEEP, GLASS, El-Gordo, SMACS-0723, MACS-0416), covering an unmasked area of 189.36 \mathrm{arcmin}^2. We develop a new probabilistic pair-counting methodology that integrates full photometric redshift posteriors and corrects for detection incompleteness to quantify close pairs with physical projected separations between 20 and 50 kpc. Our analysis reveals an increase in pair fractions up to z = 8, reaching 0.211 \pm 0.065, followed by a statistically flat evolution to z = 11.5. We find that the galaxy merger rate increases from the local Universe up to z = 6 and then stabilizes at a value of ~ 6 Gyr^{-1} up to z = 11.5. We fit both a power-law and a power-law + exponential model to our pair fraction and merger rate redshift evolution, finding that the latter model describes the trends more accurately, particularly at z = 8.0 - 11.5. In addition, we measure that the average galaxy increases its stellar mass due to mergers by a factor of 2.77 \pm 0.99 from redshift z = 10.5 to z = 5.0. Lastly, we investigate the impact of mergers on galaxy stellar mass growth, revealing that mergers contribute 71 \pm 25&percnt; as much to galaxy stellar mass increases as star formation from gas. This indicates that mergers drive about half of galaxy assembly at high redshift.

### 112) [2407.02674](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02674v2): Elevated UV luminosity density at Cosmic Dawn explained by non-evolving, weakly mass-dependent star formation efficiency

<p>
Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered unexpectedly high cosmic star formation activity in the early Universe, mere hundreds of millions of years after the Big Bang. These observations are often understood to reflect an evolutionary shift in star formation efficiency (SFE) caused by changing galactic conditions during these early epochs. We present FIREbox-HR, a high-resolution, cosmological hydrodynamical simulation from the Feedback in Realistic Environments project, which offers insights into the SFE of galaxies during the first billion years of cosmic time. FIREbox-HR re-simulates the cosmic volume (L = 22.1 cMpc) of the original FIREbox run with eight times higher mass resolution (m_b ~ 7800 M_sun), but with identical physics, down to z ~ 6. FIREbox-HR predicts ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions in good agreement with available observational data. The simulation also successfully reproduces the observed cosmic UV luminosity density at z ~ 6 - 14, demonstrating that relatively high star formation activity in the early Universe is a natural outcome of the baryonic processes encoded in the FIRE-2 model. According to FIREbox-HR, the SFE - halo mass relation for intermediate mass halos (M_halo ~ 10^9 - 10^11 M_sun) does not significantly evolve with redshift and is only weakly mass-dependent. These properties of the SFE - halo mass relation lead to a larger contribution from lower mass halos at higher z, driving the gradual evolution of the observed cosmic UV luminosity density. A theoretical model based on the SFE - halo mass relation inferred from FIREbox-HR allows us to explore implications for galaxy evolution. Future observations of UV faint galaxies at z &gt; 12 will provide an opportunity to further test these predictions and deepen our understanding of star formation during Cosmic Dawn.

We present the number densities and physical properties of the bright galaxies spectroscopically confirmed at z~7-14. Our sample is composed of 60 galaxies at z_\mathrm{spec}~7-14, including recently-confirmed galaxies at z_\mathrm{spec}=12.34-14.32 with JWST, as well as new confirmations at z_\mathrm{spec}=6.583-7.643 with -24&lt; M_\mathrm{UV}&lt; -21 mag using ALMA and Keck. Our JWST/NIRSpec observations have also revealed that very bright galaxy candidates at z~10-13 identified from ground-based telescope images before JWST are passive galaxies at z~3-4, emphasizing the necessity of strict screening and spectroscopy in the selection of the brightest galaxies at z&gt;10. The UV luminosity functions derived from these spectroscopic results are consistent with a double power-law function, showing tensions with theoretical models at the bright end. To understand the origin of the overabundance of bright galaxies, we investigate their morphologies using JWST/NIRCam high-resolution images obtained in various surveys including PRIMER and COSMOS-Web. We find that ~70&percnt; of the bright galaxies at z~7 exhibit clumpy morphologies with multiple sub-components, suggesting merger-induced starburst activity, which is consistent with SED fitting results showing bursty star formation histories. At z\gtrsim10, bright galaxies are classified into two types of galaxies; extended ones with weak high-ionization emission lines, and compact ones with strong high-ionization lines including NIV]\lambda1486, indicating that at least two different processes (e.g., merger-induced starburst and compact star formation/AGN) are shaping the physical properties of the brightest galaxies at z\gtrsim10 and are responsible for their overabundance.

### 114) [2406.06672](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06672v2): The Manhattan Suite: Accelerated galaxy evolution in the early Universe

<p> Douglas Rennehan </p>
<p>
Observational advances have allowed the detection of galaxies, protoclusters, and galaxy clusters at higher and higher redshifts, opening a new view into extreme galaxy evolution. I present an argument that the high redshift, massive galaxies discovered over the last decade are really the most massive galaxies within protocluster-cores of galaxy clusters at z~2, and that they are the partial descendants of same galaxies discovered by JWST at z~9. To that end, I present \textit{The Manhattan Suite}, a set of 100 high resolution zoom-in simulations of the most massive galaxy clusters, out to 9\,R_\mathrm{vir}, selected at z = 2 from a (1.5\,\mathrm{cGpc})^3 parent volume, and simulated using the \textit{Simba} model. Unlike other cluster suites, my selection at z = 2 ensures that these systems are biased in a similar fashion to observations, in that they should be the brightest and the most massive by construction at z \gtrsim 2. I show that my sample is able to reproduce extremely star-bursting protoclusters such as SPT2349-56, high redshift galaxy clusters XLSSC122 and JKCS0249, and the wealth of massive (sometimes quenched) galaxies at z \gtrsim 3 and up to z ~ 9. I argue that these systems are intimately linked, and represent the same evolutionary history.

### 115) [2406.04437](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04437v2): Halfway to the Peak: The JWST MIRI 5.6 micron number counts and source population

<p> Leonid Sajkov, Anna Sajina, Alexandra Pope, Stacey Alberts, Lee Armus, Duncan Farrah, Jamie Lin, Danilo Marchesini, Jed McKinney, Sylvain Veilleux, Lin Yan, Jason Young </p>
<p>
We present an analysis of eight JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) 5.6 micron images with 5\,\sigma depths of ~0.1 uJy. We detect 2854 sources within our combined area of 18.4 square arcminutes. We compute the MIRI 5.6um number counts including an analysis of the field-to-field variation. Compared to earlier published MIRI 5.6 um counts, our counts have a more pronounced knee, at roughly 2 uJy. The location and amplitude of the counts at the knee are consistent with the Cowley et al. (2018) model predictions, although these models tend to overpredict the counts below the knee. In areas of overlap, 84% of the MIRI sources have a counterpart in the COSMOS2020 catalog. These MIRI sources have redshifts that are mostly in the z~0.5-2, with a tail out to z~5. They are predominantly moderate to low stellar masses (10^8-10^{10}M_{\odot}) main sequence star-forming galaxies, suggesting that with ~2hr exposures, MIRI can reach well below M^* at cosmic noon and reach higher mass systems out to z~5. Nearly 70% of the COSMOS2020 sources in areas of overlap now have a data point at 5.6um (rest-frame near-IR at cosmic noon) which allows for more accurate stellar population parameter estimates. Finally, we discover 31 MIRI-bright sources not present in COSMOS2020. A cross-match with IRAC channel 1 suggests that 10-20% of these are likely lower mass (M_*\approx10^9M_{\odot}), z~1 dusty galaxies. The rest (80--90%) are consistent with more massive but still very dusty galaxies at z&gt;3.

### 116) [2406.02672](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02672v2): A comparison of pre-existing ΛCDM predictions with the abundance of {\it JWST} galaxies at high redshift

<p> Shengdong Lu, Carlos S. Frenk, Sownak Bose, Cedric G. Lacey, Shaun Cole, Carlton M. Baugh, John C. Helly </p>
<p>
Observations with the {\it James Webb Space Telescope} have revealed a high abundance of bright galaxies at redshift, z\gtrsim 12, which has been widely interpreted as conflicting with the \LambdaCDM model. In Cowley et al. (2018) predictions were made -- prior to the {\it JWST} observations -- for the expected abundance of these galaxies using the Durham semi-analytic galaxy formation model, {\sc galform}, which is known to produce a realistic population of galaxies at lower redshifts including the present day. Key to this model is the assumption of a ``top-heavy" initial mass function of stars formed in bursts (required to explain the number counts and redshift distribution of sub-millimetre galaxies). Here, we compare the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity functions derived from {\it JWST} observations with those predicted by the Cowley et al. model up to z=14 and make further predictions for z=16. We find that below z~ 10, the Cowley et al. predictions agree very well with observations, while agreement at z\gtrsim12 requires extending the model to take into account the timescale for the growth of obscuring dust grains at these very early times and its dependence on gas metallicity. We trace the evolution of these galaxies from z=14 to z=0 and find that their descendants typically reside in halos with a median mass 2.5\times 10^{13}\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}. The stellar masses of the descendants range from 3.2\times 10^{6}\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}} to 3.2\times 10^{11}\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}. Although these galaxies were all central galaxies at z=14, over half of their descendants end up as satellites in massive halos.

### 117) [2405.00504](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00504v2): JWST meets Chandra: a large population of Compton thick, feedback-free, and intrinsically X-ray weak AGN, with a sprinkle of SNe

We investigate the X-ray properties of a sample of 71 broad line and narrow line AGN at 2&lt;z&lt;11 discovered by JWST in the GOODS fields, which have the deepest Chandra observations ever obtained. Despite the widespread presence of AGN signatures in their rest-optical and -UV spectra, the vast majority of them is X-ray undetected. The stacked X-ray data of the non-detected sources also results in a non-detection. The upper limit on the X-ray emission for many of these AGN is one or even two orders of magnitude lower than expected from a standard AGN SED. X-ray absorption by clouds with large (Compton-thick) column density and low dust content, such as the Broad Line Region (BLR) clouds, can explain the X-ray weakness. In this scenario the BLR covering factor should be much larger than in low-z AGN or luminous quasars; this is supported by the larger equivalent width of the broad component of H\alpha in JWST-selected AGN. We also find that the JWST-discovered AGN lack prominent, fast outflows, suggesting that, in JWST-selected AGN, dense gas lingers in the nuclear region, resulting in large covering factors. We also note that a large fraction of JWST-selected AGN matches the definition of NLSy1, typically accreting at high rates and characterized by a steep X-ray spectrum -- this can further contribute to their observed weakness at high-z. Finally, we discuss that the broad Balmer lines used to identify type 1 AGN cannot be ascribed to Very Massive Stars or Supernovae, although we show that some of the faintest broad lines could potentially be associated with superluminous SNe.

### 118) [2404.17945](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17945v2): Widespread rapid quenching at cosmic noon revealed by JWST deep spectroscopy

Massive quiescent galaxies in the young universe are expected to be quenched rapidly, but it is unclear whether they all experience starbursts before quenching and what physical mechanism drives rapid quenching. We study 14 massive quiescent galaxies (\log(M_\star/M_\odot) &gt; 10) at z~2 selected from a representative sample of the Blue Jay survey. We reconstruct their star formation histories by fitting spectral energy distribution models to the JWST/NIRSpec R~1000 spectra. We find that massive quiescent galaxies can be split into three categories with roughly equal numbers of galaxies according to their SFHs: 1) Relatively old galaxies quenched at early epochs; 2) Galaxies that are rapidly and recently quenched after a flat or bursty formation history (depending on the assumed prior); 3) Galaxies that are rapidly and recently quenched after a major starburst. Most recently quenched galaxies show neutral gas outflows, probed by blueshifted \rm Na\,I\,D absorption, and ionized gas emission, with line ratios consistent with active galactic nucleus (AGN) diagnostics. This suggests that AGN activity drives multi-phase gas outflows, leading to rapid quenching. By tracing back the SFHs of the entire sample, we predict the number density of massive quiescent galaxies at z=4-6: n=(1.5-6.0)\times10^{-5}\,\rm Mpc^{-3}. The two old massive quiescent galaxies in our sample appear to have extremely early formation and quenching (z\gtrsim6), possibly descendants of early post-starbursts at z&gt;3. These galaxies still show neutral gas reservoirs and weak H\alpha emission, perhaps because the ejective AGN feedback that caused rapid quenching has weakened over time.

<p>
\require{mediawiki-texvc}Given the sensitivity of the resonant Lyman-\mathrm{\alpha} (Ly\mathrm{\alpha}) transition to absorption by neutral hydrogen, observations of Ly\mathrm{\alpha} emitting galaxies (LAEs) have been widely used to probe the ionising capabilities of reionisation-era galaxies and their impact on the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, prior to JWST our understanding of the contribution of fainter sources and of ionised `bubbles' at earlier stages of reionisation remained uncertain. Here, we present the characterisation of three exceptionally distant LAEs at z&gt;8, newly discovered by JWST/NIRSpec in the JADES survey. These three similarly bright (M_\text{UV} \approx -20\,\mathrm{mag}) LAEs exhibit small Ly\mathrm{\alpha} velocity offsets from the systemic redshift, \Delta v_\mathrm{Ly\alpha} \lesssim 200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}, yet span a range of Ly\mathrm{\alpha} equivalent widths (15\,&#8491;, 31\,&#8491;, and 132\,&#8491;). The former two show moderate Ly\mathrm{\alpha} escape fractions (f_\mathrm{esc,Ly\alpha} \approx 10&percnt;), whereas Ly\mathrm{\alpha} escapes remarkably efficiently from the third (f_\mathrm{esc,Ly\alpha} \approx 72&percnt;), which moreover is very compact (half-light radius of 90\pm10\,\mathrm{pc}). We find these LAEs are low-mass galaxies dominated by very recent, vigorous bursts of star formation accompanied by strong nebular emission from metal-poor gas. We infer the two LAEs with modest f_\mathrm{esc,Ly\alpha}, one of which reveals evidence for ionisation by an active galactic nucleus, may have reasonably produced small ionised bubbles preventing complete IGM absorption of Ly\mathrm{\alpha}. The third, however, requires a ~ 3\,\text{physical Mpc} bubble, indicating faint galaxies have contributed significantly. The most distant LAEs thus continue to be powerful observational probes into the earlier stages of reionisation.

Willner </p>
<p>
The first James Webb Space Telescope ({\it JWST}) Near InfraRed Camera (NIRCam) imaging in the field of the galaxy cluster PLCK G165.7+67.0 (z=0.35) uncovered a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) at z=1.78, called ``SN H0pe." Three different images of this one SN were detected as a result of strong gravitational lensing, each one traversing a different path in spacetime, thereby inducing a relative delay in the arrival of each image. Follow-up {\it JWST} observations of all three SN images enabled photometric and rare spectroscopic measurements of the two relative time delays. Following strict blinding protocols which oversaw a live unblinding and regulated post-unblinding changes, these two measured time delays were compared to the predictions of seven independently constructed cluster lens models to measure a value for the Hubble constant, H_0=71.8^{+9.2}_{-8.1} km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}. The range of admissible H_0 values predicted across the lens models limits further precision, reflecting the well-known degeneracies between lens model constraints and time delays. It has long been theorized that a way forward is to leverage a standard candle, but this has not been realized until now. For the first time, the lens models are evaluated by their agreement with the SN absolute magnifications, breaking degeneracies and producing our best estimate, H_0=75.7^{+8.1}_{-5.5} km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}. This is the first precision measurement of H_0 from a multiply-imaged SN Ia and only the second from any multiply-imaged SN.

### 121) [2403.07103](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07103v2): Between the Extremes: A JWST Spectroscopic Benchmark for High-redshift Galaxies Using ~500 Confirmed Sources at z\geqslant5

<p>
The exceptional spectra of the most luminous z&gt;10 sources observed so far have challenged our understanding of early galaxy evolution, requiring a new observational benchmark for meaningful interpretation. As such, we construct spectroscopic templates representative of high-redshift, star-forming populations, using 482 confirmed sources at z=5.0-12.9 with JWST/NIRSpec prism observations, and report on their average properties. We find z=5-11 galaxies are dominated by blue UV continuum slopes (\beta=-2.3 to -2.7) and reduced Balmer indices, characteristic of dust-poor and young systems, with a shift towards bluer slopes and younger ages with redshift. The evolution is mirrored by ubiquitous CIII] detections across all redshifts (rest-frame equivalent widths of =5-14 \r{A}), which increase in strength towards early times. Rest-frame optical lines reveal elevated ratios (O32=7-31, R23=5-8, and Ne3O2=1-2) and subsolar metallicities (log O/H=7.3-7.9), typical of ionization conditions and metallicities rarely observed in z~0 populations. Within our sample, we identify 57 Ly\alpha emitters, which we stack and compare to a matched sample of nonemitters. The former are characterized by more extreme ionizing conditions with enhanced CIII], CIV, and HeII+[OIII] line emission, younger stellar populations from Balmer jumps, and a more pristine interstellar medium seen through bluer UV slopes and elevated rest-frame optical line ratios. The novel comparison illustrates important intrinsic differences between the two populations, with implications for Ly\alpha visibility. The spectral templates derived here represent a new observational benchmark with which to interpret high-redshift sources, lifting our constraints on their global properties to unprecedented heights and extending out to the earliest of cosmic times.

<p>
The JWST discovery of ``little red dots'' (LRDs) is reshaping our picture of the early Universe, yet the physical mechanisms driving their compact size and UV-optical colors remain elusive. Here we report an unusually bright LRD (z=3.1) observed as part of the RUBIES program. This LRD exhibits broad emission lines (FWHM ~4000km/s), a blue UV continuum, a clear Balmer break and a red continuum sampled out to rest 4 &mu;m with MIRI. We develop a new joint galaxy and AGN model within the Prospector Bayesian inference framework and perform spectrophotometric modeling using NIRCam, MIRI, and NIRSpec/Prism observations. Our fiducial model reveals a M_*~ 10^9M_\odot galaxy alongside a dust-reddened AGN driving the optical emission. Explaining the rest-frame optical color as a reddened AGN requires A_{\rm v}\gtrsim4, suggesting that a great majority of the accretion disk energy is re-radiated as dust emission. Yet despite clear AGN signatures, we find a surprising lack of hot torus emission, which implies that either the dust emission in this object must be cold, or the red continuum must instead be driven by a massive, evolved stellar population of the host galaxy -- seemingly inconsistent with the high EW broad lines (H\alpha EW ~800&#8491;). The widths and luminosities of Pa\beta, Pa\delta, Pa\gamma, and H\alpha imply a modest black hole mass of M_{\rm BH}~10^8M_\odot. Additionally, we identify a narrow blue-shifted HeI absorption in G395M spectra, signaling an ionized outflow with kinetic energy up to ~1&percnt; the luminosity of the AGN. The low redshift of RUBIES-BLAGN-1 combined with the depth and richness of the JWST imaging and spectroscopic observations provide a unique opportunity to build a physical model for these so-far mysterious LRDs, which may prove to be a crucial phase in the early formation of massive galaxies and their supermassive black holes.

### 123) [2402.18773](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18773v2): Physical Pathways for JWST-Observed Supermassive Black Holes in the Early Universe

<p> Junehyoung Jeon, Volker Bromm, Boyuan Liu, Steven L. Finkelstein </p>
<p>
Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed active galactic nuclei (AGN) powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with estimated masses of 10^7-10^8 M_\odot at redshifts z~7-9. Some reside in overmassive systems with higher AGN to stellar mass ratios than locally. Understanding how massive black holes could form so early in cosmic history and affect their environment to establish the observed relations today are some of the major open questions in astrophysics and cosmology. One model to create these massive objects is through direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) that provide massive seeds (~10^5-10^6 M_\odot), able to reach high masses in the limited time available. We use the cosmological simulation code GIZMO to study the formation and growth of DCBH seeds in the early Universe. To grow the DCBHs, we implement a gas swallowing model set to match the Eddington accretion rate as long as the nearby gaseous environment, affected by stellar and accretion disk feedback, provides sufficient fuel. We find that to create massive AGN in overmassive systems at high redshifts, massive seeds accreting more efficiently than the fiducial Bondi-Hoyle model are needed. We assess whether the conditions for such enhanced accretion rates are realistic by considering limits on plausible transport mechanisms. We also examine various DCBH growth histories and find that mass growth is more sustained in overdense cosmological environments, where high gas densities are achieved locally. We discuss the exciting prospect to directly probe the assembly history of the first SMBHs with upcoming, ultra-deep JWST surveys.

<p>
We present the first Chandra X-ray observations of H72.97-69.39, a highly-embedded, potential super-star cluster (SSC) in its infancy located in the star-forming complex N79 of the Large Magellanic Cloud. We detect particularly hard, diffuse X-ray emission that is coincident with the young stellar objects (YSOs) identified with JWST, and the hot gas fills cavities in the dense gas mapped by ALMA. The X-ray spectra are best fit with either a thermal plasma or power-law model, and assuming the former, we show that the X-ray luminosity of L_X = (1.0 +- 0.3)e34 erg/s is a factor of ~20 below the expectation for a fully-confined wind bubble. Our results suggest that stellar wind feedback produces diffuse hot gas in the earliest stages of massive star cluster formation and that wind energy can be lost quickly via either turbulent mixing followed by radiative cooling or by physical leakage.

<p> Junchao Wang, Zhiqi Huang, Lu Huang, Jianqi Liu </p>
<p>
We develop a Python tool to estimate the tail distribution of the number of dark matter halos beyond a mass threshold and in a given volume in a light-cone. The code is based on the extended Press-Schechter model and is computationally efficient, typically taking a few seconds on a personal laptop for a given set of cosmological parameters. The high efficiency of the code allows a quick estimation of the tension between cosmological models and the red candidate massive galaxies released by the James Webb Space Telescope, as well as scanning the theory space with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. As an example application, we use the tool to study the cosmological implication of the candidate galaxies presented in Labb\'e et al. (2023). The standard \Lambda cold dark matter (\LambdaCDM) model is well consistent with the data if the star formation efficiency can reach ~ 0.3 at high redshift. For a low star formation efficiency \epsilon ~ 0.1, \LambdaCDM model is disfavored at ~ 2\sigma-3\sigma confidence level.

<p> Yi Xu, Masami Ouchi, Kimihiko Nakajima, Yuichi Harikane, Yuki Isobe, Yoshiaki Ono, Hiroya Umeda, Yechi Zhang </p>
<p>
We study outflows in 130 galaxies with -22&lt;MUV&lt;-16 at z=3-9 identified in JWST NIRSpec and NIRCam WFSS data taken by the ERO, CEERS, FRESCO, GLASS, and JADES programs. We identify 30 out of the 130 galaxies with broad components of FWHM~200-700 km/s in the emission lines of H{\alpha} and [OIII] that trace ionized outflows, and find no excesses from the star-formation main sequence. Four out of the 30 outflowing galaxies are Type 1 AGN whose H{\alpha} emission lines include line profile components as broad as FWHM&gt;1000 km/s. With the velocity shift and line widths of the outflow broad lines, we obtain ~80-500 km/s for the outflow velocities. We find that the outflow velocities as a function of star-formation rate are comparable to or higher than those of galaxies at z~1, accounting for the selection bias, while the outflow velocities of AGN are large but not significantly different from the others. Interestingly, these outflow velocities are typically not high enough to escape from the galactic potentials, suggestive of fountain-type outflows, which are concluded on the basis of thorough comparisons with recent JWST results. We estimate mass loading factors {\eta} to be 0.1-1 that are not particularly large, but comparable with those of z~1 outflows. The large fraction of galaxies with outflows (30% with high resolution data) provides constraints on outflow parameters, suggesting a wide opening angle of &gt;45 deg and a large duty-cycle of &gt;30%, which gives a picture of more frequent and spherical outflows in high-z galaxies.

Merger events can trigger gas accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) located at the centre of galaxies, and form close pairs of AGN. The fraction of AGN in pairs offers critical insights into the dynamics of galaxy interactions, SMBH growth, and their co-evolution with host galaxies. However, the identification of dual AGN is difficult, as it requires high-quality spatial and spectral data; hence, only very few pairs have been found in the distant Universe so far. This study aims to provide a first observational estimate of the fraction of dual AGN at 2&lt;z&lt;6 by analysing a sample of 16 AGN observed with JWST/NIRSpec IFS, as part of the GA-NIFS survey. For two AGN in our sample, we also incorporate archival VLT/MUSE data to expand the search area. We searched for nearby companion galaxies and emission-line sources within the ~20x20 kpc field of view of the NIRSpec data cubes, extending up to ~50 kpc using the MUSE data cubes. We analysed the spectra of such emitters to determine their physical and kinematic properties. We report the serendipitous discovery of a triple AGN and four dual AGN (two of which considered as candidates), with projected separations in the range 3-28 kpc. Their AGN classification is mainly based on standard optical emission line flux ratios, as observed with JWST/NIRSpec, and is complemented with additional multi-wavelength diagnostics. The identification of these 3-5 multiple AGN out of the 16 AGN systems in GA-NIFS (i.e. ~20-30%) suggests they might be more common than previously thought based on other observational campaigns. Moreover, our inferred fraction of dual AGN moderately exceeds predictions from cosmological simulations that mimic our observational criteria (~10%). This work highlights the exceptional capabilities of NIRSpec for detecting distant dual AGN, and prompts new investigations to constrain their fraction across cosmic time.

<p>
We study the co-evolution of dark matter halos, galaxies and supermassive black holes using an empirical galaxy evolution model from z=0 -- 10. We demonstrate that by connecting dark matter structure evolution with simple empirical prescriptions for baryonic processes, we are able to faithfully reproduce key observations in the relation between galaxies and their supermassive black holes. By assuming a physically-motivated, direct relationship between the galaxy and supermassive black hole properties to the mass of their host halo, we construct expressions for the galaxy stellar mass function, galaxy UV luminosity function, active black hole mass function and quasar bolometric luminosity function. We calibrate the baryonic prescriptions using a fully Bayesian approach in order to reproduce observed population statistics. The obtained parametrizations are then used to study the relation between galaxy and black hole properties, as well as their evolution with redshift. The galaxy stellar mass -- UV luminosity relation, black hole mass -- stellar mass relation, black hole mass -- AGN luminosity relation, and redshift evolution of these quantities obtained from the model are qualitatively consistent with observations. Based on these results, we present upper limits on the expected number of sources for z=5 up to z=15 for scheduled JWST and \textit{Euclid} surveys, thus showcasing that empirical models can offer qualitative as well as quantitative prediction in a fast, easy and flexible manner that complements more computationally expensive approaches.
