We present a spectroscopic study of photometrically identified extreme emission-line galaxies (EELGs) with observed-frame equivalent widths (EWs) &gt;5000 A of either H alpha or H beta + [OIII] in the CEERS legacy deep field utilizing JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy from the CAPERS, RUBIES, THRILS and CEERS surveys. This master sample allows for performance tests of photometric selections and unveils what types of sources, either AGN or young star formation, were producing excessive ionizing radiation in the early Universe. We identify AGN through broad H alpha emission-lines and report 6 new broad-line AGN at 3.5&lt;z&lt;7 identified by the deep (~8 hr) G395M THRILS survey. We investigate the photometrically selected EELGs in a color-color plot designed for "Little Red Dot'' selection and demonstrate that it effectively removes AGN with non-extreme lines from the sample. EELGs with and without broad lines show similar optical line ratios. We compare emission-line morphology to EWs and continuum morphologies and find that [OIII] morphology is more compact at higher EW. ~10% of photometrically selected EELGs have broad Balmer lines, jumping to 35% in deep spectroscopy which indicates a significant fraction of photometrically selected EELGs may host AGN. However, many AGN selected as EELGs have incorrectly high photometric EWs. For sources with extreme emission-line EWs that pass our photometric criteria and host an AGN, we find that the narrow H alpha component dominates over the broad, especially in the highest-EW sources. This implies that even when an AGN is present, it does not dominate the extreme emission.

### 2) [2602.22386](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22386v1): Little Red Dots as Obscured Little Blue Dots: A Super-Eddington Unification Model

<p> Piero Madau, Roberto Maiolino </p>
<p>
We test whether "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) are dust-reddened, high-inclination counterparts of compact, blue broad-line AGNs ("Little Blue Dots", LBDs) powered by super-Eddington accretion. We model the central engine as a geometrically thick, radiation-pressure supported accretion flow whose funnel yields strongly anisotropic, intrinsically blue ionizing continua, coupled to an equatorially concentrated BLR and a dusty screen with modest covering factor. Using inclination-dependent SEDs as input to Cloudy, we show that the extreme broad Halpha equivalent widths (EWs) of JWST LRDs are reproduced with global BLR covering factors of only 15%, consistent with standard Type 1 AGNs. Large Balmer EWs arise because self-shadowing suppresses the high-inclination optical continuum while the BLR is illuminated by an EUV-rich SED. Weak high-ionization lines follow from orientation-dependent suppression of the XUV/soft X-ray continuum toward equatorial directions, without requiring a fully enclosing gaseous "cocoon". With a gray attenuation law of AV = 2.8 along LRD-selected sightlines, the fiducial model matches the V-shaped UV-optical continua and large Balmer decrements; strong Balmer breaks occur only for the most obscured views. A compact equatorial dust component tied to the BLR and normalized by energy conservation intercepts and reradiates only a small fraction of Lbol, producing a modest hot-dust bump and far-IR/sub-mm emission consistent with current limits and implying small dust masses. The model unifies LRD and LBD observables via orientation, predicting correlated trends in Halpha EW, Balmer decrement, Balmer break, high-ionization line strengths, and IR emission.

### 3) [2602.22366](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22366v1): Detection of CO<sub>2</sub> ice in the planetary nebula NGC 6302

Sterling, Jeremy R. Walsh, L. B. F. M. Waters, Albert Zijlstra </p>
<p>
Using JWST/MIRI observations, we report the detection of CO<sub>2</sub> ice in the dusty torus of the planetary nebula NGC 6302, an environment generally considered hostile to fragile molecular species and ices due to intense UV irradiation. This detection accompanies cold (20-50 K) gas-phase CO<sub>2</sub> along the same sightlines. The ice absorption profile exhibits a double-peak profile, a characteristic of pure, crystalline CO<sub>2</sub> ice. The CO<sub>2</sub> gas-to-ice ratio is more than an order of magnitude higher than in young stellar objects, pointing to distinct ice formation or processing mechanisms in evolved stellar environments. This discovery demonstrates that the dusty torus provides sufficient shielding to harbour ice chemistry, and that ice-mediated surface reactions must be incorporated into chemical models of planetary nebulae.

### 4) [2602.22305](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22305v1): You can't see me: super-Eddington growth hindering X-ray detection in high-z broad-line AGNs

<p> Alessandro Trinca, Alessandro Lupi, Francesco Haardt, Piero Madau </p>
<p>
We revisit black hole mass estimates for high-redshift broad-line AGNs discovered with JWST by jointly analysing their broad emission lines and their systematic non-detections in deep Chandra imaging. Building upon the self-shadowed, super-Eddington accretion flow framework and the coronal over-cooling prescription of Madau & Haardt (2024), we couple funnel-dependent Comptonization physics with slim-disc spectra from Kubota & Done (2019) and explore the resulting parameter space through a full MCMC inference. Using the sample analysed by Lupi et al. (2024) and Maiolino et al. (2025), we show that X-ray weakness - manifested as extreme bolometric corrections, suppressed 2-10 keV luminosities, and non-detections in the 0.5-5 keV Chandra band - naturally arises when the corona is confined and radiatively over-cooled inside a narrow super-Eddington funnel. The combined broad line+X-ray analysis yields strongly bimodal posteriors: either very massive, very low-Eddington black holes (physically disfavoured), or a population of low-mass (~ 10^6-10^7 ~M<sub>&odot;</sub>) black holes accreting at f_Edd \gg 1. The latter solution is strongly preferred for nearly all objects and returns masses consistent with, or lower than, local M_BH-M_star relations, mitigating the extreme mass ratios implied by single-epoch virial estimators. The predicted intrinsic spectra are redder and exhibit reduced hard-X-ray output but higher bolometric luminosities, implying bolometric corrections larger than those typical of the local AGN population, yet consistent with low-redshift highly accreting counterparts. These results support a picture in which many JWST broad-line AGNs are powered by rapidly growing, super-Eddington black holes whose suppressed coronal emission and self-shadowed BLR geometry combine to mimic overmassive black holes at z ≳ 6.

### 5) [2602.21329](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21329v1): FRESCO: Constraining Dust Attenuation and Star-Formation Rates of z~ 2 Star-Forming Galaxies with JWST Paschen and Ground-Based Balmer Emission Line Observations

<p> Michael A. Wozniak, Naveen A. Reddy, Pascal A. Oesch, Ivan Kramarenko, Jorryt Matthee, Chloe Neufeld, Irene Shivaei, Bahram Mobasher, Alice E. Shapley, Brian Siana </p>
<p>
We present new constraints on dust attenuation and star-formation rates (SFRs) for 77 galaxies at redshifts z=1.43-2.65, using Paschen emission line detections from the JWST FRESCO survey and ground-based Balmer line measurements from the MOSDEF survey. Using nebular and continuum emission maps, we find that Paschen emission covers a smaller area than continuum emission observed in the F210M (2.1 μm; rest-frame optical) and F444W (4.4 μm; rest-frame near-IR) bands, and is preferentially located toward galaxy outskirts. These results suggest that current star formation is concentrated in regions farther from galaxy centers than older stellar populations traced by the continuum, indicative of inside-out star formation. With a careful accounting of slit-loss corrections for ground-based measurements, we calculate nebular reddening and dust-corrected SFRs using the Balmer decrement (Hα/Hβ) and Paschen-to-Balmer line ratios (Paα/Hα and Paβ/Hα), assuming the Milky Way extinction curve. On average, Paschen-derived reddening and SFRs agree with Balmer-derived values; however, two galaxies exhibit significantly higher Paschen reddening and four show significantly higher Paschen SFRs. We find that non-unity dust covering fractions bias the Balmer decrement toward less reddened OB associations, while decrements involving the Paschen lines are less affected by this bias. These results highlight the enhanced sensitivity of the Paschen lines to the most heavily obscured OB associations in z~2 galaxies, particularly in galaxies with patchy dust geometries. Future studies using Paschen lines exclusively to measure nebular reddening will yield more robust constraints on the dustiest star-forming regions.

### 6) [2602.21205](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21205v1): The JWST Resolved Stellar Populations Early Release Science Program. IX. The RR Lyrae Population in WLM with HST and JWST

<p>
RR Lyrae stars are a common, dependable Population II distance indicator, and provide an independent tracer of early star formation. Here, we utilize archival HST/ACS and JWST/NIRCam observations of the nearby dwarf star-forming galaxy WLM to study RR Lyrae in JWST filters. We independently identify RR Lyrae in HST and JWST imaging in order to evaluate JWST's efficacy at characterizing RR Lyrae in the near-IR. We use an MCMC template-fitting technique to obtain periods, amplitudes, and mean magnitudes from the RR Lyrae time-series data. The spatially overlapping HST and JWST observations allow us to directly compare the same sources observed with the instruments, and calibrate the NIRCam F090W and F150W RR Lyrae period-Wesenheit-metallicity (PWZ) relation to the Gaia-consistent HST PWZ. We additionally assess the epoch-to-epoch consistency of NIRCam photometry, and find evidence of burn-in. We conclude that the zero-point offset is negligible compared to the uncertainties from the template fitting. We conduct an MCMC fit of the PWZ with both HST and JWST data. Our results are three-fold. First, we find that we can reliably identify RR Lyrae in NIRCam data, but light-curve template fitting proves difficult on short-baseline observations. Second, the HST PWZ fit yields a distance modulus to WLM of μ= 24.85±0.05 (0.93±0.02 Mpc). This is closer than previous measurements, primarily attributed to consistency with the Gaia scale. Lastly, although the JWST PWZ fit has large uncertainties and a poorly-constrained slope, it represents a first-of-its-kind PWZ calibration in NIRCam filters.

### 7) [2602.21084](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21084v1): MHD Simulations of Strongly Magnetized HII Region Evolution: Evidence for Ionized Gas Filamentation

<p> Samuel Crowe, Yisheng Tu, Zhi-Yun Li, Jeong-Gyu Kim, John Bally </p>
<p>
Recent JWST observations of HII regions in the Central Molecular Zone have shown a highly filamentary morphology distinct from HII regions in other parts of the galaxy. We present magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of strongly magnetized (plasma-β &lt;&lt; 1) HII region evolution that investigate and describe the formation of these ionized gas filaments. HII region evolution has been simulated in a 30 pc^3 box, in distinct models with pre-placed overdensities in the ambient medium and overdensities that have been generated with driven turbulence. We find that when these overdensities are seeded in the ambient medium before the birth of the ionizing source, the photoionized plasma stripped off of these dense blobs is funneled into long filaments along the magnetic field lines. The length and emission measure of these ionized gas filaments are similar to the filaments observed in the Central Molecular Zone. Given that these filaments are effectively magnetically-confined flows of photoionized gas, their density and curvature are influenced by the density of the blob and the geometry of the configuration.

### 8) [2602.20898](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20898v1): XRISM Discovery of Multiple Ionized Fe-K Emission and Absorption Components in Centaurus A

<p>
We present the first clear detection of ionized Fe-K emission and absorption components in the nearby radio galaxy Centaurus A, revealed by the high-resolution XRISM/Resolve detector. In the 6.5-6.9 keV band, XRISM reveals multiple Fe XXV and Fe XXVI emission components. One is a broad (with a width of sigma = 3000 km/s) and redshifted (+3400 km/s) component, originating at D = 0.02 pc from the central black hole. The other two components are narrow (with a width of sigma = 500 km/s) and exhibit redshifted and blueshifted velocities (+2600 km/s and -1500 km/s), originating from more distant regions (D = 0.1 pc). The photo-ionized model explains the broader component, while the two narrower components can be explained by either photo-ionization or collisional ionization. One interpretation is that the broader component is an outflow at ~10^2 R_S (R_S; Schwarzschild radius) and the narrow component is a shock-heated plasma close to the torus, with a possible connection to the JWST-discovered outflow outside the torus. Two blueshifted absorption lines are detected at ~7.1 keV (~10^4 km/s) and ~10.6 keV (~10^5 km/s). The line significance of the 10.6 keV line is above 98%. The absorption line components might be attributed to the broad emission component. These results demonstrate the high potential of XRISM/Resolve to characterize ionized emission and absorption features in the Fe-K band. Our findings establish a new benchmark in the study of circumnuclear environments in low-luminosity radio galaxies, thereby contributing to a broader understanding of AGN unification.

### 9) [2602.20374](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20374v1): First Observation of CO<sub>2</sub> Emission and foreground absorption Toward the Galactic Center with JWST

<p>
CO<sub>2</sub> is an important, stable, and abundant molecule in the Universe, but it is very difficult to detect because it has no observable pure rotational transitions. The unique sensitivity and resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) provide a fresh way to investigate it. CO<sub>2</sub> is typically found in the solid phase (ice) on grain mantles in dense molecular clouds, but is less commonly detected in the gas phase (compared to common molecules such as CO and H<sub>2</sub>O) and has mostly been found in protostellar and proto-planetary environments. Here, we report and characterize the first observations of gas-phase CO<sub>2</sub> absorption toward two IR-bright regions of the Galactic Center, thanks to the high sensitivity of JWST. Using an LTE model we find a CO<sub>2</sub> gas excitation temperature between 20 and 50~K, a column density around 2×10^15~cm<sup>2</sup> and a radial velocity consistent with 0. We also report: 1) simultaneous detections of C_2H<sub>2</sub> and HCN absorption bands (near 13.7 and 14.0 μm, respectively), with column densitiy ratios of 1:3 and 3:2 with respect to gas-phase CO<sub>2</sub>, and 2) CO<sub>2</sub> ice absorption with a ice-to-gas ratio of 90, consistent with previous findings. We conclude that the absorbing medium is likely in the foreground, most likely from one or more somewhat clumpy cloud(s), located between 0.15 and 4~kpc away from Earth. Additionally, we detected point-like CO<sub>2</sub> emission likely associated with a Galactic Center star (IRS~11SW), which is also spatially coincident with a previously reported X-ray source, raising the possibility that the system is a symbiotic binary.

We compile JWST/NIRSpec prism and MIRI data for 249 Little Red Dots (LRDs) at 2.3&lt;z&lt;9.3, forming a representative spectroscopic subset of NIRCam-selected LRDs. We derive a median stacked spectrum covering rest-frame 0.09-1.2 μm, with MIRI photometry extending the spectral energy distribution to 4 μm. Four additional stacks for subsamples defined by optical-to-UV luminosity ratios show that LRDs form a heterogeneous population spanning diverse continuum slopes and line properties. Assuming LRDs host super-massive black holes (BHs) surrounded by dense gas clouds, and stars accompany this core, we infer masses of M_BH~10^6.0-6.5~M<sub>&odot;</sub> and M_\bigstar~10^8.3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, corresponding to BH-to-stellar mass ratios of 1-2%. The stacks show ubiquitous UV and optical FeII emission, indicating a direct view of the broad-line region and high (but sub-Eddington) accretion (λ_Edd=0.6±0.2). We find a significant stellar contribution in the far-UV, reaching ~80% in the bluest systems. Possible Wolf-Rayet features (HeIIλ4687, nitrogen lines) are identified, tracing a young (3-7 Myr) compact starburst event. We also detect strong Balmer breaks and atypical Balmer, Paschen, [OIII], and optical and near-infrared HeI line ratios, and an absorption at ~4550 Angstrom (probably linked to FeII), all consistent with radiative-transfer effects in high-density gas with warm temperatures (4000-7000 K). We find a diversity of LRD flavors modulated by the luminosity ratio between between a short (≲20 Myr) and intense phase of BH activity, the most extreme stage lasting ~3-7 Myr, characterized by near-Eddington-limit radiation, and a nuclear and compact starburst dominated by massive stars (even super-massive, M_SMS~10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), all embedded in dense gas with modest dust content producing a variety of optical depths.

Gaseous halos around galaxies play an important role in galaxy evolution. The exchange of metals from the interstellar medium (ISM) to the circumgalactic medium (CGM) are caused by the formation, feedback, and/or merging history of galaxies. We study the variation in chemical composition between the ISM (≲3 kpc) and CGM (~5-10 kpc) for a sample of M<sub>&sext;</sub>&gt;10^9.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> main-sequence galaxies at 4&lt;z&lt;6 with both JWST and ALMA observations. Using JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy, we derive the optical line ratios from the ISM and the CGM for our sample focusing on the typical optical lines used for metallicity studies. Our comparison shows that the ISM and the CGM have similar chemical abundances. This indicates that the CGM of these typical 4&lt;z&lt;6 galaxies is enriched to the level of their ISM in the early universe. Using statistical tests, we find that some of the line ratios show marginal differences between the ISM and CGM. Combined with ttCloudy modeling, our results suggest that a difference in ionization level (higher for the ISM) is the dominant reason for the observed ratio difference of oxygen line ratios. There is also indication of a deficit in the nitrogen abundance with respect to oxygen in the CGM, which suggests a delay in redistribution of secondary nitrogen. Finally, an enhanced F_[CII]158μm/F_Hα ratio is observed in the CGM, suggesting that feedback and/or mergers play a key role in metal mixing.

Galaxy major mergers are a potential mechanism for triggering active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity, but their role remains debated, particularly beyond the local Universe. We aim to shed light on the merger-AGN connection at z=0.5-2, exploiting the multi-wavelength datasets and  James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations in the COSMOS field. We construct a stellar mass-limited sample and identify AGN via mid-infrared (MIR) colours, X-ray detections, and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. We train convolutional neural networks to identify mergers with mock JWST observations. We create non-AGN and non-merger control samples matching the redshift, stellar mass, and star-formation rate distributions of the AGN and mergers. We find AGN to be moderately more frequent in mergers than in non-mergers, with excess ratios ranging from ~2.5 (X-ray AGN) to ~1.3 (MIR) and ~ 1.1-1.2 (SED AGN). Similarly, AGN galaxies show a higher merger fraction (f_merg) than non-AGN controls. We then study f_merg as a function of relative and absolute AGN power, utilising the AGN fraction (f_AGN) and accretion disc luminosity (L_disc) parameters. We uncover a f_merg-f_AGN relation with two regimes: f_merg stays roughly flat for less-dominant AGN (f_AGN&lt;0.8) but increases at f_AGN&gt;0.8 for the MIR and X-ray AGN, and more gently for SED AGN, where mergers appear to be the main triggering mechanism. Additionally, f_merg increases monotonically as a function of L_disc, for all AGN types, reaching f_merg&gt;50&percnt; for the most luminous AGN (L_disc ≳ 10^46 erg s<sup>-1</sup>). Overall, our results suggest that major mergers can trigger AGN out to the cosmic noon at z~2. Furthermore, the role of major mergers shows a clear dependence on AGN luminosity and remains the principal mechanism for fuelling the most powerful AGN.

### 13) [2602.19044](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19044v1): Evidence for Log-Periodic Modulation in High-Redshift Compact Object Abundance Consistent with Cyclic Condensate Collapse

<p> Takeshi Fukuyama </p>
<p>
We analyze the redshift distribution of high-z galaxies and active galactic nuclei identified in early JWST data, and investigate the presence of periodic structure in the variable x=\ln(1+z). A baseline-corrected unbinned frequency analysis reveals a statistically significant peak corresponding to a spacing Δx ≃ 0.34, suggesting an approximately log-periodic pattern in the redshift distribution. A periodic structure in x implies a preferred scaling ratio in (1+z), which may be interpreted as a realization of discrete scale invariance. We discuss the possibility that such behavior arises from cyclic condensate dynamics in Bose&ndash;Einstein condensate (BEC) cosmology. In the Fukuyama&ndash;Morikawa&ndash;Tatekawa framework, repeated collapse and re-formation episodes of a self-interacting condensate occur over characteristic timescales of order several 10^8 years. When mapped into redshift space, this temporal periodicity naturally translates into an approximately constant spacing in \ln(1+z). While the observed frequency is not interpreted as a sharp theoretical prediction, its magnitude is quantitatively consistent with the intrinsic cycle timescale of QCD-axion motivated condensate dynamics. The present analysis therefore provides observational support for cyclic BEC cosmology as a viable dynamical origin of log-periodic structure in the high-redshift universe.

<p> Zacharias Roupas </p>
<p>
We review our semi-analytic model of stellar black hole (BH) mass growth by gas accretion in gas-rich stellar clusters during their birthstage within the first ~ 10 Myr after the first stellar formation event. Such proto-stellar clusters are massive and compact, with typical masses ~ 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and sizes ~ 1 pc, suggested by recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations. We find that the BH masses are shifted by the end of gas depletion to values within and above the BH mass gap, well within the range of components of the recent gravitational-wave (GW) signal GW231123, and up to masses ~ 10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>.

We present a detailed study of near-infrared (2-4μm) JWST/NIRSpec spectra of 48 high-redshift (z=2.53^+1.32_-0.70) galaxies detected with ALMA at &gt;3σ. From a multi-wavelength SED analysis we establish the sample has a a median stellar mass of log_10(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=10.8±0.1 and dust mass of log_10(M_d/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=8.7±0.1, covering a broad range of far-infrared luminosity (log_10(L_FIR/L<sub>&odot;</sub>)=10.9-12.7). The majority of sources show no signs of AGN activity, with 40% having either X-ray counterparts (L_Xc&gt;10^42erg/s), elevated optical line ratios, or broad (FWHM&gt;800 km/s) Hα profiles, although we note this is a lower limit due to the stochastic placement of NIRSpec slits. We establish the sample has a median gas-phase metallicity of 12+log(O/H)=8.71±0.02, as derived from the [NII]/Hα ratio, with the most FIR-luminous galaxies (log_10(L_FIR/L<sub>&odot;</sub>)&gt;12) falling 0.15±0.03dex above the fundamental metallicity relation. From the [SII] emission-line doublet ratio, we measure a median electron density of log_10(n_e/cm^-3)=2.53±0.07 consistent with less-massive, star-forming, galaxies at the same epoch. For nine galaxies with [OII] and Hβ detections (median log_10(L_FIR/L<sub>&odot;</sub>)=11.81±0.15), we derive a median observed (dust-uncorrected) ionisation parameter of log_10(U)=-2.84±0.06. Our results indicate that luminous far-infrared galaxies are massive, chemically evolved systems that appear to deviate from the standard dust and metal production equilibrium observed in less obscured galaxies. This study demonstrates the synergy of JWST and ALMA in unveiling the nature of DSFGs, and highlights the need for a NIRSpec survey of uniformly selected, massive, dust-obscured, galaxies to fully characterise their interstellar medium.

<p> Laura Sommovigo, Lachlan Lancaster, Shyam H. Menon, Joseph A. O'Leary, Rachel S. Somerville, Greg L. Bryan </p>
<p>
Recent JWST observations reveal massive, UV-bright galaxies at z &gt; 10 with little apparent dust attenuation, whereas ALMA detections at z ≃ 7 show similarly massive systems that are already dust-rich and IR-luminous. This raises a fundamental question: can a single physical model of star formation and dust production explain both populations across cosmic time? We address this using a minimal framework with only two free parameters&ndash;the instantaneous star formation efficiency (ε<sub>&sext;</sub>) and the dust yield per Type II supernova (y_d)&ndash;and predict the rest-frame UV and IR luminosity functions (LFs) from z ≃ 14 to 7. For a uniform ISM, we find a UV-IR tension at the bright end of the LFs at z ≥ 7. The UV LF requires low dust yields (y_d ≲ 0.01 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), whereas the z=7 IR LF requires higher yields (y_d ~ 0.1 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) unless the star formation efficiency is boosted above ε<sub>&sext;</sub> ≈ 5-10%. We show that incorporating a porous, turbulent ISM largely resolves this tension: turbulence opens low-column-density sightlines that enhance the UV escape fraction while leaving the total absorbed energy&ndash;and thus the IR luminosity&ndash;nearly unchanged once radiative-transfer&ndash;induced flattening of the attenuation curve is included. Large-grain dust distributions, while reducing UV opacity, play a secondary role once ISM porosity and radiative transfer are taken into account. At z &gt; 10, however, even strong turbulence cannot reproduce the bright end of the UV LF at high dust yield. This could be resolved either by efficient dust removal in early massive systems or by substantial ISM dust growth by z ≃ 7. Our results highlight dust physics as a key lever for interpreting the rapidly growing UV and IR constraints within the broader context of early galaxy formation.

Galaxy mergers play a crucial role in shaping the morphology, the star formation, and the mass growth of galaxies across cosmic time. While mergers have been extensively investigated in the local Universe, the evolution of their frequency and physical properties in the early Universe has yet to be fully understood. We investigate the role of mergers in a large spectroscopic sample of 1233 galaxies in the range 5&lt;z&lt;14 with good detection (S/N-pixel &gt; 3) in JWST imaging, covering six different extragalactic fields. We identify mergers from rest-frame optical disturbances in F444W, using a combination of Gini, M-20, and Asymmetry parameters. We find a morphological merger fraction f_m that does not strongly evolve with redshift from z=0 to z ~ 8. The average f_m of our primary major merger condition (Gini+0.14xM-20 &gt; 0.33, A&gt;0.35) is ~ 5 %, which increases to ~13 % for major+minor merger tracers. Accounting for the evolving observability timescale of each tracer, we find that the merger rate is strongly increasing from z=1 to 7 by more than 1 dex, averaging ~ 2 merger/galaxy/Gyr at 5&lt;z&lt;10 for major mergers (in agreement with photometric pair studies), and a factor of 3 higher for minor+major mergers. We also perform SED modeling using available HST+JWST photometry to infer stellar masses and SFRs, using a non parametric star-formation history. We find that mergers at z &gt; 5 have a significant impact, although significantly lower than at z&lt;1, on the SFR of galaxies. When averaged over 10 Myr (comparable to the observability timescale of morphological disturbances), their SFRs are a factor of 1.7 higher than a mass and redshift matched sample of non-mergers, suggesting that mergers trigger new star-formation through short-lived powerful bursty episodes. Despite this, mergers contribute only by 5% - 10% to the mass build-up of galaxies in the redshift range explored.

<p>
Neutral gas outflows play a crucial role in the baryon cycle of galaxies, their properties provide key insights into the transition from star formation to quiescence. In this work, we investigate the neutral gas outflow of 23 massive (M<sub>&sext;</sub> = 10^10.1-11.6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) quiescent galaxies (QGs) at z=2.82&ndash;4.61, selected from the JWST NIRSpec (R~1000) and NIRCam program DeepDive. We trace the neutral gas outflows using the NaI Doublet absorption lines and detect excess NaI D in 13/23 (57%) targets, of which 7/23 (30%) show blueshifted absorption with velocity offsets |Δv| &gt;~ 150 km/s. The z ~ 3.5 targets have Δv similar to those of their local counterparts; they are also equivalent when compared in SFR&ndash;Δv space. We derive mass outflow rates and identify the most extreme neutral gas outflow rate log(\dot M_out / M<sub>&odot;</sub>   yr^-1)=2.68±0.27 beyond the local Universe, coincident with an X-ray AGN. For all NaI D detected systems, the inferred mass outflow rate can, in principle, suppress ongoing star formation; however, the outflows are unlikely to escape their hosts, suggesting recycling on relatively short timescales (~3&ndash;180 Myr), depending on the assumed potential and launching radius. All NaI D detected targets occupy the LI(N)ER region of the BPT diagram and/or are X-ray detected, but we find no strong correlation between ongoing AGN and the neutral outflow: 2/4 broad-line/X-ray AGNs are NaI D undetected &ndash; yet, the outflows can be powered by fossil/episodic AGNs, and one broad-line target shows a possible P-Cygni profile that indicates strong outflows. As neutral outflows alone are not able to permanently quench star formation by removing gas in our sample at z ~ 3.5, the presence of gas cycling in and out of massive passive systems may instead be the signature of feedback-regulated quenching-maintenance processes.

Mérida, Vesna Pirc Jevšenak, Roberta Tripodi </p>
<p>
UV slopes (β) are a powerful diagnostics for galaxies at the Epoch of Reionization, tracing star formation, ISM ionization, and the escape fraction f<sub>esc</sub> of ionizing photons. Studies at low and intermediate z find a gradual β reddening with time and steeper slopes for fainter galaxies, however recent JWST studies reveal a flattening of this trend at z&gt;7. We want measure β for galaxies at z&gt;7.5 using the strong lensing around massive galaxy clusters to observe high-redshift and faint galaxies. The low-brightness regime is of particular interest for reionization, as most of the recent models of this process posit that numerous faint galaxies are the prime drivers of reionization. We use NIRCam and NIRSpec data from CANUCS, Technicolor, JUMPS, Silver Bullet, UNCOVER and MEGASCIENCE across 7 strong lensing fields. We find galaxies down to M_UV~-16 and 7.5&lt;z&lt;12.5. We measure \beta with a forward-modelling procedure and estimate f<sub>esc</sub> for a subsample with emission line data using a relation, calibrated from a low-z sample, with UV slope, galaxy size and Hβ equivalent width. We find 378 galaxies (45 with spectrum), yielding average values β=-2.3±0.4, z=8.5±1.0, and M_UV=-18±1. We find no significant β evolution across our redshift range, suggesting a flattening of the β-z trend above z~7.5. We find a weak negative trend between β and M_UV. For 14 galaxies we estimate an average f<sub>esc</sub>=0.26±0.22. The flat trend of β at z&gt;7.5 suggests similar properties between 300 and 600 Myr after the Big Bang. The weak trend between β and M_UV suggests an analogous composition for low- and high-mass galaxies' ISM, likely due to a lack of time for dust buildup. While average f<sub>esc</sub> is higher than necessary to ionize the IGM by z~6, the model extrapolated at low-z may overestimate its value.

<p>
We investigate the detection and nature of 5.6~μm MIRI-red sources in the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS), covering 2.4~arcmin<sup>2</sup> in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. MIDIS is the deepest JWST/MIRI survey to date, probing faint limits and enabling studies of rare high-redshift galaxy populations. We define MIRI-red sources as those detected at 5σ significance in MIRI/F560W with red colors: m_F444W - m_F560W ≥ 0.5. Using an empirical methodology, we estimate the purity and completeness of MIRI detections and find that a 5-sigma detection at 28.75 mag has a purity of 92&percnt; and completeness of 54&percnt;. We identify seven MIRI-red galaxy candidates, including an F115W dropout consistent with a high-redshift galaxy candidate. We explore possible physical origins for the MIRI-red population, including active galactic nuclei, dust-obscured galaxies, extreme emission-line galaxies, evolved stellar populations, and Little Red Dots (LRDs). Given the proximity of the F444W and F560W filters and the depth of MIDIS, MIRI-red galaxies are consistent with emission-line galaxies with EW_0(Hα) ≥ 750 Å or EW_0(Hβ+ [OIII]) ≥ 600 Å, or high-redshift Balmer breaks of at least 1.6. We also discuss an extreme MIRI-red galaxy undetected in F444W, a potential MIRI-only source, for which we derive EW_0(Hα) ~ 6000 Å and EW_0(Hβ+ [OIII]) ~ 4000 Å, or high-z LRD analogs with Balmer breaks of 6.3. Finally, we find fewer MIRI-red detections than expected from extrapolations of the Hα or Hβ+[OIII] line luminosity functions, consistent with previous deep searches, while the absence of z&gt;10 LRD candidates agrees with theoretical expectations for the MIDIS volume.

<p>
The detection limit of astronomical imaging observations is limited by several noise sources. Some of that noise is correlated between neighbouring image pixels and exposures, so in principle could be learned and corrected. We present an astronomical self-supervised transformer-based denoising algorithm (ASTERIS), that integrates spatiotemporal information across multiple exposures. Benchmarking on mock data indicates that ASTERIS improves detection limits by 1.0 magnitude at 90% completeness and purity, while preserving the point spread function and photometric accuracy. Observational validation using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Subaru telescope identifies previously undetectable features, including low-surface-brightness galaxy structures and gravitationally-lensed arcs. Applied to deep JWST images, ASTERIS identifies three times more redshift &gt; 9 galaxy candidates, with rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity 1.0 magnitude fainter, than previous methods.

<p>
We present results from imaging observations of three quadruply lensed quasars by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at redshifts z = 2.550, 2.975, and 1.500. We model our targets assuming a singular isothermal ellipsoid mass profile and an elliptical SÃ\copyrightrsic profile for the lensing galaxies, and reconstruct the geometric configuration of each system with measured Einstein radii of 0.44', 0.58', and 0.49'. While no spectroscopic measurements are available for the lenses, we constrain the redshift of each lens to 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.2, 1.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.5, and 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.9. For all three lenses, the best-fit light model yield a typical de Vaucouleurs n_S\acuteersic ~ 4 profile and an effective radius R_e around ~ 1.5 - 3.5 kpc. We accordingly classify the three lenses as early-type galaxies at an intermediate to high redshift, a common type for strong lensing galaxies. Compared to other known quadruple lenses, the lensing galaxies in this work are at the lower end of the distribution of Einstein radii and upper end of the distribution of the lens redshifts. They represent an interesting quadrant of subarcsecond-separation lenses in the population of single-galaxy strong lensing which have been largely unexplored yet and will be great targets of interest in upcoming high-resolution lensing surveys.

### 23) [2602.16706](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16706v1): How Bursty is Star Formation at z&gt;5?

<p> Massimo Stiavelli, Massimo Ricotti </p>
<p>
Motivated by observational evidence from JWST and theoretical results from cosmological simulations, we use a simple parametric, phenomenological model to test to what extent bursty star formation with standard Initial Mass Function, no continuous star formation, no mergers, \mrand no dust can account for the observed properties in the M_UV vs M_* plane of galaxies at redshifts z&gt;5. We find that the simplest model that fits the data has a quiescence period between bursts Δt ~ 100~Myrs and the stellar mass in each galaxy grows linearly as a function of time from z=12 to z=5 (i.e., repeated bursts in each galaxy produce approximately equal mass in stars). The distribution of burst masses across different galaxies follows a power-law dN/dM_* &prop; M_*^α with slope α~ -2. At z&gt;9-10 the observed galaxy population typically had only one or two bursts of stars formation, hence the observed stellar masses at these redshifts (reaching M_* ~ 10^10~M<sub>&odot;</sub>), roughly represent the distribution of masses formed in one burst.

### 24) [2602.16030](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16030v1): Molecular diagnostics for the mid-infrared emission of planet-forming disks. Carbon and oxygen elemental abundances

<p>
Mid-infrared observations of planet-forming disks reveal a wide diversity in molecular spectra. Carbon and oxygen abundances play a central role in setting the chemical environment of the inner disk and the spectral appearance. We aim to systematically explore how variations in elemental carbon and oxygen abundances affect the mid-infrared spectra of planet-forming disks, and to identify robust mid-infrared molecular diagnostics of C/H, O/H, and the C/O ratio. Using the thermochemical disk code ProDiMo and the line radiative transfer code FLiTs, we construct a grid of 25 models with varying carbon and oxygen abundances, covering a broad range of C/O ratios. We analyze the resulting mid-infrared molecular emission, including species such as H<sub>2</sub>O, CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, C_2H<sub>2</sub>, OH. We find that the mid-infrared molecular spectra are highly sensitive not only to the C/O ratio, but also to the absolute abundances of carbon and oxygen. Despite the same disk structure and C/O ratios, molecular fluxes (e.g., C_2H<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>) vary by more than an order of magnitude. This variation stems from the differences in excitation conditions and emitting regions caused by the elemental abundances of oxygen and carbon. We identify diagnostic molecular flux ratios - such as CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O and H<sub>2</sub>O/C_2H<sub>2</sub> - that can serve as tracers of C/H and O/H respectively. By combining these diagnostics, we demonstrate a method to infer the underlying C/O ratio. Our model grid provides a framework for interpreting mid-infrared molecular emission from disks, allowing estimates of elemental abundances if the disk properties and structure are known. Comparisons with recent JWST observations suggest that a variety in C and O abundances is seen in a sample of T Tauri disks, possibly shaped by disk transport processes and the presence of gaps.

### 25) [2602.15952](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15952v1): Gas Accretion versus BH Merger driven Growth Modes of Supermassive Black Holes and Implications for the Little Red Dots

<p> Paramita Barai </p>
<p>
We investigate the growth of central supermassive black holes in galaxies, aiming to distinguish between gas accretion versus BH merger-driven growth modes. By performing and analysing cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of (50 ~ Mpc)^3 comoving boxes, we also study how the BH feedback parameters affect the coevolution between SMBHs and their host galaxies. Starting as 10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> seeds, we find that the BHs grow initially via BH mergers to ~ 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Gas accretion onto the BHs is initially low, then increases with time, and reaches the Eddington rate after 7-9 Gyrs. The BHs then undergo very fast growth via efficient gas accretion over a period of 600 - 700 Myr, when the BH mass increases 10^2 - 10^3 times, causing their predominant growth from 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub> to (10^9 - 10^10) M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Taking into account the cosmological gas inflows and outflows, SMBHs do not grow to more than 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> by z=0, because of gas depletion from galaxy centers driven by AGN feedback. In terms of SMBH - host galaxy coevolution along the M_BH - M<sub>&sext;</sub> relation, we find that they initially lie below and thereby move upward toward the relation. We make some physical implications of the growth of high-z Little Red Dots recently observed by JWST: the normal-mass SMBHs had predominantly undergone BH merger driven evolution, whereas the overmassive BHs underwent periods of Eddington-limited or super-Eddington bursts of gas accretion.

### 26) [2602.15940](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15940v1): The large cores of dark matter and globular clusters in AS1063. Possible evidence of self-interacting dark matter. Or not

<p> Jose M. Diego </p>
<p>
Deep JWST images of AS1063 reveals tens of thousands of globular clusters in the galaxy cluster AS1063. When compared with the lensing model based on the same JWST data, the distribution of globular clusters traces closely the distribution of lensing mass (mostly composed of dark matter). Interestingly, both the distributions of dark matter and globular clusters have large central cores. However the size of the core in the distribution of globular clusters is about half the size the core of the dark matter distribution. We argue that the standard cold dark matter and fuzzy dark matter models struggle to explain these large cores. Meanwhile, the self interacting dark matter with a velocity dependent cross section, combined with core stalling, offers a natural explanation to the existence of these cores if σ_SI≈ 0.3 cm<sup>2</sup> g^-1 for galaxy cluster halos. But we also discuss how the lack of hydrodynamical N-body simulations capable of resolving globular clusters in galaxy cluster scale halos, hinders the possibility of ruling out the standard non-collisional dark matter scenario. Future high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters, with several trillion particles, and containing over a hundred thousand globular clusters, can provide the insight needed to transform the epistemic nature of dark matter into an ontological one

<p>
Little Red Dots (LRDs), among the most enigmatic high-redshift discoveries by JWST, are commonly believed to be powered by accreting supermassive black holes. Here, we explore the possibility that these sources are globular clusters in formation, with rest-frame UV arising from a very young stellar population and rest-frame optical from a short-lived supermassive (&gt;10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) star. The spectral profiles of LRDs are broadly consistent with this scenario, though the observed temperatures and bolometric luminosities favor emission reprocessed by optically thick, continuum-driven winds not fully captured by current models. The LRD z~5-7 UV luminosity function naturally evolves, under standard evolutionary and mass-loss prescriptions, into a present-day mass function with a turnover at log_10(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=5.3 and an exponential cutoff at high masses, consistent with local globular-cluster populations. We estimate the total present-day number density of LRDs formed across all redshifts to be ≈0.3 Mpc^-3, similar to local globular clusters. The observed LRD redshift range matches the age distribution of metal-poor globular clusters, without current LRD counterparts to the metal-rich population. If LRDs are globular clusters in formation, we predict chemical abundance patterns characteristic of multiple stellar populations, including enhanced He and N, and potential Na-O and Al-Mg anti-correlations. These results offer a local perspective to explore this surprisingly abundant population of distant sources, and a potential new window into extreme stellar astrophysics in the early Universe.

### 28) [2602.14604](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14604v2): Infrared spectra of methane-containing ice mixtures for JWST data analyses

<p> Varvara Karteyeva, Ruslan Nakibov, Igor Petrashkevich, Mikhail Medvedev, Anton Vasyunin </p>
<p>
Context. Solid methane (CH_4) is an important molecule in interstellar and planetary environments, serving as a precursor to complex organic compounds, and it is a potential biosignature in exoplanetary studies. Despite its significance, laboratory data on the low temperature phase of methane below 10 K remain limited. Aims. We obtained spectra of methane in binary mixtures at 10 K and compared them to the spectra obtained at 6.7 K. These temperatures correspond to phases II and II* of pure methane and are representative of dark molecular clouds and protostars in early stages. We also tested whether the data we obtained can be applied to interpret JWST data. Methods. Laboratory reference spectra were obtained with the ISEAge setup via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in transmission mode. A weighted χ^2 minimization was used for the fitting. Results. We present infrared spectra with corresponding band strengths of pure methane and binary mixtures with methane: CH_4:H<sub>2</sub>O, CH_4:CO<sub>2</sub>, CH_4:CH_3OH, and CH_4:NH_3 at 6.7 K and 10 K. They show an increase of 20% in mixtures compared to the commonly used 10 K band strength value of pure methane. We also tested whether the spectra can be used on open JWST data by probing the spatial distribution of methane in B335. We also present additional experiments concerning the phase transition of methane between phase II* and phase II. Conclusions. Our results reveal distinct spectral features for methane in non-H<sub>2</sub>O environments that enable a more accurate interpretation of JWST observations. The dataset of spectra is publicly available on Zenodo and can be used for fitting JWST data.

<p> Haojie Hu, Hiroto Yanagisawa, Moka Nishigaki, Tomokazu Kiyota, Tomoaki Ishiyama, Ken Ohsuga </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled the discovery of hundreds of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at redshifts z≳ 4-7. A non-negligible fraction of these SMBHs are hosted in galaxies with BH-to-galaxy mass ratios (M_BH/M<sub>&sext;</sub>) being excessively larger than that for local SMBHs by ~ 1-2 dex. The origin of these "overmassive'' BHs remains elusive, demanding either a heavy seed formation scenario or rapid growth of seed BHs. Their deviation from local scaling relations challenges our understanding of how SMBHs and their host galaxies coevolve across cosmic time. In this paper, we apply phenomenological modelings for BHs and galaxies to dark matter halo merger histories from N-body simulations to investigate the subsequent evolution of JWST-discovered "overmassive'' SMBHs. We find that early evolution of "overmassive'' SMBHs is dominated by stunted accretion leading to gradual decreases in M_BH/M<sub>&sext;</sub> ratios. In contrast, less massive SMBHs experience super-Eddington accretion during their early evolution, resulting in a slow increase of mass ratios toward M_BH/M<sub>&sext;</sub> ~ 0.01. Convergence occurs at M_BH~ 10^8~M<sub>&odot;</sub> with M_BH/M<sub>&sext;</sub> ~ 0.01. At lower redshift, nearly all SMBHs evolve onto local relations, as expected given that our models adopt empirical relations derived from low-redshift observations. This suggests that the global feedback mechanisms regulating the coevolution of M_BH/M<sub>&sext;</sub> ratios are implicitly encoded in local relations in terms of star-formation rate distribution, black hole accretion rate distribution and their active (quiescent) fractions.

<p>
We present a parametric strong-lensing model for the galaxy cluster MACS J1931.8-2635 (z_l = 0.35), accompanying the detection of the spectroscopically confirmed SN Eos at z = 5.13 (Coulter et al. 2026). We identify 10 new multiple-image systems in recent VENUS JWST/NIRCam imaging, so that the model is constrained with a total of 19 robust multiple-image systems &ndash; nine of which also have a spectroscopic redshift. For the point-like source corresponding to SN Eos, our model predicts a total of five images, with the observed radial image pair having a similar magnification of μ≃ 25 - 30 and a small time delay of &lt; 5 days, in agreement with their simultaneous observation. According to the model, the other three predicted images arrived earlier, with time delays of 3.7 ± 0.7, 3.5 ± 0.7 and 54.0 ± 10.8 years prior to the two observed images, and with magnifications of 12.9 ± 2.6, 13.0 ± 2.9 and 2.2 ± 0.4, respectively. The absence of detections at the predicted positions, where the host galaxy's images are also visible, confirms the transient nature of the source. SN Eos and its host galaxy are studied in separate articles, and we here focus on the lens model. The final model reaches a very good r.m.s. distance between model and observations of 0.44''. We present the lens-modeling results, including newly identified systems such as a triply imaged, grand-design spiral galaxy candidate at z ≃ 3.65_-0.09^+0.04, and briefly discuss the potential of using high-redshift lensed SNe for cosmography.

<p> A. Yeghikyan, M. Rah, S. Shamyar </p>
<p>
The presence of dust in supernova remnants (SNRs) is confirmed by extensive infrared data from observatories such as Spitzer, Herschel, and JWST, alongside theoretical models of dust formation. This study explores the existence of dust and ices, particularly water ice via 62 μm in SNRs such as the Crab Nebula and N49, using observational data and preliminary modeling with Cloudy. Observations suggest that water ice may be present in IC 443 and possibly other remnants, though the 63 μm band could also indicate [OI] emission. Theoretical models indicate that water ice could survive under certain conditions in SNRs, with densities and temperatures analyzed. Further observations and refined simulations are needed to confirm these findings.

<p> Samuel Gagnon-Hartman, Andrei Mesinger, Ivan Nikolić, Eleonora Parlanti, Giacomo Venturi </p>
<p>
The Lyman α (Lyα) line from high-redshift galaxies is a powerful probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) can significantly attenuate the emergent Lyα line, even in the damping wing of the cross-section. However, interpreting this damping wing imprint relies on our prior knowledge of the spectrum that escapes from the galaxy and its environs into the IGM. This emergent spectrum is highly sensitive to the composition and geometry of the interstellar and circumgalactic media, and so exhibits a large galaxy to galaxy scatter. Characterizing this scatter is further complicated by non-trivial selection effects introduced by observational surveys. Here we build a flexible, empirical model for the emergent Lyα spectra. Our model characterizes the emergent Lyα luminosity, the velocity offset of the Lyα line with respect to the systemic redshift, and the Hα luminosity, with multivariate probability distributions conditioned on the UV magnitude. We constrain these distributions using z~5-6 galaxy observations with VLT MUSE and JWST NIRCam, forward-modeling observational selection functions together with galaxy parameters. Our model results in Lyα equivalent width distributions that are a better match to (independent) Subaru observations than previous empirical models. The extended distributions of Lyα equivalent widths and velocity offsets we obtain could facilitate Lyα transmission during the early stages of the EoR. We also illustrate how our model can be used to identify GN-z11-like outliers, potentially originating from merging systems. We publish fitting functions and make our model publicly available.

<p>
The unprecedented rest-frame UV and optical coverage provided by JWST enables simultaneous constraints on the electron density (n_e) and temperature (T_e) of ionized gas in galaxies at z&gt;5. We present a self-consistent direct method based on multiple OIII]1661,66) and [OIII] (λ4363, and λ5007) transitions to characterize the physical conditions of the high-ionization zone. This new approach is insensitive to a wide range of n_e due to the high critical densities of the OIII] and [OIII] transitions. Applying this technique to six galaxies at z=5-9, we find electron densities up to n_e~ 3× 10^5 cm^-3 and temperatures of T_e ~ 20,000 K in systems at z&gt;6. Accounting for these self-consistent densities changes the derived T_e and modifies the inferred metallicities by up to 0.29 dex relative to previous estimates. We discuss the reported N/O overabundances in the high-z galaxies from our sample, which arise entirely from the high N^3+/H^+ values inferred from NIV] lines. We point out that a T_e-stratification, in which the N^3+ zone has a slightly higher T_e than T_e([OIII]), could substantially reduce the inferred N/O. Quantitatively, if T_e(N^3+) were 10&percnt; higher than T_e([OIII]), this could induce a systematic overestimation of N^3+/O^2+ of nearly 50&percnt;. Classical N/O diagnostics such as N^+/O^+, due to their critical densities, can significantly impact the inferred N/O abundance in the presence of high-density gas, whereas N^2+/O^2+ place these galaxies closer to z~0 systems in the N/O-O/H plane. Future JWST programs with larger and more diverse samples will be essential to test the universality and robustness of these results.

<p> Yuxuan Pang, Xin Wang, Cheng Cheng, Shengzhe Wang, Hang Zhou, Qianqiao Zhou, Xue-Bing Wu, Karl Glazebrook </p>
<p>
We present an analysis of medium/high-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectra for 11 LRDs at z ~ 4. By decomposing the broad and narrow components of the Balmer emission lines, we investigate the connection between line emission and UV/optical continua for the LRD population. We find that the broad Hα luminosity strongly correlates with the optical continuum (but not with the UV), indicating a common AGN origin for both. In contrast, the [O III] line strength is correlated with the UV continuum rather than the optical. Using the width and luminosity of the broad Hα line, we estimate central black hole masses of 10^6-10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> accreting at high Eddington ratios, consistent with an early (λ_Edd ~ 0.6), rapid-growth phase of AGN evolution. Assuming a constant mass accretion rate in the framework of slim-disk models, we infer growth timescales of ~ 10^5-10^7yr, and suggest LRDs may evolve into narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. Upper limits from our spectra indicate that LRDs exhibit intrinsically weak optical Fe II emission compared to typical AGN. To simultaneously account for the inferred broad-line region size and observed luminosity, we propose a "Clumpy Envelope" model in which the optical emission arises from an extended, clumpy gas with a characteristic radius of tens of light-days. The diversity in observed optical continuum shapes can be explained by radial temperature gradients and self-absorption effects within this structure. Our results demonstrate the power of JWST high-resolution spectroscopy in probing the central engines and physical nature of the LRD population.

<p> Bocheng Zhu, Liang Gao </p>
<p>
We present a new Pop III + Pop II subgrid framework implemented in the moving-mesh code \sc arepo, designed to study the impact of Pop III feedback on star formation in the early universe. The framework combines primordial non-equilibrium chemistry, metal-line cooling, IMF-sampled stellar evolution with SN feedback, and approximate Lyman-Werner (LW) and ionizing radiation transport. We run a suite of 1cMpc/h box simulations with different initial conditions and resolutions from z=127 to z=10. The highest gas mass and spatial resolution in the fiducial simulation reach ~10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and ~4 pc, respectively. The model successfully reproduces the UV-inferred Pop II star formation rate density (SFRD) from recent JWST observations across all initial conditions, with only minor variation driven by local halo interactions and LW irradiation. We find that the volume filling factor of metal-enriched gas converges to ~1&percnt; at z=10. Convergence is achieved once subhalos with M_subhalo≳ 10^6.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> are resolved, and the total stellar mass at z=10 is largely insensitive to initial conditions or the resolution considered in this work. A fiducial simulation requires ~ 10^4 CPU hours, making the framework computationally tractable for larger box simulations and enabling future large parameter studies of stellar physics or environment effects such as Pop III IMF variations, X-ray radiation, or the streaming velocity at high redshift.

Based on deep high resolution JWST images of AS1063, and after a careful masking of artifacts, extended features in the cluster, and background galaxies (including known lensed ones), we have identified tens of thousands of unresolved point sources in the central region of the galaxy cluster. We extended the identification of these point sources up to 1.18 Mpc from the center of the cluster using data in the second module. Most of these sources are expected to be globular clusters orbiting in the deep potential well of the cluster, but also the surviving compact cores of satellite galaxies. We study the distribution of the globular clusters and compared it with the distribution of mass from a lens model derived from the same JWST data. We find a very tight correlation between the two distributions, but also some differences, including a more concentrated distribution for the globular clusters than for dark matter. We explored the possibility of using the distribution of globular clusters as a proxy for the lensing mass. We find that a simple smoothing kernel can transform the discrete distribution of point sources into a continuous two-dimensional distribution that matches well the lensing convergence. This suggests that globular clusters can be used as tracers of the dark matter distribution in other massive clusters where gravitational lensing constraints are scarce but globular clusters can be detected more easily, for instance in low redshift galaxy clusters.

We present a panchromatic optical-mm characterization of GNz7q, a recently identified X-ray weak, rapidly growing red quasar embedded within a dusty starburst galaxy at z=7.1899, using the full suite of JWST/NIRCam, NIRSpec, MIRI, and archival NOEMA observations. Our deep NIRSpec/G395M spectroscopy reveals unambiguous broad Balmer emission (FWHM =2221±20kms<sup>-1</sup>), confirming a super-Eddington accreting black hole (λ_Edd=2.7±0.4) with a mass of log(M_BH/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=7.55±0.34, using accretion-rate corrected BH mass estimators. After subtracting the point source, we robustly detect stellar emission from the host galaxy across multiple NIRCam and MIRI filters. Out joint morphological-spectral analysis yields a stellar mass of log (M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=10.5±0.4 and an intense star formation rate of SFR=330±97 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1, confirming the host as a massive, dusty starburst galaxy. We find that GNz7q lies on the local M_BH-M_* relation (M_BH/M_*≃ 0.001) and is well positioned to evolve into the locus of massive SDSS quasars with log (M_BH/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≈ 9 and M_*≈ 10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z~ 6, owing to its remarkably rapid growth in both the black hole and its host galaxy. This stands in stark contrast to many recently reported JWST AGN populations at similar redshifts, including the little red dots (LRDs), whose weak or undetected star formation makes it difficult for them to grow into the massive galaxies hosting SDSS-like quasars. These results suggest that GNz7q marks as a rare, pivotal phase of early BH-galaxy co-eolution, plausibly providing a crucial direct pathway to the supermassive black hole systems within the first billion years of the Universe.

<p>
One of the major conundrums in contemporary extragalactic astrophysics is the apparent overabundance of a remarkable population of UV-bright galaxies at redshifts z≳ 9. We analyse galaxies spectroscopically observed by JWST/NIRSpec Prism and confirmed to lie at z&gt;9, with sufficient signal-to-noise to carefully model their rest-frame UV to optical continua and line emission. In particular, we model the damped Lyman-α (Lyα) absorption (DLA) features of each galaxy to place observational constraints on the gas assembly of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) onto the galaxy halos at the onset of cosmic reionisation. Based on the derived HI column densities and star-formation rate (SFR) surface densities, we show that all galaxies are highly efficient at forming stars on rapid ~ 10-100 Myr depletion timescales, greatly in excess compared to the canonical local universe Kennicutt-Schmidt relation and predictions from state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulations. The dense HI gas appears to also drive the offset from the fundamental-metallicity relation of these galaxies though its dust-to-gas ratio is seemingly consistent with values derived for local galaxies except for the lowest metallicity sight-lines. Our results provide the first robust observational constraints on the impact of pristine HI gas on early galaxy assembly, and imply that a combination of highly efficient star formation and low dust obscuration can likely explain the UV-brightness of galaxies at cosmic dawn.

<p>
High-z quasars are believed to reside in massive dark matter haloes (DMHs), suggesting that they reside in galaxy overdense regions. However, previous observations have shown a range of environments around them. The previous targets are limited to bright quasars (M_1450≲-25), for which photoevaporation may hinder galaxy formation in their vicinity. Here, we present Subaru/Hyper-Suprime Cam observations of the environments of four low-luminosity quasars (-24&lt;M_1450&lt;-22) at z~6.18, which are expected to have a smaller photoevaporation effect. We detect Lyman α emitters (LAEs) around them with narrowband NB872 imaging, and measure the local LAE overdensity. One quasar (J0844-0132) resides in an overdense region (δ_LAE=3.77±0.97), whereas the other three fields are consistent with normal fields. The result is confirmed over the proximity zone of each quasar, suggesting that the diverse environment around quasars is independent of photoevaporation. We find no significant correlation between the LAE overdensities and the properties of host galaxies and supermassive black holes. Our quasars have host stellar mass measurements from JWST, allowing us to compare them with the LAE overdensity around galaxies without quasar activity with comparable stellar masses. We find that the LAE overdensity in the J0844-0132 field is stronger than that of galaxies with similar stellar mass at z~6, while the other quasar fields show a comparable LAE overdensity.

<p>
We constrain the nebular attenuation curve and investigate dust geometry in star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon using photometric medium-band emission line measurements. We measure H-alpha emission line fluxes for a sample of 209 star-forming galaxies at 1.2&lt;z&lt;2.4 in MegaScience/UNCOVER with stellar masses spanning 7.85&lt;log_10(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;11.0. For 66 of these galaxies, we also measure a Pa-beta flux. We find that the Pa-beta/H-alpha line ratio increases strongly with stellar mass and star-formation rate (SFR) across our full mass range, indicating that more massive galaxies are dustier. We compare our results with a mass-, SFR-, and redshift-matched sample of galaxies from the MOSDEF survey with spectroscopic measurements of H-alpha/H-beta, finding that a shallow Reddy et al. (2025) nebular attenuation curve is more consistent with our observations than the typically assumed Cardelli et al. (1989) attenuation curve, especially for massive galaxies. This shallow attenuation curve could be explained by low dust covering fractions in star-forming regions. Through comparison to other studies, we show that assuming this shallower attenuation curve can increase the inferred A_Halpha,neb by up to 1 magnitude at high masses. We observe no trend between A_Halpha,neb and axis ratio, indicating that nebular attenuation is likely localized to small clumps. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that dust geometry is patchy and non-uniform, especially in massive galaxies. Our results highlight the ability of JWST medium bands to probe emission lines for large samples of galaxies, and statistically constrain dust properties in upcoming large programs.

### 41) [2602.10987](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10987v1): Beyond ΛCDM: fundamental constants as cosmological observables

<p> Dinko Milaković, John K. Webb </p>
<p>
Recent cosmological tensions pose difficulties for ΛCDM. Forthcoming facilities will be able to check whether these tensions result from systematic effects or indeed with the ΛCDM model itself. However, these new data will primarily probe gravitational interactions and provide only limited information about non-gravitational interactions. Distinguishing between competing models that make similar predictions yet rely on fundamentally different principles, therefore requires suitably diverse physical tests. Observational constraints on spacetime variations of fundamental constants fill this need. The fine-structure constant, α= e^2/\hbar c, can be measured using absorption systems towards bright quasars using the Many Multiplet method, and using atomic doublets from line emitting gas in galaxies. A spectroscopic facility such as the WST could produce more than 100,000 new measurements of α from quasars together with a million measurements from galaxies. When combined with other probes, such a large and homogeneous dataset of α measurements would provide unprecedented constraints on physics beyond ΛCDM.

### 42) [2602.10893](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10893v1): Deep and Sparse Denoising Benchmarks for Spectral Data Cubes of High-z Galaxies: From Simulations to ALMA observations

<p>
Beyond cosmic noon, galaxies appear as faint whispers amid noise, yet this epoch is key to understanding massive galaxy assembly. ALMA's sensitivity to cold dust and [C II] emission allows us to probe their interstellar medium, but faint signals make robust denoising essential. We evaluate and benchmark denoising strategies including Principal Component Analysis, Independent Component Analysis, sparse unsupervised representations: iterative soft thresholding with 2D-1D wavelets, and supervised deep learning with a 3D U-Net, to identify techniques that suppress noise while preserving flux and morphology across peak SNRs of 2.5-8, applied to (i) synthetic spectral cubes of rotating toy disk galaxies, (ii) synthetic [C II] IFU cubes from FIRE simulations, and (iii) ALMA [C II] observations of CRISTAL galaxies and W2246-0526. Performance is assessed via RMSE, conservation of flux and spectra, noise reduction, and SNR improvement of the central galaxy. For synthetic cubes: PCA and ICA provide marginal improvement; IST reduces noise effectively at moderate SNRs but can suppress emission at low SNRs; and the U-Net outperforms IST, though it can produce quantifiable hallucinations at lower-SNRs. For moderate-SNR observations (ALMA-CRISTAL), U-Net and IST achieve comparable performance, conserving &gt;91% flux and increasing SNR by &gt;6. However, for observations with complex morphologies absent in the training set (W2246), the U-Net underperforms relative to IST, recovering ~80% flux, while IST robustly conserves flux and improves SNR by ~3, highlighting generalisation challenges and the need for physically-motivated training priors. We conclude that IST is a robust unsupervised denoiser for moderate-SNR data, and a synthetically trained U-Net generalises effectively to real data, dependent on training priors. This framework offers a pathway for transferable denoising for ALMA, VLT/MUSE, and JWST.

### 43) [2602.10682](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10682v1): JWST spectra are consistent with the edge-on star-forming galaxy scenario for the "runaway supermassive black hole"

<p> Jorge Sanchez Almeida, Ignacio Trujillo, Sebastian F. Sanchez, Mireia Montes </p>
<p>
The linear structure reported by van Dokkum et al. (2023) has been proposed as either a massive stellar wake produced by a runaway supermassive black hole (SMBH) or a bulgeless edge-on galaxy. New JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations target the tip of the structure, where a SMBH would produce a bow shock, whereas a normal galaxy would host an HII region. Using standard BPT diagrams ([OIII]5007/Hb vs [NII]6583/Ha and [OIII]5007/Hb vs [OII]6716,6731/Ha), we find that the line ratios at the tip fall on the locus of low-metallicity low-extinction HII regions. This region does not overlap with loci typical of shocks in merging galaxies. Thus, these results are consistent with the interpretation that the linear structure is a star-forming galaxy, with the bright knot representing one of its HII regions.

Understanding the earliest stage of star and planet formation requires detailed observations to address the connection and interplay between the accretion, outflow and disk evolution. We present results from the observations of the low luminosity (L_bol~~0.2~L<sub>&odot;</sub>) and mass (M_*~ 0.15~M<sub>&odot;</sub>) Class~0 protostar IRAS 16253-2429, conducted as part of the iteDisk ALMA large program and the JWST cycle-1 GO program itIPA. Observations reveal a wide hourglass-shaped continuum cavity traced in scattered light (at ≤~5~μm), with a brighter, extended northern side. We detect 15 pure rotational H<sub>2</sub> transitions (E_up:~1015&ndash;21411~K), revealing a wide-angle molecular outflow. The outflow width (as traced in H<sub>2</sub>~0-0~S(11)) at the protostellar location measures ≤35 au, slightly larger than the dust and Keplerian disk diameters (~30 au) but wider than the 20&ndash;23~au jet width in [Fe II]. The opening angle narrows from 40&ndash;35\arcdeg for the low-J H<sub>2</sub> lines (up to S(5)) and the cold gas component (ALMA ^12CO) to ~28&ndash;19\arcdeg for the high-J H<sub>2</sub> lines (S(7)&ndash;S(11)). Position-velocity diagrams of H<sub>2</sub> reveal higher velocities for higher E_up, ranging from ~12.5 km~s<sup>-1</sup> for H<sub>2</sub>~0-0~S(1) and S(2) to ~28.5 km~s<sup>-1</sup> for H<sub>2</sub>~0-0~S(5)~and~S(7) with respect to the mean flow velocity. The nested excitation and velocity structure of the collimated jet and wide angle wind suggest a magnetohydrodynamic wind as a likely launching mechanism, similar to the findings in other protostars and Class II sources. The lower velocity mm CO may be gas from the infalling envelope accelerated outwards by the wide angle wind along the cavity walls.

<p> Viacheslav V. Klimenko, Varsha P. Kulkarni, Monique C. Aller </p>
<p>
Interstellar dust plays a crucial role in gas cooling and molecule formation, influencing galaxy evolution. However, the composition and structure of dust in distant galaxies are still poorly understood. We have started a JWST MIRI MRS program investigating the dust features in gas-rich and dusty galaxies at redshifts z&lt;1.2, with strong 2175~Å bumps detected in absorption along the lines of sight to distant background quasars. Here we describe our program strategy, and present MIRI MRS observations of IR dust features at z=0.5-1.2 in five quasar spectra that form the first part of our full sample. We identify artifacts in MIRI MRS data that affect the background in IFU cubes, and propose methods to reduce their effects. We pay special attention to modeling the quasar mid-IR continuum, which shows significant variation depending on AGN morphology, redshift, and black hole mass. Dust in foreground galaxies produces significant absorption from the 10~μm silicate feature in all five quasar spectra. Compared with the average 10~μm silicate feature in the diffuse ISM of the Milky Way, we find differences in the absorption peak position, width of the features, and asymmetry of the profiles. A detailed study of these silicate features is presented in our next paper (Klimenko et al. 2026b). In two quasar spectra, we tentatively detect weak IR features near 3.0 and 3.4~μm. Their strengths are comparable to those seen in the Milky Way ISM, but follow-up observations are required to confirm these detections.

<p>
Here we analyse the growth and feedback effects of massive black holes (MBHs) in the SEEDZ simulations. The most massive black holes grow to masses of ~10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> by z=12.5 during short bursts of super-Eddington accretion, sustained over a period of 5-30 Myr. We find that the determining factor that cuts off this initial growth is feedback from the MBH itself, rather than nearby supernovae or exhausting the available gas reservoir. Our simulations show that for the most actively accreting MBHs, feedback completely evacuates the gas from the host halo and ejects it into the inter-galactic medium. Despite implementing a relatively weak feedback model, the energy injected into the gas surrounding the MBH exceeds the binding energy of the halo. These results either indicate that MBH feedback in the early (ΛCDM) Universe is much weaker than previously assumed, or that at least some of the high redshift galaxies we currently observe with JWST formed via a two-step process, whereby a MBH initially quenches its host galaxy and later reconstitutes its baryonic reservoir, either through mergers with gas rich galaxies or from accretion from the cosmic web. Moreover, the maximum black hole masses that emerge in SEEDZ are effectively set by a combination of MBH feedback modelling and the binding potential of the host halo. Unless feedback is extremely ineffective at early times (for example if growth is merger dominated rather than accretion dominated or feedback is contained close to the MBH) then the maximum mass of black holes at redshift before 12.5 should not significantly exceed 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>.

<p>
Low-mass or dwarf galaxies (M<sub>&ast;</sub>&lt;10^9 M&odot;) are abundant in the Universe, yet their formation and evolution remain poorly understood. Their enhanced sensitivity to feedback from star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN) make them excellent laboratories to test whether feedback prescriptions in cosmological simulations accurately reproduce their interstellar medium (ISM) properties. We present JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging of nine dwarf galaxies from COSMOS-Web survey at redshift z&lt;0.08, with star formation rates ranging from 0.003-0.3 M&odot; yr^-1 and stellar masses of log M<sub>&ast;</sub>~8-9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. The detection rate with both NIRCam and MIRI is 100&percnt;, indicating that these dwarfs possess substantial ISM content. The detected sample includes a roughly equal mix of early-type and late-type dwarfs, suggesting that it is representative of the broader dwarf galaxy population in low-density environments. We find that the observed MIRI flux distributions are comparable to forward-modelled flux distributions of mass-matched simulated galaxies in TNG50. We further conduct a multi-wavelength morphological analysis complementing the JWST NIRCam and MIRI imaging with archival HST/ACS data, employing the CAS (concentration, asymmetry, smoothness) framework. Among the multi-wavelength images, MIRI exhibits the largest variation in CAS parameters, likely due to dust lanes and clumps in several galaxies, also suggested by Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting. This suggests that the dust content in these systems may be higher than those implied by rest-frame optical or near-infrared observations alone. Upcoming UV/optical and mid-infrared spectroscopic follow-up will be critical for constraining the gas kinematics and dust grain properties of dwarf galaxies in low-density environments such as COSMOS.

### 48) [2602.09091](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09091v1): All the Massive Galaxy Overdensities during Reionization: JWST Rest-Frame Optical Selection Reveals Young, Chemically Evolved Galaxies Embedded in Dense, Neutral Gas at z &gt; 5

The high-redshift progenitors of present-day galaxy clusters are believed to substantially contribute to the global star-formation rate density and drive the large-scale reionization of the Universe. Here we present a blind and unbiased search for and characterization of galaxy overdensities during the reionization epoch at redshifts z~ 5.5-7, based on rest-frame optical JWST/NIRCam grism spectroscopy of the Abell 2744 lensing field as part of the JWST-ALT survey. Using a physically-motivated, cosmological inference Friends-of-Friends (FoF) algorithm, we identify six galaxy overdensities, including five robust systems at z=5.66 to 6.77. They are all characterized by total halo masses M_halo ≳ 10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub> inferred from a range of proxies. We find that the galaxy members in these overdense environments are on average less massive though equally metal-rich, and generally comprised of younger stellar populations as indicated from their bluer spectral slopes less prominent Balmer breaks, than field galaxies at similar redshifts. Further, we use this novel rest-frame optical selection of galaxy proto-clusters to infer the fraction and 3D distribution of strong Lyman-α emitters (LAEs) and damped Lyman-α absorbers (DLAs) in the overdensity environments. We find that two out of six galaxy overdensities have excess \hi absorption compared to the field-average, while the other four are consistent within their large scatter in density. These results present the first direct observational constraints on the tomography of the dense, neutral gas reservoirs in large-scale galaxy overdensities at z&gt;5 and highlight the limitations of pre-JWST searches for reionization-era galaxy overdensities relying on the detection of strong LAEs alone.[Abridged]

### 49) [2602.08824](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08824v1): CHIMPS2: The physical properties and star formation efficiency of molecular gas in the Central Molecular Zone

<p> S. M. King, T. J. T. Moore, S. N. Longmore, D. J. Eden, J. D. Henshaw, A. J. Rigby, R. Rani </p>
<p>
We present Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) estimates of the physical properties and star formation efficiency (SFE) of molecular gas in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), using new ^12CO J=2\to1 observations from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. Combined with CHIMPS2 ^12CO and ^13CO J=3\to2, and SEDIGISM ^13CO J=2\to1 data, we estimate a median excitation temperature of T_ex = 11K for ^13CO throughout the CMZ, with peaks exceeding 120K in the Sgr B1/B2 complex. Cooler gas dominates around Sgr A and nearby clouds. We derive a median H<sub>2</sub> column-density of N(H2) = 2 × 10^22 cm<sup>2</sup> and a total ^13CO-traced gas mass of M_gas = 7 × 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, consistent with previous estimates when accounting for spatial coverage. The instantaneous SFE is assessed using Hi-GAL compact sources detected at 70-μm and 160&ndash;500-μm. The 70-μm-bright SFE, tracing current star formation, is modest overall but elevated in Sgr B1/B2, the Arches cluster, and Sgr C. In contrast, the 160&ndash;500-μm SFE, tracing cold pre-stellar gas, is more broadly enhanced, particularly in the dust ridge clouds and towards negative longitudes surrounding Sgr C. The contrasting distributions suggest an evolutionary gradient in SFE, consistent with a transition from dense, cold gas to embedded protostars. Our results imply that the CMZ may be enter a more active phase of star formation, with large reservoirs of gas primed for future activity.

### 50) [2602.08447](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08447v2): Stratification of the AGN-Driven multi-phase outflows in the dwarf Seyfert galaxy NGC 4395

<p> Payel Nandi, Luis Colina, Rogemar A. Riffel, Miguel Pereira Santaella, C. S. Stalin, D. J. Saikia, Javier Alvarez-Marquez, Markus Kissler-Patig </p>
<p>
We present a multi-wavelength study of nuclear outflows in the nearby dwarf Seyfert galaxy NGC~4395, which hosts an intermediate-mass black hole. Using itJWST/NIRSpec and MIRI IFU spectroscopy (1.66&ndash;28.6~μm), together with ALMA and Gemini/GMOS data, we probe the ionised and molecular gas on parsec scales. The JWST nuclear spectra reveal 134 emission lines, including H sci, He, numerous fine-structure lines, H<sub>2</sub> rotational/ro-vibrational transitions, and several PAH bands. Modelling of the H<sub>2</sub> rotational lines reveals three warm/hot molecular components (T\!≈\!580, 1480, and 2900~K), along with a cold (&lt;50~K) phase traced by ALMA CO(2&ndash;1). Outflow signatures are detected in cold and warm/hot molecular gas, in H sci, and in 36 fine-structure lines spanning ionisation potentials of 7.6&ndash;300~eV. Ionised outflow velocities range from 127 to 716~km s<sup>-1</sup>, with blueshifted and redshifted components consistent with a stratified biconical geometry. The cold molecular gas shows a mass outflow rate nearly 1&ndash;2 orders of magnitude larger than that of the warm/hot molecular and ionised phases. The kinetic coupling efficiency is 0.003&ndash;0.12&percnt; for the coronal-line gas and 0.4&ndash;1.4&percnt; for the H sci outflow, indicating that only the low-ionisation gas significantly impacts the surrounding ISM. Outflow velocity and the fraction of flux in the outflowing component increase with ionisation potential, implying that the most highly ionised gas originates closest to the AGN and is most efficiently accelerated.

### 51) [2602.07347](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07347v1): Clump-Scale Dust Attenuation in Epoch of Reionization Galaxies: Spatially Resolved Properties from FirstLight Simulations

<p> Yurina Nakazato, Kosei Matsumoto, Akio K. Inoue, Daniel Ceverino, Takashi Hosokawa, Daisuke Toyouchi </p>
<p>
Understanding dust attenuation in galaxies at both integrated and spatially resolved scales is fundamental for accurately determining the physical properties of galaxies. Recent high-spatial-resolution observations with ALMA and JWST enable investigations of spatially resolved properties in high-redshift galaxies (z ≳ 6), but spatial variations in dust properties remain poorly constrained. We use cosmological zoom-in simulations combined with post-processing dust radiative transfer calculations for 376 clumpy galaxies at z=6-9 with stellar masses of M_* ≳ 10^9   M<sub>&odot;</sub>. For each system, we investigate dust attenuation and re-emission properties for three components: system-integrated, individual clumps, and diffuse regions. We find that system-integrated attenuation curves are grayer than the Calzetti curve, even when assuming MW- or SMC-type dust. Attenuation curves of individual clumps are even grayer, while diffuse regions exhibit steeper curves owing to enhanced scattering in optically thin environments. Since the effects of optical depth and dust-star geometry are intrinsically degenerate in attenuation curves, we introduce a toy model based on the IRX-Δβ plane, where Δβ denotes the difference between attenuated and intrinsic UV slopes. Applying this framework, we find that clumps have dust column densities approximately an order of magnitude higher than system-integrated values and exhibit co-spatial or dust-extended geometries. In contrast, system-integrated attenuation reflects star-extended geometries driven by contributions from optically thin diffuse regions. We apply this framework to REBELS-IFU galaxies at z ~ 7 and find good agreement with our simulation predictions.

### 52) [2602.07159](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07159v1): The stellar velocity anisotropy of strong lensing massive elliptical galaxies and its role in the inference of the Hubble parameter H_0 using spatially resolved kinematics

<p> Vishal Verma, Quinn Minor </p>
<p>
One of the biggest challenges in cosmology, the Hubble Tension, requires independent measurements of H_0, and strong lensing with time-delay cosmography is a promising avenue. The inclusion of spatially resolved kinematic data helps break the mass&ndash;sheet degeneracy, a key limitation in strong lensing. Kinematics, however, suffers from its own degeneracy due to unknown stellar velocity anisotropy, which can bias galaxy mass profile inferences. We investigate the bias in H_0 using a sample of ten massive elliptical galaxies at z=0.2 from the Illustris TNG100 simulations. We generate mock line-of-sight velocity-dispersion maps resembling JWST NIRSpec observations and test four anisotropy models: Osipkov&ndash;Merritt (OM), Mamon&ndash;Lokas (ML), constant β, and a generalized&ndash;OM (gOM) profile, under both kinematics-only and joint kinematics plus strong lensing analyses. We find a sub-percent average bias in H_0 across ten galaxies with joint modeling for three models: +0.2 ± 1.6&percnt; (ML), -0.9 ± 1.9&percnt; (constant) and -0.9 ± 1.6&percnt; (gOM), with ~ 5&percnt; scatter. Joint modeling reduces bias, improves precision, and mitigates outlier results. Overall, the gOM model best recovers galaxy parameters and delivers the most accurate H_0 relative to posterior uncertainties considering both analyses. However, the single-parameter OM model produces large systematic biases: with kinematics only data, H_0 errors can exceed 20&percnt;, and even with joint modeling, produces an overall bias of +11.5 ± 1.3&percnt; (OM). The higher bias in OM is unlikely to average out across an ensemble of galaxies. Our findings highlight the impact of anisotropy assumptions on H_0 inference and, more broadly, in galaxy dynamics.

### 53) [2602.07124](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07124v1): AGN versus Star-formation: A MUSE Analysis of NGC 1365

<p> Kyla Mullaney, Kelly E. Whalen, Jenna Cann, Kimberly Weaver, Jeffrey McKaig, Sara Doan </p>
<p>
Active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star formation feedback may heat and remove gas from galaxies in a process that quenches ongoing star formation and shapes the evolution of galaxies. Potential impacts from these processes can be seen in the complex and interconnected signatures of AGN and star formation activity throughout a galaxy. Here, we analyze archival integral field unit (IFU) data for the nearby Seyfert galaxy, NGC 1365, as observed with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Our analysis probes the ionization and kinematic properties of NGC 1365 at high spatial resolution over unprecedentedly large physical scales (approximately 40 kpc), allowing us to trace the effects of feedback throughout nearly an entire galaxy. We use these optical IFU data in conjunction with observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Chandra X-ray Observatory to analyze and compare maps of emission line flux, ionization state, star formation, and gas kinematics. In doing so, we identify a region of BPT-identified unexpectedly high ionization relative to surrounding areas in the star forming arms, and work to identify its source, finding that shock heating may play a significant role. Results from this analysis allow us to place constraints on the relative impact of AGN and star formation processes on the star forming gas in NGC 1365, as well as begin to inform our understanding on the global impacts of feedback in galaxy populations as a whole.

### 54) [2602.15047](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15047v1): Model selection with the Pantheon+ Type Ia SN sample

<p> Namit Chandak, Fulvio Melia, Junjie Wei </p>
<p>
Recent discoveries, e.g., by JWST and DESI, have elevated the level of tension with inflationary ΛCDM. For example, the empirical evidence now suggests that the standard model violates at least one of the energy conditions from general relativity, which were designed to ensure that systems have positive energy, attractive gravity and non-superluminal energy flows. In this Letter, we use a recently compiled Type Ia supernova sample to examine whether ΛCDM violates the energy conditions in the local Universe, and carry out model selection with its principal competitor, the R_h=ct universe. We derive model-independent constraints on the distance modulus based on the energy conditions and compare these with the Hubble diagram predicted by both ΛCDM and R_h=ct, using the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova catalog. We find that ΛCDM violates the strong energy condition over the redshift range z \subset (0, 2), whereas R_h=ct satisfies all four energy constraints. At the same time, R_h=ct is favored by these data over ΛCDM with a likelihood of ~ 89.5&percnt; versus ~ 10.5&percnt;. The R_h=ct model without inflation is strongly favored by the Type Ia supernova data over the currrent standard model, while simultaneously adhering to the general relativistic energy conditions at both high and low redshifts.

Setton, Wendy Q. Sun, John R. Weaver, Katherine E. Whitaker, Adi Zitrin </p>
<p>
Little red dots (LRDs) are an abundant population of compact high-redshift sources with red rest-frame optical continua, discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Their red colors and power sources have been attributed either to dust reddening of standard hot accretion disks or to intrinsically cool thermal emission from dense hydrogen envelopes, in both cases surrounding accreting supermassive black holes. These scenarios predict order-of-magnitude differences in emission temperature but have lacked decisive temperature diagnostics. Here we report a prominent absorption feature at rest-frame ~ 1.4   μm in two out of four LRDs at z ~ 2 with high signal-to-noise JWST spectra, among the coolest from a large LRD sample. The feature matches the shape and wavelength of the water absorption band seen in cool stars. Atmosphere models require T ≲ 3000  K to reproduce it, confirming unambiguously the presence of a cool, dense gas component contributing 20-30&percnt; to the emergent continuum. A composite model reproduces both the absorption and the rest-frame optical-to-infrared continuum shape and suggests a temperature range (~2000  K - 4000   K) rather than a single blackbody predicted by some gas envelope models. Molecular absorption demonstrates that the red continua of some LRDs are intrinsic rather than dust-reddened, implying order-of-magnitude lower bolometric luminosities and black-hole masses, and providing a new diagnostic of the emitting gas.

Sanders, Dirk Scholte, Maya Skarbinski, Thomas M. Stanton, Vivienne Wild </p>
<p>
We present deep, medium-resolution λ=1-5 μm JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy for 14 quiescent galaxies at 3&lt;z&lt;5 with log_10(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &gt; 10, obtained as part of the EXCELS survey. We perform a complete re-reduction of these data, including a custom optimal-extraction approach to combat the spectral "wiggles" that result from undersampling of the NIRSpec spatial PSF. We constrain the star-formation histories and stellar metallicities of these objects via full-spectral fitting, finding a clear stellar age vs stellar mass correlation, in which more massive galaxies assembled their stellar mass at earlier times. This confirms spectroscopically that the archaeological "downsizing" trend was already in place by z≃4. The slope of our measured relation (≃1.5 Gyr per dex in stellar mass) is consistent with literature results at 0 &lt; z &lt; 3. We do not observe objects with log_10(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≲10.5 and ages of more than a few hundred Myr at this epoch, suggesting that recently reported examples of higher-redshift quiescent galaxies at these masses are likely to soon rejuvenate. We measure relatively high stellar metallicities for the majority of our sample, consistent with similar objects at 0 &lt; z &lt; 3. Finally, we explore evidence for α-enhancement in six older and more luminous galaxies within our sample, finding considerable disagreements in the chemical abundances measured using different stellar population models, different fitted rest-frame wavelength ranges, star-formation history models and fitting codes. We therefore conclude that inferring detailed stellar chemical abundances for the earliest quiescent galaxies remains challenging, and higher signal-to-noise spectra are required (SNR per resolution element &gt;100 for R≃1000).

### 57) [2602.05921](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05921v1): Early growth of massive black holes in dynamical dark energy models with negative cosmological constant

<p> N. Menci, M. Castellano, P. Mukherjee, D. Roberts, P. Santini, A. A. Sen, F. Shankar </p>
<p>
Recent results from combined cosmological probes indicate that the Dark Energy component of the Universe could be dynamical. The simplest explanation envisages the presence of a quintessence field rolling into a potential, where the Dark Energy energy density parameter Ω_DE=Ω_Λ+Ω_x results from the contribution of the ground state energy Ω_Λ and the scalar field energy Ω_x. Provided that Ω_DE≈ 0.7, negative values of Ω_Λ can be consistent with current measurements from cosmological probes, and could help in explaining the large abundance of bright galaxies observed by JWST at z&gt; 10, largely exceeding the pre-JWST expectations in a ΛCDM Universe. Here we explore to what extent such a scenario can account also for the early presence of massive Black Holes (BHs) with masses M_BH≳ 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub> observed at z≳ 8, and for the large over-abundance of AGN with respect to pre-JWST expectations. Our aim is not to provide a detailed description of BH growth, but rather to compute the maximal BH growth that can occur in cosmological models with negative Ω_Λ under the simple assumption of Eddington-limited accretion onto initial light Black Hole seeds with mass M_seed~ 10^2 M<sub>&odot;</sub> originated from PopIII stars. To this aim we develop a simple analytic framework to connect the growth of dark matter halos to the maximal growth of BHs within the above assumptions. We show such models can account for present observations assuming values of Ω_Λ≈ -1, simultaneously boosting both galaxy and AGN number counts without invoking any additional physics. This would allow us to trace the observed excess of bright and massive galaxies and the early formation of massive Black Holes and the abundance of AGN to the same cosmological origin.

<p>
Radio observations offer a dust-independent probe of star formation and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, but sufficiently deep data are required to access the crossover luminosity between these processes at high redshift (z&gt;4.5). We present three spectroscopically confirmed high-redshift radio sources (HzRSs) detected at 1.3 GHz at z=4.9-5.6, with radio luminosities spanning L_1.3   GHz≈2-5×10^24   W   Hz^-1. These sources were first identified as high-redshift candidates through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of archival Hubble, JWST NIRCam+MIRI, and ground-based photometry, and then spectroscopically confirmed via the H α emission line using wide-field slitless spectroscopy from JWST COSMOS-3D. The star formation rates (SFRs) measured from SED fitting, the H α flux, and the 1.3 GHz luminosity, span ~100-1800  M<sub>&odot;</sub>   yr^-1, demonstrating broad agreement between these SFR tracers. We find that these three sources lie either on or 0.5-1.0 dex above the star-forming main sequence at z=4-6 and have undergone a recent burst of star formation. The sources have extended rest-UV/optical morphologies with no evidence for a dominant point source component, indicating that an AGN is unlikely to dominate their rest-UV and optical emission. Two of the sources have complex, multi-component rest-frame UV/optical morphologies, suggesting that their starbursts may be triggered by merging activity. These HzRSs open up a new window towards probing radio emission powered by star formation alone at z&gt; 4.5, representing a remarkable opportunity to begin tracing star formation, independent of dust, in the early Universe.

### 59) [2602.05411](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05411v1): Mergers Drive Structural Complexity but Not Starbursts in Lyman-α Emitters at 3 &lt; z &lt; 4: A JWST Spatially Resolved View

<p> Qi Song, F. S. Liu, Jian Ren, Tianfu Gao, Pinsong Zhao, Qifan Cui, Yubin Li, Hao Mo, Guanghuan Wang </p>
<p>
Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal that the merger fraction among Lyα emitters (LAEs) at redshifts z &gt; 3 is significantly higher than previously estimated. In this study, we focus on three high signal-to-noise merging LAE systems at 3 &lt; z &lt; 4, selected from the VLT/MUSE-Deep survey in the GOODS-S field. We combine new itJWST/NIRCam broadband and medium-band imaging with archival itHST/ACS data to perform spatially resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using the scBagpipes software package. Our analysis reveals that two of the systems are minor mergers, while the third is a major merger. The close agreement between spatially resolved and integrated stellar mass estimates indicates that recent star formation does not significantly outshine the light from older stellar populations in these systems. Moreover, both the individual components and the systems as a whole lie on the star-forming main sequence, further supporting the conclusion that these mergers have not yet triggered substantial starburst activity. Furthermore, we detect prominent color gradients and disturbed dust distributions in these merging systems, indicating that the mergers have already induced significant internal structural perturbations. These morphological and dust-related changes may facilitate the escape of Lyα photons &ndash; potentially through mechanisms such as gas redistribution or a reduced covering fraction of neutral hydrogen &ndash; thereby playing a key role in shaping the observed properties of LAEs.

### 60) [2602.05383](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05383v1): A Chemistry-First Centered Icy Chemical Inventory of Protostellar Sources with JWST

<p>
The chemical evolution in star forming regions is driven by the interplay between gas and ice mantles. Identifying the ice compositions at the early stage of star formation thus provides constraints on the chemical processes inaccessible from gas-phase characterizations. As part of the CORINOS program, spectra from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) MIRI MRS were taken toward four Class 0 protostars: IRAS 15398-3359, Ser-emb7, L483, and B335. The spectra were processed with simultaneous fitting of a continuum and silicate absorption to produce optical depth mid-infrared spectra of the ices at 5-28 μm (360-2000 cm^-1) toward these four sources. Simple molecules such as water (H<sub>2</sub>O), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methanol (CH_3OH), formic acid/formate (HCOOH/HCOO^-), ammonia/ammonium (NH_3/NH_4^+), and formaldehyde (H<sub>2</sub>CO) are the most abundant features in these ices, while complex organic molecules (COMs) represent a smaller contribution. Likely COMs include hydroxylamine (NH<sub>2</sub>OH), methylamine (CH_3NH<sub>2</sub>), and ethanol (CH_3CH<sub>2</sub>OH). Absorption features belonging to functional groups such as -CH_3 and -OH suggest that additional COMs are present, but these cannot be unambiguously assigned due to overlapping bands. Formation pathways toward these COMs utilizing radical-radical combination reactions based on laboratory simulation experiments is presented. By extension, COMs predicted by these reactions, but absent from the spectra, are discussed. The results provide insight into the chemical environment of these ices and also highlight the critical need for caution and sufficient evidence in order to confidently identify COMs in ice.

### 61) [2602.05135](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05135v1): Growth of High-Redshift Quasars from Fermion Dark Matter Seeds

<p> Yu Wang, Remo Ruffini </p>
<p>
Quasars hosting ≳ 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> black holes at z&gt;6 challenge growth scenarios that start from light seeds and assume accretion within already formed galaxies. Motivated by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discovery of Little Red Dots (LRDs), which suggests that ~ 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> black holes can be active in compact, pre-galactic environments, we revisit early black hole growth with a minimal cosmology-based framework. We model the accretion history as the smaller of the Bondi inflow rate and the Eddington-limited rate, where the Bondi rate is set by the supply of overdense primordial gas whose density declines with cosmic expansion, and the Eddington rate captures regulation by radiative feedback. By fitting the observed masses and luminosities of J0313&ndash;1806 (z=7.64) and J0100+2802 (z=6.30) with Bayesian inference, we infer initial conditions that favor massive seed black holes with initial mass M_0 ~ 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, formed at z~20-30 in environments with baryonic overdensity factors f_ρ≳ 50 relative to the cosmic mean. The resulting growth histories include a prolonged supply-limited stage, and they reproduce the observed quasar masses without requiring sustained Eddington accretion or any super-Eddington episodes. The inferred seed mass scale is consistent with black holes produced by the collapse of quantum-degenerate fermion dark matter cores, providing a physically defined pathway to massive seeds at the redshifts implied by LRD phenomenology.

### 62) [2602.04997](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04997v1): The CON-quasar stage of IRAS 07251-0248 E

<p> Eduardo González-Alfonso, Miguel Pereira-Santaella, Ismael García-Bernete, Jacqueline Fischer, Giovanna Speranza </p>
<p>
ALMA continuum measurements of the local ULIRG IRAS 07251-0248 E at 667μm reveal an extremely compact (R &lt; 27 pc) and bright (T_B &gt;200 K) nucleus with an absorbing foreground envelope and a surrounding (R ~ 75 pc) disk or torus seen nearly face-on. The bright and unresolved nuclear emission implies large optical depths (τ_667μm &gt;0.5, corresponding to N_H &gt; 10^25 cm<sup>2</sup>) of hot dust at &gt;500 K. In addition, JWST observations of the source show strong mid-infrared (mid-IR) absorption in the ro-vibrational bands of H2O nu_2=1-0 (5-7 μm) and of other species including CO, HCN, C2H2, CH4, and CO2, and Herschel/PACS observations exhibit strong and saturated absorption due to OH, H2O, CH^+, and CH. We propose a model in which the unresolved ALMA submillimeter and JWST mid-IR continua trace the same nuclear source, the former penetrating deep into the nucleus and the latter probing the nuclear photosphere. The continuum model, which includes trapping of photons (the "greenhouse" effect), indicates that the nuclear (R_h ~ 13 pc) luminosity and luminosity surface density are ~10^12 Lsun and Σ_bol~ 5e8 Lsun pc^-2, arising from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) so buried that high-ionization lines are completely obscured. The observed mid-IR gas-phase molecular bands probe outflowing gas with velocities of ~160 km s<sup>-1</sup> and are reproduced with the predicted T_dust profile, while the far-IR molecular absorption lines are generated in the surrounding thick disk or torus with τ_100 μm~10. We conclude that IRAS 07251-0248 harbors a compact obscured nucleus (CON) that hides an AGN currently emitting at quasar luminosity. While the observed outflow could be driven by radiation pressure, we favor the scenario of a (partially) energy-conserving hot bubble caught in a very early phase of the expulsion of the highly concentrated gas at the galactic nucleus.

<p>
We present a systematic study of the environments of 25 luminous quasars at z &gt; 6.5 from the ASPIRE program. Using JWST/NIRCam WFSS data, we identified 487 galaxies at 5.3 ≲ z ≲ 7.0 exhibiting [OIII] emission. Among these, 122 [OIII] emitters lie within |Δv_los| &lt; 1000~km~s<sup>-1</sup> of the quasars, corresponding to a ~9.4-fold enhancement relative to the average galaxy density at other redshifts. Furthermore, we identified 16 [CII]-emitting galaxies at the quasar redshifts from ALMA mosaic observations. A cross-correlation function (CCF) analysis between quasars and [OIII]+[CII] emitters yields a cross-correlation length of r_0^QG = 8.68^+0.51_-0.55~h^-1~cMpc and a auto-correlation of r_0^QQ=15.76^+2.48_-2.70~h^-1~cMpc, indicating that z ~ 7 quasars reside in dark matter halos with M_halo = 10^12.27^+0.21_-0.26~M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Notably, the number of [OIII]-emitting galaxies at quasar redshifts varies significantly from field to field, ranging from zero to twenty, highlighting a diverse quasar environment. Remarkably, seven quasars trace significant galaxy overdensities (i.e., protoclusters), with δ_gal &gt; 5 within a volume of V ~ 500~cMpc^3. We also find that |Δv_los| increases rapidly toward smaller galaxy-quasar separations in protocluster fields, consistent with galaxy kinematics around extremely massive halos in cosmological simulations. By combining JWST and ALMA data, we reveal the complex and diverse environments of these early quasars, providing robust evidence that the earliest luminous quasars are effective tracers of galaxy overdensities, albeit with substantial field-to-field variation.

<p>
We use data from the JWST ASPIRE Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS) program to measure the auto-correlation function of [O,\sc iii] emitters at 5.3&lt;z&lt;7.0 and the quasar&ndash;[O,\sc iii] emitter cross-correlation around 25 ASPIRE quasars (6.51&lt;z&lt;6.82; &langle; z&rangle;=6.6). We use synthetic source injection to calibrate the selection function, which we combine with the large-volume FLAMINGO-10k simulation (2.8,cGpc box) to construct realistic mock observations. Our simulation-based approach captures nonlinear structure growth and scale-dependent bias on small scales and derives covariance matrices that include cosmic variance. The clustering yields correlation lengths of r_0^GG=4.7^+0.4 -0.5,h^-1,cMpc for the [O,\sc iii] auto-correlation with fixed slope γGG=1.8, and r_0^QG=8.7^+0.8 -0.9,h^-1,cMpc for the quasar&ndash;[O,\sc iii] cross-correlation with γQG=2.0. We infer log(M_h,min^[O,III]/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=10.5^+0.1 -0.1 for [O,\sc iii] emitters and log(Mh,min^QSO/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=12.1^+0.3 -0.4 for quasars. These imply duty cycles of 2.5^+1.0 -0.8,per,cent for [O,\sc iii] emitters and 0.3^+4.0 -0.3,per,cent for quasars, corresponding to UV-bright lifetimes of tQ=2.6^+30_-2.5,Myr (less than 10,per,cent of a Salpeter e-folding time). The results indicate that the observed UV-luminous phase contributes little to total SMBH growth, placing tight constraints on early black-hole formation.

### 65) [2602.04967](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04967v1): Abundant hydrocarbons in a buried galactic nucleus with signs of carbonaceous grain and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon processing

<p> I. García-Bernete, M. Pereira-Santaella, E. González-Alfonso, M. Agúndez, D. Rigopoulou, F. R. Donnan, G. Speranza, N. Thatte </p>
<p>
Hydrocarbons play a key role in shaping the chemistry of the interstellar medium (ISM), but their enrichment and relationship with carbonaceous grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) still lack clear observational constraints. We report JWST NIRSpec+MIRI/MRS infrared (IR; 3-28 micron) observations of the local ultra-luminous IR galaxy (ULIRG) IRAS 07251-0248, revealing the extragalactic detection of small gas-phase hydrocarbons such as benzene (C_6H_6), triacetylene (C_6H<sub>2</sub>), diacetylene (C_4H<sub>2</sub>), acetylene (C_2H<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH_4), and methyl radical (CH_3) as well as deep amorphous C-H absorptions in the solid phase. The unexpectedly high abundance of these molecules indicates an extremely rich hydrocarbon chemistry, not explained by high-temperature gas-phase chemistry, ice desorption or oxygen depletion. Instead, the most plausible explanation is the erosion and fragmentation of carbonaceous grains and PAHs. This scenario is supported by the correlation between the abundance of one of their main fragmentation products, C_2H<sub>2</sub>, and cosmic ray (CR) ionization rate for a sample of local ULIRGs. These hydrocarbons are outflowing at ~160 km/s, which may represent a potential formation pathway for hydrogenated amorphous grains. Our results suggest that IRAS 07251-0248 might not be unique but represents an extreme example of the commonly rich hydrocarbon chemistry prevalent in deeply obscured galactic nuclei.

### 66) [2602.04947](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04947v1): Tidal disruption event rates across cosmic time: forecasts for LSST, Roman, and JWST and their constraints on the supermassive black hole mass function

<p> Mitchell Karmen, Suvi Gezari, Colin Norman, Muryel Guolo </p>
<p>
Measuring the mass distribution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) over cosmic time remains particularly challenging for the low mass (M<sub>&bull;</sub>≲10^8~M<sub>&odot;</sub>) population at z&gt;1. This population is also the most sensitive to SMBH seeding and early growth models. In this work we construct a semi-empirical model for the redshift evolution of the TDE rate under multiple SMBH mass function prescriptions, and show that the observed redshift-dependent rate of TDEs is very sensitive to the SMBH mass function and its evolution with redshift. We further incorporate galaxy-scale processes that evolve with redshift &ndash; namely, increasing galaxy nuclear stellar densities, enhanced galaxy-galaxy merger rates, dust obscuration, and a possible top-heavy IMF at early cosmic times &ndash; and quantify their combined impact on the TDE rate. We find that including these effects generally results in a volumetric TDE rate that increases with redshift until a maximum near cosmic noon, before declining at higher redshift where SMBHs that can disrupt stars become increasingly scarce. We forecast TDE rates in the Rubin LSST and the Roman High Latitude Time Domain Survey, alongside expectations for serendipitous TDE rates in the JWST COSMOS-Web survey. Finally, we provide a methodology for using a flux-limited survey of TDEs in LSST to directly constrain the redshift evolution of the SMBH mass function.

<p>
We present an extensive study of the structure and kinematics of the jet and outflow of EC 53, a Class I protostar with a quasi-periodic variability, using combined James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations. ALMA continuum observations resolve a compact disk with a radius of ~0.14\arcsec (60 au). Scattered light from the outflow cavity is prominent in the short-wavelength NIRCam and NIRSpec observations, revealing only the southeast nearside lobe. We detected 27 H<sub>2</sub> emission lines tracing a narrow, cone-shaped structure within the outflow cavity. A high-velocity ionized jet is detected in several forbidden atomic lines, characterized by a position angle of 142\degree, an opening angle of 1.4\degree, and an estimated geometric launching radius of at most ~40 au. Mid-infrared CO ro-vibrational emission lines, stronger in the P-branch, show a similar distribution to the H<sub>2</sub> emission and are likely to originate from hot gas within the outflow cavity. CO and C_2H emission lines detected by ALMA trace slower, colder outflow components and cavity walls. The spatial and kinematic stratification between the hot atomic and molecular components and the colder molecular gas is consistent with predictions from MHD disk wind models, although envelope material entrained by a wide-angle wind or jet may also contribute. Our analysis highlights the powerful synergy between JWST and ALMA in advancing the understanding of protostellar jets and outflows across multiple spatial and physical scales.

<p>
We systematically search for galaxy overdensities using 20 independent fields with a minimum of six filters (F090W, F115W, F150W, F277W, F356W, and F444W) from BEACON, the JWST Cycle 2 NIRCam pure-parallel imaging survey. We apply an adaptive kernel-density estimation method that incorporates the full photometric redshift probability distribution function of each galaxy to map galaxy overdensities, and identify 207 significant (&gt;4 σ) overdensities at 1.5&lt;z&lt;5. We measure the quenched-galaxy fraction, the median specific star formation rate (sSFR), the total halo mass, and the local galaxy density of each system. By investigating the correlation among these observables, we find that galaxy quenching proceeds in two paths:(i) Overdensities within more massive halos exhibit higher quenched fractions and lower averaged sSFRs. This trend weakens at z≳2, consistent with cold gas streams penetrating shock-heated massive halos and sustaining star formation activity at early times. (ii) We also find a dependence of the same parameters on local densities at z&lt;2, where the quenched fraction increases and the sSFR decreases toward higher densities. The environmental trend in sSFR weakens at z~2&ndash;3 and shows tentative evidence for a reversal at z&gt;3, potentially due to a larger cold gas supply in earlier times. Our study reveals a complex interplay between individual galaxies and large-scale environmental properties, marking the onset of environmental effects on galaxy quenching in massive halos at cosmic noon.

<p> Weiyang Liu, Linhua Jiang </p>
<p>
We present a study of high-redshift Lyα emitters (LAEs) with multiple components using HST and JWST. High-redshift galaxies are mostly point-like objects on ground-based images, but they often exhibit multiple components in higher spatial resolution images. JWST for the first time allow detailed analyses on these individual components. We collect 840 spectroscopically confirmed LAEs at z=2~7 from the literature and nearly 50&percnt; of them appear to have multiple components in JWST images. We further construct a sample of 248 LAEs that have two or more relatively isolated components in a circular aperture of 2\arcsec in diameter. We estimate photometric redshifts for all 593 components of the 248 LAEs, and find that 68&percnt; of them are `real components' with photometric redshifts consistent with the spectroscopic redshifts of the LAEs. The remaining components are mostly foreground objects. The fraction of the `real components' decreases rapidly with the projected distance to the LAE centers from ~80&percnt; at 0\farcs2-0\farcs4 to ~30&percnt; at 0\farcs8-1\farcs0. Our SED modeling results suggest that the majority of the LAEs are young, low-mass, low extinction starburst galaxies (partly due to a selection effect), and their `real components' have stronger star-forming activities than main-sequence galaxies. We investigate the potential impact of the high foreground contamination rate on previous studies based on ground-based images that often use a 2\arcsec aperture for photometry, and find that some of key parameters such as stellar mass would have been largely affected.

Ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) are thought to be a driving mechanism of large-scale winds driven by active galactic nuclei, which cause significant galactic feedback through quenching star formation and regulating supermassive black hole growth. We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium-Resolution Spectrometer observations of two nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), F11119+3257 and F05189-2524, with nuclear X-ray detected UFOs and kiloparsec-scale outflow. These galaxies show remarkably similar mid-infrared continuum and emission line features, notably including a high-velocity v_90 ~ 4000 km s<sup>-1</sup> outflow detected in highly ionized neon emission lines, e.g., \nevi. In F05189-2524, we see a slightly slower biconical outflow extending up to ~2 kpc in the same neon emission lines. Both sources show evidence of AGN-driven radiative feedback through a deficit of rotational molecular hydrogen lines in the nuclear region, &lt;1 kpc from the central quasar, but no clear evidence of any molecular gas entrained in the quasar-driven outflow. Energetic analysis shows that the warm ionized gas in both of these sources contributes minimally (~0.1-5&percnt;) to the momentum outflow rate of these sources and leaves the conclusions of previous literature unchanged: the energetics of these sources are broadly consistent with a momentum-conserving outflow.

Interstellar medium studies rely on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence as a framework for interpretation. In this context, the statistical characterization of interstellar observations is of prime importance. We open a new perspective on diffuse interstellar matter by analyzing James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of the Pleiades nebula with NIRCam. These observations are remarkable in that they provide a microscope view at the cold neutral medium (CNM) with a spatial resolution of 0.2 mpc (40 au). A two-dimensional Fourier analysis is used to characterize the structure of PAH emission in regions near and far from the Pleiades star Merope. To produce maps of the interstellar emission, stars and galaxies are filtered out. The final step in the data cleaning involves subtracting a component, in Fourier space, which we infer to be a residual of the near-infrared cosmic background. The PAH emission power spectra are highly anisotropic. They are well fitted with a break-free power-law, suggesting that we do not observe a specific scale for energy dissipation. Power-law indices are -3.5 near Merope and -3 in the more distant field. The magnetic field orientation, as derived from the Planck dust polarization data, aligns with the PAH anisotropy. The power anisotropy is constant across scales. These findings are discussed in relation to interstellar turbulence that may be driven by the Pleiades stars. The JWST observations of the Pleiades offer a new viewpoint for comparing observations and theoretical models, as they examine physical scales at which turbulence in the CNM is subsonic and decoupled from the thermal instability. The observations may indicate that the turbulent energy cascade in the CNM is anisotropic.

### 72) [2602.03651](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03651v2): Broadband infrared spectroscopy of methanol isotopologues in pure, H2O-rich, and CO-rich ice analogues

<p>
Deuterium fractionation is highly efficient during the early stages of star formation, particularly in starless and prestellar cores where temperatures are low (&lt;10 K) and molecular freeze-out onto dust grains is significant. Methanol forms early in these environments following CO freeze-out via successive hydrogenation reactions on grain surfaces, while the production of deuterated methanol requires elevated gas-phase D/H ratios generated through dissociative recombination of deuterated H3+. Consequently, large abundances of deuterated methanol are observed toward young stellar objects where prestellar ices have recently sublimated. Here, we present laboratory infrared spectra of methanol and its deuterated isotopologues in astrophysical ice analogues, complemented by anharmonic vibrational calculations used to guide band assignments. Experiments were performed at the CASICE laboratory using a Bruker Vertex 70v spectrometer coupled to a closed-cycle helium cryostat, with isotopologue ices deposited at 10 K under high-vacuum conditions. Infrared transmission spectra were recorded over 6000-30 cm-1 (1.67-333 um) and compared with spectra of pure isotopologue ices. Distinctive mid-infrared band patterns are identified for each deuterated species. In particular, CH2DOH exhibits a characteristic doublet at 1293 and 1326 cm-1 (7.73 and 7.54 um), while CHD2OH shows a similar doublet at 1301 and 1329 cm-1 (7.69 and 7.52 um), both remaining largely invariant across all studied ice mixtures. These robust spectral signatures provide reliable tracers for identifying deuterated methanol in JWST observations and for constraining astrochemical gas-grain models of deuterium enrichment prior to star and planet formation.

<p>
The dynamics of the inner regions of young stellar objects (YSOs) is driven by a variety of physical phenomena, from magnetospheres and accretion to the dust sublimation rim and inner disk flows. These inner environments evolve on timescales of hours to days, exactly when bursts, dips, and rapid structural changes carry the most valuable information about star and planet formations, but remain hardly reachable with current facilities. A better reactive infrastructure with six or more telescopes, combined with alerts from large time-domain surveys (e.g., at the era of LSST/Rubin type facilities), and equipped with instruments spanning from the V-band to the thermal infrared (N), would provide the instantaneous uv-coverage and spectral diagnostics needed to unambiguously interpret and image these events as they happen. Such a world's first time-domain interferometric observatory would enable qualitatively new science: directly linking optical and infrared variability to spatially resolved changes in magnetospheric accretion, inner-disk geometry, and dust and gas dynamics in the innermost astronomical unit. Crucially, connecting these processes to outer-scale unresolved information from JWST, ALMA, and the ELT would yield a complete tomography of the planet-forming region.

### 74) [2602.03030](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03030v1): From Grism to IFU: Revising the Redshift and Nature of the Massive Dusty Galaxy S1 with JWST and ALMA

<p>
We report a revised spectroscopic redshift for the dusty massive galaxy S1, previously inferred with an exceptionally high baryon-to-star conversion efficiency from NIRCam slitless grism data at z_grism=5.58. Our new JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations reveal multiple rest-frame optical and NIR emission lines, yielding a secure spectroscopic redshift of z<sub>spec</sub>=3.2439±0.0002. We show that the earlier grism-based redshift resulted from contamination by a nearby galaxy whose dispersed spectral trace overlaps with S1, illustrating a known challenge of slitless spectroscopy when only a single dispersion angle and single emission feature are available. In addition, we present new ALMA 1 mm observations, which robustly detect dust emission (S_1mm=0.99±0.03 mJy) and show a dust half-light radius (R_e,1mm=0.73±0.10 kpc) slightly smaller than the stellar size (R_e, F444W = 0.97±0.01 kpc). Using the revised redshift and compiled multi-wavelength photometry, we update the UV-to-FIR SED and find that S1 is less extreme than previously inferred, yet remains a very massive (logM<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>~10.6), heavily obscured star-forming galaxy. The updated SED modeling reveals S1 to be a very dust- and gas-rich system with a moderate star formation rate and a long gas depletion time (τ_dep ~ 1.4 Gyr), deviating from SMGs and OFGs, but more closely resembling typical massive main-sequence galaxies. We note that, although this revision reduces the number of ultra-massive galaxies reported in Xiao et al. 2024, it does not alter the main conclusions of that work. Overall, our study clarifies the nature of S1 and underscores the importance of multi-line spectroscopic confirmation, slitless observations at multiple position angles, and IFU data for robust redshift and physical characterization of rare massive galaxies in the early Universe.

### 75) [2602.02702](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02702v2): Connecting the Dots: UV-Bright Companions of Little Red Dots as Lyman-Werner Sources Enabling Direct Collapse Black Hole Formation

<p> Josephine F. W. Baggen, Matthew T. Scoggins, Pieter van Dokkum, Zoltán Haiman, Alberto Torralba, Jorryt Matthee </p>
<p>
We compile a sample of 83 Little Red Dots (LRDs) with JWST imaging and find that a substantial fraction (~43%, rising to ≳85% for the most luminous LRDs) host one or more spatially offset, UV-bright companions at projected separations of 0.5  kpc ≲ d≲ 5  kpc, with median of &langle; d &rangle; = 1.0 kpc. This fraction is even higher when smaller spatial scales are probed at high S/N ratio: we show that the two most strongly lensed LRDs known to date, A383-LRD and the newly discovered A68-LRD, both have UV-bright companions at separations of only d~0.3 kpc, below the resolution limit of most unlensed JWST samples. We explore whether these ubiquitous red/blue configurations may be physically linked to the formation of LRDs, in analogy with the "synchronized pair" scenario originally proposed for direct-collapse black hole formation. In this picture, ultraviolet radiation from the companions, which typically have modest stellar masses (M<sub>&ast;</sub> ~ 10^8-9M<sub>&odot;</sub>), suppresses molecular hydrogen cooling in nearby gas, allowing nearly isothermal collapse and the formation of extremely compact objects, such as massive black holes or quasi-stars. Using component-resolved photometry and SED modeling, we infer Lyman-Werner radiation fields of J_21,LW ~ 10^2.5-10^5 at the locations of the red components, comparable to those required in direct-collapse models, suggesting that the necessary photodissociation conditions are realized in many LRD systems. This framework provides a simple and self-consistent explanation for the extreme compactness and distinctive spectral properties of LRDs, and links long-standing theoretical models for early compact object formation directly to a population now observed with JWST in the early universe.

We investigate the chemical abundances and star-formation histories (SFH) of ten massive (log_10 (M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&gt;10.5) quiescent galaxies at 3&lt;z&lt;4 using deep, medium-resolution spectroscopic data obtained as part of the itJWST DeepDive Cycle 2 GO program. Our itDeepDive sample demonstrates early formation and quenching times inferred from spectro-photometric fitting, with most galaxies having formed 50&percnt; of their stellar mass by z ~ 5, and quenching by z ~ 4, showing good agreement across the various SFH parameterizations explored in this work. Though they differ slightly between SFH parameterizations, the inferred formation timescales for the  DeepDive sample span both rapid (≲ 100 Myr) and more extended (≳ 200 Myr) episodes, corresponding to star formation occurring over a few to several dynamical times given their compact sizes and high densities at z~3-4. On average, massive quiescent galaxies at 3&lt;z&lt;4 are α-enhanced (&langle; [α/Fe]&rangle;= 0.22^+0.22_-0.17), although there is strong diversity (~0.3 dex in scatter) among individual [α/Fe] values. Our results for α-enhancement are consistent with lower-redshift studies, implying weak evolution in [α/Fe] from z ~ 4 to z~ 1. The SFH timescales associated with the low [α/Fe] measurements suggest longer formation timescales, potentially pointing to earlier enrichment by Type Ia supernovae, or metals preferentially being removed via outflows driven either by powerful early active galactic nuclei or supernovae. Overall, this work represents the first, statistically representative combined study of the star-formation histories and chemical abundances of massive quiescent galaxies at z&gt;3.

This work presents the first results of the PRImordial galaxy Survey with MIRI Spectroscopy (PRISMS), a JWST cycle 4 program (PID 8051) aimed at the characterization of a relatively large sample of ten galaxies about 500 Myr after the Big Bang. Here, we present deep (13.9 hours) spectroscopy with the MIRI LRS of the lensed galaxy UNCOVER-26185 at a redshift of z=10.054. It is a faint UV galaxy (UV absolut magnitude of -18.83 mag) previously identified as a X-ray luminous AGN. MIRI LRS detects the Hβ+[OIII]4960,5008 complex and Hα emission line with a significance of 10σ and 8σ, respectively, as well as the optical continuum emission at rest-frame 0.45 μm and 0.57 μm with a signal-to-noise ratio of 6-7. The UV-to-optical spectral energy distribution, combining continuum and emission lines, is compatible with: (i) a low stellar (A_V= 0.2) and nebular (A_V=0.0) extinction, (ii) a SFH composed by a young (7 Myr) starburst and an intermediate-age (65 Myr) stellar population, and (iii) a total stellar mass of 1.7×10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. The Hα-derived star-formation rate is 1.3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1. The low optical emission line ratios locate UNCOVER-26185 as the most metal-poor (Z = 0.04 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>), and as outlier with the lowest ionization (logU=-2.5) galaxy identified so far at redshifts above 9. With no evidence of an active galactic nuclei in the rest-frame UV-to-optical spectrum, UNCOVER-26185 has the properties of a metal-poor, main-sequence star-forming galaxy at redshift 10, with ISM and ionization properties very different than those of the already studied UV-bright galaxies at redshifts beyond 10. PRISMS is starting to explore the population of intermediate-UV luminosity galaxies at z=10, covering UV absolute magnitudes in the range of -17.9 to -20.5, fainter than those of UV-bright galaxies studied so far.

<p>
We present very deep (~11h) JWST/MIRI low-resolution spectroscopy of the rest-frame optical emission of U37126, a UV-bright (M_UV ~ -20), mildly lensed (μ≃ 2.2) galaxy at z=10.255. The continuum emission is well detected in both NIRSpec and MIRI spectra, yet no nebular recombination or metal emission lines are observed (EW(Hbeta+[OIII])&lt;300A and EW(Halpha)&lt;400A, at 3sigma). Combined with the exceptionally blue UV continuum slope, beta_UV ~ -2.9, and weak/flat Balmer break, these constraints indicate a stellar population dominated by very young and massive stars with a strongly suppressed nebular contribution. Comparisons with synthetic stellar population models indicate that U37126 requires both a very high ionizing photon production efficiency, log(Xi<sub>ion</sub> / Hz erg^-1) ~ 25.75, and a nearly unit LyC escape fraction, of fesc&gt;86% (3sigma) based on Halpha flux limit and fesc=0.94+/-0.06 derived independently from SED fitting. The best-fit SED yields a (de-lensed) stellar mass of Mstar ~ 10^7.8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and a star-formation rate of SFR~10M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr (sSFR~160 Gyr^-1), that along with its very compact size, reff~61pc, yields very high stellar mass and star-formation-rate surface densities, Sigma_M ~ 3x10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/pc^2 and Sigma_SFR ~ 400 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr/kpc<sup>2</sup>. Together with the lack of detectable nebular emission, these properties suggest that U37126 is undergoing an "ISM-naked'' starburst phase, possibly driven by an extremely efficient gas-to-star conversion followed by strong feedback that has cleared the remaining gas from its stellar core, allowing most LyC photons to escape. Finally, we show that even a small fraction of galaxies like U37126 (~ 3%-6%), with extreme LyC production and escape, could contribute disproportionately (~ 50%-100%) to the ionizing photon budget during cosmic reionization.

<p> D. H. Li, Z. H. Zhang, H. H. Peng, M. C. Galvez-Ortiz, S. Y. Zhou, H. R. A. Jones </p>
<p>
We conducted a search for brown dwarf candidates in a James Webb Space Telescope deep field around A2744 to investigate the space density of these objects at kiloparsec distances. Our methodology employed an initial selection based on photometric colours, followed by spectral energy distribution fitting to both stellar atmospheric models and high-redshift galaxy templates. This approach yielded two robust T dwarf candidates and one possible L subdwarf candidate. The T dwarfs have estimated Galactic heights of 0.43 and 0.86 kpc, likely residing near the outer edges of the Galactic thin and thick discs, respectively. We measure a T dwarf surface number density of 0.094 per squared arcmin in the UNCOVER field, lower than previous predictions but consistent at the order-of-magnitude level. We also provide space number density estimates for T5-T8.9 dwarfs across different effective temperature and spectral type bins, finding that T5-T7 dwarfs out to 2 kpc have significantly lower densities than their solar neighbourhood counterparts, whilst T8 dwarfs within the thick disc exhibit densities comparable to local values. Our analysis demonstrates that broad-band near- to mid-infrared photometry provides high sensitivity to late-T dwarfs but is relatively less sensitive to L and early-T dwarfs. Spectroscopy is typically required to distinguish photometric candidates of L dwarfs, early-T subdwarfs, and high-redshift galaxies in JWST deep fields. This study demonstrates the potential for expanding our understanding of brown dwarf distributions and characteristics at unprecedented distances, offering new insights into substellar populations beyond the solar neighbourhood.

<p> Tomonari Michiyama, Toshiki Saito, Kouichiro Nakanishi, Daisuke Iono, Kazuki Tokuda, Kisetsu Tsuge, Yuzuki Nagashima, Shinya Komugi </p>
<p>
The formation of super star clusters (SSCs) in galaxies remains a fundamental yet unresolved problem. Among the proposed mechanisms, cloud-cloud collisions (CCCs) have been suggested as a potential trigger, although observational validation has been limited. Here we present high-resolution (0.12^&Prime;, ~14 pc) ALMA observations of CO (J=1\!-\!0) emission toward a super giant molecular cloud (SGMC) in the overlap region of the Antennae galaxies. The data resolve the SGMC into two distinct velocity components separated by ~50 km s<sup>-1</sup>. One component exhibits a "U-shaped'' structure within a large filament likely shaped by ram pressure, while the other shows hub-filament morphology. Such a morphology is naturally interpreted as a CCC scenario. The 108 GHz continuum emission detected at the apparent collision interface is dominated by free-free radiation, with an ionizing photon rate consistent with the stellar mass and age of the optically identified SSCs. Supplementary infrared imaging with JWST reveals emission spatially coincident with the inferred collision interface, further supporting the CCC scenario. These results provide compelling, multi-wavelength evidence that CCCs play a key role in triggering SSC formation in merging galaxies.

### 81) [2602.01549](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01549v1): Stellar Mass Growth in the First Galaxies: Theory and Observation

<p> Alan Dressler, Andrew Benson </p>
<p>
We compare the growth in stellar mass of galaxies in the 6&lt;z&lt;12 epoch with predictions of a semi-analytic galaxy formation model - Galacticus. In contrast to diverse and controversial results that compare models and data for the phluminosity evolution of galaxies &ndash; reported in an abundance of recent papers, we find very good, unambiguous agreement in the more fundamental quantity of stellar mass - measured from JWST observations - and Galacticus predictions. Specifically, we find good agreement for the shape of the integrated stellar mass as a function of redshift without any adjustment of parameters, and in phamplitude as well, when 'feedback' is lowered by a factor of 3 compared to that required to match later-universe models and data. This result emerged from detailed investigation of the claim by Dressler et al. that bursts of star formation dominated the growth in stellar mass, specifically, that half of the galaxies with stellar mass growth of M_* &gt; 2×10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> in the epoch 8&lt;z&lt;6 had less than M_*&lt;×10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> prior to z = 8. Here too we find agreement between models and data, namely that these ~100 Myr 'bursts' had strong in situ growth at z≤8, or showed (in Galacticus) substantial stellar and/or gas-rich mergers, and 30-40 Myr 'starbursts' as are common in z&lt;3 galaxies. We note that, if a theoretical simulation is unable to pass the test of matching the growth of stellar mass, any success in reproducing the luminosity function is meaningless.

### 82) [2602.01286](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01286v1): Galactic disc warps from z = 2.5 to modern epoch: ruling out observational effects

<p> Ilia V. Chugunov, Vladimir P. Reshetnikov, Alexander A. Marchuk </p>
<p>
A significant fraction of galaxies show warps in their discs, usually noticeable at its periphery. The exact origin of this phenomenon is not fully established, although multiple warp formation mechanisms are proposed. In this study, we create a sample of more than 1000 distant (z ≲ 2.5) edge-on galaxies imaged by HST and JWST. For these galaxies, we measurd characteristics of warps and finally analyse how their parameters and frequency change with time. We focus on our main result that galaxies with strong warps were more prevalent in the past compared to the modern epoch. We check how selection effects and varying image quality between objects in our sample could influence our results and conclude that varying fraction of warped galaxies is not caused by observational effects, but represents a genuine evolution. Such a trend may be consistent with mergers and interactions between galaxies being the primary mechanism of warp formation, as number density of galaxies decreases with time, implying higher rate of mergers and interactions in the past.

### 83) [2602.00229](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00229v1): A JWST NIRCam/MIRI view of the W51A high-mass star-forming region

We present observations of the W51A region, including the massive protoclusters W51-E and W51-IRS2, with JWST in 10 NIRCam and 5 MIRI filters. In this work, we highlight the most novel features apparent in these images and compare them with other multi-wavelength images. The broad view of the NIRCam/MIRI images of the W51A region shows that areas dominated by warm dust and ionized gas are distinct from those dominated by PAHs. The high angular resolution of the JWST images resolves dust filaments in high contrast, revealing geometrically converging features feeding W51-E and a cavity around W51-IRS2. This picture adds support to the hypothesis that feedback from W51-IRS2 is suppressing further gas infall onto the protocluster, while by contrast, gas is still accreting onto W51-E. Comparing the NIRCam and MIRI images to ALMA data, we find 24 sources detected by both JWST and ALMA, accounting for only ~10&percnt; of the ALMA sources; the rest are too embedded or too cool to be detected by JWST. A knot of [Fe II] and H<sub>2</sub> emission north of W51-IRS2, previously detected in ground-based images, reveals peculiarly bright and compact peaks detected in all JWST bands. The knot is likely the most energetic example of a protostellar jet driven by a massive star impacting dense interstellar medium. The new images provide a complementary view to the previous long-wavelength perspective on this 4 x 8 pc area of one of the most active star-forming regions in our Galaxy, revealing new mysteries to be further explored.

### 84) [2601.23250](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23250v1): Too many or too massive? Investigating the high-z demography of active SMBHs from JWST

<p>
Recent JWST observations have unveiled a numerous population of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) at 4&lt; z&lt;10, with space densities roughly an order of magnitude above pre-JWST estimates, and many of these AGN have masses orders of magnitude above the local black hole mass-stellar mass (M_BH-M_*) scaling relations. We investigate the consistency of these observations within a data-driven framework that links the galaxy stellar mass function to the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass function and AGN luminosity functions using different M_BH-M_* relations and the observed Eddington-ratio distribution. By comparing our predictions against observed AGN luminosity functions at z~ 5.5 we find that observations can be reproduced either by highly-elevated M_BH-M_* relations paired with low duty cycles, or moderate relations with higher duty cycles. Through the Soltan argument, we find that M_BH-M_* relations that are modestly above the local relation for AGN produce consistency between multiple tracers of the SMBH demography at z~ 5.5, while more extreme normalisations would require a weakly-evolving luminosity function at z&gt; 5.5. Continuity-equation modelling shows that initially high M_BH-M_* relations predict a strong two-phase evolutionary scenario and very steep low-mass SMBH mass functions in tension with several current estimates, while more moderate relations generate local SMBH mass functions in better agreement with present determinations and near-constant scaling relations. Our results favour a scenario where SMBHs at z ~ 5 on average lie modestly above local AGN scaling relations, with elevated but physically plausible duty cycles. Future wide-field clustering and demographic studies will help break the remaining degeneracies between SMBH scaling relations and AGN duty cycles at early cosmic times.

### 85) [2601.23069](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23069v1): Quantifying the C/O ratio in the planet-forming environments around very-low-mass stars

<p> Javiera K. Díaz-Berríos, Catherine Walsh, Ewine F. van Dishoeck </p>
<p>
The material in planet-forming disks determines the composition of planets; hence, it is crucial to understand the physical and chemical processes that set the abundance and distribution of key volatiles. James Webb Space Telescope observations of disks around very-low-mass (~0.1~M&odot;) stars (VLMS) have revealed their hydrocarbon-rich inner regions (e.g., C_2H<sub>2</sub>), with column densities significantly higher than predicted. We employ chemical kinetics models using the physical structure of the inner disk around an M~Dwarf star with an X-ray luminosity of L_X~10^29~erg~s<sup>-1</sup>. We adopt initial abundances that mimic the effects of carbon enhancement and oxygen depletion (C/O from 0.44 to 87.47) and quantify how the abundances and distributions of key volatiles respond. The column density and number of molecules (N) of hydrocarbons and oxygen-bearing species are highly sensitive to the C/O ratio, with the largest increases in hydrocarbons occurring when carbon increases by a factor of 2, and/or oxygen decreases by a factor of 10, relative to solar. In the IR-emitting region (T_gas&gt;200~K), a range of C/O ratios can reproduce the observed N and ratios relative to CO<sub>2</sub>. The disk-integrated molecular ratio with respect to CO<sub>2</sub> is highly sensitive to the underlying C/O ratio. However, our results apply only to a source with a single X-ray luminosity value at the middle of that observed for VLMS; hence, a degeneracy between the stellar L_X and the C/O ratio cannot be discarded. Nonetheless, our findings support that an enhanced C/O is required to drive the hydrocarbon-rich chemistry observed in the inner disks around VLMS.

### 86) [2601.22991](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22991v1): Seeds of supermassive black holes in general relativistic and alternative cosmologies: Implications of massive seeds

<p> Nirmali Das, Sanjeev Kalita, Ankita Kakati </p>
<p>
Presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with mass (10^6-10^9) M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z = 10 has been recently revealed by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations. In this study we generate seeds for the above range of SMBHs in various background cosmologies. We consider cosmic timescales required for black hole growth provided by three general relativistic cosmological models (ΛCDM, ωCDM and Dynamical Dark Energy(DDE) and the braneworld cosmology. The growth of SMBHs is studied through Eddington limited and super-Eddington accretion, where the accretion starts at z=30. It is found that growth of SMBHs by z=10 within Eddington limited accretion is possible through massive seeds (M≥10^4M<sub>&odot;</sub>) in all cosmologies. Super Eddington accretion onto spinning black holes with mass of few tens of solar masses can result in SMBHs by z=10 in all cosmologies. The viable cosmologies considered here are found to be unable to strongly distinguish between the seed black hole masses. The seeds generated in this work are assumed to be of primordial origin in order to satisfy the criteria of formation of high redshift massive galaxies. The fraction of primordial black holes (PBHs) contributing to dark matter (f_PBH) and their corresponding number densities for the mass range (10^5-10^8) M<sub>&odot;</sub> are calculated in both seed effect and Poisson effect. In seed effect, PBHs of mass ≥ 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub> contributes ≤ 10^-2 to the dark matter fraction. The evolution of gas mass inside a PBH seeded dark matter halo is studied. The ratio of black hole to stellar mass is also evaluated for star formation efficiency in the range (0.1-1) and found to be (10^-3-1) for M_BH=10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and (10^-2-10) for M_BH=10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>.

<p>
A major challenge in identifying massive quiescent galaxies at z&gt;3 is distinguishing truly passive systems from dust-obscured star-forming galaxies, as both populations exhibit similar red ultraviolet (UV)-to-near-infrared (NIR) colors. In this work, we present ALMA Band 7 dust-continuum observations of five ultramassive galaxies (UMGs; log (M<sub>&sext;</sub> / M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &gt; 11) spectroscopically confirmed at z<sub>spec</sub> &gt; 3 from the MAGAZ3NE survey. Our results reveal that only one galaxy shows a faint 870 \um dust continuum detection, while the remaining four UMGs are undetected down to the 3σ depth . By incorporating ALMA constraints into the spectral energy distribution analysis, we confirm that these UV-NIR-selected systems are truly quiescent UMGs, lying more than one dex below the star-forming main sequence with log (sSFR/Gyr^-1) &lt; -1, thereby ruling out the possibility of obscured star formation. We then estimate dust masses using both spectral energy distribution modeling and modified blackbody fitting, with consistent results between the two methods. We find that three UMGs have evolved into extremely dust-poor quiescent galaxies, with M_dust/M<sub>&sext;</sub> ≲ 10^-4, while the ALMA-detected galaxy has a comparatively higher dust reservoir with M_dust/M<sub>&sext;</sub> ~ 10^-3. Our results present the most massive and extremely dust-poor spectroscopically confirmed quiescent galaxies known at 3 &lt; z &lt; 4, providing valuable observational constraints on rapid dust removal and quenching processes in the early universe. Future molecular line observations will be essential to directly measure the gas content and verify the efficiency of the depletion process.

We present an updated gravitational lens model of the Bullet cluster (1E 0657-56) by combining JWST NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec spectroscopy. Although previous lens models relied on many multiply imaged galaxies, only six systems had spectroscopic redshifts prior to this work. Our lens model is constrained by a catalogue of 135 secure multiple images from 27 background galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, uniformly covering both subclusters and a wide redshift range of 0.9 - 6.7. We also provide a catalogue of 199 multiple image candidates. We model the cluster with Lenstool and incorporate several large-scale haloes, cluster members, the intracluster gas, and group-scale haloes surrounding the cluster core, motivated by spectroscopic studies of cluster member kinematics. We describe the main cluster component with a complex, elongated double-peaked distribution, and the subcluster with a single large-scale halo aligning closely with the brightest cluster galaxy (4_-2^+4 kpc). The uncertainty of the alignment is improved threefold with the addition of JWST systems. The addition of group-scale substructures, roughly following the two axes of cluster assembly, improves the fit to the multiple image positions and provides a physically motivated alternative to constant shear. Our lens model shows the closest agreement with previous studies in aperture mass profiles at ~60 kpc from the BCGs, but exhibits significant differences in the detailed mass distribution as a result of different lens-modelling strategies and adopted constraints. The differences are reflected in small but spatially coherent deviations between the new spectroscopic redshifts and redshifts predicted by earlier lens models.

<p>
The population of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) newly discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) exhibits peculiar properties that distinguish it from both local type I AGN and high-redshift quasars. Most of these sources are compact, appearing as 'little dots': among them, the sub-class (10-30% of the total) characterized by significantly red optical colors has been named 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs), while here we analogously introduce the term 'Little Blue Dots' (LBDs) for the remaining, bluer sources (70-90%). We then present a comparative analysis of the prototypical representatives ('Rosetta Stones') of the two classes: GN-28074 at z=2.26, the Red Rosetta Stone, and GS-3073 at z=5.55, the Blue Rosetta Stone. In both Rosetta Stones the broad Balmer lines are better described by exponential profiles rather than single Gaussians, similarly to normal low-redshift type I AGN, indicating that exponential profiles are not unique to LRDs. They are both extremely X-ray weak, show strong auroral [OIII] 4363 emission, weak hot dust mid-IR emission, and no time variability. However, they differ in terms of excitation diagnostics: the HeII 4686 line is undetected in the Red Rosetta but strongly detected in the Blue Rosetta in both narrow and broad components, with the latter much broader than hydrogen Balmer lines. This supports BLR stratification and disfavors the cocoon electron-scattering scenario. An additional difference is the presence of prominent Balmer absorption in the Red Rosetta &ndash; indicative of extremely dense gas along the line of sight &ndash; but absent in the Blue Rosetta. Taken together, these results suggest that LRDs and LBDs share the same central engine as standard type I AGN, while differing in the amount and geometry of dense gas surrounding the accretion disk, and/or in their accretion properties.

<p> Andrew Marszewski, Claude-André Faucher-Giguère, Guochao Sun, Daniel Anglés-Alcázar, Robert Feldmann, Kung-Yi Su, Tim B. Miller, Niranjan Chandra Roy </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope has unveiled an abundant population of potential active galactic nuclei (AGN) at high redshift (z≳4) known as little red dots (LRDs), which are likely hosted in relatively low-mass galaxies. However, previous theoretical models have highlighted the difficulty in continuously feeding massive black holes in the central regions of bursty, high-redshift galaxies because of repeated gas evacuation by stellar feedback. We analyze galaxies in high-redshift FIRE-2 simulations to understand whether they are capable of hosting the observed abundant population of high-redshift AGN. We use a gravitational torque-driven accretion (GTDA) model and a simple free-fall accretion model to derive black hole accretion rates and construct predicted AGN bolometric luminosity functions for z=5-7. The GTDA model and the free-fall model with black holes accreting ≲ 1 percent of their central gas supply (&lt;100  pc) per free-fall time predict AGN abundances that are more than sufficient to explain the most recent LRD observations. The fiducial models, in fact, overpredict the number of low-luminosity AGN as compared with observations. We explore possible resolutions of this tension. A plausible, though likely not unique, scenario for alleviating the AGN overpredictions and which also provides a good match to the host-galaxy UV luminosity distribution suggests that LRDs are super Eddington-accreting, Eddington luminosity-limited, M_BH≳ 2×10^5  M<sub>&odot;</sub> black holes residing in M<sub>&sext;</sub> ≳ 2×10^7  M<sub>&odot;</sub> galaxies.

<p>
We present the first spectroscopic characterization of an interstellar object at mid-infrared wavelengths. Post-perihelion observations of 3I/ATLAS using the JWST/MIRI medium-resolution spectrometer were obtained on 2025 December 15&ndash;16 and 27 when the object was at heliocentric distances of 2.20 and 2.54 au, respectively. Our 5&ndash;28 micron spectra exhibit fluorescence features from several gaseous species, including the ν_2 band of water at 5.8&ndash;7.0 microns. the primary ν_2 and associated hot bands of carbon dioxide around 15 microns, and a forbidden transition of atomic nickel at 7.507 microns. We also report the first direct detection of methane in an interstellar object. The delayed onset of methane production relative to water suggests past depletion from the outermost layers, with the observed methane emerging from unprocessed subsurface material. Comparison of the volatile production rates measured during the two epochs indicate a significant reduction in overall outgassing over 12 days, with the measured water activity level dropping more steeply than other species. As shown through near-nucleus coma mapping, 3I continues to display an extended source of water production from icy grains entrained within the coma. Our production rate measurements confirm that 3I exhibits a strongly enhanced CO<sub>2</sub>:H<sub>2</sub>O mixing ratio relative to typical solar system comets, as well as a somewhat enriched CH_4:H<sub>2</sub>O value.

<p>
One of the major discoveries by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the identification of a large population of luminous galaxies at z&gt;10, challenging theoretical models for early galaxy formation. The unexpectedly high number density of these systems has triggered intense debate about potential differences in the physical properties of galaxies at such extreme redshifts and those at lower redshift. However, progress has been limited by the lack of rest-frame optical diagnostics, which are critical for constraining the key properties. Here we present deep JWST/MIRI observations of a UV-luminous galaxy at z=11.04, CEERS2-588, only 400 Myr after the Big Bang. CEERS2-588 is detected in the MIRI F560W and F770W bands, while deep MIRI/MRS spectroscopy yields no detection of Hα or [OIII]&lambda;5007 line, revealing a prominent Balmer break detected for the first time at z&gt;10. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting indicates an extended star formation history possibly reaching z&gt;15, followed by rapid quenching within the recent ~10 Myr, in stark contrast to other z&gt;10 galaxies. The MIRI detections also significantly improve our stellar mass estimate to log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=9.1^+0.1_-0.1, making CEERS2-588 the most massive galaxy securely confirmed at z&gt;10. Remarkably, the inferred gas-phase metallicity is near solar, exceeding predictions from current theoretical models. These results suggest that efficient starbursts play a key role in producing the abundant luminous galaxy population in the early universe.

The Euclid Early Release Observations (ERO) programme targeted the Perseus galaxy cluster in its central region over 0.7deg<sup>2</sup>. We combined the exceptional image quality and depth of the ERO-Perseus with FUV and NUV observations from GALEX and AstroSat/UVIT, as well as ugrizHα data from MegaCam at the CFHT, to deliver FUV-to-NIR magnitudes of the 87 brightest galaxies within the Perseus cluster. We reconstructed the star-formation history (SFH) of 59 early-type galaxies (ETGs) within the sample, through the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code CIGALE and state-of-the-art stellar population (SP) models to reproduce the galactic UV emission from hot, old, low-mass stars (i.e. the UV upturn). In addition, for the six most massive ETGs in Perseus [stellar masses log_10(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 10.3], we analysed their spatially resolved SP through a radial SED fitting. In agreement with our previous work on Virgo ETGs, we found that (i) the majority of ETGs needs the presence of an UV upturn to explain their FUV emission, with temperatures &langle; T_UV&rangle;~33800 K; (ii) ETGs have grown their stellar masses quickly, with SF timescales τ≲ 1500 Myr. We found that all ETGs in the sample have formed more than about 30% of their stellar masses at z~5, up to ~100%. At z~5, the stellar masses of the most massive nearby ETGs, which have present-day stellar masses log_10(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≳ 10.8, are then found to be comparable to those of the red quiescent galaxies observed by JWST at similar redshifts (z&gt;4.6). This study can be extended to ETGs in the 14000 deg<sup>2</sup> extragalactic sky that will soon be observed by Euclid, in combination with those from other major upcoming surveys (e.g. Rubin/LSST), and UV observations, to ultimately assess whether the nearby massive ETGs represent the progeny of the massive high-z JWST red quiescent galaxies.

### 94) [2601.20930](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20930v1): It's More Complicated Than You Think: A Forward Model to Infer the Recent Star Formation History, Bursty or Not, of Galaxy Populations

Observations of the early Universe (z &gt; 4) with the James Webb Space Telescope reveal galaxy populations with a wide range of intrinsic luminosities and colors. Bursty star formation histories (SFHs), characterized by short-term fluctuations in the star formation rate (SFR), may explain this diversity, but constraining burst timescales and amplitudes in individual galaxies is challenging due to degeneracies and sensitivity limits. We introduce a population-level simulation-based inference framework that recovers the power and timescales of SFR fluctuations by forward-modeling galaxy populations and distributions of rest-UV to rest-optical spectral features sensitive to star formation timescales. We adopt a stochastic SFH model based on a power spectral density formalism spanning 1 Myr-10 Gyr. Using simulated samples of N=500 galaxies at z~4 with typical JWST/NIRSpec uncertainties, we demonstrate that: (i) the power of SFR fluctuations can be measured with sufficient precision to distinguish between simulations (e.g., FIRE-2-like vs. Illustris-like populations at &gt;99% confidence for timescales &lt; 100 Myr); (ii) simultaneously modeling stochastic fluctuations and the recent (t_L &lt; 500 Myr) average SFH slope is essential, as secular trends otherwise mimic burstiness in common diagnostics; (iii) frequent, intense bursts impose an outshining limit, and bias inference toward underestimating burstiness due to the obscuration of long-timescale power; and (iv) the power of SFR fluctuations can be inferred to 95% confidence across all timescales in both smooth and bursty populations. This framework establishes a novel and robust method for placing quantitative constraints on the feedback physics regulating star formation using large, uniformly selected spectroscopic samples.

The central engines of Little Red Dots (LRDs) may be "black hole stars" (BH*s), early stages of black hole growth characterized by dense gas envelopes. So far, the most direct evidence for BH*s comes from a handful of sources where the host galaxy is completely outshone as suggested by their remarkably steep Balmer breaks. Here we present a novel scheme to disentangle BH*s from their host galaxies assuming that the [OIII]5008Å line arises exclusively from the host. Using a sample of 98 LRDs (z~2-9) with high quality NIRSpec/PRISM spectra, we demonstrate that the host-subtracted median stack displays a Balmer break &gt;2× stronger than massive quiescent galaxies, with the rest-optical continuum resembling a blackbody-like SED (T_eff~4050 K, log(L_bol)~43.9 erg s<sup>-1</sup>, R_eff~1300 au). We measure a steep Balmer decrement (Hα/Hβ&gt;10) and numerous density-sensitive features (e.g., FeII, HeI, OI). These are hallmark signatures of dense gas envelopes, providing population-level evidence that BH*s indeed power LRDs. In the median LRD, BH*s account for ~20&percnt; of the UV emission, ~50&percnt; at the Balmer break, and ~90&percnt; at wavelengths longer than Hα with the remainder arising from the host. BH*s preferentially reside in low-mass galaxies (M<sub>&sext;</sub>~10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) undergoing recent starbursts, as evidenced by extreme emission line EWs (e.g., [OIII]5008Å~1100Å, CIII]~12Å), thereby favoring BH* origins linked to star-formation. We show V-shaped LRD selections are biased to high BH*/host fractions (≳60&percnt; at 5500Å) &ndash; less dominant BH*s may be powering JWST's blue broad-line AGN. We find BH*s are so commonplace and transient (duty cycle ~1&percnt;, lifetime ~10 Myrs) that every massive black hole may have once shone as a BH*.

<p>
JWST observations have revealed that massive galaxies formed and evolved far faster than predicted by galaxy formation models, with many having already assembled a large mass in stars ~12 billion years ago [1-7]. However, masses of distant galaxies are highly uncertain, as they assume a distribution of stellar birth masses (the initial mass function [IMF]) similar to that in the Milky Way (MW). Specifically, the contribution from low-mass stars, which make up the bulk of stellar mass, is not directly observed, but inferred based on an extrapolation of the MW IMF. Here, we provide the first robust measurements of the IMF beyond the local Universe. Using ultra-deep spectra of nine massive, quiescent galaxies at z~0.7 from the ambitious JWST-IMFERNO program, extended to bluer wavelengths with deep spectra from LEGA-C [8], we find that these distant galaxies have excess low-mass stars. In other words, they have more bottom-heavy IMFs than the MW. For the oldest two galaxies, which are direct descendants of JWST's "impossibly early" galaxies, the bottom-heavy IMFs increase their stellar masses by a factor of 3-4. These galaxies thus amplify the tension with galaxy formation models.

Recent JWST observations have unveiled a large number of quiescent galaxies at z≳3, bringing potential challenges to current galaxy formation models. Since star formation is expected to be fed by external gas accretion, the knowledge about the circumgalactic media (CGM) of these galaxies is essential to understanding how they quench. In this work, we present the discovery of a massive and passive galaxy (M<sub>&sext;</sub>≃10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) within the MQN01 structure at z~3.25, containing one of the largest overdensities of galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) found so far at z≳3. The passive galaxy has a star-formation rate of 4^+6_-2~M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr, placing it more than 1 dex below the star-forming main sequence, and has no detectable molecular gas (M_H2&lt;7×10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>). Surprisingly, it is located at the center of a large cool gas reservoir, as traced by bright Lyα and Hα emission. By taking advantage of deep multi-wavelength information unique to this field, including deep Chandra X-ray data, we argue that the inefficient gas accretion from the CGM onto this galaxy over the last few hundreds of Myr, as suggested by the observations, could be caused by an AGN jet of a nearby star-forming galaxy located at a projected distance of 48 kpc. In particular, we argue that the jet feedback may have maintained a high level of CGM turbulence around the passive galaxy and thus caused a reduced gas accretion over the required time-scales. In addition, the elevated ionizing field provided by the AGN overdensity, including the nearby AGN, can illuminate the passive galaxy's cool CGM and make it visible through fluorescent emission. Our study demonstrates that the star formation rates of high-redshift galaxies could be substantially reduced and maintained at a low level even within gas-rich and overdense environments in particular situations.

<p>
Ultra-faint galaxies at high-z are fundamental elements of the early galaxy assembly, and spectroscopic characterization of this population is essential to understand the earliest galaxy evolution. Leveraging the ultra-deep JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec observations of a gravitational lensing field of Abell S1063, taken as part of the GLIMPSE survey, we present spectroscopic properties of 16 galaxies fainter than M_UV=-17 mag, including the metallicity, dust attenuation, and the ionizing photon production efficiency. The emission lines are generally quite strong, roughly half of which cannot be replicated with standard stellar populations and require an extreme ionizing source. We also identify relatively strong [OIII] emission lines from all sample galaxies, which indicates that the low-mass end of the mass-metallicity relation is extended down to M<sub>&sext;</sub>~10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z~6. The strong [OIII] line detection from the lowest-mass galaxy among the sample (M<sub>&sext;</sub>~10^5.6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) stands in contrast to recent reports of extremely metal-poor galaxy candidates at similar mass and redshift, suggesting that there could be two distinct pathways of the earliest metal enrichment as simulations have predicted. Interestingly, we detect both dust attenuation and galactic outflow in one of the sample galaxies with M<sub>&sext;</sub>=10^6.6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z=5.5. All the dust, metal, and outflow contents in this galaxy can be consistently explained by supernovae (SNe), indicative of the key roles of SNe in the earliest galaxy assembly such as dust production, metal enrichment, stellar feedback, and baryon cycle.

<p>
As observations have yet to constrain the ionizing properties of the faintest (M_UV &gt; -16) galaxies, their contribution to cosmic reionization remains unclear. The rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) continuum slope (β) is a powerful diagnostic of stellar populations and one of the few feasible indicators of the escape fraction of ionizing photons (f<sub>esc</sub>) for such faint galaxies at high-redshift. Leveraging ultra-deep JWST/NIRCam GLIMPSE imaging of strong lensing field Abell S1063, we estimate UV continuum slopes of 555 galaxies at z &gt; 6 with absolute magnitudes down to M_UV ≃ -12.5. We find a modest evolution of β with redshift and a flattening in the β-M_UV relation such that galaxies fainter than M_UV ~ -16.5 no longer exhibit the bluest UV slopes. The 138 ultra-faint galaxies with M_UV &gt; -16 are a diverse population encompassing dusty (30&percnt;), old (15&percnt;), and low-mass (50&percnt;) galaxies. We apply the empirical β-f<sub>esc</sub> relation from local Lyman continuum leakers, finding the mean f<sub>esc</sub> peaks at ~ 20&percnt; at M_UV=-16.5 and declines towards fainter galaxies, while remaining consistent with f<sub>esc</sub> = 14&percnt; within uncertainties, in agreement with recent radiative transfer simulations. Incorporating GLIMPSE constraints on the UV luminosity function, ionizing photon production efficiency, and escape fractions produces a reionization history consistent with independent observational constraints. Our results indicate galaxies with M_UV between -18 and -14 supplied ~ 60&percnt; of the ionizing photons to cosmic reionization, while the lower f<sub>esc</sub> of fainter galaxies produces a natural cutoff in the ionizing photon production rate density.

### 100) [2601.19978](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19978v1): An X-ray-Emitting Proto-Cluster at z≈5.7 Reveals Rapid Structure Growth

<p> Akos Bogdan, Gerrit Schellenberger, Qiong Li, Christopher J. Conselice </p>
<p>
Galaxy clusters are the most massive gravitationally bound structures in the universe and serve as tracers of the assembly of large-scale structure. Studying their progenitors, proto-clusters, sheds light on the earliest stages of cluster formation. Yet, detecting proto-clusters is demanding: their member galaxies are loosely bound and the emerging hot intracluster medium (ICM) may only be in the initial stages of virialization. Recent JWST observations located several proto-cluster candidates by identifying overdensities of z≳5 galaxies. However, none of these candidates was detected by X-ray observations, which offer a powerful way to unveil the hot ICM. Here, we report the combined Chandra and JWST detection of a proto-cluster, JADES-ID1, at z≈5.68, merely one billion years after the Big Bang. We measure a bolometric X-ray luminosity of L_bol = (1.5^+0.5_-0.6) ×10^44  erg  s<sup>-1</sup> and infer a total gravitating mass of M_500= (1.8^+0.6_-0.7) × 10^13  M<sub>&odot;</sub>, making this system a progenitor of today's most massive galaxy clusters. The detection of extended, shock-heated gas indicates that substantial ICM heating can occur in massive halos as early as z≈5.7. In addition, given the limited survey volume, the discovery of such a massive cluster is statistically unlikely, implying that the formation of the large-scale structure must have occurred more rapidly in some regions of the early universe than standard cosmological models predict.

<p> Ravishankar Anirudh, Anna de Graaff, Florian Lacroix, Sedona H. Price, Annalisa Pillepich </p>
<p>
We use the TNG50 galaxy formation simulation to generate mock JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec microshutter array (MSA) observations of Hα-emitting gas in M_*=10^8-10^11.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> star-forming galaxies at z=2-6. We measure morphological properties from the mock imaging through Sersic profile fitting, and gas rotational velocities (v) and velocity dispersions (σ) by fitting the mock spectra as thin, rotating discs. To test the efficacy of such simple parametric models in describing complex ionised gas kinematics, we compare the best-fit quantities to intrinsic simulation measurements. At z=3, we find that v and σ for aligned and resolved sources generally agree well with intrinsic measurements, within a factor of ~2 and ~1.5, respectively. The recovery of kinematics is robust for smooth, disc-like systems, but v and σ can be over- or underestimated by more than a factor of 2, respectively, for intrinsically elongated systems. The scatter in the recovery accuracy is larger at higher redshift, as TNG50 galaxies at z&gt;3 deviate more strongly from the thin rotating disc assumption. Despite uncertain measurements for individual galaxies, we find that key population trends, such as the weak redshift evolution of σ and v/σ as well as the dependence of σ on the global star formation rate, are broadly recovered by our kinematic modelling. Our work provides the end-to-end framework needed to compare NIRSpec MSA observations to cosmological simulations and to quantify observational biases in measuring ionised gas kinematics, highlighting the need for the development of dedicated models for high-redshift galaxies.

<p>
JWST has revealed a population of compact galaxies in the early Universe with broad emission lines and strong Balmer breaks; among them the so-called ''little red dots'' (LRDs). Their nature remains uncertain with hypotheses including exotic phenomena. We assemble a sample of LRD-like objects at z&gt;3 and use self-consistent radiative-transfer calculations to show that a supermassive black hole accreting from a dense gas cocoon accurately reproduces the detailed spectra. We show that the cocoons must be non-spherical, with comparable amounts of inflowing and outflowing material. And we predict correlations between Balmer break strength, Balmer line-absorption and scattering line width, which we confirm in our observed sample. We reproduce all LRD-like properties without requiring star-like atmospheres and we determine the typical black hole in our sample to be of order a million solar masses, with ionized cocoon masses of tens of solar masses potentially supplied from a much larger cold-gas reservoir.

<p>
We present a JWST/NIRSpec rest-frame optical spectroscopic census of ALMA 1-mm continuum sources in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF) identified by the deep ALMA UDF and ASPECS programs. Our sample is composed of the ALMA flux-limited (S_1 mm≳ 0.1 mJy) sources observed with medium-resolution NIRSpec spectroscopy from JADES and SMILES, 16 faint submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) at spectroscopic redshifts of z~ 1-4. These SMGs show bright longer-wavelength optical lines (Hα, [N II]λ&lambda;6548,6583, and [S II]λ&lambda;6717,6731) and faint shorter-wavelength optical lines (Hβ and [O III]λ&lambda;4959,5007) with a large nebular attenuation, E(B-V)~0.3-1.8. We test the SMGs using BPT diagnostics and Chandra X-ray fluxes, and find that most SMGs are classified as AGNs; the AGN fraction is ~80&percnt; for the SMGs at M_*&gt;10^10.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. We find only one SMG (&lt;10&percnt;) with a broad Balmer line, indicating that the SMGs are predominantly obscured AGNs. With the optical lines, we estimate the metallicities of the SMGs to be moderately high, ~0.4-2 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>, exceeding the model-predicted dust-growth critical metallicity (~0.1-0.2Z<sub>&odot;</sub>), which naturally explains the dusty nature of the SMGs. Interestingly, the SMGs fall in the mass-metallicity relation and the star-formation main sequence, showing no significant differences from other high-z galaxies. Similarly, we find electron densities of n_e~10^2-10^3 cm^-3 for the SMGs that are comparable with other high-z galaxies. Together with the high SMG fraction (~ 100&percnt;) at the massive end (M_*&gt;10^10.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), these results indicate that the SMGs are mostly not special, but typical massive star-forming galaxies at high redshift.

### 104) [2601.17820](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17820v2): JOYS: JWST MIRI/MRS spectra of the inner 500 au region of the L1527 IRS bipolar outflow

<p>
This study characterized the physical and kinematic properties within the innermost 500 au region of the L1527 bipolar outflow, a class 0/I low-mass protostar using JWST MIRI/MRS spectroscopy across 5-28 micron at 0.2-1.0 arcsec resolution. We identified emission lines from molecular and ionized species and analyzed their spatial morphology using line-integrated intensity maps. We derived gas temperatures and column densities through excitation diagram analysis of H2 rotational lines and compared results with shock models. The observations reveal extended molecular hydrogen emission tracing the bipolar outflow, with the H2 gas temperatures distributed into warm (~550 K) and hot (~2500 K) components, likely originating from moderate-velocity J-type shocks and some UV irradiation. We detect forbidden atomic and ionized emission lines of [Ni ii], [Ar ii], [Ne ii], [Ne iii], [S i], and [Fe ii] showing spatially extended morphology. Double-peaked emission profiles were seen in [Ar ii], [Ne iii], and [Fe ii], in the eastern region, suggesting that the high velocity component traces a fast, highly ionized jet. A radial velocity map derived from [Ne ii] emission shows the eastern region to be redshifted and the western region blueshifted, contrary to earlier interpretations. The analysis of the MIRI/MRS observations reveals molecular, atomic, and ionized emission lines in this low-mass protostar connected with active outflow signatures. The most striking feature discovered is the presence of a poorly collimated high-velocity ionized jet, embedded within a broader wide-angle molecular outflow likely driven by a disk wind. The coexistence of these components supports a stratified outflow structure and suggests that L1527 exhibits unique jet-launching characteristics atypical of its early evolutionary stage.

### 105) [2601.17498](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17498v1): Discovery of an Extremely Metal-Poor Galaxy at z=3.654 Using JWST Infrared Spectroscopy

<p> Zijian Yu, Sijia Cai </p>
<p>
We report the discovery of an extremely metal-poor galaxy at a redshift of z = 3.654, identified through infrared spectroscopy using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). This galaxy, CAPERS-39810, exhibits a metallicity of 12 + log(O/H) = 6.73±0.13, indicative of its primitive chemical composition, resembling the early stages of galaxy formation in the Universe. We use JWST NIRSpec/MSA for spectroscopic analysis, complemented by photometric data from the COSMOS2025 catalog. Our analysis employs the R3 strong-line diagnostic method to estimate metallicity, due to the lack of auroral lines in the spectrum. The galaxy's emission lines, including Hb, [O III], Ha and He I, are clearly detected. The rest-frame equivalent widths of the strong hydrogen recombination lines are EW_0(Hb) = 184±48 Åand EW_0(Ha) = 1144±48 Å. Furthermore, we perform detailed spectral energy distribution modeling to derive a galaxy logarithmic stellar mass of 8.02^+0.22_-0.34 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. This discovery adds to the growing body of evidence for the existence of very low-metallicity galaxies existed at cosmic noon of z≈3, which are crucial for understanding the processes of chemical enrichment and star formation in young galaxies at the cosmic noon.

### 106) [2601.17439](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17439v1): The Supermassive Black Hole in the Nearby Spiral Galaxy M81: A Robust Mass from JWST/NIRSpec Stellar Dynamics

<p>
Despite its proximity, the mass of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the spiral galaxy M81 (NGC~3031) has remained uncertain, with previous dynamical measurements being unreliable. We present the first robust stellar-dynamical measurement of its mass using high-resolution, two-dimensional kinematics from JWST/NIRSpec observations of the central 3''×3''. By tracing stellar motions in the near-infrared, our data penetrate the obscuring nuclear dust and allow for the separation of stellar light from the non-thermal AGN continuum. We modeled the kinematics using JAM within a Bayesian framework, exploring a comprehensive suite of models that systematically account for uncertainties in the point-spread function, orbital anisotropy, and stellar mass-to-light ratio. This ensemble modeling approach demonstrates that a central dark mass unambiguously drives the central rise in velocity dispersion. The models yield a robust SMBH mass of M_BH = (4.78^+0.07_-0.10)×10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. This result resolves a long-standing uncertainty in the mass of M81's black hole and provides a crucial, reliable anchor point for SMBH-galaxy scaling relations.

### 107) [2601.17416](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17416v1): The rest ultraviolet to infrared spectral energy distributions of heavily reddened quasars are "V-shaped" and hot-dust poor

<p> Matthew Stepney, Manda Banerji, Shenli Tang, Matthew J. Temple, Paul C. Hewett </p>
<p>
We present a rest-ultraviolet to infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis of 63 heavily reddened quasars (HRQs) at redshifts z=0.7-2.7 and with dust extinctions E(B-V)=0.4-1.8. Our analysis demonstrates that SEDs with red optical and blue UV continua are very common in HRQs, with more than 82 per cent of the sample showing a UV-excess relative to the reddened quasar continuum. We model the SEDs by combining a reddened quasar and an unobscured scattered light component, though contributions from a star-forming host galaxy cannot be ruled out. The average scattering fraction is small (0.3 per cent). Higher scattering fractions are ruled out by the (i-K)=2.5 colour-cut used to select HRQs which pre-dates the discovery of the JWST "Little Red Dot" (LRD) population. Hence, LRDs generally have bluer UV continua. Nevertheless, four HRQs satisfy the LRD UV/optical continuum slope selections and are therefore massive, cosmic noon analogues of LRDs. Analysis of the near-infrared SEDs of HRQs reveals a deficit of hot dust relative to blue quasars, similar to what is observed in LRDs. This suggests HRQs trace a phase where strong AGN feedback processes eject dust from the inner torus. The UV scattering fraction of HRQs is weakly correlated with the amount of hot dust emission and anti-correlated with the line-of-sight extinction, E(B-V). This is consistent with the hot dust acting as the scattering medium, and the line-of-sight extinction being dominated by dust on interstellar medium scales in the host galaxy.

<p>
Ordinary matter-including particles such as protons and neutrons-accounts for only about one sixth of all matter in the Universe. The rest is dark matter, which does not emit or absorb light but plays a fundamental role in galaxy and structure evolution. Because it interacts only through gravity, one of the most direct probes is weak gravitational lensing: the deflection of light from distant galaxies by intervening mass. Here we present an extremely detailed, wide-area weak-lensing mass map, covering 0.77 deg x 0.70 deg, using high-resolution imaging from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as part of the COSMOS-Web survey. By measuring the shapes of 129 galaxies per square arcminute-many independently in the F115W and F150W bands-we achieve an angular resolution of 1.00 +/- 0.01 arcmin. Our map has more than twice the resolution of earlier Hubble Space Telescope maps, revealing how dark and luminous matter co-evolve across filaments, clusters, and under-densities. It traces mass features out to z ~ 2, including the most distant structure at z ~ 1.1. The sensitivity to high-redshift lensing constrains galaxy environments at the peak of cosmic star formation and sets a high-resolution benchmark for testing theories about the nature of dark matter and the formation of large-scale cosmic structure

A. Yung </p>
<p>
We investigate galaxies in the GARDEN (Galaxies at All Redshifts Deciphered and Explained with the NIRSpec MSA) survey that show auroral emission lines, enabling spatially resolved measurements of electron temperature and direct oxygen abundances. Two galaxies have spectra suitable for this analysis: CANDELS 8005 at z=3.794 and CANDELS 7986 at z=4.702. For both, we measure auroral and key nebular emission-line fluxes across their full extent, allowing direct-method oxygen abundance determinations in individual spaxels. These observations demonstrate the viability of deep JWST/NIRSpec MSA spectroscopy for spatially resolved chemical analyses at high redshift, aided by weak nebular continua and low interstellar extinction. We derive global direct abundances of 12 + log(O/H) = 8.008 (+0.025, -0.027) for CANDELS 8005 and 7.89 (+0.027, -0.028) for CANDELS 7986. Emission-line diagnostics indicate neither galaxy hosts an active galactic nucleus. A first-order kinematic analysis suggests a potential merger in CANDELS 8005. The direct abundances agree with strong-line estimates from our data and recent high-redshift calibrations. We build emission line, radial velocity, strong-line abundance, electron temperature, and direct abundance maps for both galaxies. From these maps, we measure linear radial metallicity gradients of -0.111 (+0.026, -0.025) dex/kpc for CANDELS 8005 (statistically significant) and -0.093 +/- 0.088 dex/kpc for CANDELS 7986, where the large uncertainties limit significance. These results represent the first detection of a radial metallicity gradient from direct-method abundances with measurements taken in galaxies at z&gt;0, supporting inside-out galaxy growth with feedback-regulated chemical enrichment.

<p>
We present near- and mid-infrared spectra of eight Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (LLAGN), spanning nearly four orders of magnitude in black hole mass and Eddington ratio, obtained with JWST/NIRSpec and MIRI as part of the ReveaLLAGN program along with identical archival data of Cen A. The high spatial resolution of JWST cleanly separates AGN emission from host-galaxy contamination, enabling detections of high-ionization potential lines more than an order of magnitude fainter than previously measured. Emission-line diagnostics reveal a transition at log(L_bol/L_Edd) ~ -3.5, where the spectral energy distribution becomes increasingly deficient in ultraviolet photons. We find that rotational H<sub>2</sub> excitation temperatures are elevated (~500 K higher) compared to both higher-luminosity AGN and star-forming galaxies, while the H<sub>2</sub>(0-0)S(3)/PAH_11.3 μm ratios are consistent with those observed in the AGN population. We discuss the possible roles of outflows, jets, and X-ray dominated regions in shaping the interstellar medium surrounding LLAGN. Silicate emission at ~10 μm, localized to the nuclear region, is detected in most ReveaLLAGN targets. This dataset offers the first comprehensive JWST-based characterization of infrared emission lines in the nuclear regions of LLAGN.

### 111) [2601.16772](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16772v1): Improved measurements of the age of JWST galaxies at z=6-10

<p> M. Lopez-Corredoira, C. M. Gutierrez </p>
<p>
From James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) surveys, 31 galaxies with average redshift 7.3 are selected containing large Balmer break, Lyman-α break (V-shaped SED versus λ). Apart from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and JWST-NIRCam (Near-infrared camera) photometry for these galaxies, there are JWST-NIRSpec (Near-infrared spectrograph) spectra for 13 galaxies and mid-infrared photometry (mostly JWST-MIRI) for 15 of them. Spectroscopical analyses included Balmer emission lines, Balmer + 4000 angstroms breaks or CaII lines. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with photometry include old and young stellar populations, emission lines associated to HII regions, AGN, interstellar dust extinction and intergalactic extinction from neutral hydrogen. By adopting realistic extinction curves and taking into account the V-shaped SED and low emission at near infrared at rest, the analyses show that AGN contribution in these galaxies ('little red dots' most of them) should be small on average in the reddest wavelengths, though important for few of the 31 galaxies. Average age of the 31 galaxies: 0.61± 0.31(95% CL) Gyr, while the average age of the ΛCDM universe is 0.70 Gyr. This corresponds to a formation epoch z_ form.&gt;11.2(97.5% CL). Reddest galaxies present largest ages. One of these very red galaxies gets an age incompatible to be younger than the age of the Universe within &gt;4.7σ. TP-AGB effect cannot explain this tension. None the less, there may be other uncertainties in the models, so this tension is a provisional result and further research is needed to confirm it.

We present the first sample of 222 high-redshift (z&gt;0.5) star clusters, detected with JWST/NIRCam in 78 magnified galaxies from different galaxy cluster fields. The majority of the systems (~60%) is observed in the very deep NIRCam observations of the cluster AbellS1063 (GLIMPSE program), showing the power that deep observations, combined with lensing, has to reveal these primordial stellar structures. We perform simultaneous size-flux estimates in all available NIRCam filters and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting analysis to recover star cluster physical properties. All star cluster candidates have very high magnification. Star clusters and clumps show similar ages and redshift distributions, although noticeable differences are seen in their masses, sizes and stellar surface densities inherent to the lack of resolution in the latter group. We reconstruct the formation redshift of star clusters and find that the large majority of the observed star clusters show young ages (&lt;100 Myr) and seems to form at cosmic noon (CN,1&lt;z&lt;4). A small sample of CN star clusters is about 1 Gyr old, these potential globular clusters have formed well within cosmic reionization. Star clusters have stellar densities in the range 10^2 to 10^6 M/pc^2, with median values around 10^4 pc2. Their sizes and densities better overlap with those of nuclear star clusters in the local Universe. These intrinsic properties make high-z star clusters a viable channel to grow intermediate mass black holes. We use Bayesian inference to make first direct measurement of the star cluster mass function at z&gt;1, based on a subsample of 60 star clusters younger than 100 Myr and with masses above 2e6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. The star cluster mass function is well described by a power-law with slope beta = -1.89 suggesting that a power-law -2 function might already be in place in the distant Universe.

Massive star-forming clumps are a prominent feature of high-redshift galaxies and are thought to trace gravitational fragmentation, feedback, and bulge growth in gas-rich disks. We present a statistical analysis of clump-like structures in ~3600 galaxies spanning 2 ≲ z ≲ 8 from deep JWST/NIRCam imaging in the JADES GOODS&ndash;South field. Clumps are identified as residual features after subtracting smooth Sérsic profiles, enabling a uniform, rest-frame optical census of sub-galactic structure. We characterize their physical properties, size&ndash;mass relations, and spatial distributions to constrain models of sub-galactic structure formation and evolution. We find that clumps in our sample are typically low-mass (10^~7-8M<sub>&odot;</sub>), actively star-forming, and show diverse gas-phase metallicity, dust attenuation, and stellar population properties. Their sizes and average pairwise separations increase with cosmic time (toward lower redshift), consistent with inside-out disk growth. The clump mass function follows a power law with slope α= -1.50_-0.17^+0.19, consistent with fragmentation in turbulent disks. We find a deficit of relatively young clumps near galaxy centers and a radial transition in the size&ndash;mass relation: outer clumps exhibit steeper, near-virial slopes (R_e&prop; M_*^~ 0.3), while inner clumps follow flatter trends (R_e&prop; M_*^~ 0.2), consistent with structural evolution via migration or disruption. These results provide new constraints on the formation, survival, and dynamical evolution of clumps, highlighting their role in shaping galaxy morphology during the peak of cosmic star formation.

We present nitrogen abundance measurements based on the low-ionisation [NII]6583 emission line for 588 galaxies between 1.5&lt;z&lt;7.0 from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). We detect the temperature-sensitive [OIII]4363 auroral line in 40 galaxies in our sample, affording T_e-based abundances for this subset. We find that the average N/O abundance ratio in our low-metallicity sample is at least 0.1 dex higher than z ~ 0 samples. In particular, we find significant scatter toward high N/O, with five galaxies being identified with enhanced nitrogen abundances (log(N/O)&gt;-1.1) at low-metallicity (12+log(O/H)&lt;8.0) from T_e-based measurements. Meanwhile, applying strong-line abundance measurements to the remainder of our sample reveals a further 14 candidate galaxies passing these abundance cuts, implying that around 13 % of 12+log(O/H)&lt;8.0 galaxies at these redshifts are nitrogen-enhanced at this level. We find that N/O abundance in low-metallicity systems correlates with SFR, surface density of SFR, and surface density of stellar mass at high redshift, while only in high-metallicity systems does a correlation with stellar mass emerge. Despite healthy representation of these `moderately nitrogen-enhanced' galaxies (-1.1&lt;log(N/O)&lt;-0.6), no galaxies in our low-metallicity sample are identified as having log(N/O)&gt;-0.6, abundances that are typical of high-redshift NIII]- and NIV]-emitters. This demonstrates that the extreme nitrogen enhancements seen in some NIII]- and NIV]-emitters are only attained during the most extreme starbursts. This suggests that these elevated abundances are caused by enrichment from young massive stars in extreme environments and that the impact of this enrichment pathway is milder, though still important, for high-redshift systems on the star-forming main sequence.

Dust attenuation modifies the observed spectral energy distribution (SED), leading to biases in the properties inferred from integrated SED fitting. As spatially resolved SED modeling becomes feasible for large high-redshift samples, it is increasingly important to assess how dust attenuation affects resolved mass estimates. We evaluate the impact of dust attenuation on stellar mass estimates derived from integrating spatially resolved SED fitting results. We perform spatially resolved and integrated SED fitting on a sample of 3408 galaxies at 3 ≤ z &lt; 9 from the GOODS South field, combining deep NIRCam from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) and HST/ACS imaging from GOODS and CANDELS. We compare galaxy-integrated properties derived from fitting the summed SED with those obtained from spatially resolved SED modeling. Using a two-component dust attenuation model with a variable slope, we investigate how the dust attenuation slope, A(V), and stellar population properties contribute to discrepancies in the resulting stellar mass estimates. Resolved stellar masses are systematically higher than integrated estimates, with a median offset of +0.24 dex. Resolved analyses recover higher dust attenuations (ΔA(V)≈ +0.08 mag), lower birth cloud fractions (Δμ≈ -0.28), and grayer attenuation curves (Δδ_ISM = +0.08), arising from preferential sampling of compact star-forming regions. Integrated fits underestimate stellar ages by ~23&percnt; at z &lt; 5 and 31&percnt; at z ≳ 5. The stellar mass offset correlates strongly with the age difference and the attenuation slope difference, indicating that age-dependent outshining and spatially varying dust geometry are primary drivers of the discrepancy between resolved and integrated stellar masses.

<p>
In the local Universe, supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses strongly correlate with their host-galaxies' stellar masses (M_*), but galaxies hosting faint AGN recently found by JWST may deviate from this relation. To constrain the M_BH-M_* relation at high redshift, we performed AGN-host image decomposition for 17 low-luminosity AGN galaxies at z ~ 4&ndash;6 using NIRCam images in the JADES GOODS-N field. These sources are identified as AGNs from broad Hα emission lines detected by the CONGRESS and FRESCO surveys. We used scgalfit+MCMC to fit spatial profiles in 7 wide-band images and detected extended emission in 9 sources out of 17. The close spatial alignment between the extended components and the AGN centers indicates that this emission likely originates from the host galaxies. These sources are extended at 0.9&ndash;2.0~μm, suggesting significant host-galaxy light in the rest-frame UV. For the sources with the host detection, the stellar mass inferred based on image decomposition result can be 1-2 dex lower than the results without image decomposition. The BH-to-stellar mass ratio spans M_BH/M<sub>&ast;</sub> ~ 0.01&ndash;1.48, placing them well above the local M_BH&ndash;M<sub>&ast;</sub> relation. In contrast, the host-galaxy size&ndash;mass relation broadly agrees with previous measurements. Our results suggest that the host galaxies of these faint AGN are either genuinely under-massive compared to their black hole masses, or too compact to be spatially resolved.

<p>
Using JWST NIRCam imaging and grism spectroscopy from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) Origins Fields, we report spectroscopic redshift measurements of 1,445 emission-line galaxies at z=0-9. Within this sample, we identify two prominent galaxy protoclusters at z = 3.47 and 3.69, each anchored by massive dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). In the vicinity of these systems, we discover seven background galaxies at z=3.6 - 6 that simultaneously exhibit strong rest-frame optical emission lines (e.g., [O III] and Hα) and unusually reddened UV-to-optical continua. We attribute this reddening to dust extinction arising from the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the foreground DSFGs at projected separations of 7-30 kpc. We infer a high dust column density (≳ 10^-1 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/kpc<sup>2</sup>), substantially exceeding those measured in low-redshift halos and those predicted by hydrodynamical simulations like IllustrisTNG and FIRE-2. The steep extinction curves, comparable to or steeper than that of the SMC, indicate a dominant population of small dust grains in the high-redshift CGM. We conclude that DSFGs at this epoch host large reservoirs of dusty CGM enriched to solar metallicity. These extended dust components are largely invisible to (sub-)millimeter interferometers such as ALMA because of their low surface brightness. We discuss the physical processes in dust transport that might be key to reproducing our observations, including galaxy mergers, cool-phase gas outflows, dust shattering, sputtering and radiation pressure. Finally, we caution that foreground CGM dust extinction may redden background galaxies at intermediate redshifts to mimic Lyman-break galaxies at z≳10.

<p>
We report a galaxy overdensity candidate at z≈ 10.5 in the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). This overdensity contains 18 galaxies with consistent photometric redshifts and robust F115W dropouts within 8 comoving Mpc in projection. The galaxy number density is four times higher than the field expectation, accounting for one-third of comparably bright galaxies and nearly 50% of the total star formation rate at 10&lt;z<sub>phot</sub>&lt;12 in the GOODS-S field. Two compact members of the overdensity show potential Balmer breaks suggestive of evolved stellar populations or little red dots (LRDs). One-third of galaxies have close companions or substructures within 1 kpc at consistent photometric redshifts, implying more frequent interactions in an overdense environment. Most galaxies have stellar masses of 0.6-3×10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, half-light radii of ~200 pc, and star formation rates of ~5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1, with no significant deviation from typical high-redshift scaling relations. We find tentative evidence for a spatially varying Lyα transmission inferred photometrically, consistent with an emerging ionized bubble. This overdensity provides a rare opportunity for probing the environmental impact on galaxy evolution and the onset of cosmic reionization within the first 500 Myr.

We present a sample of 2081 sources selected at photometric redshift z<sub>phot</sub> &gt; 8 across the JADES DR5 data release in GOODS-S and GOODS-N over a total area of 469 square arcmin. These sources range from M_UV = -22 to M_UV = -16, with 19 objects at z<sub>phot</sub> &gt; 14. We estimate the UV slopes for the full sample from fits to the photometry and find evidence for a steepening of the relationship between the UV continuum slope and M_UV to higher redshifts, a result that differs from prior analyses of brighter samples in the literature. We provide evidence that over one quarter of our sources have evidence for being morphologically extended, with many galaxies showing multiple bright knots or clumps even out to z ~ 13 - 14, an indication of how galaxies at Cosmic Dawn are growing and evolving. We discuss JADES-GN+189.15982+62.28899, a GOODS-N F200W dropout galaxy at z<sub>phot</sub> ~ 15 - 18 which has been observed spectroscopically with JWST/NIRSpec in prism mode, resulting in a very low signal-to-noise spectrum that is consistent with the photometry and rules out a number of low-redshift solutions for the source. Finally, we use a subsample of 123 objects in our sample with spectroscopic redshifts to explore the usage of alternate fitting templates and a prescription for Ly-α damping wing absorption, finding that both produce significant improvements to the estimated photometric redshifts.

<p>
Wisps are among the most prominent scattered light artifacts in JWST/NIRCam imaging. They often appear in certain regions of the detectors and contaminate observations at surface-brightness levels relevant for faint-source photometry. We introduce a new subtraction method that uses the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm to model and remove wisps. Using deep NIRCam observations from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) and other programs, we construct multi-component, filter- and detector-specific wisp templates that capture the wisp structures and their exposure-to-exposure morphological variations. Wisps in individual exposures are represented as non-negative linear combinations of these templates, consistent with their additive nature and reducing degeneracies relative to single-template scaling. Compared to existing approaches, our method delivers lower residual root mean square in wisp-affected regions and reduces photometric bias and scatter to levels consistent with clean detector areas. The NMF wisp templates are readily applicable to other datasets and are publicly released to support future NIRCam extragalactic surveys.

We present morphological parameters and their uncertainties for all sources detected in JWST/NIRCam imaging in GOODS-N and GOODS-S from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) catalogs. We model the surface brightness profiles of these sources with single-component Sérsic profiles, performing Bayesian inference of galaxy structural parameters. We fit each of the &gt;10^5 sources with every available JWST/NIRCam wide-band filter individually, amounting to over 3 million Sérsic profiles computed. We provide catalogs of this morphological information, building one of the largest extragalactic morphological datasets to date, which we share alongside imaging and photometry from the JADES Data Release 5. With this information, we analyze the rest-frame optical redshift evolution of the effective radius and the surface luminosity density within a radius of 1 kiloparsec, Σ_1 kpc, for 24,692 galaxies at z&gt;1. We find r_eff &prop; (1+z)^-0.635 ± 0.013 kpc, while Σ_1 kpc is relatively constant across time. Additionally, we explore bulge-disk decomposition on a subset of 8,390 galaxies in the JADES deep imaging covering the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, finding the effective radius of the bulge-components to increase marginally with time, whereas the disk-component sizes evolve as r_eff,disk &prop; (1+z)^-1.091 ± 0.043. Future work modeling multi-component surface brightness profiles will enable further analysis of the morphological evolution of galaxies across cosmic time.

JADES Data Release 5 (DR5) photometric catalogs and describes the methodologies used for source detection, deblending, photometry, uncertainty estimation, and catalog curation. The catalogs are constructed from 35 space-based imaging mosaics obtained with JWST/NIRCam, JWST/MIRI, HST/ACS, and HST/WFC3, combining approximately 1250 hours of JADES imaging with extensive additional public JWST and HST observations in the GOODS fields. Sources are identified using custom signal-to-noise-based detection and deblending algorithms optimized for the depth, resolution, and complex point-spread-function structure of JWST imaging. Source centroids, shapes, and photometric apertures are determined using a new fast two-dimensional Gaussian regression method applied to detection-image profiles. We provide forced circular-aperture photometry, ellipsoidal Kron photometry, and curve-of-growth measurements for every source in every band. We introduce a new pixel-level regression framework to model photometric uncertainties as a function of aperture size and local mosaic properties, accounting for correlated noise in heterogeneous JWST mosaics. Photometric redshifts are computed using template-based fitting applied to both small-aperture photometry on unconvolved images and Kron photometry on common-PSF mosaics. The JADES DR5 catalogs supersede previous JADES photometric releases, and are publicly released through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes and an interactive web interface.

Medium to ultra-deep mid-infrared imaging surveys with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)'s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) are reframing our view of the early Universe, from the emergence of ultra-red dusty and quiescent galaxies to the epoch of reionization to the first galaxies. Here we present the MIRI coordinated parallels component of the JADES program, which obtained ultra-deep (155 ks) imaging at 7.7 μm over ~10 arcmin<sup>2</sup> as well as medium depth (~5-15 ks) imaging at 7.7, 12.8, and 15 μm over ~36, 25, and 22 arcmin<sup>2</sup>, respectively, in the GOODS-S and GOODS-N fields. This paper describes the data reduction, which combines the official JWST Calibration Pipeline with custom steps to optimize flagging of warm/hot pixels and optimize background subtraction. We further introduce a new step to address artifacts caused by persistence from saturating sources. The final, fully reduced JADES/MIRI mosaics are being released as part of JADES Data Release 5, along with prior-based forced photometry using NIRCam detection images, providing critical rest-frame near-infrared and optical constraints on early galaxy populations.

We present the Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) imaging products of the fifth data release (DR5) of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). The JADES survey is one of the most ambitious programs yet conducted on JWST, producing deep infrared imaging and multiobject spectroscopy on the GOODS-S and GOODS-N extragalactic deep fields in order to explore galaxies to the earliest epoch. Here we describe the NIRCam data reduction procedures that result in deep and well-characterized mosaics in up to 18 filters covering 469 arcmin<sup>2</sup>, with 250 arcmin<sup>2</sup> having at least 8 filters of coverage. This release contains the full NIRCam imaging of JADES, over 800 JWST mission hours, as well as co-reductions of 19 other programs in these two premier deep fields. We perform detailed tests on the final data products, thereby characterizing the photometric properties, point-spread function, and astrometric alignment. We release mosaics for individual programs (or epochs, depending on scheduling) and the mosaics combining data from all programs in order to facilitate photometric variability studies and the deepest possible photometry.

<p>
Compact galaxy groups are ideal laboratories for studying the effects of interactions between AGN and multiple nearby galaxies. Recent JWST observations of the nearby compact group Stephan's Quintet highlight tidal flows between the interacting galaxies as well as outflows from the active galaxy NGC 7319. To study the kinematics on a large scale throughout the group, we obtained spatially-resolved long-slit spectra of Stephan's Quintet at multiple slit positions with Apache Point Observatory's Kitt Peak Ohio State Multi-Object Spectrograph. We fit multiple Gaussians to the Hα λ6563 Å and [N II] λλ6548, 6583 Å emission lines to isolate the different kinematic components. We used the kinematics to develop the first biconical outflow model of the narrow-line region of NGC 7319. Using a combination of galactic rotation models, biconical outflow models, and kinematic maps of the ionized gas, we disentangled the outflows, rotation, and tidal flows in the group. We found outflow radial velocities up to 550 km s<sup>-1</sup> peaking at 2.6 kpc from the central supermassive black hole, and a transition from AGN-powered outflows to gravitationally-powered tidal flows at a projected distance between 2.4 &ndash; 6.3 kpc. We performed a line ratio analysis and determined the gas shows Seyfert-like ionization out to 6.3 kpc (projected), which supports our finding that gas outside this radius is predominantly powered by tidal flows. Our separation of kinematic components in Stephan's Quintet will enable future studies of the physical conditions and dynamical forces in the ionized gas to better quantify the feeding and feedback processes of AGN in compact groups.

### 126) [2601.15207](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15207v1): The importance of super-Eddington black hole accretion for the emergence of massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift

<p> Evgenii Chaikin, Joop Schaye, Filip Huško, Cedric G. Lacey, Sylvia Ploeckinger, Matthieu Schaller </p>
<p>
Recent JWST observations indicate that massive quiescent galaxies (stellar mass M_*≳ 10^10~M<sub>&odot;</sub>) at high redshift (z≳ 6) are more abundant than predicted by most existing galaxy formation simulations and semi-analytic models. Notably, the new COLIBRE simulations have succeeded in reconciling this tension, though the precise reason for their improved agreement with JWST data remains unclear. We demonstrate that the improved agreement is largely due to super-Eddington growth of supermassive black holes (BHs) at high redshift. We run a series of (100~cMpc)^3 simulations with the COLIBRE subgrid physics, varying the maximum allowed BH accretion rate in units of the Eddington rate. We show that only the fiducial COLIBRE model, which permits super-Eddington accretion, is consistent with the JWST constraints at z ≳ 6. Moreover, we find that in COLIBRE about 50 per cent of BH mass growth at high redshift occurs in the super-Eddington regime, even though such events are extremely rare in time. Our work highlights the important role of super-Eddington accretion in simulations of galaxy formation for reproducing the observed early emergence of quenching of massive galaxies.

### 127) [2601.14976](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14976v1): MSA-3D: Connecting the Chemical and Kinematic Structures of Galaxies at z ~ 1

We investigate the connection between ionized gas kinematics and gas-phase metallicity gradients in 21 star-forming galaxies at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.7 from the MSA-3D survey, using spatially resolved JWST/NIRSpec slit-stepping observations. Galaxy kinematics are characterized by the ratio of rotational velocity to intrinsic velocity dispersion, v/σ, measured at 1.5 R_e, where R_e is the effective radius. We find that dynamically hotter disks exhibit systematically flatter metallicity gradients, with a moderate anti-correlation between metallicity gradient and v/σ (Pearson r=-0.43, p=0.05) and a linear fit yields a slope of ~ 0.005 dex per dex in v/σ, weaker than the dependence on stellar mass. A significantly stronger anti-correlation is observed with R_e/σ, interpreted as a proxy for the radial mixing timescale (r=-0.59, p=0.005), indicating that cumulative radial mixing more directly regulates chemical stratification. The metallicity gradients in our sample are uniformly shallow, indicating that efficient turbulent mixing in kinematically settled disks regulates the chemical structure of typical star-forming galaxies at z~1.

Context. The European Archive of the James Webb Space Telescope (eJWST) provides access to all data collected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). JWST's capabilities span from studying early universe galaxy formation to probing exoplanet atmospheres. Specifically, for Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), JWST offers unparalleled opportunities, enabling investigation into AGN phenomena with unprecedented detail through high-resolution imaging, spectroscopy, and photometric data. Aims. This study aims to compile and release a catalogue of all AGN observations conducted with JWST. Using eJWST, we systematically filter and organize these observations to facilitate access and retrieval of all of JWST's data products related to AGNs. Our goal is to provide the community with a valuable resource for their research. Methods. We compiled the AGN observations in eJWST using specific keywords set by the principal investigators in their proposals, manually reviewing the approved programs of JWST, as well as cross-matching all available observations with available AGN catalogues such as the Million Quasar catalogue, the SDSS MaNGA AGN catalogue, the CDFS catalogue, and others. Results. The resulting catalogue contains a total of 3,242 individual AGNs included in JWST observations. This is one of the first extensive collections of AGN observations from the JWST. It includes detailed information about the targets (name, coordinates, redshift), specifics of the JWST observations (instrument, aperture, filter, etc.), and provides links for data downloads.

As radio emission from normal galaxies is a dust-free tracer of star formation, tracing the star formation history of the Universe is a key goal of the SKA and ngVLA. In order to investigate how well radio luminosity traces star formation rate (SFR) in the early Universe, we have examined the radio properties of a JWST Paschen-alpha sample of galaxies at 1.0≤z≤1.8. In the GOODS-S field, we cross-matched a sample of 506 FRESCO Paschen-alpha emitters with the 1.23 GHz radio continuum data from the MeerKAT MIGHTEE survey finding 47 detections. After filtering for AGN (via X-ray detections, hot mid-infrared dust and extended radio emission), as well as blended sources, we obtained a sample of SFGs comprising: 11 cataloged radio detections, 18 non-cataloged detections (at ~3-5sigma) and 298 undetected sources. Stacking the 298 undetected sources we obtain a 3.3sigma detection in the radio. This sample, along with a local sample of Paschen-alpha emitters, lies along previous radio luminosity/SFR relations from local (z&lt;0.2) to high redshift (z~1). Fitting the FRESCO data at 1.0≤z≤1.8 we find log(L_1.4GHz) = (1.31+/-0.17) x log(SFR_Pa-alpha) + (21.36+/-0.17) which is consistent with other literature relations. We can explain some of the observed scatter in the L_1.4GHz/SFR_Pa-alpha correlation by a toy model in which the synchrotron emission is a delayed/averaged tracer of the instantaneous Paschen-alpha SFR by ~10/75 Myr.

### 130) [2601.14395](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14395v1): Growth of Light Seed Black Holes in the Early Universe

<p> Daxal H. Mehta, John A. Regan, Lewis Prole </p>
<p>
Observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses exceeding 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at redshifts z &gt; 8, posing significant challenges to existing models of early black hole formation and growth. Here we show, in a fully cosmological setting, that light seed black holes (LSBHs), remnants of Population III stars, can grow rapidly to ~10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub> in the early Universe. This growth is enabled by our novel black hole seeding prescription and the unprecedented resolution of our zoom-in cosmological simulations, which resolve the dense environments necessary for efficient accretion. Our results provide robust evidence that LSBHs can attain the masses required to serve as the dominant progenitors of the SMBH population observed at later cosmic epochs. These findings have far-reaching implications for the interpretation of JWST observations and future gravitational wave detections with LISA.

### 131) [2601.14385](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14385v1): Mirror images of lensed star clusters with mismatched spectral energy distributions: A possible signature of top-heavy stellar initial mass functions and extreme stars in high-redshift star clusters

<p> Erik Zackrisson, Jose M. Diego, Jose M. Palencia, Francesco Gabrielli, Armin Nabizadeh, Angela Adamo, Guglielmo Costa </p>
<p>
Strongly lensed star clusters have recently been detected up to redshift z≈ 10 in galaxy cluster fields using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). When pairs of mirror images of such star clusters appear across the lensing critical curve, it is usually assumed that both images will display identical spectral energy distributions (SEDs). However, this assumption may be invalidated in the presence of gravitational microlensing from stars or other compact objects in the lens, since microlensing will affect the SED contribution from bright stars within the star cluster independently in the two mirror images. Here, we explore under what circumstances mismatched mirror-image SEDs are likely to be observable, and argue that SED differences detectable in JWST observations of lensing-cluster fields will be limited to star clusters of mass &lt; 10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and ages ≲ 5 Myr. The probability of severely mismatched mirror-image SEDs increases if the stellar initial mass function is very top-heavy and extends to stellar masses \gg 100 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, as has been suggested to be the case for Population III stars. The prevalence of lensed star clusters with highly discrepant mirror-image SEDs could therefore serve as a probe of very massive stars and extreme stellar populations in the early Universe.

### 132) [2601.14370](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14370v1): Hunting the first Cosmic Giants: formation and detectability of Direct Collapse Black Holes around high-redshift quasars

<p> Alessandro Trinca, Alessandro Lupi, Zoltán Haiman, Marta Volonteri, Rosa Valiante, Raffaella Schneider, Roberto Decarli </p>
<p>
The rapid emergence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe poses a challenge to current models of black hole growth. One promising formation pathway is the direct collapse black hole (DCBH) scenario, in which gas in pristine, low-metallicity halos forms supermassive (or quasi-) stars leading to massive black holes seeds under specific environmental conditions. In this work, we investigate the potential host environments of DCBHs by coupling a semi-analytic model tracing BH formation and galaxy co-evolution with high-resolution N-body dark matter merger trees. This allows us to trace the population of DCBHs formed during the hierarchical assembly of a ~ 10^12 ~M<sub>&odot;</sub> dark matter halo hosting a bright 10^9 ~M<sub>&odot;</sub> quasar at redshift z ≈ 7. We find that, when accounting for local fluctuations in the UV radiation field within this early cosmic structure, massive BH seeds can form via direct collapse as early as z ≈ 22. Even under more stringent conditions for heavy seed formation, tens of DCBHs are predicted to emerge within the simulated overdensity down to z ~ 14, at which point metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium inhibits further episodes of direct collapse. A significant fraction of the massive black hole population formed at z &gt; 14 is expected to survive in satellite galaxies that do not merge with the central halo down to z ≈ 7. We show that the existence of such a population of ungrown heavy BH seeds can be probed through deep JWST observations targeting regions surrounding bright high-redshift quasars, and we discuss tailored observational strategies to detect and identify these elusive systems.

### 133) [2601.14368](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14368v1): The Little Red Dots Are Direct Collapse Black Holes

<p> Fabio Pacucci, Andrea Ferrara, Dale D. Kocevski </p>
<p>
The discovery by JWST of a substantial population of compact "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) presents a major puzzle: their observed spectra defy standard astrophysical interpretations. Here, we show that LRD spectra are naturally reproduced by emission from an accreting Direct Collapse Black Hole (DCBH). Using radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, we follow the growth of the DCBH seed via a dense, compressionally heated, collisionally ionized accretion flow. The model self-consistently reproduces the screen responsible for the observed Balmer absorption, while allowing UV/optical emission to partially escape, along with reprocessed infrared radiation. Crucially, this structure is not a blackbody and requires no stellar contribution: the UV continuum originates entirely from reprocessed DCBH radiation, attenuated only by a small amount of dust with an extinction curve consistent with high-redshift galaxies. This single framework simultaneously explains the key observational puzzles of LRDs: (a) weak X-ray emission, (b) metal and high-ionization lines alongside absent star-formation features, (c) overmassive black holes, (d) compact morphology, (e) abundance and redshift evolution &ndash; linking them directly to pristine atomic-cooling halos, (f) long-lived (&gt;100 Myr), slowly variable phases driven by radiation pressure. Our findings indicate that JWST is witnessing the widespread formation of heavy black hole seeds in the early Universe.

### 134) [2601.12413](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12413v4): Updated Metallicity Diagnostics for Precision Oxygen Abundance Measurements in High-redshift Galaxies with JWST

<p> Shihong Liu, Yu Rong, Tie Li, Yao Yao, Cheng Jia, Enci Wang, Hongxin Zhang, Zhicheng He, Huiyuan Wang, Xu Kong </p>
<p>
Recent work has demonstrated that widely used strong-line oxygen abundance indicators, such as O3N2, R23, and \widehatR, suffer from large uncertainties when applied to high-redshift galaxies. We show that this loss of precision primarily arises because, at fixed \Oabund, galaxies span a wide dynamic range in ionization parameter and nitrogen enrichment. Here we develop updated indicators that explicitly incorporate both effects via the proxies O32 and N2O2. We define R_u&equiv; R23+α_1 O32+α_2 N2O2, \widehatR_u&equiv; \widehatR+β_1 O32+β_2 N2O2, and O_u&equiv; O3N2+γ_1 O32+γ_2 N2O2, and calibrate \Oabund~as low-order polynomials in each composite indicator. Applied to a JWST sample with T_e-method abundances, the updated indicators substantially tighten the correlations with \Oabund, boosting adjusted coefficients of determination from \mathbbR^2≲ 0 (classical indicators) to \mathbbR^2≳ 0.5 for the full sample and to ~ 0.7 at z&gt;2. The residuals reveal a redshift evolution in the mapping between \Oabund, strong lines, ionization, and nitrogen enrichment, with a pivotal turning point near the cosmic noon (z~ 2). Our calibrations provide a practical, physically grounded path to precise metallicity measurements in the JWST era and a firmer basis for quantifying early chemical enrichment and feedback.

### 135) [2601.11515](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11515v1): Spectroscopic confirmation of a large and luminous galaxy with weak emission lines at z = 13.53

Arellano-Córdova, Laia Barrufet, Ryan Begley, Adam C. Carnall, Hanna Golawska, Ho-Hin Leung, Dirk Scholte, Thomas M. Stanton </p>
<p>
We present JWST/NIRSpec PRISM observations of a robust galaxy candidate at z≃14, selected from pure-parallel NIRCam imaging; PAN-z14-1. The NIRSpec spectrum allows confirmation of this source at z<sub>spec</sub>=13.53^+0.05_-0.06 through modeling of the Lyman-α break. PAN-z14-1 is the fourth most distant galaxy known to date and is extremely luminous (M_UV=-20.6±0.2), with a blue UV-continuum slope (β=-2.26±0.08) and a large physical size (r_c=233±10  pc). We fail to detect any rest-frame UV emission lines at ≥ 2σ significance, with upper limits sufficiently constraining to exclude the possibility of strong line emission. In terms of its physical properties, PAN-z14-1 is remarkably similar to the previously confirmed z<sub>spec</sub>=14.18 galaxy GS-z14-0. The lack of strong emission lines and large physical size is consistent with an emerging picture of two potentially distinct galaxy populations at z&gt;10, distinguished by star-formation rate surface density. In this scenario, PAN-z14-1 is a second example of a "normal'', extended, luminous, star-forming galaxy at z ≃ 14, and differs markedly from the other class of extremely compact galaxies with strong emission lines recently uncovered at extreme redshifts with JWST. These results highlight the importance of further spectroscopic confirmation of z&gt;10 galaxy candidates in order to fully understand the diversity of properties displayed by the first galaxies.

### 136) [2601.11466](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11466v1): Pseudo Little Red Dot: an Active Black Hole Embedded in a Dense and Dusty, Metal-Poor Starburst Galaxy at z=5.96

<p> Karina I. Caputi, Ryan A. Cooper, Pierluigi Rinaldi, Rafael Navarro-Carrera, Edoardo Iani </p>
<p>
We present a study of Pseudo-LRD-NOM (Pseudo little red dot with no metal lines), a highly magnified low-mass galaxy behind the lensing cluster Abell 370 at z=5.96. We classify this object as a pseudo-LRD because its red rest-frame optical colour is mainly driven by a prominent Halpha line (with EW0 &gt;~ 800 Angstroms) present in its JWST NIRSpec spectrum. Halpha is dominated by a narrow component and also has a minor broad component indicative of an active black hole with M_BH = 2.9x10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. A narrow Hbeta emission line is also detected (with S/N = 8), producing a Balmer decrement (narrow) Halpha/Hbeta = 11. The rest-frame UV spectral slope is beta_UVspec = -1.2. All these features can be ascribed to high dust attenuation. However, no [OIII]5007 or any other metal lines are detected in the spectrum, so [OIII]5007/Hbeta &lt; 0.25, at odds with a simple dust-attenuation explanation. Accounting for all the spectral properties requires the model of a starburst with moderate colour excess E(B-V)=0.18-0.45, high gas density (n_H &gt;~ 10^6 cm^-3) and extremely low gas/stellar metallicities (Z = 0.01-0.1 Zsun). The demagnified stellar mass is 1.62^+1.54_-0.79 x10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and the stellar-mass surface density is Sigma* = 418^+725_-310 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/pc^2, similar to that of massive/nuclear star clusters. Pseudo-LRD-NOM provides evidence of massive black-hole growth occurring in a high-density, dusty starburst which is at the early stages of its chemical enrichment, and is likely a precursor to a real LRD.

<p>
We apply the angular two-point correlation function (TPCF) to the spatial distribution of young star clusters (YSCs) in four nearby star forming galaxies (NGC 628, NGC 4449, M51, and M83) in order to investigate their underlying hierarchical structuring. Using newly constructed catalogs of YSCs in the emerging phase (eYSCs), identified in the infrared with JWST, and optical YSCs detected in archival HST data, we compute TPCFs for various cluster samples and age bins across the four galaxies as part of the FEAST (Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic Star ClusTers) program. We find clear evidence of hierarchical structuring, especially in eYSCs and YSCs with ages &lt; 10 Myr (referred to as oYSCs), which show similar TPCFs within each galaxy. NGC 628 exhibits a clear distinction between the TPCFs of eYSCs and oYSCs, implying a shorter randomization timescale. In contrast, clusters aged 10 to 300 Myr exhibit progressively more random spatial distributions, becoming effectively random after ~ 100 Myr, consistent with earlier studies. The two-dimensional fractal index D_2 of the YSCs underlying distribution is calculated from model fits to TPCFs. Our values of D_2 derived from the youngest YSC populations align better with the expected value of D_2 ~ 1.3 for a universal star formation process compared to previous findings.

<p>
The Lyman-alpha (Lyα) absorption profile in star-forming galaxies serves as a powerful tracer of the extended, dense neutral hydrogen in their surroundings during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). We report a unique galaxy, A2744-z7DLA, at z≈ 6.87 gravitationally lensed by the foreground galaxy cluster Abell 2744, which exhibits both moderate Lyα emission and damped Lyα absorption, suggesting the presence of a dense neutral hydrogen environment. Our analysis suggests that the UV continuum turnover near Lyα is more likely shaped by a damped Lyα system rather than nebular continuum from two photon process. We analyze the physical properties of A2744-z7DLA with spectroscopic and photometric data from the JWST and the HST. The galaxy shows a compact morphology (r_e ~ 0.3 kpc) and a broadened Hα emission line, suggesting possible AGN activity. The broad component of Hα has a FWHM of 2721 ± 200 km s<sup>-1</sup>, corresponding to a black hole mass of M_BH=2.90^+2.35_-1.28× 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and a black hole-to-stellar mass ratio of log (M_BH/M_stellar) = -1.58^+0.45_-0.34. The Balmer decrement (Hα/Hβ) yields a dust attenuation of A_V ≈ 1.15 ± 0.23, indicating that this system is less dust-rich than some "little red dots". Furthermore, we perform SED fitting using both stellar and AGN models. The results show that the UV and optical wavelengths are dominated by star-forming regions, while the AGN component contributes primarily at longer wavelengths. This work provides new insights into the interplay between star formation, neutral gas, and potential AGN activity in galaxies during the EoR.

### 139) [2601.11092](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11092v1): Emission-line Diagnostics at z≳ 2: A Probe of the Ionizing Spectrum and α Enhancement Beyond Cosmic Noon

<p> Leonardo Clarke, Natalie Lam, Alice E. Shapley, Michael W. Topping, Gabriel B. Brammer, Ryan L. Sanders, Naveen A. Reddy, Shreya Karthikeyan </p>
<p>
We analyze several key rest-optical emission-line ratios in a sample of 763 galaxies as well as composite spectra from JADES DR3 in the range 1.4 &lt; z &lt; 7. These emission-line ratios include: [O III]&lambda;5008/Hβ, [N II]λ6585/Hα, [S II]λλ6718,6733/Hα, [O I]λ6302/Hα, O32, R23, Ne3O2, and RO2Ne3. We find evidence for a harder ionizing spectrum at z~ 3.5 compared to z~ 2 at fixed gas-phase metallicity, resulting in a pronounced shift in the star-forming galaxy locus on the [N II]/Hα BPT diagram and the O32 vs. R23 diagram. At z≳ 3.5, star-forming galaxies occupy a common locus, indicating that ISM ionizing conditions at fixed gas-phase metallicity do not evolve strongly at these early cosmic times. There is a connection between ISM ionizing conditions and the chemical abundance patterns (i.e., α/Fe) in massive stars providing the ionizing radiation field. Therefore, the lack of evolution in ISM ionizing conditions at z≳ 3.5, followed by evolution towards a softer ionizing spectrum at fixed nebular metallicity as cosmic time proceeds to z~ 2 and lower redshift mirrors the chemical abundance patterns in Milky Way stars as a function of iron abundance.

### 140) [2601.11068](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11068v1): A Portrait of the Cosmic Reionisation History in the Context of the Early Dark Energy Model

<p> Weiyang Liu, Xin Wang, Hu Zhan, Karl Glazebrook, Mengtao Tang, Michele Trenti </p>
<p>
Recent JWST observations of Lyman-α emission at z ~ 11-6 indicate a rapid reionization of the intergalactic medium within the first ~700 Myr. The required Lyman continuum (LyC) photon budget may naturally arise from the unexpectedly high galaxy number densities revealed by JWST, reducing the need for scenarios invoking very high LyC escape fractions (f<sub>esc</sub>≳0.2) or dominant contributions from ultra-faint galaxies (M_UV&gt;-15) in the standard ΛCDM framework. In this work, we model the reionization history under the Early Dark Energy (EDE) paradigm &ndash; originally proposed to ease the Hubble tension &ndash; which also explains the observed over-abundance of high-z galaxies without extreme star formation efficiencies. The EDE model yields reionization histories consistent with current constraints while requiring only moderate LyC escape fractions and UV luminosity densities (f<sub>esc</sub>~ 0.05-0.1, M_UV≲ -17 to -15). Our results suggest that, once key astrophysical parameters are better constrained, the reionization history could serve as an independent and complementary probe of EDE cosmologies.

<p>
We present the neutral gas morphology of four galaxies from z = 0.22 to 0.47 obtained with the COSMOS HI Large Extragalactic Survey (CHILES). The HI is resolved at the highest redshift with the 7.5 arcsec beam of CHILES and 43 kpc linear scale, with all four galaxies having extended HI. Three are massive galaxies (Mstellar &gt; 3 e10 Mo), with HI masses of 1.6 - 6.7 e10 Mo, and active star formation (3 - 30 Mo/yr). The morphology and kinematics of the galaxies vary from regular to disturbed, including an asymmetric HI disk surrounding the fourth smaller galaxy (Mstellar ~ e9 Mo). CO(1-0) observations of the sample, obtained with the LMT, confirm the redshifts of three of the four galaxies and we derive H2 masses of 0.4 - 5.2 e10 Mo. JWST imaging with four combined NIRCam filters reveals disturbed stellar components with compact knots in two of the galaxies. We combine our new higher-redshift galaxies with previously published observations to conduct a more complete study of HI and H2 evolution in the redshift range 0 - 0.5. With our HI flux-limited observations compared to similar lower redshift galaxies with high stellar mass (Mstellar &gt; e10 Mo), the results show the mean H2/HI ratio at the highest redshift is 10.3 +- 3.4 larger than the mean H2/HI ratio in the local Universe.

<p>
The transient and variable optical sky is relatively poorly characterised on fast (&lt;1 hr) timescales. With the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), the Deeper, Wider, Faster programme (DWF) probes a unique parameter space with its deep (median of g~22.2 AB mag), minute-cadence imaging. In this work, we present DWF's first data release which comprises high cadence photometry extracted from ~12000 images and 166 hours of telescope time. We present a novel data processing pipeline, ttdwf-postpipe, developed to identify sources and extract their light curves. The accuracy of the photometry is assessed by cross-matching to public catalogues. In addition, we injected a population of synthetic GRB afterglows into a subset of the DWF DECam imaging to compare the efficiency of our pipeline with a standard difference imaging approach. Both pipelines show performance and reliably recover injected transients with peak magnitudes g&lt;22 AB mag with an efficiency of 97.24^+0.7_-1.0 percent for ttdwf-postpipe and 96.14^+0.9_-1.1 percent for a difference imaging approach. However, we find that ttdwf-postpipe is less likely to recover transients appearing in galaxies that are brighter or comparable in brightness to the transient itself. To demonstrate the power of the data in this release, we conduct a search for uncatalogued variable stars in a single night of DWF DECam imaging and find ten pulsating variables, two eclipsing binaries and one ZZ ceti. We also conduct a search for variable phenomena in the Chandra Deep Field South, a Rubin deep drilling field, and identify two flares from likely UV ceti type stars.

<p> Yoshihisa Asada, Kohei Inayoshi, Qinyue Fei, Seiji Fujimoto, Chris Willott </p>
<p>
We present a statistical study on the origins of the UV continuum and narrow/broad emission lines in little red dots (LRDs), a newly discovered class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Leveraging all archived JWST/NIRSpec data, we build a sample of 28 spectroscopically-confirmed LRDs at 5&lt;z<sub>spec</sub>&lt;7.2, by requiring broad Hα emission, blue UV colors, V-shaped continua, and compact morphologies. We define a control sample of 9 blue, compact, broad-line AGNs without red optical continua (hereafter little blue dots; LBDs), and examine correlations between rest UV and the narrow/broad Hα luminosities in these populations. In LRDs, both narrow and broad Hα components are tightly correlated with the UV continuum, and the luminosity ratios are consistent with those in young starburst galaxies. In contrast, the UV to broad Hα ratios in LBDs closely match local unobscured AGNs and are statistically different from LRDs. The Lyα occurrence rates and strengths do not differ between LRDs and LBDs and are comparable to normal star-forming galaxies. These results are consistent with a scenario where the central BH in LRDs is enshrouded by a dense opaque gas envelope &ndash; in this model, the UV continuum as well as narrow and even broad Hα emissions are not powered by AGNs but predominantly by young massive stars surrounding the envelope, while the envelope radiates as a ~ 5000 K blackbody. As the envelope dissipates, direct AGN emission can emerge, potentially transforming LRDs into LBDs and marking the end of a short-lived phase of rapid black hole growth.

<p> Chen Qin, Huynh Anh N. Le, Yongquan Xue, Shifu Zhu, Xiaozhi Lin, Kim Ngan Nhat Nguyen </p>
<p>
We investigate the correlation between ionized gas outflows, jets, and star formation in a sample of 42 local type-I active galactic nuclei (AGNs) exhibiting significant [O III] outflows. This study uses both new submillimeter (sub-mm) observations and archival data from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. Our analysis, which includes a correction for jet emission in the sub-mm bands, fitting spectral energy distribution, and analyzing spectra, enables us to derive star-formation rates (SFRs) through various methods. By comparing radio power and SFRs, we select a sub-sample of jetted AGNs of which radio emission is mostly from the jets. We find that jetted AGNs predominantly lie above the main sequence of star-forming galaxies, suggesting a correlation between jet activity and star formation. By comparing dust extinction, we demonstrate that jetted AGNs do not have more dust which is the fuel of both star formation and AGN activity. Therefore, this correlation is more likely to arise from AGN feedback. We also find that the Eddington ratio does not impact the specific SFRs (sSFRs) of our sample. Additionally, for jetted AGNs, stronger radio emission corresponds to higher sSFRs, suggesting that jet emission may promote star formation, i.e., positive feedback. Our results not only shed light on the feedback mechanisms of AGNs but also underscore the complex interplay between black hole activity and star formation in galaxy evolution.

### 145) [2601.10304](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10304v1): Effect of Primordial Black Holes on the global 21-cm signal

<p> Atrideb Chatterjee </p>
<p>
The 21-cm global signal, a treasure trove of information about the nature of the first luminous sources of the Universe, has traditionally been modelled assuming that these early sources were predominantly star-forming galaxies. However, recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed several AGNs as early as z ~ 10 - 10.4 . In light of this, it is important to investigate the contribution of such AGNs to the 21-cm signal. Assuming that these AGNs are seeded by Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and employing an analytical PBH model, consistent with existing cosmological and astrophysical constraints, we show that these exotic objects can have a significant impact on the redshift evolution of the global signal.

### 146) [2601.10097](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10097v1): Caught in Swallowtails: Discovery of Two Swallowtail Image Formations in MS 0451.6-0305

<p> Ashish K. Meena, Wenlei Chen, Lukas J. Furtak, Johan Richard, Adi Zitrin, Jose M. Diego, Mathilde Jauzac, Patrick L. Kelly, Rogier A. Windhorst </p>
<p>
We report the discovery of two swallowtail image formations at z=2.91 and z=6.70 behind the galaxy cluster MS 0451.6-0305 in JWST-NIRCam imaging. We find that in both of the above lensed systems, the complex image morphology cannot be reproduced by simple fold/cusp caustics, and detailed lens modeling reveals higher-order swallowtail caustic configurations. In the z=2.91 lens system, a small part of the source galaxy (which itself is part of a galaxy group) containing atleast two compact knots sits inside the swallowtail caustic, producing a quadruply imaged arc. At two of the image positions of these knots, we infer point source magnifications of ≳ 300, implying lensing-corrected effective radii of ≲ 0.8-1.5 pc. The z=6.70 system exhibits even more complex image formation. We therefore only use the most confidently identified counter-images of knots in this system as constraints in our lens modeling. The resulting model predicts magnifications ~20-200 and lensing-corrected effective radii of ≲ 0.8-18.5 pc for various knots. Together, these two systems represent the first example of observations of multiple swallowtail image formations in a single galaxy cluster and demonstrate the ability of swallowtail caustics to magnify individual substructures at sub-parsec scales, from intermediate redshifts to the first billion years of the Universe.

### 147) [2601.09948](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09948v1): Beyond UV: Rest-frame B-band and Apparent Luminosity Functions of z=5-9 Galaxies

<p> Nicha Leethochawalit, Takahiro Morishita, Tirawut Worrakitpoonpon, Michele Trenti </p>
<p>
We present new measurements of galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) from JWST/NIRCam imaging over the redshift range z=4.5-9.7, using photometric catalogs from JADES and public extragalactic fields. Our analysis includes rest-frame UV and B-band LFs, as well as apparent LFs in F090W, F115W, F200W, F356W, and F444W. We present the first constraints on the rest-frame B-band LF at z~7-8 and extend existing measurements at z~5 to M(B) = -18 mag. The B-band LFs evolve more strongly with redshift than UV LFs, though both decline more gradually than predicted by simulations at z&gt;5. No single existing simulation reproduces all observed trends, with discrepancies likely driven by assumptions about binary evolution and stellar population synthesis models. The apparent LFs in F356W and F444W show hints of a bright-end excess at all redshifts, extending to fainter magnitudes at higher redshift. While extreme emission line galaxies may partially account for it, the excess may also indicate a population of moderately red, optically bright sources - potentially dusty star-forming galaxies or obscured AGNs. Finally, we find that rest-frame B-band luminosity correlates more tightly with stellar mass than UV, making it a powerful tracer of mass assembly and reinforcing the diagnostic value of rest-frame optical LFs in uncovering the physical processes that drive early galaxy formation.

### 148) [2601.09810](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09810v1): Calibrating Mid-Infrared Emission Features As Diagnostics of Star Formation in Infrared-Luminous Galaxies via Radiative Transfer Modeling

<p>
Luminous infrared galaxies are key sites of obscured stellar mass assembly at z &gt; 0.5. Their star formation rates (SFRs) are often estimated using the luminosities of the 6.2 micron and 11.2 micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features, or those of the [Ne II] and [Ne III] fine-structure lines, as they are minimally affected by obscuration. It is uncertain whether the calibration of these features as SFR tracers depends on the starburst bolometric luminosity or the level of Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) activity. We here investigate the relationship between the luminosities of PAH and Neon lines with star formation rate for highly luminous objects using radiative transfer modeling and archival observations of 42 local Ultraluminous (≥ 10^12 L_sun) Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs). We find that PAH and [Ne II] features arise mainly in star-forming regions, with small contributions from the AGN or host, but that the [Ne III] line has a mixed contribution from both star formation and AGN activity. We present relations between L_PAH and L_NeII, and both starburst luminosity and SFR. We find relations for lower luminosity (L_IR ~= 10^10-10^12 L_sun) systems underestimate the SFRs in local ULIRGs by up to ~1 dex. The 6.2 micron and 11.2 micron PAH features, and the [Ne II] line, are thus good tracers of SFR in ULIRGs. We do not find that a more luminous AGN affects the relationship between SFR and PAH or Neon luminosity, but that it can make PAH emission harder to discern. Our results and derived relations are relevant to studies of star-forming and composite galaxies at z &lt; 3 with the James Webb Space Telescope.

<p>
JWST's "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) are increasingly interpreted as active galactic nuclei (AGN) obscured by dense thermalized gas rather than dust as evidenced by their X-ray weakness, blackbody-like continua, and Balmer line profiles. A key question is how LRDs connect to standard UV-luminous AGN and whether transitional phases exist and if they are observable. We present the "X-Ray Dot" (XRD), a compact source at z=3.28 observed by the NIRSpec WIDE GTO survey. The XRD exhibits LRD hallmarks: a blackbody-like (T_eff ≃ 6400 K) red continuum, a faint but blue rest-UV excess, falling mid-IR emission, and broad Balmer lines (FWHM ~ 2700-3200 km s<sup>-1</sup>). Unlike LRDs, however, it is remarkably X-ray luminous (L_rm2-10 keV = 10^44.18 erg s<sup>-1</sup>) and has a continuum inflection that is bluewards of the Balmer limit. We find that the red rest-optical and blue mid-IR continuum cannot be reproduced by standard dust-attenuated AGN models without invoking extremely steep extinction curves, nor can the weak mid-IR emission be reconciled with well-established X-ray&ndash;torus scaling relations. We therefore consider an alternative scenario: the XRD may be an LRD in transition, where the gas envelope dominates the optical continuum but optically thin sightlines allow X-rays to escape. The XRD may thus provide a physical link between LRDs and standard AGN, offering direct evidence that LRDs are powered by supermassive black holes and providing insight into their accretion properties.

### 150) [2601.09644](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09644v1): A New Constraint on the Optical Depth from the Reionization History Independent of CMB Large-Scale E-Mode Polarization

<p> Yuta Kageura, Masami Ouchi, Fumihiro Naokawa, Hiroya Umeda, Akinori Matsumoto, Yuichi Harikane, Minami Nakane, Tran Thi Thai </p>
<p>
Recent studies report a mild discrepancy between baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements within the ΛCDM framework. This discrepancy could be explained if the optical depth τ inferred from the CMB large-scale E-mode polarization is underestimated, which may be biased by foreground-subtraction or instrumental systematics. In this work, we present a determination of τ independent of the large-scale E-mode polarization, using the latest measurements of the redshift evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction x_HI(z), which is constrained by Lyman-α forest and damping-wing absorption measurements at z~5-14, based on ground-based optical and JWST observations. Combining x_HI(z) with the Planck CMB power spectra excluding the large-scale E-mode polarization, we obtain τ=0.0552^+0.0019_-0.0026, a stringent constraint consistent with the previous CMB results including the large-scale E-mode. We also evaluate a potential systematic error in our method associated with absorption modeling, obtaining τ=0.0552^+0.0075_-0.0049. Using this constraint on τ, we resolve the degeneracy in the τ-Ω_m plane and find a 2.4σ tension with the DESI DR2 BAO results, thereby confirming the claimed mild discrepancy suggestive of physics beyond ΛCDM. Finally, we derive an upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses, Σm_ν&lt;0.0550 (0.0717) eV at the 95% (99%) confidence level. This limit favors the normal mass ordering and, when combined with the lower limits from neutrino oscillation experiments, yields a further constraint, Σm_ν=0.0594_-0.0007^+0.0113 eV. However, the cosmological upper limit and the oscillation-based lower limit show a mild 2.2σ tension, providing an independent indication of possible physics beyond ΛCDM.

We present observations of jets within 2000 au of three deeply embedded protostars using 2.9-27 micron observations with JWST. These observations show the morphologies and kinematics of the collimated jets from three protostars, the low-mass Class 0 protostars B335 and HOPS 153, and the intermediate-mass protostar HOPS 370. These jets are traced by shock-ionized fine-structure line emission observed with the JWST NIRSpec and MIRI IFUs. We find that [Fe II] emission traces the full extent of the inner 1000 to 2000 au of the jets, depending on distance to the protostar, while other ions mostly trace isolated shocked knots. The jets show evidence of wiggling motion in the plane of the sky as well as asymmetries between blue and red-shifted lobes. The widths of the jets increase non-monotonically with distance from the central protostar, with opening angles ranging from 2.1 degrees to &lt; 10.1 degrees for the three protostars in the sample. The jets have total velocities ranging from 147 to 184 km/s after correcting for disk inclination. For B335, an 8-month gap between NIRSpec and MIRI MRS observations enabled measurement of the tangential velocity of a shocked knot; in combination with the radial velocity, this shows that the jet has a different inclination than the outflow cavity. We find multiple knots before and during a recent outburst in B335, although the knots were more frequent during the burst. The asymmetries between blue- and red-shifted lobes strongly suggest complex interactions between the circumstellar disks and magnetic fields.

Since its launch, JWST has opened an unprecedented opportunity to characterise the ionised ISM of high-redshift galaxies using well-established rest-frame UV/optical diagnostics from the local Universe. At the same time, these observations challenge the validity of such classical methods when applied to the extreme environments typical at high redshift. We present an in-depth analysis of the ISM in three representative case studies at z=2 - 6 (MARTA 4327, the Sunburst Arc and RXCJ2248-ID) conducted within a multi-cloud photoionisation modelling framework (HOMERUN). We show that even a small fraction of unresolved high-density clumps can contribute more than half of the observed flux of auroral lines, while only negligibly to standard optical density tracers. As a result, T_e-method metallicities can be underestimated by ~ 0.15 - 0.3 dex, as for MARTA 4327. By modelling rest-frame UV and optical data, we demonstrate that discrepancies between abundances obtained from diagnostics tracing different zones do not necessarily imply chemical inhomogeneities. In RXCJ2248-ID, the disagreement between UV and optical N/O may naturally arise from ionisation and density structure alone. In contrast, we find evidence for genuine chemical stratification in the Sunburst Arc, where a component enriched in nitrogen coexists with a chemically normal one. Finally, we argue that very-high-ionisation lines may be explained within a pure star-formation scenario invoking matter-bounded regions. However, in the case of RXCJ2248-ID, we cannot rule out a minor contribution from an AGN based solely on the observed fluxes. These results indicate that classical diagnostics can be significantly biased in high-redshift galaxies and that self-consistent, physically motivated tools are therefore essential to properly interpret the complex ISM conditions and chemical enrichment in the early Universe.

### 153) [2601.08936](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08936v1): A possible pathway to UHZ1-type systems at z~10 by heterogeneous mass primordial black holes as dark matter

<p> Alexander Kashlinsky, Fernando Atrio-Barandela, Diego Martín-González </p>
<p>
Recent space-based observations discovered several unusual objects, exhibiting similar properties, at redshifts z≳ 10. Among them is the UHZ1 system at z=10.1, containing ~ 10^8M<sub>&odot;</sub> in stars, with a similarly massive central black hole of ~ 10^7-8M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Here we propose a possible mechanism for forming such systems which hinges on the presence of primordial black holes (PBHs) covering a range of masses while contributing a significant fraction of the dark matter (DM). We evaluate the accurate expression for the small-scale power responsible for the collapse of the first halos in the presence of the PBH population. The extra power in the matter density field, produced by the granulation term, will cause an earlier collapse of DM halos, populated by PBHs of different masses. In these collapsed and virialized systems the PBHs will undergo 2-body relaxation, driving the more massive PBHs to the halo center under dynamical friction. We quantify this evolution for a distribution of PBH orbital parameters and halo properties. The analysis shows that PBHs can have appropriate mass functions capable of producing systems with parameters similar to what is observed for UHZ1. We suggest that the proposed mechanism could account for a subset of other systems newly discovered with the JWST at high redshifts, including the Little Red Dots.

### 154) [2601.08693](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08693v2): Stellar masses of optically dark galaxies: uncertainty introduced by the attenuation law and star-formation histories

<p>
JWST observations have suggested that some high-redshift galaxies may be ultra-massive, thereby challenging standard models of early galaxy formation and cosmology. We analyse the stellar masses using different modelling assumptions and with new data of three galaxies (S1, S2 and S3), whose NIRCam/grism redshifts were consistent with z&gt;5. These three optically dark galaxies have previously been reported to host exceptionally high stellar masses and star-formation rates, implying extremely high star-formation efficiencies. Recent NIRSpec/IFU observations for S1 indicate a spectroscopic redshift of z<sub>spec</sub>=3.2439±0.0002, which is lower than previously reported. Using the Bayesian spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling tool ttProspector, we investigate the impact of key model assumptions on stellar mass estimates, such as the choice of star-formation history (SFH) priors (constant versus rising SFH base for the non-parametric prior), the dust attenuation law, and the treatment of emission line fluxes. Our analysis yields revised stellar masses of log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≈ 10.36^+0.47_-0.32, 10.95^+0.11_-0.10 and 10.31^+0.24_-0.19 for S1, S2, and S3, respectively. We find that adopting a rising SFH base prior results in lower inferred stellar masses compared to a constant SFH base prior. We identify a significant degeneracy between the dust attenuation curve slope, the amount of dust attenuation, and stellar mass. Our results highlight various systematics in SED modelling due to SFH priors and dust attenuation that can influence stellar mass estimates of heavily dust obscured sources. Nevertheless, even with these revised stellar mass estimates, two of the three galaxies remain among the most massive and actively star-forming systems at their respective redshifts, implying high star-formation efficiencies.

### 155) [2601.08212](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08212v1): Diverse Origins of Broad Hα Lines in Heavily Obscured AGNs Revealed by Multi-epoch Spectroscopy

<p>
According to the classical AGN model, broad emission lines originate from the broad-line region (BLR) and are observable only when the attenuation by the dusty torus is small. However, we recently found several heavily-obscured (A_V &gt; 50 mag) AGNs with broad Hα detections: MCG -3-34-64, UGC 5101, and Mrk 268. To investigate the origin of the observed broad line in these AGNs, we performed multi-epoch optical spectroscopic observations to search for flux variability of the broad Hα line. For MCG -3-34-64 and UGC 5101, no significant variability was detected, suggesting that the broad line of these AGNs may arise from sources other than the BLR. Spectral fitting analysis suggests possible large contribution of ionized outflows to the observed broad component of MCG -3-34-64, while both the outflow and scattering by polar material can explain that of UGC 5101. For Mrk 268, we detected a significant (4.3σ) flux variation of the broad Hα line by using the flux ratio of the Hα complex and the [SII]λ&lambda;6716, 6731 doublet, indicating that the broad line originates directly from the BLR. The lack of significant flux variation in the optical continuum implies that the line of sight to the nucleus of Mrk 268 is mildly obscured. Our results demonstrate that the observed broad Hα lines in obscured AGNs likely have multiple origins. Such complexity may introduce additional uncertainties in black hole mass measurements of distant AGNs revealed by e.g., JWST.

<p>
This letter presents an analysis of the infrared (~ 3-28 μm) spectra extracted from the nuclear (r &lt; 150 pc) regions of four low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN), observed by JWST NIRSpec/IFU and MIRI/MRS as an extension of the Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS). We find that, compared to higher-luminosity AGN, these low-luminosity AGN exhibit distinct properties in their emission of ionized gas, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>). Specifically, the low-luminosity AGN exhibit relatively weak high-ionization potential lines (e.g., [Ne V] and [O IV]), and the line ratios suggest that fast radiative shocks (with v_s of ~ 100s km s<sup>-1</sup>) are the primary excitation source of ionized gas therein. Under the low-excitation conditions of their nuclear regions, these low-luminosity AGN generally exhibit a higher fraction of PAHs with large size (N_C ≳ 200), reflecting the preferential destruction of smaller PAH molecules by AGN feedback. Furthermore, the H<sub>2</sub> transitions in these low-luminosity AGN are not fully thermalized, with slow, plausibly jet-driven molecular shocks (with v_s ≤ 10 km s<sup>-1</sup>) likely being the extra excitation source. Taken together with results from the literature, these findings indicate that feedback operates in both low- and high-luminosity AGN, albeit its impact varies with AGN luminosity. In particular, systematic variations in PAH band ratios are found across AGN, demonstrating the differing influence of feedback in AGN of varying luminosities and highlighting the potential of PAH band ratios as diagnostics for distinguishing kinetic- and radiative-mode AGN feedback.

### 157) [2601.07912](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07912v1): Relatively Fast and Reasonably Furious: Evidence for Increased Burstiness in Smaller Halos at Cosmic Dawn

<p> Julian B. Muñoz, John Chisholm, Guochao Sun, Jenna Samuel, Jordan Mirocha, Emily Bregou, Alessandra Venditti, Mahdi Qezlou, Charlotte Simmonds, Ryan Endsley </p>
<p>
We introduce an effective framework to model star-formation burstiness and use it to jointly fit galaxy UV luminosity functions (UVLFs), clustering, and Hα/UV ratios, providing the first robust empirical evidence that early galaxies hosted in lower-mass halos are burstier. Using z~ 4-6 observations, we find that galaxies show approximately 0.6 dex of SFR variability if hosted in halos of M_h = 10^11  M<sub>&odot;</sub> (typical of M_UV≈ -19 galaxies at z = 6). This translates into a scatter of σ_M_UV≈ 0.75 in the UVLF, in line with past findings. Strikingly, we find that burstiness grows for galaxies hosted in smaller halos, reaching ≳ 1 dex for M_h ≤ 10^9  M<sub>&odot;</sub> (corresponding to σ_M_UV ≈ 1.5 for faint M_UV ≳ -15 galaxies). Extrapolating to higher redshifts, when small halos were more prevalent, the inferred mass-dependent burstiness can reproduce observed UVLFs up to z~ 17 within 1σ, potentially alleviating the tension between pre- and post-JWST galaxy-formation models. Current observations allow us to constrain burst timescales to approximately 20 Myr, consistent with expectations from supernova feedback, and suggest broad distributions of ionizing efficiencies at fixed M_UV. Our results demonstrate that mass-dependent burstiness, as predicted by hydrodynamical simulations, is critical for understanding the mass assembly of early galaxies.

### 158) [2601.07374](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07374v1): Possible evidence for a pair-instability supernova nature of ultra-early JWST sources

<p> Andrea Ferrara, Stefano Carniani, Takahiro Morishita, Massimo Stiavelli </p>
<p>
Recent JWST observations have revealed a population of unexpectedly bright sources at ultra-high redshift (z &gt; 15), challenging current models of early galaxy formation. One extreme example is 'Capotauro', an F356W-dropout identified in the CEERS survey and initially interpreted as a luminous galaxy at z~30, but subsequently found to be variable over an ~ 800 day baseline. Motivated by this variability, we explore the alternative hypothesis that Capotauro is a pair-instability supernova (PISN) originating from a massive (250-260 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), metal-free star. Using state-of-the-art PISN light curves, spectral energy distributions, and synthetic spectra, we show that a PISN at z≃ 15 can plausibly reproduce the observed brightness, temporal evolution, photometry, and NIRSpec spectrum. We compare this scenario with alternative interpretations, including a local Y0 brown dwarf, and discuss observational tests to discriminate among them. If confirmed, this event would provide a rare window onto Population III stars, and highlights the importance of transient contamination in ultra-high redshift galaxy samples.

<p>
Using deep medium-resolution JWST rest-optical spectra of a sample of typical star-forming galaxies (Lyman break galaxies and Lyman-α emitters) from the LyC22 survey at z ~ 3, we determined the nebular abundances of N, O, and Ne relative to H for a subsample of 25 objects with the direct method, based on auroral [OIII]4363 line detections. Our measurements increases the number of accurate N/O determinations at z ~ 2-4 using a homogeneous approach. We found a mean value of log(N/O)=-1.29^+0.25_-0.21 over a metallicity range 12+log(O/H)=7.5 to 8.44. The observed N/O ratio and scatter are indistinguishable from that observed in low-z galaxies and HII regions over the same metallicity range, showing thus no redshift evolution of N/O for typical galaxies over a significant fraction of cosmic time. We also show that typical z ~ 3 galaxies show a similar offset in the BPT diagram as galaxies from the low-z Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS), when compared to the average of SDSS galaxies, and show that this offset is not due to enhanced nitrogen abundances. Our results establish a basis for future studies of the evolution of N and O at higher redshifts.

<p>
We present a search for and characterization of ionized outflows in 15 star-forming systems at z~3-9 with no evidence of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), observed with JWST/NIRSpec IFU as part of the GA-NIFS program. The targets often show satellites and complex substructure, from which we isolate 40 galaxies/regions. The sample probes the high-mass end of the galaxy population, with most sources having log_10~(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=9.5-11, extending previous studies on high-z star formation driven outflows that mainly focused on lower-mass galaxies. Using the [OIII]5007 and Hα emission lines, we identify broad kinematic components consistent with galactic outflows in 14 galaxies/regions. We find that the outflowing gas is more dust attenuated (by A_V~0.59 mag on average) and metal-enriched (0.13 dex) than the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxies, but its velocities are insufficient to escape the galaxies and reach the circumgalactic medium, suggesting that outflows mainly redistribute dust and metals around their hosts. The outflows identified in this study display velocity dispersions within σ_out=130-340~km~s<sup>-1</sup> and outflow velocities v_out=170-600~km~s<sup>-1</sup>, and, when combined with less luminous and less massive star-forming galaxies from previous works, reveal a statistically significant correlation between v_out and star formation rate (SFR). The typically low mass-loading factors (η=M&#775;_out/SFR≤1, in 9 out of 14 the outflows) indicate that these outflows do not strongly suppress star formation. Overall, our results suggest that ejective feedback via ionized outflows is inefficient in massive, luminous star-forming galaxies within the first 2 Gyr of the Universe.

<p>
We report the identification of a pair of faint little red dots (LRDs), dubbed Red Eyes, in a strongly-lensed galaxy at z~7 behind the PLCKG004.5-10.5 cluster, identified from the JWST Treasury program VENUS. Red Eyes are spatially resolved on the image plane with distinct colors, while the critical curve lies far north of Red Eyes, clearly requiring two different LRDs rather than a single LRD. Red Eyes is an extremely close pair of LRDs separated by ~70 pc in the source plane with a magnification of μ~20, which consistently explains another counter-image detected to the north-west. Red Eyes is hosted in a typical star-forming galaxy with M_UV,int~ -19, but its own UV emission is very faint (M_UV,int ≳ -16). Moreover, Red Eyes does not reside at the galaxy center but lies at an offset position of approximately one effective radius R_e away from the galaxy center. If observed without lensing, Red Eyes would appear as a typical star-forming galaxy at z~ 7 with M_UV~ -19, showing no apparent LRD signatures in either morphology or SED. These results suggest that multiple off-center LRDs, similar to Red Eyes, may be commonly hidden in a typical high-z star-forming galaxy. In this case, various plausible scenarios may emerge, one of which is that intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with M_BH~10^4&ndash;6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> may form in star clusters on a stellar disk and contribute to the growth of the central supermassive black hole via mergers, with some IMBHs detectable as luminous LRDs in a sufficiently active and massive phase.

<p>
Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) can form from the near-complete collapse of massive stars, causing them to abruptly disappear. The star M31-2014-DS1 in the Andromeda galaxy was reported to exhibit such a disappearance between 2014 and 2022, with properties consistent with the failed explosion of a ≈ 12 - 13 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yellow supergiant leading to the formation of a ≈ 5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> BH. We present mid-infrared (MIR) observations of the remnant obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and X-ray observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory in 2024. The JWST MIRI/NIRSpec data reveal an extremely red source, showing strong blueshifted absorption from molecular gas (CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, SO<sub>2</sub>) and deep silicate dust features. Modeling the dust continuum confirms continued bolometric fading of the central source to log(L/L<sub>&odot;</sub>)≈3.88 (≈7-8% of the progenitor luminosity), surrounded by a dust shell spanning ≈40-200 au. Modeling of the molecular gas indicates ~ 0.1 M<sub>&odot;</sub> of gas expanding at ≈ 100 km s<sup>-1</sup> near the inner edge of the dust shell. No X-ray source is detected down to a luminosity limit of L_X≲1.5×10^35 erg s<sup>-1</sup>. We show that the panchromatic observations are explained by (i) a low-energy (≈10^46 erg) ejection of the outer H-rich progenitor envelope and (ii) a fading central BH powered by inefficient (~0.1% in mass) accretion of loosely bound fallback material. The analysis robustly establishes the bolometric fading of M31-2014-DS1 and provides the first cohesive insights into BH formation via low-energy explosions and long-term fallback.

### 163) [2601.05333](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05333v1): Cosmic wallflowers: the circumgalactic origins of isolated ultra-compact star clusters at z&gt;7

<p> Floor van Donkelaar, Lucio Mayer, Pedro R. Capelo, Debora Sijacki, Angela Adamo </p>
<p>
The discovery of gravitationally lensed stellar clusters at high redshift with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed extremely compact, massive star-forming systems in galaxies at z &gt; 6, providing a new window into early cluster formation. In this work, we investigate star cluster formation in the circumgalactic environments of gas-rich galaxies with stellar masses spanning between ~10^8 - 10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z &gt; 7, using the MassiveBlackPS cosmological hydrodynamical simulation with 2 pc resolution. We identify 55 baryon-dominated clusters forming outside galactic discs but within the virial radius of the primary halo. Star formation in these systems proceeds rapidly, reaching peak stellar surface densities above 10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> pc^-2, closely matching the compact clusters recently discovered by JWST in the lensed Cosmic Gems Arc at z ≈ 9.6. Such extreme densities are a key pre-requisite to trigger runaway stellar collisions, indicating that a subset of our clusters would be a likely host of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). We find that massive star clusters can form efficiently in the circumgalactic medium at early times through filament fragmentation, whereby high gas densities lead to rapid local collapse via a combination of thermal and gravitational instabilities. This formation pathway implies that some compact clusters formed in the quiet outskirts of forming galaxies rather than within their discs. Small variations in filament properties, including metallicity, density, and dark-matter content, influence the likelihood of a star cluster being able to form an IMBH seed. The formation of clusters in circumgalactic environments points to a potential evolutionary pathway connecting early off-disc clusters, present-day globular clusters, and the seeds of massive BHs.

### 164) [2601.04988](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04988v2): Through Thick and Thin: The Cosmic Evolution of Disk Scale Height

To investigate the formation and evolution of vertical structures in disk galaxies, we measure global \operatornamesech^2 scale heights, averaging thin and thick components when present, for 2631 edge-on disk galaxies with M_*&gt;10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at 0&lt;z&lt;3.5 from the JWST COSMOS-Web survey. We show that dust extinction systematically overestimates scale heights at shorter rest-frame wavelengths, and therefore adopt a fixed rest-frame wavelength of 1 μm. After further correcting for projection-induced bias using a new accurate method, we find that the median disk scale height increases from 0.56±0.03 kpc at z=3.25 to 0.84±0.04 kpc at z=1.25, and subsequently decreases to 0.67±0.06 kpc at z=0.25. The bias-corrected disk scale-length-to-height ratio remains constant at 2.7±0.2 for z&gt;1.5, but rises to 4.0±0.4 at z=0.25. These results imply that the high-redshift progenitors of present-day thick disks were of intermediate thickness, neither thin nor thick, yet dynamically hot and dense. The observed radial variation of scale height is consistent with the artificial flaring expected from observational effects, disfavoring minor mergers as the primary mechanism of disk thickening. Instead, we suggest that the high-redshift intermediate-thickness disks were single-component systems that increased their vertical scale height through decreasing surface mass density and/or violent gravitational instabilities, eventually producing thick disks. Thin-disk growth begins at z≈2 and dominates at z≲1, yielding a vertically more compact system with decreasing scale heights from z≈1 to 0. The inferred thin-disk mass fraction increases from 0.1±0.03 at z=1 to 0.6±0.1 at z=0. Together, these findings reveal a continuous evolutionary link between high-redshift single-component disks and present-day thick thin disk systems.

### 165) [2601.04955](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04955v1): Rapid emergence of overmassive black holes in the early Universe

<p> Sunmyon Chon, Shingo Hirano, Tomoaki Ishiyama, Seok-Jun Chang, Volker Springel </p>
<p>
The origin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains a long-standing problem in astrophysics. Recent JWST observations reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of overmassive black holes at z&gt;4-6, where the BH masses lie far above local scaling relations and not reproduced by current cosmological models. How such overmassive black holes form and rapidly grow within young galaxies has remained unclear. Here we present fully cosmological radiation-hydrodynamic simulations that, for the first time, self-consistently follow the birth, early growth, and emergent observable signatures of SMBHs in proto-cluster environments. We find that heavy seeds of order 10^6 M_sun naturally form, exceeding typical theoretical expectations by an order of magnitude. These seeds rapidly develop dense, optically thick disks whose strong electron scattering produces broad Hα emission comparable to that seen in little red dots (LRDs). Sustained super-Eddington accretion then drives fast growth to ~ 3 × 10^7 ~M_sun by z ~ 8. These results provide a unified physical scenario in which LRDs correspond to a short-lived, enshrouded phase of heavy-seed formation, naturally evolving into the overmassive quasars detected by JWST and ultimately the progenitors of today's SMBHs.

### 166) [2601.04344](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04344v2): Nitrogen enhancement of GN-z11 by metal pollution from supermassive stars

<p> Sho Ebihara, Michiko S. Fujii, Takayuki R. Saitoh, Yutaka Hirai, Hideyuki Umeda, Yuki Isobe, Chris Nagele </p>
<p>
Spectroscopic observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed young, compact, high-redshift (z) galaxies with high nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) ratios. GN-z11 at z=10.6 is one of these galaxies. One possible scenario for such a high N/O ratio is pollution from supermassive stars (SMSs), from which stellar winds are expected to be nitrogen-rich. The abundance pattern is determined by both galaxy evolution and SMS pollution, but so far, simple one-zone models have been used. Using a galaxy formation simulation, we tested the SMS scenario. We used a cosmological zoom-in simulation that includes chemical evolution driven by rotating massive stars (Wolf-Rayet stars), supernovae, and asymptotic giant branch stars. As a post-process, we assumed the formation of an SMS with a mass between 10^3 and 10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and investigated the contribution of its ejecta to the abundance pattern. The N/O ratio was enhanced by the SMS ejecta, and the abundance pattern of GN-z11, including carbon-to-oxygen and oxygen-to-hydrogen ratios, was reproduced by our SMS pollution model if the pollution mass fraction ranges within 10-30 per cent. Such a pollution fraction can be realized when the gas ionized by the SMS is polluted, and the gas density is 10^4-10^5 cm^-3 assuming a Strömgren sphere. We also compared the abundance pattern with those of other N/O-enhanced high-z galaxies. Some of these galaxies can also be explained by SMS pollution.

<p>
The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and the James Webb Space Telescope are transforming our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution in the early Universe. By combining their capabilities, these observatories provide unprecedented insights into the gas, dust, and stars of high-redshift galaxies at spatially resolved scales, unveiling the complexities of their interstellar medium, kinematics, morphology, active galactic nuclei, and star formation activity. This review summarizes recent breakthroughs in the study of galaxies during the first billion years of cosmic history, highlighting key discoveries, open questions, and current limitations. We discuss how observations, theoretical models, and simulations are shaping our understanding of early galaxy evolution and identify promising directions for future research. While significant progress can be achieved through optimized use of existing facilities and collaborative efforts, further advances will require enhanced angular resolution and sensitivity, motivating upgrades to current instruments and the development of next-generation observatories.

Observing supernovae (SNe) in the early Universe (z &gt; 3) provides a window into how both galaxies and individual stars have evolved over cosmic time, yet a detailed study of high-redshift stars and SNe has remained difficult due to their extreme distances and cosmological redshifting. To overcome the former, searches for gravitationally lensed sources allow for the discovery of magnified SNe that appear as multiple images - further providing the opportunity for efficient follow-up. Here we present the discovery of "SN Eos": a strongly lensed, multiply-imaged, SN II at a spectroscopic redshift of z = 5.133 +/- 0.001. SN Eos exploded in a Lyman-α emitting galaxy when the Universe was only ~1 billion years old, shortly after it reionized and became transparent to ultraviolet radiation. A year prior to our discovery in JWST data, archival HST imaging of SN Eos reveals rest-frame far ultraviolet (~1,300Å) emission, indicative of shock breakout or interaction with circumstellar material in the first few (rest-frame) days after explosion. The JWST spectroscopy of SN Eos, now the farthest spectroscopically confirmed SN ever discovered, shows that SN Eos's progenitor star likely formed in a metal-poor environment (≤ 0.1 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>), providing the first direct evidence of massive star formation in the metal-poor, early Universe. SN Eos would not have been detectable without the extreme lensing magnification of the system, highlighting the potential of such discoveries to eventually place constraints on the faint end of the cosmic star-formation rate density in the very early Universe.

### 169) [2601.03705](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03705v1): Identification of solid N2O in interstellar ices using open JWST data

<p> V. Karteyeva, R. Nakibov, I. Petrashkevich, M. Medvedev, A. Vasyunin </p>
<p>
Context. There are only six molecules containing N-O bond that are detected in gaseous phase in interstellar medium. One of those is nitrous oxide (N2O), which was searched for but not found in solid form from as early as Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) mission was launched. The observational capabilities of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) present a possibility to identify solid interstellar N2O. Aims. We aim to identify nitrous oxide in open JWST spectra of interstellar ices towards a sample of Class 0, 0/I and flat protostars using the relevant laboratory mixtures of N2O-bearing interstellar ice analogues. Methods. A set of laboratory infrared transmission spectra was obtained for the following mixtures: N2O:CO2=1:20, N2O:CO=1:20, N2O:N2=1:20, N2O:CO2:CO=1:15:5, N2O:CO2:N2=1:15:13 at 10-23 K. A search for N2O in JWST NIRSpec spectra towards 50 protostars was performed by fitting the 4.44-4.47 um (2250-2235 cm-1) NN-stretch absorption band with new laboratory mixtures of N2O-bearing ices. Results. We claim the first secure identification of N2O in 16 protostars. The fitting results show that N2O is formed predominantly within the apolar layer of the ice mantles, rich in CO, CO2 and N2. The abundance of solid N2O is estimated as 0.2-2.1% relative to solid CO. We present band strengths for N2O in the mixtures corresponding to the apolar layer. Also, an identification of the C-N stretch band at 4.42 um (2260 cm-1) is reported, which we tentatively assign to HNCO, the simplest C-N bond carrier.

### 170) [2601.03339](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03339v1): Early thin-disc assembly revealed by JWST edge-on galaxies

<p> Marloes van Asselt, Francesca Rizzo, Luca Di Mascolo </p>
<p>
The vertical structure of stellar discs provides key constraints on their formation and evolution. Nearby spirals, including the Milky Way, host thin and thick components that may arise either from an early turbulent phase or from the subsequent dynamical heating of an initially thin disc; measuring disc thickness across cosmic time therefore offers a direct test of these scenarios. We present a new methodology to measure the thickness of edge-on galaxies that explicitly accounts for small departures from perfectly edge-on orientations by fitting a full three-dimensional model with forward modelling. This improves on traditional approaches that assume an inclination of 90&deg; and can bias thicknesses high. Applying the method to itJWST imaging of galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3 with stellar masses ≳ 10^9~M<sub>&odot;</sub> from four major surveys, we measure a median scale height of z_0 = 0.25±0.14~kpc and a median ratio h_r/z_0 = 8.4±3.7. These values are consistent with the Milky Way and local thin discs, but imply scale heights ~ 1.6 times smaller than those inferred for local galaxies from single-disc fits. This result implies that thin discs are already present at z~3. We further show that a thick disc contributing 10&percnt; of the thin-disc luminosity would be detectable in the data considered in this work, implying that any thick disc present must be fainter and favouring a scenario in which thick discs build up progressively through dynamical heating.

### 171) [2601.03338](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03338v2): Fast rotations in galaxies at cosmic noon indicate central concentration of stars, dark matter or massive black holes

<p> Fernanda Roman-Oliveira, Francesca Rizzo, Filippo Fraternali </p>
<p>
The rotation curves of regularly rotating disc galaxies are a unique probe of the gravitational potential and dark matter distribution. Until recently, matter decomposition of rotation curves at z&gt;0.5 was challenging, not only due to the lack of high resolution kinematic data but also of both suitable photometry to accurately trace the stellar surface density and spatially-resolved sub-mm observations to trace the cold gas distribution. In this paper, we analyse three galaxies from the Archival Large Program to Advance Kinematic Analysis (ALPAKA) sample, combining highly resolved cold gas observations from ALMA with rest-frame near-infrared imaging from JWST to investigate their dynamical properties and constrain their dark matter halos. The galaxies, initially classified as regularly rotating discs based on ALMA observations alone, appear in JWST as extended and symmetric stellar discs with spiral arms. Our dynamical models reproduce the rotation of the discs in the outer parts well, but they systematically underpredict the inner rotation velocities, revealing a deficit of central mass relative to the data. This discrepancy indicates either an underestimation of the bulge masses due to variations in the stellar mass-to-light ratio or dust attenuation or the presence of overmassive black holes. Alternatively, it may suggest departures from standard dark-matter halo profiles, including enhanced central concentrations.

<p>
We present JWST/MIRI imaging of eight nearby Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) from the GATOS survey to investigate the physical conditions of extended dust in their narrow line regions (NLRs). In four galaxies (ESO 428-G14, NGC 4388, NGC 3081, and NGC 5728), we detect spatially resolved dust structures extending ~100-200 pc along the NLR. In these systems, we find a strong link between the morphology of the dust, the radio ejecta, and the coronal [Si VI] emission, implying that dust carries imprints of the processes shaping the NLR. Using spatially resolved spectral energy distributions, we show that dust in the NLR has systematically steeper slopes than star forming clumps. This dust emits at temperatures in the range 150 - 220 K, at a distance of ~150 pc from the nucleus. Using simple models, we show that, even under optimistic assumptions of grain size and AGN luminosity, the excess MIR emission cannot be explained by AGN illumination alone. We interpret this excess heating as in-situ. We show that shocks with velocities of v_shock ~ 200- 400   km/s in dense gas can close this gap, and in some cases even account for the total observed emission. This, combined with multiple lines of evidence for shocks in these regions, supports a scenario in which shocks not only coexist with dust but may be playing a key role in heating it. Our findings reveal shocks may be an important and previously overlooked driver of extended dust emission in the central hundreds of parsecs in AGN.

<p>
We present photometric properties of 161 galaxy candidates at z=7-14 selected from the second data release (DR2) of BEACON, a JWST Cycle 2 pure-parallel NIRCam imaging program. Carefully selected from 36 independent pointings (corresponding to ~350 arcmin<sup>2</sup> sky coverage), and hence with reduced cosmic variance, our galaxy candidates provide an unbiased sample for investigating galaxy properties over a wide range of environments. We measure the physical properties, including UV continuum slope (β_UV), stellar mass (M_*), star formation rate (SFR), and sizes. Our highest redshift galaxy candidate at z=13.71±0.15 has a remarkably bright UV luminosity of M_UV=-21.19±0.08, making it the brightest galaxy at z&gt;12 if spectroscopically confirmed. With an extremely blue UV slope, compact morphology, and high star formation rate surface density (Σ_SFR), this candidate may have extremely low metallicity, high ionizing photon escape fraction, or contributions from an AGN. Among our multiple independent sightlines, we identify three fields of galaxy number overdensity with &gt;3σ significance. The properties of galaxies in various environments do not exhibit significant differences, implying either that accelerated galaxy evolution in overdense regions is not yet widespread at z&gt;7, or that the current constraints are limited by sample size. Our simulations indicate that increasing the sample by an order of magnitude would allow such environmental trends to be robustly confirmed or ruled out, underscoring the importance of future pure-parallel observations.

### 174) [2601.02469](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02469v1): Hunting for the First Explosions at the High-Redshift Frontier

<p> Junehyoung Jeon, Volker Bromm, Alessandra Venditti, Steven L. Finkelstein, Tiger Yu-Yang Hsiao </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has spectroscopically confirmed galaxies up to z~14, 300 Myr after the Big Bang, and several candidates have been discovered at z~15-25, with one candidate as high as z~30, only 100 Myr after the Big Bang. Such objects are unexpected, since theoretical studies have not predicted the existence of detectable galaxies at z~30. While any z~30 candidates may be contaminants at lower redshifts, we explore whether such extreme redshift sources could be consistent with hyper-energetic transient events linked to the formation of the first, metal-free, stars. Specifically, we consider pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), a predicted class of extreme thermonuclear explosions that leave no remnant behind. Using cosmological simulations, we investigate an overdense cosmic region, where star formation and subsequent PISNe occur at z~30-40, even within standard cosmology. Assessing the likelihood of such a region, the corresponding number of PISNe at z≳20, and their observed flux, we find that JWST has a non-negligible chance to detect a PISN event at extremely high redshifts. If a transient event were confirmed at z~30, this would provide a direct glimpse into the epoch of first star formation, dramatically extending the empirical reach of astronomy.

<p>
We investigate the presence and origin of neutral gas outflows and inflows in 13 post-starburst (PSB) and quiescent galaxies at redshifts 1.8 ≤ z ≤ 4.6, using JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy from the EXCELS survey. NaD absorption profiles reveal that 3 out of 13 exhibit blueshifted absorption indicative of outflows, and a further 2 objects show signs of inflowing gas. Outflow velocities range from ≈ 300 - 1200 kms<sup>-1</sup>, and we find gas flows are detected exclusively in objects that quenched \lt 600 Myr ago. This result holds when we include comparable objects from recent literature. We derive mass outflow rates over two orders of magnitude higher than current levels of star formation in our sample, indicating that the winds are unlikely to be driven by supernovae, and likely play a significant role in keeping the galaxies quenched. The majority of the outflow sample have anomalously high energy and momentum outflow rates compared to those predicted for current levels of star formation or AGN activity. We conclude that we are likely observing fossil outflows driven by previous, more luminous AGN activity which has since faded. We then compare with the EAGLE simulation to explore a potential 'outflow cycle', finding that our observations are consistent with a model in which z ~ 3 quiescent galaxies undergo short ≃ 5 Myr periods of AGN activity strong enough to drive outflows, which occur every ≃ 40 Myr on average. This AGN activity drives observable outflows that persist for up to ≃ 10 Myr after the AGN fades, followed by a ≃ 20 Myr lull, and a subsequent short inflow, which eventually re-ignites AGN activity, and the cycle repeats.

We present the Parallel Application of Slitless Spectroscopy to Analyze Galaxy Evolution (PASSAGE) spectroscopic redshift catalog in the COSMOS field. PASSAGE is a JWST Cycle 1 Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) wide-field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) pure-parallel survey, obtaining near-infrared spectra of thousands of extragalactic sources. 15 out of 63 PASSAGE fields fall within the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) COSMOS footprint, of which 11 overlap with COSMOS-Web, a JWST treasury survey providing additional space-based photometry. We present our custom line-finding algorithm and visual inspection effort used to identify emission lines and derive the spectroscopic redshifts for line-emitting sources in PASSAGE. The line-finding algorithm identifies between ~200 and 950 line-emitting candidates per field, of which typically 47% were identified as true emission lines post visual inspection. We identify 2183 emission line sources at 0.08&lt;z&lt;4.7, 1896 of which have available COSMOS photometric redshifts. We find excellent redshift agreement between the COSMOS photometric redshifts and the PASSAGE spectroscopic redshifts for strong (S/N&gt;5), multi-line emitting sources. This agreement weakens for PASSAGE single-line emitters with ambiguous identities. These single-line emitters are likely mis-identified around 18% of the time based on comparisons to photometric redshifts. We derive stellar masses using PASSAGE photometry and spectroscopic redshifts, in broad agreement with existing COSMOS-Web stellar masses, but with some discrepancy driven by redshift disagreements. We publicly release this spectroscopic redshift catalog, which will enable community-led science in prime extragalactic fields and serve as a crucial dataset for validating Euclid and Roman spectroscopy.

### 177) [2601.02104](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02104v1): Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion onto ultra dense dark matter halos and direct collapse black holes

<p> Kandaswamy Subramanian, Bikram Phookun </p>
<p>
We suggest a formation scenario of black holes with intermediate mass ~ 10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, by post recombination Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion into ultra dense dark matter halos (UDMH) of ~ 10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, which have formed around the recombination epoch. Such UDMH can result from rare curvature fluctuations on small scales whose amplitude is still well below the current Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectral distortion limits. Gas accreted by the UDMH is heated to virial temperatures above which atomic cooling is efficient, cools rapidly to about ~ 8000 K and collapses on the free fall time of few 10^4 yr to the halo core, until supported by rotation. Further fragmentation due to molecular cooling is prevented by the suppression of H<sub>2</sub> molecule formation by the CMB photons at redshifts z&gt; 200-400. We find that the rotationally supported gas disk will be compact and massive enough to undergo self-gravitational instability in some cases, plausibly where accretion is into a nearly spherical UDMH which has formed from a rare peak in the density field. This results in a further, rapid transfer of mass inwards due to viscous forces and gravitational torques leading to the formation of a supermassive star and/or black hole of about 10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at redshifts of a few hundred, with abundances comparable to galaxies. Such intermediate mass black holes formed at high redshifts can seed the first super massive black holes and help explain the abundance of active galaxies detected now at increasingly larger redshifts by the James Webb Space Telescope.

<p>
We present the spectroscopic confirmation and in-depth analysis of AURORA-LQG1, a low-mass quiescent galaxy at z<sub>spec</sub>=2.0834 with log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=9.6 observed with medium-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy. The deep medium-resolution spectrum enables the measurement of its stellar velocity dispersion (σ<sub>&sext;</sub> = 95_-33^+38 km s<sup>-1</sup>), the smallest value recorded among spectroscopically confirmed quiescent galaxies at z~2. Coupled with a compact size (0.41±0.03  kpc), it yields a dynamical mass estimate of log(M_dyn/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=9.75_-0.38^+0.29. Its star formation history suggests that half of the stellar mass was in place ~1 Gyr before the observed epoch, with quenching occurring ~0.2 Gyr prior to z=2.08. These results confirm that AURORA-LQG1 is genuinely quenched, rather than in a temporary phase of suppressed star formation rate. AURORA-LQG1 is consistent with the mass fundamental plane at z~2, previously constrained only by massive quiescent systems. Compared with more massive counterparts at the same epoch observed with NIRSpec grating spectroscopy, the time since quenching for AURORA-LQG1 is among the shortest observed. The galaxy resides in a possible dense group-scale (~50 kpc) environment containing one companion with tentative spectroscopic redshift and five companion candidates, and it is embedded in a known protocluster on Mpc scales. A potential environmental influence on its evolution could explain the outside-in quenching suggested by the positive gradient of size with wavelength. This study demonstrates that deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy enables low-mass quiescent galaxies at Cosmic Noon to be characterized with a level of detail long reserved for massive systems, offering valuable new insights into how quenching operates in these underexplored low-mass systems.

<p> Nicolò Dalmasso, Giovanni Ferrami, Nicha Leethochawalit, Emanuele M. Ventura, Michele Trenti </p>
<p>
We present the deepest clustering analysis of early galaxies to date, analyzing N_g ≃ 6500 photometrically-selected Lyman Break Galaxies from JWST's Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) to reveal how galaxies and dark matter evolved during cosmic dawn (5 ≤ z &lt; 11). Using halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling of the two-point angular correlation function, we trace the galaxy-halo relationships across the first billion years of cosmic history. Our analysis reveals that galaxies at z = 10.6 reside in dark matter halos over an order of magnitude less massive (M_h ~ 10^10.12 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) than their counterparts at z = 5.5 (M_h ~ 10^11.45 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), while exhibiting correspondingly higher effective bias values (b_g^eff = 8.13^+0.04_-0.02 compared to 5.64^+0.10_-0.13). Correspondingly, the satellite galaxy fraction hints at a declining trend with decreasing redshift, reaching &lt;1&percnt; by z ~ 5-6. However, the significant systematic and random uncertainties in the data-model comparison prevent us from drawing robust conclusions on the evolution - if any - of the satellite fraction during the epoch of reionization. These results provide the first view of the coevolution between galaxies and dark matter evolved at redshift ≳ 10, offering additional and independent constraints on early galaxy formation models tuned to reproducing luminosity function evolution.

### 180) [2601.01034](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01034v2): Testing supermassive primordial black holes with lensing signals of binary black hole merges

<p> Huan Zhou, Bin Liu, Zheng-Xiang Li, Xi-Jing Wang, Kai Liao </p>
<p>
Next-generation ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors are expected to observe millions of binary black hole mergers, a fraction of which will be strongly lensed by intervening galaxies or clusters, producing multiple images with characteristic distribution of time delay. Importantly, the predicted rate and properties of such events are sensitive to the abundance and distribution of strong lensing objects which directly depends on cosmological models. One such scenario posits the existence of supermassive primordial black holes (SMPBHs) in the early universe, which would enhance the formation of dark matter halos. This mechanism has been proposed to explain the abundance of high-redshift galaxies observed by James Webb Space Telescope. Crucially, the same cosmological model with SMPBHs would also leave a distinct imprint on the population of strongly lensed GWs. It predicts both an increased event rate and a modified distribution of time delays between the multiple images. Therefore, we propose statistical measurements of the rate and time delay distribution of strong lensing GW events as a powerful probe to directly constrain the abundance of SMPBHs. Considering ΛCDM cosmology with (non-)clustered SMPBHs, we find that the abundance of SMPBHs f_PBH with masses above 10^8~M<sub>&odot;</sub> is constrained to be ~10^-4 at 95&percnt; confidence level. It will be comparable and complementary to the currently available constraint from large scale structure observations.

<p>
Massive quenched galaxies at z&gt;3 challenge models of early galaxy evolution, as their rapid formation and abrupt quenching require efficient feedback, often linked to active galactic nuclei (AGN). The quiescent galaxy GS10578 at z=3.1 is a key example of this population. Previous JWST/NIRSpec IFU data revealed an AGN outflow and uncovered a compact pair of AGN separated by ~5 kpc. In addition, VLT/MUSE spectroscopy has identified a third AGN candidate at a projected distance of ~30 kpc, associated with a luminous Lya emitter (LAE2) characterised by high-ionisation UV lines, although rest-frame optical diagnostics were not previously available. We aim to confirm the nature of LAE2 using rest-frame optical diagnostics enabled by new JWST data, and to characterise the physical and ionisation properties of both LAE2 and a distinct nearby Lya emitter (LAE1) that lacks any detectable continuum counterpart. We analyse new NIRSpec IFU observations targeting the optical nebular lines of LAE1 and LAE2, complemented with MUSE data, as part of the GA-NIFS project. We extract integrated and spatially resolved spectra, construct emission-line maps, and use standard diagnostic diagrams to determine ionisation sources and kinematics. LAE2 exhibits line ratios fully consistent with an embedded AGN. Its optical lines display a clumpy morphology and irregular kinematics on sub-kpc scales. Except for Lya, LAE1 remains undetected in all nebular lines and in JWST imaging. The similarity of the LAE1 and LAE2 Lya profiles in both velocity and flux suggests that LAE1 traces resonantly scattered emission rather than in-situ star formation. Our analysis reveals that the environment of GS10578 contains both multi-black-hole activity and gas structures on tens-of-kpc scales, offering new insights into how feedback and satellite interactions influence the late evolutionary stages of quenched massive galaxies.

<p> Andreas A. C. Sander </p>
<p>
Massive stars are the engines of the Cosmos, shaping their environments and driving galaxy evolution across cosmic time. Yet, this general textbook picture faces many challenges when trying to turn abstract insights into quantitative predictions. Recent discoveries, such the surprisingly high metallicity and early nitrogen enrichment in high-redshift galaxies discovered by JWST, are challenging current descriptions of massive star evolution and add new pieces to a puzzle that is yet everything but complete. The oncoming era of large surveys and advances in computational modeling create the potential to reach breakthroughs in our understanding. Yet, to resolve current problems and conflicting conclusions, we will also need to reconsider what we think we know. Are the objects we observe what we think they are? Are the models we use describing what is actually going on? And what can we learn from previous misconceptions? This short review highlights major open questions from individual stars and stellar systems back to the first galaxies while also discussing two examples - the weak-wind problem as well as the different flavours and impact of Wolf-Rayet stars - where recent discoveries might point in a new direction.

<p> David D Vaida, Ryan Jeffrey Farber </p>
<p>
Since the launch of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in late 2021, our understanding of high-redshift objects has faced several upheavals. JWST has discovered much more massive galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBH) than cosmological models had expected. Furthermore, JWST observations have revealed an entirely novel population of high-redshift objects. Characterized by a dominant red rest-frame component and point-like morphology, these "little red dots'' (LRD) have set off a flurry of observational and theoretical follow-up. The current identity of LRD is highly debated, yet falling into two main scenarios: active galactic nuclei (i.e., SMBH) or compact star-forming regions. If star-forming, LRD would represent the highest stellar densities ever observed. If SMBH, their high Eddington fractions, and already high masses, help elucidate the growth of the most massive SMBH found by JWST in the early Universe (z ≳4). In this mini-review, we present the observational evidence accumulated to date, including sub-millimeter probes of LRD dust masses, constraints on radio and X-ray emission from stacking, and rest-frame ultraviolet \& optical measurements provided by JWST. Furthermore, we highlight how identifying additional LRD that are truly primarily SMBH-driven may help to shed light on the formation of `overly massive' SMBH discovered by JWST within the first billion years since the Big Bang.

Red supergiants (RSGs) are important for our understanding of supernova progenitors, stellar populations, stellar evolution, mass loss and dust production. Extragalactic surveys of RSGs have a long history in the Local Group, but few studies exist beyond that due to the limited resolution and sensitivity of ground-based and previous space-based infrared observatories. Here we demonstrate the combined power of HST and JWST to push systematic searches of RSGs out to ~20 Mpc. We introduce a catalog of 97057 RSGs &ndash; the largest single-survey release of RSGs &ndash; with masses ≳10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> in 19 galaxies from the PHANGS HST+JWST Treasury program. We use HST F814W and JWST F200W photometry to select stars as RSGs based on predicted colors and magnitudes from PARSEC isochrones. The spatial distribution of our recovered RSGs follow the familiar pattern of mostly being concentrated in active star-forming regions such as spiral arms and central starburst rings. The RSG number density on kpc-scales is strongly correlated (r_s~0.82) with local star-formation rate density (Σ_SFR) traced by extinction-corrected far-ultraviolet (FUV) from GALEX+WISE, and weakly correlated (r_s~0.57) with the total stellar mass density (Σ_*), traced by near-infrared emission from WISE+Spitzer. The number of RSGs per mass of stellar populations with ages 6-30 Myr (the likely age range of RSGs &gt;10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) is ~1 per 10^3.77±0.27 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, assuming constant star-formation rates from FUV+W4. Our sample will be a useful resource for tracking progenitors and feedback sites of future supernovae in PHANGS, age-dating stellar populations, and more.

<p> Cody Carr, Renyue Cen, Brian Fleming, Sophia Flury, Stephan McCandliss, Sally Oey, Allison Strom </p>
<p>
The Epoch of Reionization marks the last major phase transition in the early Universe, during which the majority of neutral hydrogen once filling the intergalactic medium was ionized by the first galaxies. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is now identifying promising galaxy candidates capable of producing sufficient ionizing photons to drive this transformation. However, the fraction of these photons that escape into intergalactic space&ndash;the escape fraction&ndash;remains highly uncertain. Stellar feedback is thought to play a critical role in carving low-density channels that allow ionizing radiation to escape, but the dominant mechanisms, their operation, and their connection to observable signatures are not well understood. Local analogs of high-redshift galaxies offer a powerful alternative for studying these processes, since ionizing radiation is unobservable at high redshift due to intergalactic absorption. However, current UV space-based instrumentation lacks the spatial resolution and sensitivity required to fully address this problem. The core challenge lies in the multiscale nature of LyC escape: ionizing photons are generated on scales of 1&ndash;100 pc in super star clusters but must traverse the circumgalactic medium which can extend beyond 100 kpc. The proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will provide a platform for future UV instruments capable of resolving these scales. In this article, we present a science case for understanding how LyC photons escape from star-forming galaxies and define the observational requirements for future instruments aboard HWO, including a UV integral field spectrograph (IFS).

<p> Tak-Pong Woo </p>
<p>
JWST surveys have uncovered a population of compact, red sources ("Little Red Dots," LRDs) at z ≥ 5 that exhibit broad Balmer emission yet remain X-ray faint, implying heavy obscuration with N_H ≥ 10^24 cm<sup>2</sup>. We propose that LRDs may trace a short-lived, obscured phase associated with rapid baryonic inflow inside the deep solitonic cores of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) halos. Combining the soliton size scaling with (i) the observed compact radii (r_e ~ 30-100 pc) and (ii) the requirement that Compton-thick columns be achievable within a region of order the core radius, we find that particle masses m few × 10^-22 eV are plausible for soliton masses M_s ~ 10^8 - 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>; we adopt m_22=2 as a fiducial choice. A conservative mass-budget estimate for the obscuring column, together with isothermal hydrostatic stratification, indicates that configurations reaching N_H ≥ 10^24 - 10^25 cm<sup>2</sup> require densities for which radiative losses (cooling and/or diffusion) occur faster than the dynamical time, suggesting that a long-lived static hot atmosphere is unlikely (an "Opacity Crisis") and that rapid inflow or radiation-pressure-driven evolution is favored. Using 512^3 pseudo-spectral Schrödinger-Poisson simulations of idealized soliton mergers, we illustrate that compact, high-density soliton cores can form via violent relaxation under representative scalings. We discuss observational implications and tests, and outline the need for future radiation-hydrodynamic modeling to predict demographics and detailed spectra.

### 187) [2512.23789](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23789v1): Dark Recipe for the First Giants: From Population III Stars to Early Supermassive Black Holes via Dark Matter Capture

<p> Sulagna Bhattacharya, Debajit Bose, Basudeb Dasgupta, Jaya Doliya, Ranjan Laha </p>
<p>
The presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshifts (z&gt;5), as revealed by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), challenges standard black hole (BH) formation scenarios. We propose a mechanism in which non-annihilating dark matter (DM) with non-gravitational interactions with the Standard Model (SM) particles accumulates inside Population III (Pop III) stars, inducing their premature collapse into BH seeds having the same mass as the parent star. Owing to their early formation, these seeds can accrete for longer periods and grow into the SMBHs observed at early cosmic times. Focusing on spin-dependent (SD) DM-proton interactions, we identify regions of parameter space that account for the observed high-redshift SMBH population, their mass function, and the SMBH-stellar mass relation. Portions of this parameter space are testable by forthcoming direct detection experiments. The scenario may lead to distinctive gravitational wave (GW) signatures from SMBH mergers, accessible to Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and pulsar timing array (PTA) observations.

### 188) [2512.23157](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23157v1): The GLASS-JWST Early Release Science Program. V. Hα luminosity functions at z~1.3 and z~2.0

We present Hα luminosity function (LF) measurements at redshifts z~1.3 and z~2.0 using JWST NIRISS grism data from the GLASS-JWST survey. Based on emission lines spectroscopically identified in the F115W, F150W and F200W filters, we select 99 Hα emitters. Through detailed effective volume and completeness analysis for each source, we construct the Hα LF in two redshift bins. Thanks to the sensitivity of NIRISS WFSS and gravitational lensing magnification, our sample reaches intrinsic Hα luminosities ~10 times deeper than previous grism surveys, down to L_Hα~10^40.5~erg~s<sup>-1</sup> at z~1.3 and L_Hα~10^40.9~erg~s<sup>-1</sup> at z~2.0 with completeness larger than 0.8, corresponding to star formation rates of 0.4 and 1.0 M<sub>&odot;</sub>~yr^-1, respectively. We robustly constrain the faint-end slope of the Hα luminosity function to be -1.50^+0.14_-0.08 at z~1.3 and -1.60^+0.17_-0.09 at z~2.0 after considering the cosmic variance of ~ 20&percnt;, consistent with previous estimations. The emission-line samples presented here will enable further detailed studies of galaxy properties including metallicities. We find a negligible contribution from bright active galactic nuclei in our sample. We estimate integrated cosmic star formation rate densities of 0.097^+0.015_-0.016~M<sub>&odot;</sub>~yr^-1~Mpc^-3 at z~1.3 and 0.129^+0.025_-0.030~M<sub>&odot;</sub>~yr^-1~Mpc^-3 at z~2.0. The methodology presented here can be readily applicable to other JWST slitless spectroscopic datasets and future wide-field slitless surveys, including those from Euclid, Roman, and the Chinese Space Station Telescope.

(Shortened)Context: We analyze the optical variability of the FSRQ Ton 599 using BVRI photometry from the WEBT collaboration (2011-2023), complemented by photometric and spectroscopic data from the Steward Observatory.\ Aims: To characterize short- and long-term optical variability &ndash; including flux distributions, intranight changes, color evolution, and spectra &ndash; to constrain physical parameters and processes in the central engine.\ Methods: We tested flux distributions in each filter against normal and log-normal, explored the RMS-flux relation and derived PSDs. We quantified intranight variability using a χ^2 test and fractional variability. From variability timescales, we estimated the emitting region size and magnetic field. Long-term variability was studied by segmenting the light curve into 12 intervals and analyzing flux statistics. For multi-filter flares, we computed spectral slopes, redshift-corrected fluxes, monochromatic luminosities and generated Color-magnitude and color-time diagrams. From low-flux spectra, we measured Mg II line and estimated the black hole mass.\ Results: Ton 599 showed strong optical variability. Log-normal distributions fit the fluxes better, and all bands show a positive RMS-flux relation with red-noise PSDs.Intranight variability is detected, and used in constraining the emission region and magnetic field.The R band reaches a peak flux of 23.5 mJy, corresponding to a monochromatic luminosity of log(νLν)= 48.48 [erg/s]. We found a redder-when-brighter trend at low fluxes (thermal), achromatic behavior at intermediate levels (possibly due to jet orientation changes), and a bluer-when-brighter trend at high fluxes (synchrotron). Long-term color changes are modest, short-term are significant, with a negative correlation between the amplitude of color changes and the average flux. The estimated SMBH mass is order of 10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>.

### 190) [2512.21927](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21927v1): A large, long-lived, slowly-expanding superbubble across the Perseus Arm

<p> Bingqiu Chen, Guangxing Li, Haibo Yuan, Maosheng Xiang, Jixuan Zhou, Pinjian Chen, Martin Krause, Ashley Coombs </p>
<p>
Stellar feedback is a crucial mechanism in galactic evolution, as demonstrated by the widespread bubbles observed with JWST. In this study, we combine data from Gaia and LAMOST to obtain a sample of young O-B2 stars with full three-dimensional velocity information. Focusing on the largest known superbubble in the Milky Way, we identify groups of O-B2 stars at its periphery, exhibiting a transverse velocity of 25.8 km/s and an expansion velocity of 6.2 km/s. Using these velocities, we calculate a crossing time t_cross ~ 20 Myr and an expansion timescale t_expansion ~ 80 Myr. We estimate a survival timescale t_survival ~ 250 Myr and a supernova interval t_SN ~ 0.1 Myr. Together with the Galactic shear timescale t_shear ~ 30 Myr, these values satisfy t_SN &lt; t_shear &lt; t_survival. The energy and momentum from supernovae are sufficient to sustain the bubble's growth against ambient pressure. This indicates that repeated supernovae replenish energy faster than shear and turbulent distort the cavity. Our analysis classifies the Giant Oval Cavity as a large, quasi-stationary superbubble, similar to the Phantom Bubble observed by JWST, stabilised by the interplay between stellar feedback and Galactic disk dynamics.

### 191) [2512.21632](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21632v1): Can A Kinematically Hot and Thick Disk Form A Bar? : Role of Highly Spinning Dark Matter Halos

<p> Sandeep Kumar Kataria </p>
<p>
Recent JWST observations claim the existence of a significant fraction of bars in the kinematically hotter and thicker disk at high redshift Universe. These observations challenge the current understanding of disk stability in galaxies similar to the Milky Way. The analytical work and N-body simulations suggest that the kinematically hot (dispersion-dominated) and thick disk are stable against bar formation. In this work, we perform the controlled N-body simulations of a kinematically hot and thick disk, which is residing in a non-rotating and spinning dark matter halo. We report that the disk, which is classically stable against bar instability in the live and non-rotating halo, leads to bar formation in a spinning halo environment. The spinning halo model is 8 times more efficient in transporting angular momentum from the disk to the halo compared to the non-spinning halo. We claim that Ostriker-Peebles and ELN bar formation criteria do not predict bar formation for both the non-roating and spinning halo. The recent criteria from Jang-Kim successfully predict the bar stability for the non-rotating halo model, but not for the spinning halo model. These results provide an important insight into the bar formation processes for thick and hot disks at high redshift.

### 192) [2512.20945](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20945v1): Mid-IR luminosity functions: inferred dusty cosmic star-formation and black hole accretion histories from the JWST SMILES

<p>
Mid-infrared (mid-IR) observations are crucial for understanding galaxy evolution, tracing star formation, and active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity via dust emission. This work presents mid-IR galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 6, derived from the JWST Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES) program. We combine 8 MIRI bands (5-25 μm) of SMILES and archival 23-band HST+JWST NIRCam photometry to construct an extensive catalog containing 2,813 galaxies with sub-μJy level completeness in the mid-IR. We obtain monochromatic (in 5.6, 7.7, 10, 12.8, 15, 18, 21, and 25.5 μm), L_IR, and AGN LFs, with a limiting luminosity down to 10^9.5 L<sub>&odot;</sub> at z=0.5-1.0, ~10^10.5 L<sub>&odot;</sub> at z=2.0-4.0, and to ~10^11 L<sub>&odot;</sub> at z=4.0-6.0. With the unprecedented sensitivity and resolution of JWST, here we better constrain the faint-end slope and its evolution of the mid-IR LFs, quantifying the dusty cosmic star formation and black hole accretion histories out to z ~ 5. These results provide essential insights to refine our understanding of the obscured star formation and galaxy-AGN co-evolution over cosmic time.

Sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) ice has been tentatively detected in protostellar envelopes, but its reliability as a solid-state sulfur reservoir remains unclear. We present new measurements of SO<sub>2</sub> ice from 6.8-8.5 μm toward four Class 0 protostars observed with JWST's Mid-Infrared (MIRI) Medium Resolution Spectrometer, as part of the COMs ORigin Investigated by the Next-generation Observatory in Space (CORINOS) program. The sample spans a luminosity range from 1 L<sub>&odot;</sub> (B335, IRAS 15398-3359) to 10 L<sub>&odot;</sub> (L483, Ser-emb~7). To assess continuum placement uncertainty in absorption spectra, we apply randomized polynomial fits over the restricted region. We fit laboratory spectra from the Leiden Ice Database for Astrochemistry (LIDA) using the open-source Python library Omnifit. We detect the 7.7 μm CH_4 band in all sources and find its column density robust to baseline choice, providing a reference for evaluating the weaker SO<sub>2</sub> feature on its blue shoulder and quantifying baseline-related uncertainty. Three SO<sub>2</sub> laboratory ices were tested: pure SO<sub>2</sub> ice yields 0.3-1.2% of volatile sulfur may be locked in SO<sub>2</sub> ice (lower and upper limits); CH_3OH:SO<sub>2</sub> ice gives 0.02-0.18%, but with lower quality fitting. The best-fitting H<sub>2</sub>O:SO<sub>2</sub> ice yields 0.2-0.9%, which we consider the most realistic. These ranges define plausible bounds on SO<sub>2</sub> ice abundances in our sample. We find evidence for SO<sub>2</sub> in Ser-emb 7, L483, and IRAS 15398-3359, but emphasize the noisy spectrum of B335 prevents a definitive detection. Comparing SO<sub>2</sub> ice abundances across the different environments, we assess how conditions influence role of SO<sub>2</sub> as a potential sulfur reservoir and implications for the longstanding "missing sulfur'' problem.

<p>
We present an analysis of archival JWST NIRSpec IFS and HST imaging observations of the z = 3 Lyman-Continuum Emitter (LCE) candidate LACES104037. We show that a nearby galaxy, denoted LACES104037-S, has a redshift offset from the main galaxy by only ~ 450 km/s. Together with the identification of tidal bridge features between the galaxies, this indicates that the galaxies are interacting and most likely in the early stages of a merger. We show that the restframe LCE cluster sits in a tidal bridge towards the companion, about 2.7 kpc from the galaxy's core. It is faint in non-ionizing stellar continuum, and shows faint but non-negligible Hα and [O III] emission, suggesting that much of the gas surrounding the LCE cluster has been dispersed by feedback in the shallower gravitational potential of the tidal bridge. From comparing the direct LyC escape and the local Hα emission, we find a total ionizing LyC escape fraction of f<sub>esc</sub> = 57 ± 8&percnt; from the LCE cluster. We estimate the age of the LCE cluster to be ≲ 6.5 Myr, indicating that the cluster must have formed in situ in the tidal bridge well after the time of closest interaction. LyC escape from tidal stripping or in-situ formed stars in tidal features would depend less on intrinsic galaxy properties than typically observed in low-z LCE surveys, and could help explain the higher cosmic escape fraction as well as the enhanced diversity of LCE galaxy properties observed at Cosmic Noon.

The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will provide a revolutionary measurement of the Universe's expansion kinematics, driven by dark matter and dark energy, out to z ≈ 3. The accuracy of this measurement is predicated on the assumption that standardized Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) luminosities do not evolve with redshift. If present, SN Ia luminosity evolution is expected to be most detectable in the dark matter-dominated era of the Universe (z ≳ 1.5), with its effects becoming more easily distinguishable from dark energy variation at increasing redshift. We present JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec observations of SN 2025ogs, a normal SN Ia at z = 2.05 ± 0.01. This SN offers a key point of comparison for interpreting future high-redshift SN Ia samples. The NIRCam light curve indicates a blue color (B - V = -0.27 ± 0.06 mag) and a moderately fast decline (Δm_15(B) = 1.55 ± 0.15 mag), both within standard criteria for inclusion in cosmological analyses. Its luminosity distance is in 1.0σ agreement with a standard flat ΛCDM model, as well as with current cosmological constraints from the Dark Energy Survey (DES 5yr) and Pantheon+. The NIRSpec spectrum displays all of the hallmark absorption features of a normal SN Ia observed at peak brightness. We find that the rest-frame optical color, rest-frame near-ultraviolet properties, and Si II line strengths are all consistent with the moderately fast decline inferred from the light curve. Multiple absorption features (Ca II H&K, O I &lambda;7774, and the Ca II NIR triplet) all appear at a lower blueshift relative to a sample of low-z SNe Ia. Together, these results suggest that SN Ia standardization remains robust at z ≈ 2, and also highlight the importance of JWST spectroscopy for uncovering evolutionary effects that could impact Roman's high-precision cosmology.

JWST has discovered an early period of galaxy formation that was more vigorous than expected, which has challenged our understanding of the early Universe. In this work, we present the longest spectroscopic integration ever acquired by JWST/MIRI. This spectrum covers the brightest rest-frame optical nebular emission lines for the luminous galaxy JADES-GS-z14-0 at z &gt; 14. Most notably, we detect [OIII] λλ4959,5007 at ≈ 11 σ and Hα at ≈ 4 σ with these ultra-deep observations. These lines reveal that JADES-GS-z14-0 has low dust attenuation with a recent star-formation rate of SFR ≈ 10 ± 2 M<sub>&odot;</sub> / yr, star-formation rate surface density of Σ_SFR ≈ 23 ± 5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr/kpc<sup>2</sup>, and ionizing photon production efficiency of ξ<sub>ion</sub> ≈ 10^25.3 ± 0.1 Hz/erg. Using standard strong-line diagnostics, we infer a gas-phase oxygen abundance of [O/H] ≈ -1.1 ± 0.4 (≈ 10&percnt; Z<sub>&odot;</sub>), carbon-to-oxygen ratio of [C/O] ≈ -0.4 ± 0.4, ionization parameter of log_10(U) ≳ -2.4, and density of n_H ≈ 720 ± 210 cm^-3. Using detailed photoionization modeling, we instead derive [O/H] ≈ -0.3_-0.4^+0.4 (≈ 50&percnt; Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) and log_10(U) ≈ -1.5_-0.4^+0.3. The inferred properties of JADES-GS-z14-0 are similar to those measured for similarly luminous galaxies at z &gt; 10 with previous MIRI/Spectroscopy, such as GHZ2/GLASSz12, GN-z11, and MACS0647-JD1. Existing simulations are unable to reproduce the empirical and inferred properties of JADES-GS-z14-0. This work demonstrates an important step toward understanding the formation of the first stars and heavy elements in the Universe. [Abridged]

<p> Valerio De Luca, Loris Del Grosso, Gabriele Franciolini, Konstantinos Kritos, Emanuele Berti, Daniel D'Orazio, Joseph Silk </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a population of compact, high-redshift sources, the Little Red Dots (LRDs), which may host supermassive black holes (BHs) significantly heavier than their stellar content compared with local scaling relations. These objects challenge standard models of early galaxy formation and may represent an extreme class of early BH hosts. In this paper, we investigate whether these BHs could have a primordial origin. We first show that the direct formation of these BH masses in the early Universe is excluded by stringent CMB μ-distortion limits. We then investigate the assembly of massive BHs from lighter, observationally allowed primordial black holes (PBHs) via hierarchical mergers, finding that, although this channel can operate depending on the merger history, it faces challenges in explaining the observations due to the rarity of the required high-redshift dark matter halos. Finally, we estimate gas accretion onto intermediate-mass PBHs, while jointly tracking metallicity evolution, and identify regions of parameter space in which such growth could reproduce the observed properties of LRDs. As a special case, we focus on the strongly lensed source QSO1, whose extremely low metallicity and large mass provide a stringent test of these formation channels.

### 198) [2512.19175](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19175v1): DESI DR2 Constraints on the R_h=ct Universe: Model Viability and Comparison with ΛCDM

<p> Amritansh Mehrotra, S. K. J. Pacif, A. F. Santos </p>
<p>
We carry out a comparative analysis of the standard ΛCDM cosmological model and the alternative R_h=ct framework using recent observational data from cosmic chronometers, Type Ia supernova, and baryon acoustic oscillations. The study evaluates the ability of each model to reproduce the observed expansion history of the Universe through a joint statistical assessment based on the chi-squared statistics, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), and Bayes factor. While both models yield acceptable fits, ΛCDM consistently attains lower information-criterion values and higher likelihood, indicating a superior overall performance. An examination of the redshift evolution of the Hubble parameter H(z) and the deceleration parameter q(z) shows that ΛCDM naturally captures the transition from early-time deceleration to late-time acceleration, where as R_h=ct predicts a strictly linear expansion. We also estimate the age of the Universe within both models, finding that ΛCDM prediction agrees with the Planck 2018 result, while the linear expansion in R_h=ct leads to an older cosmic age. Recent JWST observations of unexpectedly mature high-redshift galaxies have reopened the discussion regarding whether the Universe may be older than implied by the standard model; although these results remain under active investigation, they underscore that fully resolving cosmic evolution may require refinements beyond the concordance paradigm.

### 199) [2512.18805](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18805v1): Spider-Webb: Spatially-Resolved Evidence of Inside-Out Quenching in the Spiderweb Protocluster at z ~ 2

We present a spatially-resolved analysis of galaxy quenching within the Spiderweb Protocluster at z ~ 2.16, combining deep imaging from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Utilizing pixel-by-pixel spectral energy distribution fitting, we derive maps of stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), specific SFR (sSFR), and rest-frame UVJ colors. Quiescent galaxies, predominantly found at log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 10.5, exhibit clear mass-dependent inside-out quenching, with central sSFR approximately an order of magnitude lower than outer regions, while lower-mass star-forming galaxies show flat sSFR profiles. Central star formation activity fundamentally anti-correlates with Sérsic index, indicating reduced activity in bulge-dominated systems. Spatially resolved UVJ colors reveal heterogeneous internal star formation, distinguishing star-forming regions in quiescent hosts from those in globally star-forming systems. These findings demonstrate that quenching mechanisms were effectively operating by z ~ 2, with the observed inside-out patterns and morphological correlations consistent with AGN-driven feedback processes. Our study provides key observational constraints on galaxy evolution during this critical epoch.

Luminous quasars at the redshift frontier z&gt;7 serve as stringent probes of super-massive black hole formation and they are thought to undergo much of their growth obscured by dense gas and dust in their host galaxies. Fully characterizing the symbiotic evolution of SMBHs and hosts requires rest-frame optical observations that span spatial scales from the broad-line region to the ISM and CGM. JWST now provides the necessary spatially resolved spectroscopy to do so. But the physical conditions that regulate the interplay between SMBHs and their hosts at the highest redshifts, especially the nature of early feedback phases, remain unclear. We present JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of J0313-1806 at z=7.64, the most distant luminous quasar known. From the restframe optical spectrum of the unresolved quasar, we derive a black hole mass of M_BH=(1.63 ± 0.10)×10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> based on Hβ and an Eddington rate of λ=L/L_Edd=0.80± 0.05, consistent with previous MgII-based estimates. J0313-1806 exhibits no detectable [O III] emission on nuclear scales. Most remarkably, we detect an ionized gas shell extending out to ~ 1.8 kpc traced by Hβ emission that also lacks any significant [O III], with a 3σ upper limit on the [O III] λ5007 to Hβ flux ratio of log_10 ≤ft( F([OIII])/F(Hβ))=-1.15. Through photoionization modelling, we demonstrate that the extended emission is consistent with a thin, clumpy outflowing shell where [OIII] is collisionally de-excited by dense gas. We interpret this structure as a fossil remnant of a recent blowout phase, providing evidence for episodic feedback cycles in one of the earliest quasars. These findings suggest that dense ISM phases may play a crucial role in shaping the spectral properties of quasars accross cosmic time.

### 201) [2512.15853](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15853v2): From "The Cliff" to "Virgil": Mapping the Spectral Diversity of Little Red Dots with JWST/NIRSpec

<p>
One of JWST's most unexpected discoveries is the emergence of "Little Red Dots'' (LRDs): compact sources at z ≳ 3 with blue rest-frame UV continua, red optical slopes, and broad Balmer emission lines that challenge standard models and suggest a population of early, unusual active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Using a comprehensive photometric selection and public NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy across six JWST deep fields, we identify a large sample of 118 LRDs with high-S/N spectra, enabling a population-wide analysis of their UV-optical continuum and emission lines. We find clear correlations between rest-frame color ([0.3-0.9 μm]) and slopes: bluer LRDs have blue UV slopes (β_ν,UV ~ 0.3) and red optical slopes, while redder LRDs exhibit redder UV slopes (β_ν,UV ~ 1.1). The continuum shape shows a similar trend: redder LRDs display prominent Balmer breaks and curvature, while bluer LRDs follow power-law-like optical SEDs. From literature compilations, ~60% of known broad-line AGNs satisfy our LRD criteria, and up to 90% of LRDs show broad Balmer lines. Emission-line diagnostics reveal a shift from high H_α/H_β and low [OIII]&lambda;5007/H_β in redder LRDs to the opposite in bluer ones, along with stronger narrow-line equivalent widths, suggesting a transition from AGN- to host-dominated emission. We fit the spectra with a two-component model combining a gas-enshrouded black hole (BH) and a galaxy host. Redder LRDs require higher-luminosity, unreddened BHs and modestly reddened hosts; bluer LRDs require lower-luminosity, reddened BHs and dust-free galaxies. This framework reproduces the diversity in colors and spectral shape by varying BH luminosity, obscuration, and host-to-BH luminosity ratio.

Over the last 15 years, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has revolutionized astrophysics by providing unprecedented resolution and sensitivity in observing the cold universe, including the formation of stars, planets, and galaxies. With groundbreaking discoveries ranging from the first detailed images of protoplanetary disks to the kinematics of galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization, ALMA has showcased the vast discovery potential of the (sub-)mm wavelength regime. However, in another 15 years from now&ndash;in the 2040s&ndash;the science landscape will have changed dramatically as new major observational facilities will have started their operations or have come towards advanced maturity in their scientific outcome (e.g., JWST, Rubin Observatory, ELT, Euclid, Gaia, Plato, Ariel, Roman Space Telescope, SPHEREx, LiteBIRD, LISA, SKA and others). At the same time, ALMA's current Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade will have been in place for ~10 years, and ALMA itself will have been operational for 30 years. To fully exploit this era, the community needs a next-generation facility operating at (sub-)mm wavelengths with capabilities far beyond those possible within ALMA's current infrastructure. To this end, ALMA2040 is a community-driven initiative to define the key scientific questions of the 2040s and translate them into a technical vision for a next-generation transformational (sub-)millimeter facility. Our goal with this document is to summarize the current status of the effort, synthesize outcomes from the 2025 workshops, outline next steps toward a reference design concept, and invite broad participation from the global mm/sub-mm community to help shape this future facility. In the following we provide details on the process and scope. We invite everyone who wishes to join the effort and/or contribute to the dedicated White Papers planned for 2026.

### 203) [2512.13778](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13778v2): Resolving dust and Lyα emission in a lensed galaxy at the epoch of reionization with JWST/CANUCS

Lyman α emission is highly sensitive to dust and neutral hydrogen and is therefore expected to be strongly suppressed in dusty or gas-rich galaxies during the epoch of reionization (EoR). Nevertheless, numerous moderately dusty Lyα emitters (LAEs) are observed at this epoch, suggesting that complex interstellar medium (ISM) geometries and feedback-driven outflows may facilitate Lyα escape. We investigate the dust, gas, and stellar properties of the gravitationally lensed LAE HCM 6A at z=6.5676 to characterize its multiphase ISM and the physical conditions regulating Lyα escape. We combine JWST/NIRISS slitless spectroscopy, HST+JWST/NIRCam imaging, and JWST/NIRSpec slit spectra from the CANUCS program. Using a customized BAGPIPES SED-fitting framework with a flexible attenuation law, we derive stellar, nebular, and dust properties on integrated (~kpc), slit-level (~0.1 kpc), and pixel-level (~25 pc) scales, enabled by strong lensing (μ≈ 8.3-9.1). A Lyα map from SLEUTH traces the spatial distribution of Lyα emission. We measure an unlensed stellar mass of log M<sub>&ast;</sub> = 8.3-8.4 and an intrinsic UV magnitude of M_UV = -19.8 ± 0.1. The older region (S1) is moderately dusty with consistent stellar and nebular attenuation indicators, implying a uniform ISM geometry, while the youngest region (S3) shows strong discrepancies among dust tracers, indicating a feedback-shaped multiphase ISM. Lyα emission arises primarily from S3, where a dust-cleared central clump enables efficient Lyα escape. We find Calzetti-like attenuation curves with a UV bump that strengthens with stellar age and decreasing A_V. Our observations provide a uniquely detailed, spatially resolved view of a moderately dusty LAE during the EoR, demonstrating how feedback and multiphase ISM structure govern Lyα escape.

The galaxy cluster XLSSC~122 is a rare system at z = 1.98, hosting surprisingly evolved member galaxies when the Universe was only one-third of its present age. Leveraging deep JWST/NIRCam imaging, we perform a weak-lensing analysis and reconstruct the cluster's mass distribution, finding a mass peak that coincides with both the X-ray peak and the position of the brightest cluster galaxy. We obtain a mass estimate of M_200c=1.6 ± 0.3× 10^14~M<sub>&odot;</sub> and a concentration of c_200 c=6.3 ± 0.3 implied by the preferred concentration&ndash;mass relation, in agreement with recent strong-lensing estimates. The high concentration in particular motivates tests against empirical and simulation-derived concentration&ndash;mass relations. Placing our weak-lensing mass map in the context of Chandra X-ray data, MeerKAT radio imaging, ALMA+ACA/ACT Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) mapping, and new JWST intracluster light measurements, we identify consistent NE&ndash;SW elongation across datasets and a pronounced offset along the same axis between the SZ and mass/X-ray peaks, pointing to significant merger activity. XLSSC~122 thus serves as a JWST pilot study for high-z lensing, demonstrating the telescope's unique ability to map cluster mass distributions at z~ 2 and motivating a uniform sample of analogous systems with joint lensing, X-ray, SZ, and radio data to probe cluster assembly at cosmic noon.

<p>
Methods: We obtained adaptive optics-assisted integral field spectroscopy in the near-infrared (IR) K band (1.93-2.47 μm) with VLT/SINFONI, complemented by VLA X and C bands (3-6 cm) and ALMA band 3 (~3.3 mm) observations. Results: The near-IR continuum reveals two infrared sources, IRS 2 and IRS 7, while the main protostellar core IRAS 18162-2048 remains undetected up to 2.47 μm. IRS 7 shows a peculiar Hydrogen Recombination Line Brγ profile with a narrow emission component superimposed on a broad absorption feature, consistent with a B2/B3 zero-age main-sequence star. Extended H<sub>2</sub> emission exhibits a `sawtooth' pattern in the excitation diagram, characteristic of UV radiation in a PDR rather than shock excitation. The radiative transfer model Cloudy reproduces the H<sub>2</sub> ro-vibrational populations for T_gas=600 K and n_H=7.9×10^3 cm^-3. VLA X and C bands observations reveal a compact radio source previously reported as a stationary condensation (SC) and coincident with IRS 7. For the first time, we detect IRS 7/SC in mm wavelengths. The spectral index in the 3-6 cm and 3.3 mm regime is consistent with optically thin free-free emission. Conclusions: Our near-IR and radio observations reveal that IRS 7/SC is a B2/B3 ZAMS star that has begun to photoionise its environment, giving rise to an extended PDR and a compact \ionH ii region. The coexistence of this source with the deeply embedded protostar IRAS 18162-2048 and other bubble-like structures in the field, suggests a multigenerational star-forming environment. Future itJames Webb Space Telescope observations targeting the H<sub>2</sub> pure rotational lines (3-28 μm) and other HRLs less affected by extinction will be essential to characterise the cooler molecular and ionised gas to fully disclose the formation history of the region.

<p>
Galactic-scale outflows are a crucial component of galaxy evolution, yet their properties in the early universe remain poorly constrained. We present the first statistical investigation of \ionMg 2-traced cool gas outflows in galaxies spanning a wide cosmic timeline from z ≈ 1 to z &gt; 6 (with sample coverage extending to z ~ 10). Using thousands of public JWST/NIRSpec spectra, we employ a signal-to-noise weighted spectral stacking technique on the \ionMg 2 λ&lambda;2796, 2803 absorption doublet. We robustly detect blueshifted \ionMg 2 absorption in nearly all stellar mass and redshift bins, with the exception of the lowest-mass systems at z ~ 1-2. The outflow equivalent width exhibits a positive correlation with stellar mass (M_*) at all epochs, with the fitted slope of 1.21 ± 0.35. Our work provides the first statistical constraints on \ionMg 2-traced cool outflows in the low-mass (M_* ≲ 10^9.5   M<sub>&odot;</sub>), high-redshift (z &gt; 3) regime. We also find that the outflow velocities generally remain below the host halo escape velocities, consistent with a galactic fountain scenario. The consistency of the stellar mass-outflow equivalent width relation across z ~ 2-6 suggests a persistent, unevolving feedback mechanism governing the baryon cycle towards cosmic dawn.

<p>
We present the first spatially resolved investigation of near-infrared coronal lines in dwarf galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN), using JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy. Coronal lines (CLs), which are forbidden transitions from highly ionized species with ionization potentials up to 450 eV, act as sensitive tracers of the AGN ionizing continuum and feedback processes. Across four dwarf galaxies with ionized gas outflows traced by the optical [O III] lines, we report the detection of 16 unique species of near-infrared CLs. Line ratio diagnostics indicate that photoionization from the AGN dominates the excitation of CLs. We find that the coronal line region in dwarf galaxies, traced by the various CLs, extends up to 0.5 kpc, and can constitute up to 10% of their host galaxy size. Correlations between CL luminosities and [O III] ionized gas outflow properties are consistent with a scenario in which AGN-driven outflows likely facilitate the detection of CLs and contribute to their extent. Several CLs, including [Si VI], [Si VII], and [Mg VIII], exhibit a secondary broad component with W_80 (the line width enclosing 80% of the total flux)&gt; 300 km/s. If we interpret this spatially compact gas as part of an outflow, this would indicate that the outflowing gas includes a wide range of ionizations. The estimated energetics imply this highly ionized component is compact yet powerful enough to perturb gas in the central regions of the host dwarfs. These results indicate that AGN in low-mass galaxies may produce outflows capable of influencing their structure and evolution.

### 208) [2512.04166](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04166v2): JWST Confirmation of a Runaway Supermassive Black Hole via its Supersonic Bow Shock

<p> Pieter van Dokkum, Connor Jennings, Imad Pasha, Charlie Conroy, Ish Kaul, Roberto Abraham, Shany Danieli, Aaron J. Romanowsky, Grant Tremblay </p>
<p>
We present JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of a candidate runaway supermassive black hole at the tip of a 62 kpc-long linear feature at z=0.96. The JWST data show a sharp kinematic discontinuity at the tip, with a radial velocity change of ≈ 600 km/s across 0.1'' (1 kpc). The velocity gradient, together with the projected post-shock flow velocity of ≈ 300 km/s, is well described by a simple shock-compression model of a supersonic object, with a velocity of v_BH = 954^+110_-126 km/s and an inclination i=29^+6_-3 deg. The previously puzzling kinematics along the linear feature, with the observed radial velocity decreasing from ≈ 300 km/s near the tip to ≈ 100 km/s closer to the former host galaxy, are naturally explained as gradual downstream mixing of shocked gas with the circumgalactic medium through turbulent entrainment. The bow shock interpretation is further supported by the morphology of the gas at the tip of the wake and an analysis of the [OIII]/Hα, [NII]/Hα, [SII]/Hα, and [SIII]/[SII] line ratios. The line ratios are consistent with fast radiative shocks and rapid cooling, with best-fit shock velocities that are in agreement with expectations from the black hole velocity and the shock geometry. Energy conservation over the lifetime of the wake suggests a SMBH mass of M_BH ≳ 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. These results confirm that the wake is powered by a supersonic runaway supermassive black hole, a long-predicted consequence of gravitational-wave recoil or multi-body ejection from galactic nuclei.

### 209) [2512.04163](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04163v2): Galactic bars are already mature at Cosmic Noon: bar strength and flatness at z ~ 1.5

<p>
In this work, we explore the nature of z&gt;1 galactic bars. Once thought to be highly transient, our results demonstrate otherwise. Our sample consists of nine massive (&gt;10^10.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) star-forming barred-spiral galaxies at z<sub>spec</sub> ~ 1.5. Using rest-frame near-IR (F444W) JWST/NIRCam imaging, we apply ellipse fitting along with 1D and 2D morphological modeling to directly measure bar properties. We find that five galaxies host flat surface brightness profiles (bar Sérsic index &lt;0.4), indicative of highly evolved, "mature" bars. By contrast, only two galaxies show exponential profiles, characteristic of young bars, and these are also shorter in absolute length than the flat bars. We therefore conclude that a large fraction of bars at this epoch have already matured, thereby indicating the presence of well-settled disks required to facilitate bar formation and sustained evolution well before z~1.5. To assess the gravitational impact of the bars, we calculate the maximum transverse-to-radial force ratio (Q_b). We find that Q_b values are comparable to, or weaker than, those of bars in the local Universe, Seven of the nine bars show only a marginal increase in strength with maturity (from exponential to flat bars). Contrarily however, the remaining two bars are flat, but have the lowest Q_b values in our sample. We hence propose that the mature bars at z~ 1.5 may experience phases of weakening due to rapid gas inflows and/or minor mergers. In conclusion, our work sheds light on the rapidly evolving nature of high-z bars and paves the way for larger statistical studies.

### 210) [2512.03331](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03331v2): Radio Detection of a Local Little Red Dot

Context. One of the most important discoveries by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the unexpected existence in the Early Universe (z &gt; 4) of very large quantities of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs), compact luminous red galaxies of intriguing physical properties. One of those intriguing properties is the absence of radio detections in high redshift LRDs. Aims. We wish to know if LRDs have radio emission that may be produced by accreting Intermediate/Supermassive Black Holes (IMBHs/SMBHs) or by frequent supernovae (SNe) from a cluster of massive stars. Methods. Assuming LRDs at high redshifts have not been detected at radio wavelengths due to their large distances and/or present limitations of observational capabilities, we analyse here archive Very Large Array radio observations of J1047+0739 and J1025+1402, two analog candidates of LRDs in the Local Universe (LLRDs) at redshifts z = 0.1 - 0.2. Results. The LLRD source J1047+0739 at z = 0.1682 is detected at 6.0 GHz in 2018 with the VLA-A (Very Large Array) as a compact source with radius less than 0.2 arcsec (&lt;700 pc at d = 750 Mpc). Its flux density was 117±8 μJy and its in-band spectral index was -0.85±0.24, which is typical of optically-thin synchrotron emission. It was also detected at 5.0 GHz in 2010 with the VLA-C, showing a flux density of 130±9 μJy. Conclusions. The observed flux densities can be provided by either a radio luminous supernova or an accreting IMBH/SMBH. However, the lack of important variation in flux density over eight years favors the IMBH/SMBH hypothesis. Radio time monitoring of this and other LLRDs could help clarify the mystery of the radio silence of its cosmological counterparts.

### 211) [2512.02106](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02106v2): JCMT Constraints on the Early-Time HCN and CO Emission and HCN Temporal Evolution of 3I/ATLAS

Interstellar objects (ISOs), particularly those with cometary activity, provide unique insight into the primordial physical and chemical conditions present during the formation of the planetary system in which they originated. Observations in the sub-mm regime allow for direct measurements of several parent molecules released from the comet nucleus into the coma. Here we present observations of the third ISO, 3I/ATLAS, with the `Ū`ū heterodyne receiver on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), which targeted emission from HCN(J = 3 - 2) and CO(J = 2 - 1). Our observations, taken between 16 July 2025 and 21 July 2025 (UT), when 3I/ATLAS was at a heliocentric distance between 4.01 and 3.84 au, provide the earliest sub-mm constraints on its activity. We do not detect HCN or CO in these epochs, with 3σ upper-limits on the production rates of Q(HCN) &lt; 1.7 × 10^24 s<sup>-1</sup> at r_h = 4.01 - 3.97 au and Q(CO) &lt; 1.1 × 10^27 s<sup>-1</sup> at r_h = 3.94 - 3.84 au, respectively. We combine this HCN limit with later JCMT observations of HCN to constrain its temporal evolution. Fitting the HCN detections with a Q(HCN) &prop; r_h^-n model and accounting for the upper-limits yields n = 12.7^+6.9_-2.5. This slope is steeper than those of typical Solar System comets, but consistent with the production rate slopes measured for other species in the coma of 3I/ATLAS.

### 212) [2511.19572](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19572v2): Constraining properties of dust formed in Wolf-Rayet binary WR 112 using mid-infrared and millimeter observations

Binaries that host a carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet (WC) star and an OB-type companion can be copious dust producers. Yet the properties of dust, particularly the grain size distribution, in these systems remain uncertain. We present Band 6 observations of WR 112 by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array telescope (ALMA), which are the first millimeter observations of a WC binary system capable of resolving its dust emission. By combining ALMA observations with James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) images, we were able to analyze the spatially resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) of WR 112. We found that the SEDs are consistent with emissions from hydrogen-poor amorphous carbon grains. Notably, our results also suggest that the majority of grains in the system have radii below one micrometer, and the extended dust structures are dominated by nanometer-sized grains. Among four parameterizations of the grain radius distribution that we tested, a bimodal distribution, with abundant nanometer-sized grains and a secondary population of 0.1-micron grains, best reproduces the observed SED. This bimodal distribution helps to reconcile the previously conflicting grain size estimates reported for WR 112 and for other WC systems. We hypothesize that dust destruction mechanisms such as radiative torque disruption and radiative-driven sublimation are responsible for driving the system to the bimodal grain size distribution.

Low surface brightness galaxies (LSBs) are an important class of galaxies that allow us to broaden our understanding of galaxy formation and test various cosmological models. We present a survey of low surface brightness galaxies at 0.4 &lt; z<sub>phot</sub> &lt; 0.8 in the GOODS-S field using JADES data. We model LSB surface brightness profiles, identifying those with \barμ_eff &gt; 24 mag arcsec^-2 in the F200W JWST/NIRCam filter. We study the spatial distribution, number density, Sérsic profile parameters, and rest-frame colours of these LSBs. We compare the photometrically-derived star formation histories, mass-weighted ages, and dust attenuations of these galaxies with a high surface brightness (HSB) sample at similar redshift and a lower redshift (z<sub>phot</sub> &lt; 0.4) LSB sample, all of which have stellar masses ≲ 10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. We find that all samples have low star formation (SFR_100 ≲ 0.01 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1). The higher redshift LSBs and HSBs have similar star formation histories which show that the LSBs and HSBs possibly come from the same progenitors at z ≳ 2, though the histories are not well constrained for the LSB samples. The LSBs appear to have minimal dust, with most of our LSB samples showing A_V &lt; 1 mag. JWST has pushed our understanding of LSBs beyond the local Universe.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission is widely used to trace the distribution of molecular gas in the interstellar medium, exhibiting a tight correlation with CO(2-1) emission across nearby galaxies. Using PHANGS-JWST and PHANGS-ALMA data, we identify localized regions where this correlation fails, with CO flux exceeding that predicted from 7.7μm PAH emission by more than an order of magnitude. These outlier regions are found in 20 out of 70 galaxies and are located in galaxy centers and bars, without signs of massive star formation. We explore two scenarios to explain the elevated CO-to-PAH ratios, which can either be due to suppressed PAH emission or enhanced CO emissivity. We examine PAH emission in other bands (3.3μm and 11.3μm) and the dust continuum dominated bands (10μm and 21μm), finding consistently high CO-to-PAH (or CO-to-dust continuum) emission ratios, suggesting that 7.7μm PAH emission is not particularly suppressed. In some outlier regions, PAH sizes and spectral energy distribution of the radiation differ slightly from nearby control regions with normal CO-to-PAH ratios, though without a consistent trend. We find that the outlier regions show higher CO velocity dispersions (Δv_CO). This increase in Δv_CO lowers CO optical depth and raises its emissivity for a given gas mass. Our results favor a scenario where shear along the bar lanes and shocks at the bar ends elevate CO emissivity, leading to the breakdown of the CO-PAH correlation. Future JWST spectroscopy and deep ALMA observations of CO isotopologues will provide critical tests of this scenario.

We present the discovery of a strongly lensed galaxy at z~11-12, dubbed the "Misty Moons'', identified in the JWST Treasury Survey, Vast Exploration for Nascent, Unexplored Sources (VENUS). The Misty Moons is gravitationally lensed by the galaxy cluster MACS J0257.1-2325 at z=0.505, and has five multiple images suggested by two independent lensing models. Two of the five images, ID1 and ID2 (μ~ 20-30), are very bright (F200W~26 AB mag) and exhibit blue SEDs with prominent Lyα breaks. In the source plane, the Misty Moons is a sub-L^* galaxy (M_UV~-18.0 mag) resolved into multiple stellar clumps, each of which has an effective radius of r_eff~ 10-70 pc and a stellar mass of ~10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. These clumps dominate the stellar mass budget of the Misty Moons (≳80&percnt;), similar to other high-z clumps, which suggests a highly clustered mode of star formation in the early Universe, unlike seen in local dwarf galaxies. We convolve the source-plane image with the JWST/NIRCam point-spread function to produce a mock NIRCam image of the Misty Moons without lensing magnification, and find that the intrinsic galaxy has a radial surface-brightness profile comparable to those of z≳10 faint galaxies, such as JADES-GS-z13-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1, indicating that the Misty Moons represents a typical z≳10 faint galaxy. The Misty Moons, a lensed galaxy with resolved internal structures, provides an ideal laboratory for exploring the early stages of galaxy formation at z≳10.

Measuring the ionizing photon production efficiency ξ<sub>ion</sub>,0 &ndash; the ratio of ionizing photon output rate Q_H^0 to UV continuum luminosity L_UV &ndash; in galaxies at z &gt; 6 is crucial for constraining their contribution to cosmic reionization. We present integrated and spatially resolved measurements of ξ<sub>ion</sub>,0 for 12 exceptionally bright (M_UV ~ -22 mag) star-forming galaxies at z ~ 7 from the REBELS survey. These measurements are based on JWST NIRSpec/IFU PRISM spectroscopy, probing the rest-frame UV and optical regime. Notably, in 8 of the 12 galaxies, the spectral coverage includes Hα, enabling self-consistent dust attenuation estimates in both the ionized gas and stellar continuum via the Balmer decrement and rest-UV slope, respectively. We find global logξ<sub>ion</sub>,0 values ranging from 25.19±0.11 to 25.61±0.11, with a weighted mean of 25.44±0.15, consistent with the canonical value of ~25.3. Using a sample of 25 star-forming clumps within these galaxies, we explore local variations in LyC production efficiency, finding a broader range, from 24.52±0.21 to 26.18±0.61. We identify strong correlations between ξ<sub>ion</sub>,0 and specific star formation rate, star formation surface density, Hβ equivalent width, and stellar mass. Clumps with the highest ξ<sub>ion</sub>,0 exhibit EW_0(Hβ) ≥ 150 Angstrom, consistent with young stellar ages. From previous Lyα measurements in three galaxies, we estimate a typical Lyα escape fraction of f<sub>esc</sub>, Lyα ~ 2&percnt;, suggesting similar or lower escape fractions for LyC photons. Combining this with our Hα measurements, we infer ionized bubble sizes ~ 1 pMpc, aligned with expectations from Lyα-detected systems and reionization models.

### 217) [2511.08477](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08477v2): Supermassive Dark Stars and their remnants as a possible solution to three recent cosmic dawn puzzles

<p> Cosmin Ilie, Jillian Paulin, Andreea Petric, Katherine Freese </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has begun to revolutionize our view of the Cosmos. The discovery of Blue Monsters (i.e., ultra-compact yet very bright high-z galaxies) and the Little Red Dots (i.e., very compact dustless strong Balmer break cosmic dawn sources) pose significant challenges to pre-JWST era models of the assembly of first stars and galaxies. In addition, JWST data further strengthen the problem posed by the origin of the supermassive black holes that power the most distant quasars observed. Stars powered by Dark Matter annihilation (i.e., Dark Stars) can form out of primordial gas clouds during the cosmic dawn era and subsequently might grow via accretion and become supermassive. In this paper we argue that Supermassive Dark Stars (SMDSs) offer natural solutions to the three puzzles mentioned above.

High-resolution JWST images of nearby spiral galaxies reveal polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission structures that trace molecular gas, including CO-dark regions. We identify ISM cloud structures in PHANGS-JWST 7.7 μm PAH maps for 66 galaxies, smoothed to 30 pc and at native resolution, extracting 108,466 and 146,040 clouds, respectively. Molecular properties were inferred using a linear conversion from PAH to CO. Given the tendency for clouds in galaxy centers to overlap in velocity space, we opted to flag these and omit them from the analysis in this work. The remaining clouds correspond to giant molecular clouds, such as those detected in CO(2-1) emission by ALMA, or lower surface density clouds that either fall below the ALMA detection limits of existing maps or genuinely have no molecular counterpart. Cross-matching with ALMA CO maps at 90 pc in 27 galaxies shows that 41 % of PAH clouds have CO associations. The converted molecular properties vary little across environments, but the most massive clouds are preferentially found in spiral arms. Fitting lognormal mass distributions down to 2×10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> shows that spiral arms host the highest-mass clouds, consistent with enhanced formation in arm gravitational potentials. Cloud molecular surface densities decline by a factor of ~ 1.5-2 toward 2 - 3 R_e. However, the trend largely varies in individual galaxies, with flat, decreasing, and even no trend as a function of galactocentric radius. Factors like large-scale processes and morphologies might influence the observed trends. We publish two catalogs online, one at the common resolution of 30 pc and another at the native resolution. We expect them to have broad utility for future PAH clouds, molecular clouds, and star formation studies.

Ram pressure stripping (RPS) plays a crucial role in shaping galaxy evolution in dense environments, yet its impact on the molecular and dusty phases of the interstellar medium remains poorly understood. We present JWST/NIRCam 3.3μm polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission maps for the nine most striking RPS galaxies in the Abell 2744 cluster at redshift z_cl=0.306, tracing the effects of environmental processes on small dust grains. Exploiting multi-band JWST/NIRCam and HST photometry, we performed a spatially resolved ultraviolet (UV) to mid-infrared (MIR) spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to characterise stellar populations in both galactic disks and clumps detected in the stripped tails. We detected PAH_3.3 emission in eight of the nine galaxies at 5σ, with morphologies revealing disk truncation and elongation along the RPS direction. In three galaxies, PAH_3.3 emission is also found in star-forming clumps embedded in the stripped tails up to a distance of 40kpc. Star formation rates inferred from PAH_3.3 emission are in agreement with those derived from SED fitting averaged over the past 100Myr within an intrinsic scatter of 0.4dex, but the relation appears to be age-dependent. The spatial correlation between the PAH strength, stellar age, and star formation rate (SFR) is consistent across disks and tails and demonstrates that PAH-carrying molecules can survive and become stripped by ram pressure. Finally, age gradients revealed by the SED fitting provide observational evidence of the fireball model in star-forming, stripped clumps of galaxies at z ~ 0.3. This work represents the first detailed study of PAH emission in cluster galaxies, offering new insights into the fate of dust and star formation in extreme environments.

The AXIS Community Science Book represents the collective effort of 592 scientists worldwide to define the transformative science enabled by the Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), a next-generation X-ray mission selected by NASA's Astrophysics Probe Program for Phase A study. AXIS will advance the legacy of high-angular-resolution X-ray astronomy with ~1.5'' imaging over a wide 24' field of view and an order of magnitude greater collecting area than Chandra in the 0.3-12 keV band. Combining sharp imaging, high throughput, and rapid response capabilities, AXIS will open new windows on virtually every aspect of modern astrophysics, exploring the birth and growth of supermassive black holes, the feedback processes that shape galaxies, the life cycles of stars and exoplanet environments, and the nature of compact stellar remnants, supernova remnants, and explosive transients. This book compiles 138 community-contributed science cases developed by five Science Working Groups focused on AGN and supermassive black holes, galaxy evolution and feedback, compact objects and supernova remnants, stellar physics and exoplanets, and time-domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. Together, these studies establish the scientific foundation for next-generation X-ray exploration in the 2030s and highlight strong synergies with facilities of the 2030s, such as JWST, Roman, Rubin/LSST, SKA, ALMA, ngVLA, and next-generation gravitational-wave and neutrino networks.

### 221) [2510.23549](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23549v2): Cosmic Vine: High abundance of massive galaxies and dark matter halos in a forming cluster at z=3.44

The Cosmic Vine is a massive protocluster at z=3.44 in the JWST CEERS field, offering an ideal laboratory for studying the early phases of cluster formation. Using the data from the DAWN JWST Archive, we conduct a comprehensive study on the large-scale structure, stellar mass function (SMF), quiescent members, and dark matter halos in the Cosmic Vine. First, we spectroscopically confirm 136 galaxies in the Vine at z=3.44, and an additional 47 galaxies belonging to a diffuse foreground structure at z=3.34 which we dub the Leaf. We identify four subgroups comprising the Cosmic Vine and two subgroups within the Leaf. Second, we identified 11 quiescent members with log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=9.5-11.0, the largest sample of quiescent galaxies in overdense environments at z&gt;3, which gives an enhanced quiescent galaxy number density 2x10^(-4)cMpc^(-3) that is three times above the field level at log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &gt; 10. Notably, these quiescent members form a tight red sequence on the color-magnitude diagram, making it one of the earliest red sequences known to date. Third, by constructing the SMFs for both star-forming and quiescent members, we find that both SMFs are top-heavy, with a significantly enhanced quiescent fraction at log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&gt;10.5 compared to field counterparts. The stellar mass-size analysis reveals that star-forming members are more compact at higher masses than their field counterparts. Finally, we estimate a halo mass of log(Mh/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=13.2+-0.3 for the protocluster core, and log(Mh/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=11.9-12.4 for satellite subgroups. The phase-space analysis indicates that three subgroups are likely infalling to the core. This work reveals a high abundance of massive galaxies and dark matter halos in a forming cluster, demonstrating the accelerated assembly of massive galaxies in massive halos when the Universe was less than 2 billion years old.

### 222) [2510.19863](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19863v2): Tracing Inflationary Imprints Through the Dark Ages: Implications for Early Stars and Galaxies Formation

<p> K. El Bourakadi, M. Yu. Khlopov, M. Krasnov, H. Chakir, M. Bennai </p>
<p>
We explore how inflationary features shape the early stages of cosmic structure formation. Using the transfer function formalism, we trace the evolution of primordial perturbations, showing how causal physics and oscillatory signatures from inflation influence the matter power spectrum. The variance of smoothed density fields is then applied to model the collapse of overdense regions and predict dark matter halo abundances through the Press-Schechter framework. Extending to the baryonic sector, we analyze primordial gas collapse in minihalos, emphasizing molecular hydrogen cooling and the thermochemical pathways leading to Population III star formation. Finally, we examine primordial black holes as potential seeds for early galaxies, connecting their accretion-driven growth to the stellar masses and disk properties of high-redshift systems. Our results indicate that oscillatory features from inflation can leave measurable imprints on halo abundances and early galaxy properties, providing a testable link between high-energy physics and astrophysical observations with JWST

### 223) [2510.19044](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19044v2): The slope and scatter of the star forming main sequence at z~5 : reconciling observations with simulations

Galaxies exhibit a tight correlation between their star-formation rate and stellar mass over a wide redshift range known as the star-forming main sequence (SFMS). With JWST, we can now investigate the SFMS at high redshifts down to masses of ~10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, using sensitive star-formation rate tracers such as Hα emission &ndash; which allow us to probe the variability in star formation histories. We present inferences of the SFMS based on 316 Hα-selected galaxies at z~4-5 with log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 6.4 -10.6. These galaxies were identified behind the Abell 2744 lensing cluster with NIRCam grism spectroscopy from the "All the Little Things'' (ALT) survey. At face value, our data suggest a shallow slope of the SFMS (SFR &prop; M<sub>&sext;</sub>^α, with α=0.45). After correcting for the Hα-flux limited nature of our survey using a Bayesian framework, the slope steepens to α= 0.59^+0.10_-0.09, whereas current data on their own are inconclusive on the mass dependence of the scatter. These slopes differ significantly from the slope of ≈1 expected from the observed evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function and from simulations. When fixing the slope to α=1, we find evidence for a decreasing intrinsic scatter with stellar mass (from ≈ 0.5 dex at M<sub>&sext;</sub>=10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> to 0.4 dex at M<sub>&sext;</sub>=10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>). This tension might be explained by a (combination of) luminosity-dependent SFR(Hα) calibration, a population of (mini)-quenched low-mass galaxies, or underestimated dust attenuation in high-mass galaxies. Future deep observations across facilities can quantify these processes, enabling better insights into the variability of star formation histories.

### 224) [2510.17968](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17968v2): Rise of the forsaken relics: connecting present-day stellar streams and phase-mixed galaxies to the Epoch of Reionization

<p> Aritra Kundu, Robyn Sanderson, Adam Lidz, Pratik J. Gandhi, Andrew Wetzel, Robert Feldmann, Nondh Panithanpaisal, Jasjeev Singh, Michael Boylan-Kolchin </p>
<p>
The `near-far' approach to studying reionization leverages the star formation histories of the Milky Way (MW) or Local Group (LG) galaxies, derived from resolved photometry, to infer the low-mass/faint-end of the stellar mass functions (SMFs) or the ultraviolet luminosity functions (UVLFs) of high-redshift galaxies (z ≳ 6), beyond the current JWST detection limits (M_UV ≳ -15). Previous works considered only intact low-mass galaxies in the MW and LG, neglecting disrupted galaxies such as stellar streams and phase-mixed objects. Using the FIRE-2 simulations, we show that these disrupted galaxies contribute up to ~50&percnt; of the total stellar mass budget of the proto-MW/LG at z =6-9. Including all the progenitors of these disrupted galaxies improves the normalization of the recovered SMFs/UVLFs by factors of ~2-3 and reduces the halo-to-halo variation in the slope by ~20-40&percnt;. This enables robust constraints down to at least the resolution limit of the simulations, near M<sub>&sext;</sub> ~ 10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> or M_UV ~ -10 at z ≳ 6. We also show that `fossil record' reconstructions - which assume each present-day system descends from a single reionization-era progenitor - are sensitive to the stellar mass/UV magnitude thresholds, which introduces bias in the inferred low-mass/faint-end slopes. Additionally, we demonstrate that neglecting disrupted systems underestimates the contribution of galaxies with M_UV ≲ -15 to the reionization-era UV luminosity density. Finally, we estimate that a significant fraction (~50&percnt;) of streams with M<sub>&sext;</sub> ≳ 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z=0 should be detectable from upcoming Rubin Observatory and Roman Space Telescope observations.

### 225) [2510.17952](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17952v2): Evolutionary Tracks and Spectral Properties of Quasi-stars and Their Correlation with Little Red Dots

<p> Andrew D. Santarelli, Ebraheem Farag, Earl P. Bellinger, Priyamvada Natarajan, Rohan P. Naidu, Claire B. Campbell, Matthew E. Caplan </p>
<p>
JWST has revealed a population of red, compact, high-redshift (z~3-10) objects referred to as "Little Red Dots'' (LRDs). These objects exhibit unusual spectral features reminiscent of stellar spectra with blackbody-like SEDs, large hydrogen Balmer breaks, Balmer line absorption, and classical stellar absorption features such as calcium H&K and the calcium triplet. Following the recent suggestion that these may be actively accreting direct-collapse black holes in the process of assembly, i.e. quasi-stars, we present evolutionary models of quasi-stars using our recently released, publicly available MESA-QUEST modeling framework. We compute a grid of models spanning a range of black hole masses and predict the luminosities, temperatures, surface gravities, and lifetimes of these objects. We find that these models lie along a Hayashi track once they hit their "late-stage'' which constitutes the majority of their lives (~ 20~Myr). We present scaling relations for estimating the mass of a quasi-star as a function of the bolometric luminosity, as well as the bolometric luminosity as a function of the effective temperature for the Hayashi track. The short lifetimes in tandem with the observed number density of LRDs imply the possibility that every supermassive black hole was once a quasi-star. We compare synthetic spectra of our quasi-star models to observations of LRDs, and show that these models are broadly capable of reproducing the continuum spectra of observed LRDs. These results indicate that quasi-stars are promising candidates for the origin of supermassive black holes via direct collapse in the early universe.

To fully characterize the formation and evolution of galaxies, we need to observe their stars, gas, and dust on resolved spatial scales. We present the ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST survey, which combines kpc-resolved imaging and spectroscopy from HST, JWST, and ALMA for 18 representative main-sequence galaxies at z=4-6 and log(M/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &gt; 9.5 to study their star formation, chemical properties, and extended gas reservoirs. The co-spatial measurements resolving the ionized gas, molecular gas, stars, and dust on 1-2 kpc scales make this a unique benchmark sample for the study of galaxy formation and evolution at z~5, connecting the Epoch of Reionization with the cosmic noon. In this paper, we outline the survey goals and sample selection, and present a summary of the available data for the 18 galaxies. In addition, we measure spatially integrated quantities (such as global gas metallicity), test different star formation rate indicators, and quantify the presence of Hα halos. Our targeted galaxies are relatively metal rich (10-70% solar), complementary to JWST samples at lower stellar mass, and there is broad agreement between different star formation indicators. One galaxy has the signature of an active galactic nuclei (AGN) based on its emission line ratios. Six show broad Hα~emission suggesting type 1 AGN candidates. We conclude with an outlook on the exciting science that will be pursued with this unique sample in forthcoming papers.

### 227) [2510.14613](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14613v2): The multimessenger view of Pulsar Timing Array black holes with the Horizon-AGN simulation

<p> Hippolyte Quelquejay Leclere, Kunyang Li, Marta Volonteri, Stanislav Babak, Ricarda S. Beckmann, Yohan Dubois, Clotilde Laigle, Natalie A. Webb </p>
<p>
We use the Horizon-AGN cosmological simulation to study the properties of supermassive black hole binaries (MBHBs) contributing most to the gravitational wave background (GWB) signal expected in the pulsar timing array (PTA) band. We develop a pipeline to generate realistic populations of MBHBs, allowing us to estimate both the characteristic strain and GWB time series observable by PTA experiments. We identify potential continuous wave (CW) candidates standing above the background noise, using toy PTA sensitivities representing the current EPTA and future SKA. We estimate the probability of detecting at least one CW with signal-to-noise ratio &gt;3 to be 4&percnt; (20&percnt;) for EPTA (SKA)-like sensitivities, assuming a 10-year baseline. We find the GWB to be dominated by hundreds to thousands of binaries at redshifts in the range 0.05-1, with chirp masses of 10^8.5-10^9.5  M<sub>&odot;</sub>, hosted mainly in quiescent massive galaxies residing in halos of mass ~ 10^13  M<sub>&odot;</sub>. CW candidates have larger masses, lower redshifts and are found in even more massive halos, typical of galaxy groups and clusters. The majority of these systems would appear as AGN rather than quasars, because of their low Eddington ratios. Nevertheless, CW candidates with f_Edd&gt;10^-3 can still outshine their hosts, particularly in radio and X-ray bands, suggesting them as the most promising route for identification. Our findings imply that optical and near-infrared searches based on light curve variability are challenging and biased toward more luminous systems. Finally, we highlight important caveats in the common method used to compare PTA observations with theoretical models. We find that GWB spectral inferences used by PTAs could be biased toward shallower slopes and higher amplitudes at f=1/yr, thereby reducing the apparent tension between astrophysical expectations and PTA observations.

### 228) [2510.13977](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13977v2): The THESAN-ZOOM project: The Hidden Neighbours of OI Absorbers during Reionization

<p> Giulia Pruto, Laura Keating, Rahul Kannan, Ewald Puchwein, Aaron Smith, Josh Borrow, Enrico Garaldi, Mark Vogelsberger, Oliver Zier, William McClymont, Xuejian Shen, Sandro Tacchella </p>
<p>
Metal absorbers represent a powerful probe of galaxy feedback and reionization, as highlighted by both observational and theoretical results showing an increased abundance of low-ionised metal species at higher redshifts. The origin of such absorbers is currently largely unknown because of the low number of galaxy counterparts detected, suggesting that they might be surrounded by low-mass faint sources below the current detection threshold. We use the THESAN-ZOOM radiation hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the connection between properties of neutral oxygen (OI) absorbers and galaxies across redshift z = 5 - 8. We find that the virialised gas in haloes becomes progressively ionised with cosmic time, leading to a decrease of ≈ 0.2 in the covering fraction of neutral oxygen, while the total oxygen covering fraction remains constant. Comparing the OI line density obtained from our covering fractions with the trend suggested by blind quasar observations, we determine that the observable absorbers (N_OI ≳ 10^13 cm<sup>2</sup>) are not confined to haloes: at z ≥ 5 the majority (≳ 60&percnt;) arise beyond R_vir, consistent with recent JWST results. Close to OI absorbers, low-mass galaxies (M<sub>&sext;</sub> ≤ 10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) are more commonly found, while, depending on the simulated environment, we do not exclude the possibility of nearby more massive star-forming sources (≥ 5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1) similar to those suggested by the latest ALMA observations. These results establish OI absorbers as sensitive tracers of the evolving ionisation structure around faint galaxies to be probed by forthcoming deep spectroscopic surveys.

### 229) [2510.12235](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12235v2): A census of quiescent galaxies across 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 8 with JWST/MIRI: Mass-dependent number density evolution of quiescent galaxies in the early Universe

<p>
Recent JWST observations have revealed a large population of quiescent galaxies (QGs) at high redshift (z ~ 4-8), challenging current models of early galaxy formation and quenching. Accurate number density estimates are crucial but remain uncertain. We present a systematic study of QGs at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 8 using a mass-complete sample from the JWST/PRIMER survey with deep NIRCam and MIRI imaging. We demonstrate that MIRI photometry is essential for refining the QG sample: it helps to mitigate contamination from dusty star-forming galaxies in the high-mass regime at z ~ 3-5 and aids in recovering lower-mass QG candidates at z &gt; 5 that are often missed without including MIRI data. We find that the evolution of the QG number density is strongly mass-dependent. The density of massive QGs (log (M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &gt; 10.6) declines rapidly, falling from n ≈ 1.32×10^-5~~Mpc^-3 at z ~ 3-4 to n &lt; 1 ×10^-6~~Mpc^-3 at z ~ 6, and becomes negligible at z &gt; 6. In contrast, low-mass QGs (9.5 &lt; log (M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &lt; 10.6) exhibit a remarkably constant number density of n ~ 3×10^-6~Mpc^-3 across the redshift range z = 4-8. This plateau suggests that these high-redshift, low-mass QGs may be galaxies undergoing temporary quenching episodes, likely subject to rejuvenation upon future gas accretion. Comparisons with leading galaxy formation models reveal significant tensions: most models underestimate the abundance of massive QGs at z &gt; 4 and fail to reproduce the flat density evolution observed for the low-mass population.

### 230) [2510.11772](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11772v3): MESA-QUEST: Tracing the formation of direct collapse black hole seeds via quasi-stars

<p>
The origin of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed at redshifts z≥ 9 remains one of the most challenging open questions in astrophysics. Their rapid emergence suggests that massive "heavy seeds'' must have formed early, possibly through the direct collapse of pristine gas clouds in the first galaxies. We present MESA-QUEST, a new framework built upon the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code, designed to model the structure and evolution of quasi-stars &ndash; massive, radiation-supported envelopes hosting accreting black holes at their cores &ndash; believed to be the progenitors of direct-collapse black hole (DCBH) seeds. Our implementation introduces flexible boundary conditions representing both Bondi accretion and saturated-convection regimes, and explores the impact of several stellar wind and mass-loss prescriptions, including Reimers, Dutch, and super-Eddington radiation-driven winds. We find that quasi-stars can grow central black holes to ≥ 10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> under favorable conditions, with saturated-convection models yielding BH-to-total mass ratios up to 0.55M_* &ndash; five times higher than Bondi-limited cases. However, strong radiation-driven winds can dramatically curtail growth, potentially quenching heavy-seed formation unless balanced by sustained envelope accretion. Our results delineate the physical limits under which quasi-stars can remain stable and produce heavy seeds capable of evolving into the earliest SMBHs detected by JWST and Chandra. Future extensions will incorporate rotation, magnetic fields, and GR-radiation hydrodynamics to refine accretion physics and constrain the viability of the quasi-star pathway for early SMBH formation.

### 231) [2510.11702](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11702v4): The Sunburst Arc with JWST. IV. The importance of interaction, turbulence, and feedback for Lyman-continuum escape

<p>
At present, the best opportunity for detailed Lyman Continuum escape studies is in gravitationally lensed galaxies at z &gt;~ 2. Only one such galaxy currently exists in the literature with sufficient spatial magnification: The Sunburst Arc at redshift z = 2.37. Here, we present rest-frame optical JWST NIRSpec integral field observations of the Sunburst Arc that cover a large fraction of the source plane. From this dataset, we generate precise maps of ISM kinematics, dust geometry, ionization, and chemical enrichment. We extract a stacked spectrum of five gravitationally lensed images of the Lyman-Continuum leaking cluster, as well as an magnification-corrected, integrated spectrum of most of the galaxy, enabling a direct comparison to other LyC leakers in the literature. We find that the galaxy rotates but also shows strong, possibly dominant, signatures of turbulence, which are indicative of recent or ongoing major interaction. The cluster that leaks ionizing photons shows little variation in kinematics or dust coverage, but dramatically elevated ionization, indicating that photoionization is the predominant mechanism that creates paths for LyC escape. We conjecture that tidal stripping of H I gas due to an interaction could have removed a large portion of the neutral ISM around the LyC emitting cluster, making it easier for the cluster to completely ionize the rest.

<p>
Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are key diagnostics of the physical conditions in the interstellar medium and are widely used to trace star formation in the mid-infrared (mid-IR). The relative strengths of mid-IR PAH emission features (e.g., 6.2, 7.7, 11.3 um) are sensitive to both the size and ionization state of the molecules and can be strongly influenced by the local radiation field. However, at low metallicities ( Z &lt; 0.2 Zsun), detecting PAHs remains notoriously difficult, likely reflecting a combination of suppressed formation and enhanced destruction mechanisms. We present new JWST/MIRI MRS observations of the metal-poor (Z = 0.1 Zsun) dwarf galaxy CGCG 007-025. We confirm the tentative PAH detection previously reported from Spitzer data and, for the first time, identify a compact (approx. 50 pc) PAH-emitting region nearly co-spatial with the newly detected [NeV](I.P. = 97 eV) emission and the galaxy's most metal-poor, strongly star-forming region. The 11.3 and 12.7 um PAH features are detected, while no emission is found from the other typically brighter features, suggesting a PAH population dominated by large, neutral molecules resilient to hard ionizing fields. When compared with models, mid-IR line ratios involving [NeIII], [OIV], and [NeV] can only be reproduced by a combination of star formation and AGN ionization, with the latter contributing 4&ndash;8%. The [OIV] and [NeV] luminosities exceed what massive stars or shocks can produce, highlighting a puzzling scenario in line with recent JWST observations of similar galaxies. This work provides a crucial reference for studying the physical conditions of the dust and star formation in low-metallicity starburst regions, environments typical of the early universe.

### 233) [2510.11455](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11455v2): Feeding the Dead: Neutral Gas Inflow in a Long-Quenched Ancient Massive Galaxy at z~ 2.7 Observed with JWST/NIRSpec

<p>
We report the spectroscopic detection of neutral gas inflow into a massive (M_* ≃ 4× 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) quiescent galaxy observed at z<sub>spec</sub> = 2.6576 with JWST. From the redshifted absorption of the NaI doublet at λλ5890, 5896 Ang, we estimate an inflow velocity v=278^+79_-79 km s<sup>-1</sup> and a column density log(N_NaI/cm<sup>2</sup>) = 13.02^+0.03_-0.03. We derive the inflowing mass of the gas M_in = 1.6^+0.1_-0.1 × 10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and rate M&#775;_in = 19^+6_-7   M<sub>&odot;</sub>   yr^-1. The presence of several surrounding galaxies suggests that the galaxy may be accreting gas from nearby companions. However, we cannot confirm it with current data and the intergalactic medium or cosmic filaments are also viable sources of the inflowing gas. Despite the ongoing inflow, the galaxy remains quiescent, with an upper limit to the star formation rate of 0.2   M<sub>&odot;</sub>   yr^-1. Moreover, its star formation history suggests that the galaxy has remained quiescent during the past ~1 Gyr, with half of its stars formed by redshift z_50=11^+18_-3. We discuss that the inflow is not massive, dense, or long-lived enough to ignite significant star formation, or it is fueling low-level AGN activity instead. This is direct evidence that quiescent galaxies can accrete cold gas after their quenching while keeping their star formation subdued. Follow-up observations with JWST and ALMA will be needed to constraint the nature of the inflowing gas.

### 234) [2510.06771](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06771v2): Low-noise Fourier Transform Spectroscopy Enabled by Superconducting On-Chip Filterbank Spectrometers

<p> Chris S. Benson, Peter S. Barry, Patrick Ashworth, Harry Gordon-Moys, Kirit S. Karkare, Izaak Morris, Gethin Robson </p>
<p>
Historically employed spectroscopic architectures used for large field of view mapping spectroscopy in millimetere and sub-millimetre astronomy suffer from significant drawbacks. On-chip filterbank spectrometers are a promising technology in this respect; however, they must overcome an orders-of-magnitude increase in detector counts, efficiency loss due to dielectric properties, and stringent fabrication tolerances that currently limit scaling to resolutions of order 1000 over a large array. We propose coupling a medium-resolution Fourier transform spectrometer to a low-resolution filterbank spectrometer focal plane, which serves as a post-dispersion element. In this arrangement, medium resolution imaging spectroscopy is provided by the Fourier transform spectrometer, while the low resolution filterbank spectrometer serves to decrease the photon noise inherent in typical broadband Fourier transform spectrometer measurements by over an order of magnitude. This is achieved while maintaining the excellent imaging advantages of both architectures. We present predicted mapping speeds for a filterbank-dispersed Fourier transform spectrometer from a ground-based site and a balloon-borne platform. We also demonstrate the potential that an instrument of this type has for an R~1000 line intensity mapping experiment using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as an example platform. We demonstrate that a filterbank-dispersed Fourier transform spectrometer would be capable of R~1000 measurements of CO power spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10&ndash;100 with surveys of 10^5&ndash;10^6 spectrometer hours.

<p>
Now detected out to redshifts of z~ 14.5, the rest-frame ultraviolet and optical spectra of galaxies encode numerous physical properties of the interstellar medium (ISM). Accurately extracting these properties from spectra remains a key challenge that numerical simulations are uniquely suited to address. We present a study of the observed ISM of galaxies in MEGATRON: a suite of cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations coupled to on-the-fly non-equilibrium thermochemistry, with multiple prescriptions for star formation/feedback and parsec-scale resolution; capable of directly predicting spectroscopic properties of early galaxies. We find that irrespective of feedback physics used, the ISM of high-redshift galaxies is denser, less metal enriched, and subject to higher ionization parameters and radiation fields compared to similar mass galaxies in the local Universe &ndash; in agreement with interpretations of JWST observations. Using common observational techniques to infer bulk galaxy properties, we find that ISM gas density controls the slope of the mass-metallicity relation. Similarly, at the densities reached in some high-redshift galaxies, O32 becomes a density tracer rather than one of ionization parameter. This motivates the use of other line ratios like C43 and N43 to infer the ionization state of the gas. Finally, various feedback models populate different regions of strong-line diagnostic diagrams as the line ratios are sensitive to the feedback-modulated density-temperature structure of the ISM. Therefore, observed strong-line diagnostics can provide a strong constraint on the underlying physics of star formation and feedback in the high-redshift Universe.

<p>
One of the most remarkable discoveries of JWST is a population of compact, red sources at z &gt; 4, commonly referred to as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Spectroscopic identifications reported that most LRDs are active galactic nuclei (AGNs), which are preferentially found around z ~ 6 and could imply a key phase in the formation and growth of black holes (BHs) in the early universe. Photometric surveys at lower redshift have recently been carried out to trace their evolution across cosmic time, and a small number of LRD-like galaxies have been spectroscopically identified at both Cosmic Noon and in the local universe. Here we report the discovery of one of the lowest-z LRD-like galaxies, J204837.26-002437.2 (hereafter J2048) at z = 0.4330, using new Gemini-N/GMOS IFU observations combined with archival multi-band photometric SED data. The GMOS data reveal extended blue emission from starburst with a star formation rate of 400 solar mass per year, together with an extended, highly fast ionized outflow. This is the first spectroscopic confirmation of extended host emission and outflow in an LRD-like galaxy, providing a unique laboratory for understanding the nature of their high-redshift counterparts. Moreover, J2048 would host an extremely overmassive BH with a BH-to-stellar mass ratio of ~ 60%, with the BH mass and host stellar mass estimated to be 10^10.2 and 10^10.4 solar masses, respectively. We discuss the origin and evolutionary fate of J2048, and the implications that such low-z analogs have for interpreting the properties of high-z LRDs.

### 238) [2510.01314](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01314v2): JWST Observations of Starbursts: PAHs Closely Trace the Cool Phase of M82's Galactic Wind

<p>
Stellar feedback drives multiphase gas outflows from starburst galaxies, but the interpretation of dust emission in these winds remains uncertain. To investigate this, we analyze new JWST mid-infrared images tracing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission at 7.7 and 11.3~μm from the outflow of the prototypical starburst M82 out to 3.2 kpc. We find that PAH emission shows significant correlations with CO, Hα, and X-ray emission within the outflow, though the strengths and behaviors of these correlations vary with gas phase and distance from the starburst. PAH emission correlates strongly with cold molecular gas, with PAH&ndash;CO scaling relations in the wind nearly identical to those in galaxy disks despite the very different conditions. The Hα&ndash;PAH correlation indicates that Hα traces the surfaces of PAH-bearing clouds, consistent with arising from ionized layers produced by shocks. Meanwhile the PAH&ndash;X-ray correlation disappears once distance effects are controlled for past 2~kpc, suggesting that PAHs are decoupled from the hot gas and the global correlation merely reflects the large-scale structure of the outflow. The PAH-to-neutral gas ratio remains nearly flat to 2~kpc, with variations following changes in the radiation field. This implies that the product of PAH abundance and dust-to-gas ratio does not change significantly over the inner portion of the outflow. Together, these results demonstrate that PAHs robustly trace the cold phase of M82's wind, surviving well beyond the starburst and providing a powerful, high-resolution proxy for mapping the life cycle of entrained cold material in galactic outflows.

### 239) [2510.00400](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00400v2): Uncertainties in high-z galaxy properties inferred from SED fitting using JWST NIRCam photometry

<p> Jiyoung Choe, Taysun Kimm, Harley Katz, Maxime Rey, Daniel Han, J. K. Jang, Joki Rosdahl </p>
<p>
Numerous high-z galaxies have recently been observed with JWST, providing new insights into early galaxy evolution. Their physical properties are typically derived through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, but the reliability of this approach remains uncertain owing to limited constraints on star formation histories (SFHs) and on the contribution from emission for such early systems. Applying \bagpipes on simulated SEDs with SFR_10&gt;0.3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr at z=6 from the SPHINX cosmological simulation, we examine the uncertainties related to the recovery of stellar masses, star formation rates (SFR_10), and stellar metallicities from mock JWST/Near-Infrared Camera photometry, spanning F115W&ndash;F444W. Even without dust or emission lines, fitting the intrinsic stellar continuum overestimates the stellar mass by about 60&percnt;, on average (and by up to a factor of five for low-mass galaxies with recent starbursts). It also underestimates the SFR_10 by a factor of 2, due to inaccurate SFHs and age-metallicity degeneracies. In full SED-fitting models that include dust attenuation and nebular emission, stellar mass estimates are primarily affected by age-metallicity degeneracy and emission lines. Short-term SFRs are most sensitive to dust attenuation and nebular emission, while long-term SFRs additionally depend on the assumed SFHs. Incorporating bands that are free of strong emission lines, such as F410M, helps mitigate stellar mass overestimation by disentangling line emission from older stellar populations. We also find that best fit or likelihood-weighted estimates are generally more accurate than median posterior values. Although stellar mass functions are reproduced reasonably well (particularly when the minimum-χ^2 estimates are used), the slope of the main sequence of star formation acutely depends on the adopted fitting model.

The population of the Little Red Dots (LRDs) may represent a key phase of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. A cocoon of dense excited gas is emerging as key component to explain the most striking properties of LRDs, such as strong Balmer breaks and Balmer absorption, as well as the weak IR emission. To dissect the structure of LRDs, we analyze new deep JWST/NIRSpec PRISM and G395H spectra of FRESCO-GN-9771, one of the most luminous known LRDs at z=5.5. These reveal a strong Balmer break, broad Balmer lines and very narrow [O III] emission. We unveil a forest of optical [Fe II] lines, which we argue is emerging from a dense (n_H=10^9-10 cm^-3) warm layer with electron temperature T_e≈7000 K. The broad wings of Hα and Hβ have an exponential profile due to electron scattering in this same layer. The high Hα:Hβ:Hγ flux ratio of ≈10.4:1:0.14 is an indicator of collisional excitation and resonant scattering dominating the Balmer line emission. A narrow Hγ component, unseen in the other two Balmer lines due to outshining by the broad components, could trace the ISM of a normal host galaxy with a star formation rate ~5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1. The warm layer is mostly opaque to Balmer transitions, producing a characteristic P-Cygni profile in the line centers suggesting outflowing motions. This same layer is responsible for shaping the Balmer break. The broad-band spectrum can be reasonably matched by a simple photoionized slab model that dominates the λ&gt;1500 Å continuum and a low mass (~10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) galaxy that could explain the narrow [O III], with only subdominant contribution to the UV continuum. Our findings indicate that Balmer lines are not directly tracing gas kinematics near the SMBH and that the BH mass scale is likely much lower than virial indicators suggest.

High-redshift (z &gt; 2) massive quiescent (MQ) galaxies provide an opportunity to probe the key physical processes driving the fuelling and quenching of star formation in the early Universe. Observational evidence suggests a possible evolutionary link between MQs and dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs; or submillimetre galaxies), another extreme high-redshift population. However, galaxy formation models have historically struggled to reproduce these populations - especially simultaneously - limiting our understanding of their formation and connection, particularly in light of recent JWST findings. In previous work, we presented a re-calibrated version of the L-Galaxies semi-analytic model that provides an improved match to observationally-inferred number densities of both DSFG and MQ populations. In this work, we use this new model to investigate the progenitors of MQs at z &gt; 2 and the physical mechanisms that lead to their quenching. We find that most MQs at z &gt; 2 were sub-millimetre-bright (S_870 &gt; 1 mJy) at some point in their cosmic past. The stellar mass of MQs is strongly correlated with the maximum submillimetre flux density attained over their history, and this relation appears to be independent of redshift. However, only a minority of high-redshift DSFGs evolve into MQs by z = 2. The key distinction between typical DSFGs and MQ progenitors lies in their merger histories: MQ progenitors experience an early major merger that triggers a brief, intense starburst and rapid black hole growth, depleting their cold gas reservoirs. In our model, AGN feedback subsequently prevents further gas cooling, resulting in quenching. In contrast, the broader DSFG population remains sub-millimetre-bright, with star formation proceeding primarily via secular processes, becoming quenched later.

The Main Sequence of Star-Forming Galaxies (SFGMS or MS) is a fundamental scaling relation that provides a global framework for studying galaxy formation and evolution, as well as insight into the complex star formation histories (SFHs) of individual galaxies. In this work, we combine large-area pre-JWST surveys (COSMOS2020, CANDELS), which probe high-M<sub>&sext;</sub> sources (&gt;10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), with SHARDS/CANDELS FAINT and JWST data from CANUCS, CEERS, JADES, and UNCOVER, to obtain a high-z, star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass (M<sub>&sext;</sub>) complete sample spanning both high- and low-M<sub>&sext;</sub> regimes. Completeness in both M<sub>&sext;</sub> and SFR is key to avoiding biases introduced by low-mass, highly star-forming objects. Our combined data set is 80% complete down to 10^7.6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z~1 (10^8.8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z~9). The overall intrinsic MS slope (based on the SFR_100 and M<sub>&sext;</sub> derived with Dense Basis and nonparametric SFHs) shows little evolution up to z~5, with values ~0.7 - 0.8. The slope in the low-M<sub>&sext;</sub> regime becomes steeper than that in the high-M<sub>&sext;</sub> end at least up to z~5, but the strength of this change is highly dependent on the assumptions made on the symmetry of the uncertainties in M<sub>&sext;</sub> and SFR. If real, the steepening suggests reduced star formation efficiency or declining gas content with decreasing M<sub>&sext;</sub>. The transition between the low-M<sub>&sext;</sub> regime and the canonical MS occurs around 10^9.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, independent of z. This critical value may coincide with the assembly of galaxies' disks, which can provide a mechanism for self-regulation that stabilizes them against feedback. The intrinsic scatter is compatible with canonical estimates, also at low-M<sub>&sext;</sub>, ranging from 0.2-0.3 dex. This is indicative of rapid variations in star formation being averaged out over ≲100 Myr.

### 243) [2509.21952](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21952v3): Modified Cosmology or Modified Galaxy Astrophysics is Driving the z&gt;6 JWST Results? CMB Experiments can discover the Origin in the Near Future

<p> Harsh Mehta, Suvodip Mukherjee </p>
<p>
The massive and bright galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at high redshifts (z &gt; 6) have challenged our understanding of the Universe. This may require revisiting the physics of galaxy formation and evolution, or modifying the ΛCDM cosmological model to explain these observations, or both. We show that high-resolution CMB experiments such as the Simons Observatory (or CMB-S4) can measure smoking-gun signatures jointly in weak lensing and kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) power spectra, which can shed light on both these scenarios. An increase in the matter power spectrum at small scales will enhance the number density of dark matter halos at high redshifts, thereby increasing the galaxy formation rate. This will cause enhanced weak lensing signal from these redshifts and also lead to enhanced patchy-kSZ signal from the epoch of reionization. However, if only galaxy astrophysics is modified, without any modification in the matter power spectrum, then the patchy-kSZ signal gets altered, while the weak lensing signal remains nearly unaltered. We show that we can measure the modified astrophysical and cosmological scenarios at a statistical significance of 10.4σ (and 29.8σ) from Simons Observatory (and CMB-S4), which will enable a conclusive understanding on what physical process is driving the high-redshift observations of JWST.

### 244) [2509.20519](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20519v2): Measuring the Central Dark Mass in NGC 4258 with JWST/NIRSpec Stellar Kinematics

<p>
We present a new stellar dynamical measurement of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 4258, a critical benchmark for extragalactic mass measurements. We use archival JWST/NIRSpec IFU data (G235H/F170LP grating) to extract high-resolution two-dimensional stellar kinematics from the CO bandhead absorption features within the central 3'' × 3''. We extract the stellar kinematics after correcting for instrumental artifacts and separating the stellar light from the non-thermal AGN continuum. We employ Jeans Anisotropic Models (JAM) to fit the observed kinematics, exploring a grid of 12 models to systematically test the impact of different assumptions for the point-spread function, stellar mass-to-light ratio (M/L) profile, and orbital anisotropy. All 12 models provide broadly acceptable fits, albeit with minor differences. The ensemble median and 68% (1σ) bootstrap confidence intervals of our 12 models yield a black hole mass of M_BH = (4.08^+0.19_-0.33) × 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. This paper showcases the utility of using the full model ensemble to robustly account for systematic uncertainties, rather than relying on formal errors from a single preferred model, as has been common practice. Our result is just 5% larger than, and consistent with, the benchmark SMBH mass derived from water maser dynamics, validating the use of NIRSpec stellar kinematics for robust SMBH mass determination. Our analysis demonstrates JWST's capability to resolve the SMBH's sphere of influence and deliver precise dynamical masses, even in the presence of significant AGN continuum emission.

Recent photometric surveys with JWST have revealed a significant population of mysterious objects with red colours, compact morphologies, frequent signs of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, and negligible X-ray emission. These 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs) have been explored through spectral and photometric studies, but their nature is still under debate. As part of the BlackTHUNDER survey, we have observed UNCOVER_20466, one of the most distant LRDs known (z=8.5), with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU. Previous JWST/NIRCam and JWST/NIRSpec MSA observations of this source revealed its LRD nature, as well as the presence of an AGN. Using our NIRSpec IFU data, we confirm that UNCOVER_20466 is an LRD (based on spectral slopes and compactness) that contains an overmassive black hole. However, our observed Balmer decrements do not suggest strong dust attenuation, resulting in a lower Hbeta-based bolometric luminosity and Eddington luminosity (~10%) than previously found. This source lies on local relations between M_BH-sigma_* and M_BH-M_Dyn, suggesting that this could be a progenitor of the core of a lower-redshift galaxy. We explore the possible evolution of this source, finding evidence for substantial black hole accretion in the past and a likely origin as a heavy seed at high redshift (~10^3Msol). Lyman-alpha emission is strongly detected, implying f<sub>esc</sub>,Lya~30%. The extremely high [OIII]4363/Hgamma ratio is indicative of not only AGN photoionization and heating, but also extremely high densities (ne~10^7cm-3), suggesting that this black hole at such high redshift may be forming in an ultra-dense protogalaxy.

### 246) [2509.18347](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18347v2): The Metallicity Dependence of PAH Emission in Galaxies II: Insights from JWST/NIRCam Imaging of the Smallest Dust Grains in M101

We explore the physical origins of the observed deficit of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at sub-solar metallicity using JWST/NIRCam imaging of the nearby galaxy M101, covering regions from solar metallicity (Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) down to 0.4 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>. These maps are used to trace the radial evolution of the shortest-wavelength PAH feature at 3.3 μm, which is emitted preferentially by the smallest PAHs (&lt;100 carbon atoms). The fractional contribution of PAH 3.3 μm to the total PAH luminosity (ΣPAH) increases by 3x as metallicity declines, rising from ~1&percnt; to ~3&percnt; over the observed range, consistent with prior predictions from the inhibited grain growth model based on Spitzer spectroscopy. We explore model refinements including photon effects and alternative size evolution prescriptions, and find that a modest amount of small grain photo-destruction remains possible, provided the grain size cutoff does not exceed ~55 carbon atoms. The best-fit models predict 3.3 μm/ΣPAH will rise to ~5.6-7.7&percnt; at 10&percnt; Z<sub>&odot;</sub>. Surprisingly, even as ΣPAH drops significantly relative to the total infrared luminosity (TIR) as metallicity declines, 3.3 μm/TIR alone rises, potentially indicating the mass fraction of the smallest PAH grains increases as the total dust content in galaxies drops. The current model cannot fully reproduce this trend even if the unusually strong effects of changing radiation field hardness on 3.3 μm/TIR are included. This may be evidence that the smallest PAHs are uniquely robust against destruction and inhibited growth effects. These results highlight the pivotal role that short-wavelength PAH emission can play in studies of low-metallicity and high-redshift galaxies.

We study 24 massive quiescent galaxies with log rmM_*/rmM<sub>&odot;</sub> &gt; 10 at 1 &lt; z &lt; 3 with JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution observations from the Early eXtragalactic Continuum and Emission Line Survey (EXCELS). We reconstruct their star formation histories and find that they have large bursts (100rm M<sub>&odot;</sub> rmyr^-1 -1000 rm M<sub>&odot;</sub> rmyr^-1), followed by a rapid truncation of star formation. The number densities of the quenched galaxies in our sample that we predict underwent a submillimeter phase are consistent with submillimeter galaxies being the progenitors of our quenched population. The median post-starburst visibility time is ~600 Myr, with more massive galaxies (log rmM_*/rmM<sub>&odot;</sub> &gt; 10.7) exhibiting shorter visibility times than lower mass galaxies. The range of quenching times &ndash; defined as the time from the peak starburst to the time of quiescence &ndash; found in this sample (0.06-1.75 Gyr) suggests multiple quenching pathways, consistent with previous studies. We do not see evidence for quenching mechanisms varying with redshift between 1&lt;z&lt;3. We detect evidence for weak AGN activity in 4 out of the 8 galaxies with robust emission line detections, based on line ratio diagnostics. Our findings suggest that there are a diverse range of quenching mechanisms at cosmic noon, and support a scenario in which the primary quenching mechanisms are rapid (&lt;500 Myr) following a starburst.

We present gas-phase abundances of carbon (C), α-elements (O, Ne, Si, and Ar) and iron (Fe) obtained from stacked spectra of high-z star-forming galaxies with the deep Near Infrared Spectrograph medium-resolution data from the James Webb Space Telescope Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey. Our 564 sources at z=4&ndash;7 have a median stellar mass of log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=8.46 and a median star-formation rate of log(SFR/M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1)=0.30, placing them close to the star-formation main sequence. We find that the stacked spectrum of all our 564 sources has relatively low [C/O]=-0.70, moderate [Ne/O]=-0.09, and low [Ar/O]=-0.28 values at a low gas-phase metallicity of 12+log(O/H)=7.71 (Z~ 0.1~Z<sub>&odot;</sub>), suggesting dominant yields of core-collapse supernovae evolved from massive stars. The detection of a weak SiIII] emission line in our stacked spectrum provides a silicon-to-oxygen abundance ratio of [Si/O]=-0.63, which is lower than that of stars in the Milky Way disc and lower than expected by chemical evolution models, suggesting silicon depletion onto dust grains. Likewise, this Si/O value is lower than that we newly derive for two individual z&gt;6 galaxies (GN-z11 and RXCJ2248) with negligible dust attenuation. By performing spectral stacking in bins of M_*, SFR, specific SFR (sSFR), and ultra-violet (UV) continuum slope β_UV, we identify [FeIII] line detections in the high-sSFR bin and the blue-β_UV bin, both of which exhibit supersolar Fe/O ratios, while their C/O, Ar/O, and Si/O ratios are comparable to those of the all-sources stack. Our findings support a chemically young gas composition with rapid dust depletion in the general population of high-z star-forming galaxies, while raising the possibility of anomalous, selective Fe/O enhancement at the very early epoch of star formation.

### 249) [2509.14328](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14328v2): Cosmic-ray impact on optical and mid-infrared emission line diagnostics in NGC 5728

<p> E. Koutsoumpou, J. A. Fernández-Ontiveros, K. M. Dasyra, L. Spinoglio </p>
<p>
Cosmic rays (CRs), from active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets and supernovae (SNe), serve as a significant feedback mechanism influencing emission lines in narrow line region (NLR) clouds. These highly energetic particles, propelled by shocks, heat the interstellar medium (ISM) and modify its chemical composition. This study investigates the role of CRs, particularly in their ability to excite gas and align with observed line ratios across UV and optical diagnostics. We employ CLOUDY to explore CR ionization rate, ionization parameter, and initial hydrogen density effects on optical and mid-infrared (MIR) emission. Our analysis includes high-quality optical data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) for NGC 5728, supplemented by infrared observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Our previous results indicate that CRs are instrumental in heating the inner regions of gas clouds, enhancing emission of low-ionization optical lines. Mid-infrared data reveal that emission lines like [Ar II] and [Ne II] within the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) field of view are sensitive to CRs. In contrast, high-ionization lines (for example, [Ne V]) serve as robust tracers of photoionization insensitive to CRs. Moreover, mixed optical and MIR diagnostics offer insight into the relative roles of CRs and shocks, which often produce similar signatures in emission lines. We find that while both mechanisms can elevate certain line ratios, their influence on MIR diagnostics diverges: shocks and CRs affect low-ionization lines differently, allowing for a better understanding when multi-wavelength data are available. Our approach not only helps to resolve the degeneracy between metallicity and CR ionization but also enables the potential differentiation of shocks and CR-driven processes in AGN.

<p>
With the rise of the integral field spectroscopy, we are currently dealing with large amounts of spatially resolved data, whose analysis has become challenging, especially when observing complex objects such as nearby galaxies. We aim to develop a method to automatically separate different physical regions within the central parts (1"~160 pc, on average) of galaxies. This can allow us to better understand the systems, and provide an initial characterisation of the main ionisation sources affecting its evolution. We have developed an unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithm to analyse data cubes based on spectral similarity. It clusters together spaxels with similar spectra, which is useful to disentangle between different physical processes. We have applied this method to a sample of 15 nearby (distances &lt;100 Mpc) galaxies, 7 from the Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS) and 8 archival sources, all observed with the medium resolution spectrometer (MRS) of the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on board of the JWST. From the clusters, we computed their median spectrum and measured the line and continuum properties. We used these measurements to train random forest models and create several empirical mid-IR diagnostic diagrams for the MRS channel 3 wavelength range, including among others the bright [Ne II], [Ne III], and [Ne V] lines, several H2 transitions, and PAH features. The clustering technique allows to differentiate emission coming from an AGN, the disc, and star forming regions in galaxies, and other composite regions, potentially ionised by several sources simultaneously. This is supported by the results from the empirical diagnostic diagrams, that are indeed able to separate physically distinct regions. This innovative method serves as a tool to identify regions of interest in any data cube prior to an in-depth analysis of the sources. [abridged]

We report the discovery of a faint (M_1700 ~ -12.2), oxygen-deficient strongly-lensed ionizing source &ndash; dubbed LAP2 (Lensed And Pristine 2) &ndash; at a spectroscopic redshift of z=4.19. LAP2 appears to be isolated and lies very close to the caustic produced by the lensing galaxy cluster Abell 2744. It was observed with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec MSA in prism mode as part of the UNCOVER program. The NIRSpec spectrum reveals prominent Lya emission (7.1 sigma), clear Ha emission (6.2 sigma), tentative Hb emission (2.8 sigma), and no detectable [OIII]4959,5007 (~ 7 times fainter than Ha). The inferred [OIII] 2 sigma upper limit corresponds to an R3 index &lt;0.85 (assuming the Ha/Hb ~ 2.86 case~B recombination ratio), which, under high-ionization conditions, implies a metallicity of Z &lt; 6 X 10^(-3) Z_sun. The combination of faint ultraviolet luminosity, large rest-frame Ha equivalent width (~ 650 A), and extremely compact size (&lt; 10 pc) suggests that LAP2 is being caught in an early, pristine formation phase consistent with an instantaneous-burst scenario, with an estimated stellar mass of at most a few 10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Deep VLT/MUSE observations further reveal copious Lya emission forming an arclet that straddles the critical line. LAP2 thus joins the rare class of extremely metal-poor star-forming complexes that JWST has started to unveil at redshifts 3 - 7, and provides a rare glimpse into a still very poorly explored faint-luminosity regime.

The JWST has enabled the discovery of Active Galactic Nuclei at high redshifts. The intrinsic UV spectrum of GN-z11 at redshift z=10.6 has a spectral slope compatible with a standard accretion disc. By fitting a disc model to its spectrum, we find that the mass of the black hole must be above 1.12 x 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub> in order that it lies below the Eddington limit. We define this mass as the Eddington mass of the black hole. We note that the spectral shape is consistent with that of accreting stellar mass black holes sources in their soft state, for which no variability is expected. Mom-z14 is a more distant object at z=14.44 and has a similar UV slope. Disc model-fitting gives a similar result but lower mass accretion rate. We also examine3 further high redshift objects: GS z14-1, GHZ2 and PAN-z14-1 at z=13.86, 12.34 and 13.53, again obtaining similar results. If sub-Eddington accretion discs are indeed the origin of much of the UV emission from these objects, then the existence of massive black holes less than 304 and 290 Myr after the Big Bang point either to exceptional black hole seeds or to primordial black holes. The observed spread of UV spectral slopes in high redshift objects suggests that our approach may be relevant to about half of that population.

### 253) [2509.05403](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05403v2): H-alpha as a Tracer of Star Formation in the SPHINX Cosmological Simulations

<p> I. G. Kramarenko, J. Rosdahl, J. Blaizot, J. Matthee, H. Katz, C. Di Cesare </p>
<p>
The H-alpha (Ha) emission line in galaxies is a powerful tracer of their recent star formation activity. With the advent of JWST, we are now able to routinely observe Ha in galaxies at high redshift (z &gt; 3) and thus measure their star formation rates (SFRs). However, using classical SFR(Ha) calibrations to derive the SFRs leads to biased results because high-redshift galaxies are commonly characterized by low metallicities and bursty star formation histories, affecting the conversion factor between the Ha luminosity and the SFR. In this work, we develop a set of new SFR(Ha) calibrations that allow us to predict the SFRs of Ha-emitters at z &gt; 3 with minimal error. We use the SPHINX cosmological simulations to select a sample of star-forming galaxies representative of the Ha-emitter population observed with JWST. We then derive linear corrections to the classical SFR(Ha) calibrations, taking into account variations in the physical properties (e.g., stellar metallicities) among individual galaxies. We obtain two new SFR(Ha) calibrations that, compared to the classical calibrations, reduce the root mean squared error (RMSE) in the predicted SFRs by ΔRMSE ≈ 0.04 dex dex and ΔRMSE ≈ 0.06 dex, respectively. Using the recent JWST NIRCam/grism observations of Ha-emitters at z ~ 6, we show that the new calibrations affect the high-redshift galaxy population statistics: (i) the estimated cosmic star formation rate density decreases by Δρ(SFR) ≈ 12%, and (ii) the observed slope of the star formation main sequence increases by Δ \partiallog SFR / \partiallog M<sub>&sext;</sub> = 0.08 ± 0.02.

Young (≲ 10 Myr) planetary-mass companions (PMCs) provide valuable insights into the formation and early evolution of planetary systems. To date, only a dozen such objects have been identified through direct imaging. Using JWST/NIRCam observations towards the Orion Nebula, obtained as part of the itPDRs4All Early Release Science program, we have identified a faint point source near the M-type star V2376 Ori. Follow-up spectroscopic observations with the MUSE instrument on the VLT confirm that the source, V2376 Ori b, is indeed a young planetary-mass companion. It is a member of Orion D, around 80 pc in the foreground of the Trapezium cluster of Orion and with an age of approximately 7 ± 3 Myr. We fit the SED of V2376 Ori b to infer a mass of ~ 20~M_Jup. The MUSE spectrum reveals several accretion tracers. Based on the Hα line intensity, we estimate an accretion rate of ~10^-6.5 ± 0.7~M_Jup yr^-1, which is comparable to that of young PMCs such as PDS~70b. In addition, the MUSE data cube reveals extended emission in the [O scii] doublet at 7320 and 7330~Å, which is interpreted as evidence of a dynamical interaction between the two sources that, potentially, involves mass transfer between their individual accretion disks. These results demonstrate that JWST/NIRCam imaging surveys of young stellar associations can uncover new PMCs, which can then be confirmed and characterized through ground-based spectroscopic follow-up.

### 255) [2509.02431](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02431v2): Can an Anti-de Sitter Vacuum in the Dark Energy Sector Explain JWST High-Redshift Galaxy and Reionization Observations?

<p> Anirban Chakraborty, Tirthankar Roy Choudhury, Anjan Ananda Sen, Purba Mukherjee </p>
<p>
The unexpectedly large abundance of UV-bright galaxies at z&gt;10 discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope poses a significant challenge to the standard ΛCDM cosmology. This work tests whether modifying the cosmological background, and thereby the growth of structures, can resolve this tension without invoking significant evolution in the astrophysical properties of early galaxies. We investigate an alternative framework featuring an anti-de Sitter vacuum in the dark energy sector, which naturally arises in quantum gravity models like string theory and can enhance early structure formation. Using a self-consistent semi-analytical model that couples galaxy evolution with reionization, we confront this scenario with a wide range of observations. We show that while a model tailored to fit the high-z UV luminosity functions (UVLFs) appears promising, it is in strong tension with cosmological constraints from the CMB and other low-redshift probes. Conversely, models within this framework that satisfy these constraints provide only a modest boost to structure formation and fail to reproduce the observed galaxy abundances at z&gt;10. Although these models remain consistent with the cosmic reionization history, we find that this class of cosmological modifications is insufficient on its own to explain the galaxy excess. Our study underscores the importance of holistic testing for any beyond-ΛCDM proposal; apparent success in one observational regime does not guarantee overall viability. By demonstrating the limitations of a purely cosmological solution, our results strengthen the case that evolving astrophysical properties are a necessary ingredient for solving the challenge of early galaxy formation.

<p>
The UV-optical dust attenuation curve is key to interpreting the intrinsic properties of galaxies and provides insights into the nature of dust grains and their geometry relative to stars. In this work, we constrain the UV-optical slope of the stellar attenuation curve using a spectroscopic-redshift sample of ~3800 galaxies at z~1-9, to characterize the diversity and redshift evolution of stellar attenuation curves and to gain insight into dust production and evolution at high redshifts. The sample is constructed from three JWST/NIRCam grism surveys in GOODS and A2744 fields, with a wealth of JWST/NIRCam and HST photometry. With constraints from spectroscopic redshifts and emission line fluxes, we use the Prospector SED fitting code with a flexible dust model. We find that the attenuation curve slope varies strongly with Av at all redshifts, becoming flatter at higher attenuation. We find no strong correlation between attenuation curve slope and size or axis ratio, and the trends with stellar mass and star-formation rate are largely driven by their correlation with Av. We find strong evidence that at fixed Av, the curve becomes flatter with increasing redshift. On average, the attenuation curves derived here are shallower than those at z~0 and than the SMC curve. The highest redshift galaxies at z=7-9 (124 galaxies, a significantly larger sample than in previous studies) show slopes even flatter than the Calzetti curve, implying reduced UV obscuration and lower IR luminosities than expected from an SMC dust curve, by as large as an order of magnitude. Hydrodynamical simulations that couple dust growth to gas chemical enrichment successfully reproduce the different loci of high- and low-redshift galaxies in the slope-Av diagram, suggesting that dust in high-redshift galaxies is increasingly dominated by large grains produced in supernova ejecta with limited ISM processing at early times.

### 257) [2508.14350](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14350v2): New Insight from the James Webb Space Telescope on Variable Active Galactic Nuclei

<p> Bangzheng Sun, Haojing Yan, Wei Leong Tee, Feige Wang </p>
<p>
Variability detected in galaxies is usually attributed to their active galactic nuclei (AGNs). While all AGNs are intrinsically variable, the AGN unification model predicts that type~2 AGNs rarely vary because their engines are blocked by dust tori. Previous UV-to-near-IR variability studies largely support this expectation. Here, we present a variability study by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) that reveals a more subtle picture. Using NIRCam imaging data from three surveys over ~140~arcmin<sup>2</sup> in the COSMOS field, we found 117 galaxies with ≥ 4σ variability in the F356W band across ~2-year baseline. Cross-matching with the existing JWST spectroscopic data, we identified five of them at z=0.19&ndash;3.69 (F356W corresponding to rest-frame λ≈0.76-2.97~μm), which were all coincidentally observed by a NIRSpec program almost contemporaneously with the last imaging epoch. One additional variable was identified at z=0.90 using the archival Keck telescope data. These six objects form our spectroscopic subsample. Interestingly, two reside in close-pair environments, while two others form a close pair themselves. Most of their light curves can hardly be explained by nuclear transients, and AGN variability is a more plausible cause. However, among these six objects, (1) only one shows broad Bracket and Pfund series permitted lines (Δv &gt; 1000~km~s<sup>-1</sup>) indicative of a type~1 AGN; (2) two show narrow permitted lines (Hα and/or He~I&lambda;10830) consistent with type~2 AGNs, with another one likely type~2 based on the host galaxy properties; and (3) two others, which form a pair, show no emission lines. Our results add more challenges to the unification model.

### 258) [2508.14155](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14155v2): Little Red Dots and their Progenitors from Direct Collapse Black Holes

<p> Junehyoung Jeon, Boyuan Liu, Volker Bromm, Seiji Fujimoto, Anthony J. Taylor, Vasily Kokorev, Rebecca L. Larson, John Chisholm, Steven L. Finkelstein, Dale D. Kocevski </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered a new population of objects, the Little Red Dots (LRDs), characterized by V-shaped spectra indicative of strong breaks around the Balmer limit and compact morphology that gave them their name. A popular explanation is that they are a sub-population of active galactic nuclei/supermassive black holes (AGN/SMBHs) predominantly found in the high-redshift Universe (z≳3). Similarly, direct collapse black holes (DCBHs), theorized to form from collapsing massive, extremely metal-poor gas clouds, have been invoked to explain high-redshift quasars, the most massive AGN sub-population. Here, we employ the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH to produce a population of DCBHs and compare them against observed LRD demographics and properties. Specifically, we compare the DCBH-seeded SMBH population against the standard stellar-remnant seeds and find that DCBH models agree better with observed LRD population statistics and host halo properties. Furthermore, for the most extreme and earliest LRD detections, interpreted to be systems with an AGN but little stellar component, DCBHs are able to reproduce the observed spectral shape and properties under multiple scenarios - high dust attenuation or AGN surrounded by dense gas - that have been proposed to explain the unique shape of LRD spectra. Even when super-Eddington accretion, invoked previously to explain the nature of LRDs, is enforced on stellar remnant seeds, the spectral characteristics of extreme LRDs cannot be reproduced. We emphasize the importance of gas-metallicity observations as an additional dimension besides the widely used SMBH-stellar mass ratios to further constrain the progenitors of LRDs.

<p>
We present the number density of massive (  log (M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &gt; 10.3 ) quiescent galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;5 using JWST NIRSpec PRISM spectra. This work relies on spectra from RUBIES, which provides excellent data quality and an unparalleled, well-defined targeting strategy to robustly infer physical properties and number densities. We identify quiescent galaxy candidates within RUBIES through principal component analysis and construct a final sample using star formation histories derived from spectro-photometric fitting of the NIRSpec PRISM spectra and NIRCam photometry. By inverting the RUBIES selection function, we correct for survey incompleteness and calculate the number density of massive quiescent galaxies at these redshifts, providing the most complete spectroscopic estimates prior to cosmic noon to date. We find that early massive quiescent galaxies are surprisingly common (≳ 10^-5 Mpc^-3 by 4&lt;z&lt;5), which is consistent with previous studies based on JWST photometry alone and/or in smaller survey areas. We compare our number densities with predictions from six state-of-the-art cosmological galaxy formation simulations. At z&gt;3, most simulations fail to produce enough massive quiescent galaxies, suggesting the treatment of feedback and/or the channels for early efficient formation are incomplete in most galaxy evolution models.

<p>
The unexpectedly high abundance of galaxies at z &gt; 11 revealed by JWST has sparked a debate on the nature of early galaxies and the physical mechanisms regulating their formation. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has begun to provide vital insights on their gas and dust content, but so far only for extreme 'blue monsters'. Here we present new, deep ALMA observations of JADES-GS-z11-0, a more typical (sub-L^*) z &gt; 11 galaxy that bridges the discovery space of JWST and the Hubble Space Telescope. These data confirm the presence of the [O III] 88 μm line at 4.5σ significance, precisely at the redshift of several faint emission lines previously seen with JWST/NIRSpec, while the underlying dust continuum remains undetected (F_ν&lt; 9.0   μJy), implying an obscured star formation rate (SFR) of SFR_IR ≲ 6   M<sub>&odot;</sub>   yr^-1 and dust mass of M_dust ≲ 1.0 × 10^6   M<sub>&odot;</sub> (all 3σ). The accurate ALMA redshift of z_[O III] = 11.1221 ± 0.0006 (≳ \! 5× refined over NIRSpec) helps confirm that redshifts measured purely from the Lyman-α break, even spectroscopically, should properly take into account the effects of potential damped Lyman-α absorption (DLA) systems to avoid systematic overestimates of up to Δz ≈ 0.5. The [O III] 88 μm luminosity of L_[O III] = (1.1 ± 0.3) × 10^8   L<sub>&odot;</sub>, meanwhile, agrees well with the scaling relation for local metal-poor dwarfs given the SFR measured by NIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI. The spatially resolved MIRI and ALMA emission also underscores that JADES-GS-z11-0 is likely to consist of two low-mass components that are undergoing strong bursts of star formation yet are already pre-enriched in oxygen (~20-30% solar), only 400 Myr after the Big Bang.

<p>
One of the most remarkable outcomes from itJWST has been the exquisite UV-optical spectroscopic data for galaxies in the high-redshift Universe (z ≥ 5), enabling the use of various nebular emission lines to infer conditions of the interstellar medium. In this work, we assess the reliability of commonly used diagnostics for estimating the star formation rate (SFR), the ionising photon production efficiency (ξ<sub>ion</sub>), and the gas-phase oxygen abundance, focusing on dust corrections based on A_V (V-band attenuation) and the Balmer decrement. Using forward-modelled galaxy spectra from idealised toy models and the FLARES cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we examine how variations in stellar populations and star-dust geometry affect these diagnostics. We find that the clumpy nature of \flares galaxies lead to strong internal variation in age, metallicity and dust attenuation, biasing the inferred quantities. In FLARES the SFRD at the bright-end of the SFR function can be underestimated by as much as 30&percnt; compared to the true values. While the intrinsic ξ<sub>ion</sub> in FLARES is nearly constant with stellar mass, estimates derived from Hα or Hβ can be underestimated by more than 0.5 dex at high stellar masses (&gt;10^9.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), introducing an artificial declining trend. Similarly, the dust-corrected mass-metallicity relation inferred from line ratios is significantly flatter than the intrinsic mass-weighted relation. These systematic offsets arise from the coupling between heterogeneous stellar populations and non-uniform star-dust geometry and depend on the diagnostic and the dust-correction method employed. No single dust-correction approach yields unbiased estimates of all quantities simultaneously, highlighting the need for forward modelling and comparisons in observed space for robust high-redshift inference.

### 262) [2507.12618](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12618v3): Supermassive Stars Match the Spectral Signatures of JWST's Little Red Dots

<p> Devesh Nandal, Abraham Loeb </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled a population of enigmatic, compact sources at high redshift known as "Little Red Dots'' (LRDs), whose physical nature remains a subject of intense debate. Concurrently, the rapid assembly of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) requires the formation of heavy seeds, for which supermassive stars (SMSs) are leading theoretical progenitors. In this work, we perform the first quantitative test of the hypothesis that LRDs are the direct observational manifestation of these primordial SMSs. We present a novel, first-principles pipeline generating synthetic spectra for a non-rotating, metal-free SMS up to 10^6   M<sub>&odot;</sub>. We establish that its luminosity (L_λ≈ 1.7 × 10^44   erg   s<sup>-1</sup>   μm^-1 at 4050 Å) provides a decisive constraint, matching prominent LRDs. Our model self-consistently reproduces their defining spectral features: the V-shaped Balmer break morphology is shown to be an intrinsic photospheric effect, while the complex line phenomenology, strong Hβ in emission with other Balmer lines in absorption arises from non-LTE effects in a single stellar atmosphere. With wind and macroturbulent broadening, we match LRD spectra at z=7.76 and z=3.55, including the Hβ width of MoM-BH*-1 to within 4&percnt;. We predict a luminosity-dependent observability window, ~10^4 yr for the most luminous systems and 10^5&ndash;10^6 yr if L_λ(4050 Å) is lower by 1&ndash;2 dex. These results provide a self-consistent alternative to multi-component obscured AGN scenarios and suggest JWST may be witnessing luminous stages of SMBH progenitors before collapse.

<p>
We present a multi-phase study of the gas in the circumnuclear region (~1.1x1.0 kpc<sup>2</sup>) of the nearby Seyfert 1.8 galaxy NGC 1365, observed in the context of the Mid-IR Activity of Circumnuclear Line Emission (MIRACLE) program. We combined spatially resolved spectroscopic observations from JWST/MIRI, VLT/MUSE, and ALMA to investigate the ionized atomic gas and the warm and cold molecular phases. MIRI data revealed over 40 mid-IR emission lines from ionized and warm molecular gas. Moment maps show that both cold and warm molecular gas follow the rotation of the stellar disk along the circumnuclear ring. The ionized gas displays flux and kinematic patterns that depend on ionization potential (IP): low-IP species (&lt;25 eV) trace the disk, while higher-IP lines (up to ~120 eV) trace outflowing material. The [O III]5700 and [Ne V]14 lines both trace the southeast nuclear outflow cone. Additionally, [Ne V]14 detects the northwest counter-cone, obscured in the optical and thus invisible in [O III]5700. Mid-IR diagnostics, unlike optical ones, clearly reveal the AGN as the primary ionization source in the nucleus. Emission from high-IP species is spatially coincident with the ionization cones and not with star-forming regions. Using the [Ne V]24/[Ne V]14 ratio, we derive an electron density of (750+-440) cm^(-3), in agreement with values from the [S II] optical doublet. For the first time, we apply a fully self-consistent approach combining advanced photoionization and kinematic models (HOMERUN+MOKA3D) to constrain intrinsic outflow properties, overcoming the limitations of simplified classical methods. Exploiting the synergy of JWST/MIRI and VLT/MUSE, HOMERUN reproduces fluxes of over 60 emission lines from optical to mid-IR, disentangling AGN and star formation contributions and yielding robust estimates of outflow mass, geometry, and energetics.

<p>
We describe the drizzling pipeline and contents of the drizzled database for Hubble Space Telescope Cycle 27-29 Archival Legacy project "SKYSURF," the largest archival project ever approved for Hubble. SKYSURF aims to investigate the extragalactic background light using all 143,914 ACSWFC, WFC3UVIS, and WFC3IR images that have been taken by Hubble since its launch in 2002. SKYSURF has produced 38,027 single-visit mosaics and 7,893 multi-visit mosaics across 28 ACSWFC, WFC3UVIS, and WFC3IR filters using nonstandard drizzling methods, which include preserving the lowest sky-level of each visit/group in the drizzled products, applying wider apertures for cosmic-ray rejection, correcting effects caused by charge transfer efficiency degradation, and removing potential light gradients from input images via sky-map subtraction. We generate source catalogs for all drizzled products with SExtractor and provide updated star-galaxy separation parameters and integrated galaxy light (IGL) estimates for 25 of the 28 SKYSURF filters (wavelength range 0.2-1.7 um) using a novel IGL fitting method made possible by the vast SKYSURF dataset. We discuss the data processing and data analysis challenges encountered, detail our solutions, and offer suggestions that may facilitate future large-scale IGL investigations with Webb, SPHEREx, and Roman.

### 265) [2506.21187](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21187v2): A joint JWST and HST view of Omega Centauri: Multiple stellar populations and their kinematics

<p>
We combine F115W and F277W images collected with the Near Infrared Camera of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with multi-band, multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of Omega Centauri to investigate its multiple stellar populations and internal kinematics. Our study focuses on a region spanning ~0.9 to ~2.3 half-light radii from the cluster center, largely unexplored by HST and JWST. Using chromosome maps, we identify the principal populations along the upper main sequence and among M-dwarfs, distinguishing lower-stream (LS) stars, chemically akin to first-generation globular cluster stars with similar metallicities, and upper-stream (US) stars, enriched in helium and nitrogen but oxygen-poor. Both streams also host subpopulations with varying metallicities. We find radially anisotropic motions, with US stars exhibiting significantly stronger anisotropy than LS stars. Subdividing the US into extreme and intermediate light-element populations reveals a gradient in anisotropy, with intermediate stars lying between the LS and extreme US populations. However, metal-rich and metal-poor stars within each stream show moderate kinematic differences. The LS stars show higher angular momentum and dispersion compared to US stars, and also exhibit stronger systemic rotation and tangential proper-motion skewness, further highlighting their kinematic divergence. Finally, leveraging a mass range of ~0.15 - 0.7 solar masses, we detect a low degree of energy equipartition for all cluster stars, which decreases with radial distance from the cluster center.

### 266) [2506.19721](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19721v3): MUSE-DARK-I: Dark matter halo properties of intermediate-z star-forming galaxies

<p> B. I. Ciocan, N. F. Bouché, J. Fensch, W. Mercier, D. Krajnović, J. Richard, T. Contini, A. Jeanneau </p>
<p>
[Abridged] We analyse the dark matter (DM) halo properties of 127 0.3&lt;z&lt;1.5 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) down to low stellar masses (8&lt;log(Mstar/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;11), using data from the MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field Survey and photometry from HST and JWST. We employ a 3D forward modelling approach to analyse the morpho-kinematics of our sample, enabling measurement of individual rotation curves out to 2-3 times the effective radius. We perform a disk-halo decomposition with a 3D parametric model that includes stellar, gas, and DM components, with pressure support corrections. We validate our methodology on mock data cubes generated from idealised disk simulations. We select the best-fitting DM model among six density profiles, including the Navarro-Frenk-White and the generalised alpha-beta-gamma profile of Di Cintio et al. (2014, DC14). Our Bayesian analysis shows that DC14 performs as well as or better than the other profiles in &gt;80% of the sample. We find that the kinematically inferred stellar masses agree with values from SED fitting. We find that 89% of galaxies have DM fractions &gt;50%. For 66% of SFGs, we infer a DM inner slope, gamma &lt; 0.5, indicating cored DM profiles, but no correlation is found between gamma and star formation rate of the sample. The stellar- and concentration-mass relations agree with theoretical expectations, but with larger scatter. We confirm the anticorrelation between halo scale radius and DM density. The halo scale radii and DM surface densities increase with Mstar, while DM densities stay constant. We find tentative evidence of an evolution of the DM density with z, which suggests that the DM halos of intermediate-z systems are denser than those of local galaxies. In contrast, the halo scale radii are z-invariant.

<p>
We probe galactic-scale outflows in star-forming galaxies at z≳2.5 drawn from the itJWST/NIRSpec AURORA program. For the first time, we directly compare outflow properties from the early universe to the present day using near-UV absorption lines. We measure ISM kinematics from FeII and MgII absorption features in 41 and 43 galaxies, respectively, and examine how these kinematics correlate with galaxy properties. We find that galaxies with outflows tend to have higher stellar masses, and that maximum outflow velocities increase with stellar mass, SFR, UV slope β, E(B-V), and A_V. We also find that MgII emission is more common in galaxies with lower masses, higher sSFRs, and less dust. These trends are consistent with those in star-forming galaxies at z&lt;2 when using the same outflow tracers, suggesting that the feedback from star formation has played a persistent role in shaping galaxy evolution over cosmic time. We also directly compare near-UV and far-UV features in the same NIRSpec spectrum for a z=5.19 galaxy, finding consistent ISM kinematics and demonstrating that different tracers yield comparable measurements. We also detect Na D absorption in 10 galaxies, which have higher stellar mass, SFR, and dust attenuation compared to galaxies without Na D absorption, which is consistent with z~0 studies. The broad continuum coverage and sensitivity of NIRSpec will enable future studies with larger samples, allowing for robust tests of these trends across a wider dynamic range of galaxy properties.

### 268) [2506.14141](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14141v2): Spectral Properties of Irradiated Circumbinary Disks around Binary Black Holes Governed by Hydrogen Opacities Dependent on Temperature and Density

<p> Saemi Bang, Atsuo T. Okazaki, Kimitake Hayasaki </p>
<p>
We study the thermal and spectral properties of irradiated circumbinary disks (CBDs) around binary black holes (BBHs), using analytic, hydrogen-based opacity models that capture dependencies on temperature, density, and ionization. We solve the vertical hydrostatic equilibrium and energy balance, assuming gas pressure only, using Rosseland-mean opacities from free-free and bound-free absorption plus electron scattering, with ionization fractions given by the Saha equation. Four opacity models are considered, including a reference model with no physical opacity, constructed by Lee et al. (2024), and three physically motivated alternatives. The midplane temperature profiles show significant variation across models, while the surface temperature remains largely unchanged in regions dominated by viscous heating. Opacity effects become pronounced in the outer disk, where irradiation reprocessing shapes the IR-optical continuum. Bound-free opacity introduces flattening and a mid-frequency peak in the spectral energy distribution. We compute spectra of a triple disk system including the CBD and two accreting minidisks. The high-frequency peak arises from the hot minidisks, while the low-frequency excess originates from irradiated outer CBD layers. Comparing model spectra with detection limits of Subaru, JWST, and Swift, we find that BBH systems within ~10 Mpc can exhibit a detectable IR excess. Our results highlight the need for physically consistent opacity modeling to interpret electromagnetic (EM) signatures of BBHs approaching coalescence and support integration of metallicity-dependent opacity tables. Our opacity-informed framework for irradiated CBDs provides an EM template for identifying stellar- to intermediate-mass BBHs in a mass range sparsely sampled by LISA, thereby bridging the gravitational-wave-EM gap with testable IR/optical signatures.

### 269) [2506.14117](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14117v2): JWST Reveals a Candidate Jellyfish Galaxy at z=1.156

<p> Ian D. Roberts, Michael L. Balogh, Visal Sok, Adam Muzzin, Michael J. Hudson, Pascale Jablonka </p>
<p>
We report the discovery of COSMOS2020-635829 as a candidate jellyfish galaxy undergoing ram pressure stripping in a (proto)cluster at z &gt; 1. High-resolution imaging from the James Webb Space Telescope reveals a symmetric stellar disk coupled to a unilateral tail of star-forming knots to the south. Using Gemini GMOS IFU observations, we show that these extra-planar continuum sources are embedded within an ionized gas tail that is kinematically connected to the disk of COSMOS2020-635829. If confirmed, this represents the highest-redshift discovery of a ram pressure stripped ionized gas tail. The tail sources are characterized by extremely young stellar populations (≲ 100 Myr), have stellar masses of ~10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, and star formation rates of 0.1&ndash;1 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1. This work shows that ram pressure stripping can potentially perturb group and cluster galaxies at z &gt; 1 and may contribute to environmental quenching even near Cosmic Noon.

### 270) [2506.13852](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13852v2): Overmassive black holes in the early Universe can be explained by gas-rich, dark matter-dominated galaxies

<p>
JWST has revealed the apparent evolution of the black hole (BH)-stellar mass (M_BH-M<sub>&ast;</sub>) relation in the early Universe, while remaining consistent with the BH-dynamical mass (M_BH-M_dyn) relation. We predict BH masses for z&gt;3 galaxies in the high-resolution THESAN-ZOOM simulations by assuming the M_BH-M_dyn relation is fundamental. Even without live BH modelling, our approach reproduces the JWST-observed M_BH distribution, including overmassive BHs relative to the local M_BH-M<sub>&ast;</sub> relation. We find that M_BH/M<sub>&ast;</sub> declines with M<sub>&ast;</sub>, evolving from ~0.1 at M<sub>&ast;</sub>=10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> to ~0.01 at M<sub>&ast;</sub>=10^10.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. This trend reflects the dark matter (f_DM) and gas fractions (f_gas), which decrease with M<sub>&ast;</sub> but show little redshift evolution down to z=3, resulting in small M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M_dyn ratios and thus overmassive BHs in low-mass galaxies. We use ttProspector-derived stellar masses and star-formation rates to infer f_gas across 48,022 galaxies in JADES at 3&lt;z&lt;9, finding excellent agreement with our simulation. Our results demonstrate that overmassive BHs would naturally result from a fundamental M_BH-M_dyn relation and be typical of the gas-rich, dark matter-dominated nature of low-mass, high-redshift galaxies. Such overmassive BHs may strongly influence early galaxy formation, and we caution that our approach does not include the self-consistent BH-galaxy co-evolution required for a complete understanding.

<p>
We present 21 transients from our three-epoch, four-band NIRCam observations covering 14.16 arcmin<sup>2</sup> in the Spitzer IRAC Dark Field (IDF), taken by the JWST Prime Extragalactic Areas for Reionization and Lensing Science program with a time cadence of ~6 months. A separate Hubble Space Telescope program provided Advanced Camera for Surveys optical imaging contemporaneous with the second and third epochs of the NIRCam observations. The NIRSpec spectroscopy on three transients confirmed a Type Ia supernova at z=1.63 and the host galaxies of the other two at z=2.64 and 1.90, respectively. Combining these with the photometric redshifts (z_ph) of the host galaxies in the rest of the sample, we find that the transients are in either a "mid-z" group at z&gt;1.6 with M_V &lt; -16.0 mag or a "low-z" group at z &lt; 0.4 with M_H &gt; -14.0 mag. The mid-z transients are consistent with supernovae. In contrast, the low-z transients' luminosities fall in the range of the so-called "gap transients" between supernovae and novae. However, this latter conclusion is only tentative due to possible catastrophic failures in z_ph that could bias them to low-z. Conversely, if they are indeed at z &lt; 0.4, it would be worth studying similar transients in the future. Our work further demonstrates the power of NIRCam in transient science and also shows that it would be more fruitful to carry out a long-term monitoring program with more passbands, a higher cadence and prompt follw-up spectroscopy. Being in the continuous viewing zone of the JWST, the IDF is an ideal field for this purpose.

<p>
Galaxy mergers play a critical role in driving galaxy evolution, especially by transforming galaxy morphology, redistributing gas around galaxies, triggering active galactic nuclei (AGN), and stimulating star formation. We present the Cosmic Owl, a galaxy merger at z=1.14, identified in the COSMOS field. Deep imaging and spectroscopy from JWST, ALMA, and VLA reveal a complex system of twin collisional ring galaxies, exhibiting nearly identical morphologies. The grism spectra from the JWST COSMOS-3D program confirm that both galaxies host an AGN. A bipolar radio jet from one AGN extends to strike the merging front. In addition, we detect a starburst at the merging front, characterized by luminous extended nebular line emission and a massive cold gas reservoir. This starburst is likely triggered by interstellar shocks induced by galaxy collision and the AGN jet. The twin ring structure of the Cosmic Owl requires further numerical simulations to clarify the precise conditions that lead to the formation of this rare morphology. This system exemplifies how shock-induced star formation, driven by galaxy collision or AGN jet, can act as a crucial mechanism for triggering intense starbursts in the early Universe.

### 273) [2506.04350](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04350v2): JWST Insights into Narrow-line Little Red Dots

<p> Zijian Zhang, Linhua Jiang, Weiyang Liu, Luis C. Ho, Kohei Inayoshi </p>
<p>
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a population of red and compact objects with a unique V-shape SED at z ≥ 4 known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Most of the LRDs with existing spectral observations exhibit broad Balmer lines and are thus likely to host active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here we present a study of LRDs with no broad H-alpha component. Our sample consists of five LRDs at z~5 with H-alpha line widths of about 250 km/s. They are selected from 32 LRDs that have NIRSpec high- or medium-resolution grating spectra covering H-alpha. During our construction of the sample, we find that approximately 20 percent of the LRD candidates previously selected do not show red continuum emission but resemble the V-shape spectra due to strong line emission. Compared to normal star-forming galaxies, narrow-line LRDs tend to have relatively higher H-alpha line widths and luminosities. If these LRDs are dominated by galaxies, our SED modeling suggests that they are dusty, compact star-forming galaxies with high stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs). Alternatively, if their SEDs are produced by AGNs, the inferred central black hole masses (MBH) are in the range of 10^5 to 10^6 solar masses, placing them at the low-mass end of the AGN population. They may represent an early stage of super-Eddington growth, where the black holes have yet to accumulate significant masses. With large measurement uncertainties, these black holes appear slightly overmassive relative to the local MBH-Mstar relation, but consistent or undermassive with respect to the MBH-sigma and MBH-Mdyn relations. We further find that nearly half of the high-redshift broad-line AGNs exhibit V-shape SEDs. (abridged)

<p>
The COSMOS-Web survey, with its unparalleled combination of multiband data, notably, near-infrared imaging from JWST's NIRCam (F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W), provides a transformative dataset down to ~28 mag (F444W) for studying galaxy evolution. In this work, we employ Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), an unsupervised machine learning method, to estimate key physical parameters of galaxies &ndash; redshift, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), specific SFR (sSFR), and age &ndash; directly from photometric data out to z=3.5. SOMs efficiently project high-dimensional galaxy color information onto 2D maps, showing how physical properties vary among galaxies with similar spectral energy distributions. We first validate our approach using mock galaxy catalogs from the HORIZON-AGN simulation, where the SOM accurately recovers the true parameters, demonstrating its robustness. Applying the method to COSMOS-Web observations, we find that the SOM delivers robust estimates despite the increased complexity of real galaxy populations. Performance metrics (σ_NMAD typically between 0.1&ndash;0.3, and Pearson correlation between 0.7 and 0.9) confirm the precision of the method, with ~ 70&percnt; of predictions within 1σ dex of reference values. Although redshift estimation in COSMOS-Web remains challenging (median σ_NMAD = 0.04), the overall success of the highlights its potential as a powerful and interpretable tool for galaxy parameter estimation. A key advance of this work is the use of JWST/NIRCam photometry, particularly the F444W band, which enhances SOM training and allows more accurate estimation of stellar mass, SFR, and age compared to previous studies using IRAC/Spitzer filters.

<p>
We present AGNBoost, a machine learning framework utilizing XGBoostLSS to identify AGN and estimate redshifts from JWST NIRCam and MIRI photometry. AGNBoost constructs 66 input features from 7 NIRCam and 4 MIRI bands to predict the fraction of mid-IR 3&ndash;30 μm emission attributable to an AGN power law (frac_AGN) and photometric redshift. Each model is trained on 10^6 simulated galaxies from CIGALE. Models are tested on mock CIGALE galaxies, an independent set of empirically-derived templates, and 748 observations from the JWST MIRI EGS Galaxy and AGN (MEGA) survey. On idealized noise-free mock CIGALE galaxies, AGNBoost achieves 15&percnt; outlier fractions of 1.63&percnt; (frac_AGN) and 0.15&percnt; (redshift), with σ_RMSE = 0.045 for frac_AGN and σ_NMAD = 0.004 for redshift. When realistic photometric uncertainties are introduced, performance remains robust with median predictions on the 1:1 relation, though outlier fractions increase to 4.38&percnt; and 3.35&percnt;, respectively. On the independent template set, AGNBoost identifies 92.6&percnt; of AGN candidates with frac_AGN &gt; 0.3 and 100&percnt; with frac_AGN &gt; 0.5, demonstrating generalization beyond the training distribution. On MEGA galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, AGNBoost achieves σ_NMAD = 0.056 and 19.79&percnt; outliers. AGNBoost frac_AGN estimates broadly agree with CIGALE fitting (σ_RMSE = 0.178, 11.96&percnt; outliers). The flexible framework allows straightforward incorporation of additional photometric bands and re-training for other variables. AGNBoost's computational efficiency makes it well-suited for wide-sky surveys requiring rapid AGN identification and redshift estimation.

We present cosmological constraints from 8 strongly lensed quasars (hereafter, the TDCOSMO-2025 sample). Building on previous work, our analysis incorporated new deflector stellar velocity dispersions measured from spectra obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Keck Telescopes, and the Very Large Telescope (VLT), utilizing improved methods. We used integrated JWST stellar kinematics for 5 lenses, VLT-MUSE for 2, and resolved kinematics from Keck and JWST for RXJ1131-1231. We also considered two samples of non-time-delay lenses: 11 from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) sample with Keck-KCWI resolved kinematics; and 4 from the Strong Lenses in the Legacy Survey (SL2S) sample. We improved our analysis of line-of-sight effects, the surface brightness profile of the lens galaxies, and orbital anisotropy, and corrected for projection effects in the dynamics. Our uncertainties are maximally conservative by accounting for the mass-sheet degeneracy in the deflectors' mass density profiles. The analysis was blinded to prevent experimenter bias. Our primary result is based on the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, in combination with Ω_m constraints from the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae (SN) dataset. In the flat Λ cold dark matter (CDM), we find H_0=71.6^+3.9_-3.3 km s<sup>-1</sup> Mpc^-1. The SLACS and SL2S samples are in excellent agreement with the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, improving the precision on H_0 in flat ΛCDM to 4.6%. Using the Dark Energy Survey SN Year-5 dataset (DES-SN5YR) or DESI-DR2 baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) likelihoods instead of Pantheon+ yields very similar results. We also present constraints in the open ΛCDM, wCDM, w_0w_aCDM, and w_φCDM cosmologies. The TDCOSMO H_0 inference is robust and consistent across all presented cosmological models, and our cosmological constraints in them agree with those from the BAO and SN.

<p>
We present simulated counterparts of the "Little Red Dot'' (LRD) galaxies observed with JWST, using the large cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, ASTRID. We create mock observations of the galaxies (5 ≤ z ≤ 8) in ASTRID, and find seventeen which fit the color and size criteria of LRDs. These LRDs are galaxies with high stellar masses (log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 9.7), and massive black holes (log(M_BH/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 6.8). The host galaxies are dense, with stellar half mass radii (325 pc ≤ r_half,* ≤ 620 pc), and dust attenuation in the F444W band above 1.25. Their star formation has been recently quenched. They host relatively bright AGN that are dust-obscured and contribute significantly to the rest-frame optical red slope and have relatively low luminosity in the rest-frame ultraviolet, where the host galaxy's stars are more dominant. These LRDs are in an evolutionary phase of miniquenching that is the result of AGN feedback from their massive black holes. The LRDs in ASTRID are bright with F444W magnitudes of 23.5-25.5. The less massive and fainter galaxies in ASTRID lack the dust concentration necessary to produce the red slope of an LRD, though this could be an effect of limited resolution. Most of the highest Eddington black holes are not LRDs due to insufficient dust attenuation from their host galaxies, which are also experiencing relatively high star formation rates. This results in their spectra being too flat, despite their highly accreting black holes.

<p>
We present four galaxy scale lenses discovered in two JWST blank-fields: the ~ 54 arcmin<sup>2</sup> of the PEARLS North-Ecliptic-Pole Time-Domain Field (NEP TDF) and in the ~ 90 arcmin<sup>2</sup> of CEERS. We perform the search by visual inspection of NIRCam photometric data, obtaining an initial list of 16 lens candidates. We down-select this list to 5 high-confidence lens candidates, based on lens modelling of the image configuration and photometric redshift measurements for both the source and the deflector. We compare our results to samples of lenses obtained in ground-based and space-based lens searches and theoretical expectations. We expect that JWST observations of field galaxies will yield approximately 1 galaxy scale lens every three to four NIRCam pointings of comparable depth to these observations (~ 9 arcmin<sup>2</sup> each). This shows that JWST, compared to other lens searches, can yield an extremely high number of secure lenses per unit area, with redshift and size distributions complementary to lens samples obtained from ground-based and wide-area surveys. We estimate that a single JWST pure-parallel survey of comparable depth could yield ~ 80 galaxy scale lenses, with a third of them having z_lens&gt;1 and z_source&gt;3.

### 279) [2505.12867](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12867v2): The Dichotomy in the Nuclear and Host Galaxy Properties of High-redshift Quasars

<p> Ruancun Li, Luis C. Ho, Chang-Hao Chen </p>
<p>
The early growth of high-redshift quasars and their host galaxies raises critical questions about their cosmic evolution. We exploit the angular resolution and sensitivity of NIRCam to investigate the host galaxies of 31 quasars at 4≲ z≲7 drawn from multiple JWST surveys. Using a new multi-band forward-modeling code (scGalfitS) that incorporates physically motivated priors, we securely detect and quantify the host emission in 30 objects, while simultaneously characterizing the nuclear spectral energy distribution. The host galaxies of high-redshift quasars are ~ 0.3~dex more compact than star-forming galaxies of comparable mass. A striking dichotomy emerges: luminous "blue'' quasars (L_5100≳10^45 erg s<sup>-1</sup>) reside in bulge-dominated galaxies (n ≈ 5) and exhibit a narrow range of ultraviolet nuclear slopes (median β_UV ≈ -1.4), while fainter "red'' quasars inhabit disk-like hosts (n≈ 1) and display a broad range of slopes (β_UV≈-2 to 4). These two populations differ markedly in their black hole-to-stellar mass ratios, with high-luminosity quasars showing M_BH/M<sub>&ast;</sub> = 1.2&percnt; compared to 4.7&percnt; for lower luminosity sources, placing them collectively ~0.6~dex above the local M_BH-M<sub>&ast;</sub> relation. This offset likely reflects rapid black hole growth in early gas-rich environments, where feedback from the active galactic nucleus becomes effective only after substantial gas depletion. Our findings suggest that the observed dichotomy, whether due to intrinsic spectral differences or dust extinction, fundamentally shapes the coevolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies in the early Universe.

<p>
JWST has revealed a stunning population of bright galaxies at surprisingly early epochs, z&gt;10, where few such sources were expected. Here we present the most distant example of this class yet &ndash; MoM-z14, a luminous (M_UV=-20.2) source in the COSMOS field at z<sub>spec</sub>=14.44^+0.02_-0.02 that expands the observational frontier to a mere 280 million years after the Big Bang. The redshift is confirmed with NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy through a sharp Lyman-α break and ~3σ detections of five rest-UV emission lines. The number density of bright z<sub>spec</sub>~14-15 sources implied by our "Mirage or Miracle" survey spanning ~350 arcmin<sup>2</sup> is &gt;100× larger (182^+329_-105×) than pre-JWST consensus models. The high EWs of UV lines (~15-35 Å) signal a rising star-formation history, with a ~10× increase in the last 5 Myr (SFR_5Myr/SFR_50Myr=9.9^+3.0_-5.8). The source is extremely compact (circularized r_e = 74^+15_-12 pc), and yet elongated (b/a=0.25^+0.11_-0.06), suggesting an AGN is not the dominant source of UV light. The steep UV slope (β=-2.5^+0.2_-0.2) implies negligible dust attenuation and a young stellar population. The absence of a strong damping wing provides tentative evidence that the immediate surroundings of MoM-z14 may be partially ionized at a redshift where virtually every reionization model predicts a ~100&percnt; neutral fraction. The nitrogen emission and highly super-solar [N/C]&gt;1 hint at an abundance pattern similar to local globular clusters that may have once hosted luminous supermassive stars. Since this abundance pattern is also common among the most ancient stars born in the Milky Way, we may be directly witnessing the formation of such stars in dense clusters, connecting galaxy evolution across the entire sweep of cosmic time.

### 281) [2505.08870](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08870v2): Galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization Are All Bark and No Bite &ndash; Plenty of Ionizing Photons, Low Escape Fractions

<p>
Early results from JWST suggest that epoch-of-reionization (EoR) galaxies produce copious ionizing photons, which, if they escape efficiently, could cause reionization to occur too early. We study this problem using \jwst imaging and prism spectroscopy for 412 galaxies at 4.5 &lt; z &lt; 9.0. We fit these data simultaneously with stellar-population and nebular-emission models that include a parameter for the fraction of ionizing photons that escape the galaxy, f<sub>esc</sub>. We find that the ionization production efficiency, ξ<sub>ion</sub> = Q(H) / L(UV), increases with redshift and decreasing UV luminosity, but shows significant scatter, σ( log ξ<sub>ion</sub>) = 0.3 dex. The inferred escape fractions averaged over the population are low, ranging from &langle; f<sub>esc</sub> &rangle; = 2.6± 1.4&percnt; at 6 &lt; z &lt; 9 to 6.5± 2.2&percnt; at 4.5 &lt; z &lt; 6 with weak or no indication of evolution with redshift. This implies that in our models most of the ionizing photons need to be absorbed to account for the nebular emission. We compute the impact of our results on reionization, including the distributions for ξ<sub>ion</sub> and f<sub>esc</sub>, and the evolution and uncertainty of the UV luminosity function. Considering galaxies brighter than M(UV) &lt; -16 mag, we would produce an IGM hydrogen-ionized fraction of x_e = 0.5 at 5.3 &lt; z &lt; 5.8, possibly too late compared to constraints from from QSO sightlines. Including fainter galaxies, M(UV) &lt; -14 mag, we obtain x_e = 0.5 at 6.0 &lt; z &lt; 8.1, fully consistent with QSO and CMB data. This implies that EoR galaxies produce plenty of ionizing photons, but these do not efficiently escape. This may be a result of high gas column densities combined with burstier star-formation histories, which limit the time massive stars are able to clear channels through the gas for ionizing photons to escape.

### 282) [2505.07935](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07935v3): Amaryllis: a digital twin of the earliest galaxies in the Universe

<p> Mahsa Kohandel, Andrea Pallottini, Andrea Ferrara </p>
<p>
Synergies between JWST and ALMA are unveiling a population of bright, super-early (z&gt;10) galaxies, including systems like GS-z14-0 (z=14.2) and GHZ2 (z=12.3) with extreme FIR line ratios ([OIII] 88 um / [CII] 158 um &gt;3) that challenge galaxy formation models. To address this, we identify a synthetic analog of these sources, "Amaryllis", within the SERRA zoom-in simulations, and track its evolution from z=16 to z=7. During this period, Amaryllis grows from log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ~ 7.4 to 10.3, linking super-early progenitors to the massive galaxy population at the end of reionization. At z ~ 11.3, Amaryllis closely matches the observed properties of GS-z14-0, including M<sub>&sext;</sub>, SFR, and the luminosity of FIR ([OIII] 88 um) and UV (e.g. CIII] 1908) lines. We find that high [OIII]/[CII] ratios appear during short, merger-driven starburst episodes, when low metallicity (Z ~ 0.1 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) and high ionization conditions (U<sub>ion</sub> ~ 0.3) push the ISM far from equilibrium. These extreme FIR line ratios are thus transient and linked to major mergers that ignite strong ionized gas outflows. Strikingly, despite this dynamical activity, Amaryllis develops a rotation-supported gaseous disk (V/σ~ 4-6) by z ~ 11, while stars remain dispersion-dominated. This coexistence of ordered gas rotation and merger-driven disturbances occurs within a massive yet typical ΛCDM halo, enabling disk formation even at cosmic dawn.

JWST uncovered a large number of massive quiescent galaxies (MQGs) at z&gt;3, which theoretical models struggle to reproduce. Explaining the number density of such objects requires extremely high conversion efficiency of baryons into stars in early dark matter halos. Using stellar kinematics, we can investigate the processes shaping the mass assembly histories of MQGs. We present high-resolution JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy of GS-9209, a massive, compact quiescent galaxy at z=4.66 (log (M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=10.52 ± 0.06, R_eff=220 ± 20 pc). Full spectral fitting of the spatially resolved stellar continuum reveals a clear rotational pattern, yielding a spin parameter of λ_2R_eff=0.85 ± 0.10. This study suggests that at least a fraction of the earliest quiescent galaxies were fast rotators and that quenching was a dynamically gentle process, preserving the stellar disc even in highly compact objects. Using Jeans anisotropic modelling and assuming a NFW profile, we measure a dark matter fraction of f_DM (&lt;2R_eff) = 14.5^+6.0_-4.2 &percnt; . Our findings use stellar kinematics to confirm the massive nature of early quiescent galaxies, previously inferred from stellar population modelling. We suggest that GS-9209 has a similar structure to low-redshift `relic' galaxies. However, unlike relic galaxies which have bottom-heavy initial mass functions (IMF), the dynamically inferred mass-to-light ratio of GS-9209 is consistent with a Milky-Way like IMF. The kinematical properties of GS-9209 are different from those of z&lt;1 early-type galaxies and more similar to those of recently quenched post-starburst galaxies at z&gt;2.

<p>
We report on Chandra X-ray observations of four narrow-line quasar candidates at z~6, selected from the SHELLQs project, based on the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam survey. These objects are characterised by narrow (FWHM&lt;310 km/s), luminous (&gt;1e44 erg/s) Lya and faint UV continuum (M_1450 = -22 - -21), prompting us to examine whether they are obscured luminous AGN at the epoch of reionization. However, none of these objects were detected by Chandra, giving an upper limit to their rest-frame 2-10 keV luminosity (Lx) of 2e44 erg/s (2 sigma), assuming a spectral slope Gamma=2. Subsequent rest-frame optical spectroscopy of these objects by the JWST-NIRSpec, presented in a companion paper, show weak broad Balmer emission at the base of narrow cores. With the scaling relation for low-redshift AGN, the observed strong [OIII]5007 flux of these sources would predict Lx to be around 1e45 erg/s, which is well above the Chandra upper limits. These optical spectra and X-ray quietness are reminiscent of JWST-selected broad-line AGN. We attribute the weak broad Balmer emission to the broad-line regions hidden partially by optically-thick obscuring matter which also hides the optical and X-ray continuum emission from the accretion disc. Compton-thick obscuration, which would strongly suppress X-ray emission, could be due to a dense inter-stellar medium that is often present in galaxies at high redshifts. Alternatively, the same effect could be obtained from an inflated disc at the innermost radii in a supercritical accretion flow, when the disc is viewed at inclined angles.

### 285) [2505.02895](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02895v2): Abundant Population of Broad Hα Emitters in the GOODS-N Field Revealed by CONGRESS, FRESCO, and JADES

<p>
We present a spectroscopic search for broad Hα emitters at z≈3.7-6.5 in the GOODS-N field, utilizing JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopy from FRESCO and CONGRESS, complemented by JADES imaging. We identify 19 broad Hα emitters with FWHM&gt;1000 km/s at z≈4-5.5, including 9 new sources. The broad Hα luminosity function (LF) derived from our sample is consistent with those of other JWST-selected broad-line AGN reported in the literature. The black hole masses and AGN bolometric luminosities, inferred from the broad Hα components, indicate that most sources are accreting at ~10% of the Eddington limit. We derive their host stellar masses via SED fitting and find higher M_BH/M_* ratios relative to the local M_BH-M_* relations, consistent with previous studies. We find that 42% of the sample do not satisfy the widely-used color selection criteria for Little Red Dots (LRDs), with the majority of these sources lacking the characteristic steep rest-optical red slope, indicating that the LRD selection is highly incomplete when selecting AGN galaxies. A comparison of the average SEDs between our sample and LRDs selected in the same field reveals that the steep red slopes observed in some LRDs are likely due to line-boosting effects as previously suggested. Furthermore, we find that 68% of color-selected LRDs with Hα detections in the NIRCam/Grism spectra do not exhibit broad-line features. While the limited sensitivity of the grism spectra may hinder the detection of broad-line components in faint sources, our findings still highlight the enigmatic nature of the LRD population.

### 286) [2504.04683](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04683v2): Probing the Cosmic Reionization History with JWST: Gunn-Peterson and Lyα Damping Wing Absorption at 4.5 &lt; z &lt; 13

We present a statistical analysis of Lyα absorption using 581 galaxies at z=4.5&ndash;13 observed with multiple JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy programs, including JADES, UNCOVER, CEERS, and GO/DDT. We carefully construct composite spectra binned by redshift with homogeneous UV properties (UV magnitudes, UV slopes, and Lyα equivalent widths) and identify significant Lyα forest signals in galaxies at z~5&ndash;6, which diminish toward higher redshifts. We also find UV continuum breaks at rest-frame 1216 Å that soften beyond z≳6, confirming the effects of cosmic reionization through a self-consistent transition from Gunn-Peterson to Lyα damping wing absorption in galaxies. Fair comparisons of composite spectra with matched UV magnitudes and slopes across redshift reveal that UV-faint galaxies clearly show stronger Lyα absorption than UV-bright galaxies towards high redshift, providing insights into the topological evolution of reionization. We estimate Lyα transmission at the Gunn-Peterson trough and Lyα damping wing absorption by comparing the galaxy spectra to low-z (z~2-5) galaxy templates that include galactic and circumgalactic absorption and Lyα emission. Using these measurements together with reionization simulations, we derive volume average neutral hydrogen fractions of &langle; x_HI &rangle; = 0.00^+0.12_-0.00, 0.25^+0.10_-0.20, 0.65^+0.27_-0.35, 1.00^+0.00_-0.20, and 1.00^+0.00_-0.40 at z~5, 6, 7, 9, and 10, respectively. These values broadly align with a reionization history characterized by a rapid transition around z~7&ndash;8, consistent with Lyα emitter observations. While the physical driver of this rapid reionization remains unclear, it may involve the emergence of hidden AGN populations and/or the onset of Lyman-continuum escape from galaxies.

### 287) [2503.16595](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16595v4): Little red dots as young supermassive black holes in dense ionized cocoons

<p> V. Rusakov, D. Watson, G. P. Nikopoulos, G. Brammer, R. Gottumukkala, T. Harvey, K. E. Heintz, R. Damgaard, S. A. Sim, A. Sneppen, A. P. Vijayan, N. Adams, D. Austin, C. J. Conselice, C. M. Goolsby, S. Toft, J. Witstok </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered many compact galaxies at high redshift with broad hydrogen and helium lines, including the enigmatic population of little red dots (LRDs). The nature of these galaxies is debated and is attributed to supermassive black holes (SMBHs) or intense star formation. They exhibit unusual properties for SMBHs, such as black holes that are overmassive for their host galaxies and extremely weak X-ray and radio emission. Here we show that in most objects studied with the highest-quality JWST spectra, the lines are broadened by electron scattering with a narrow intrinsic core. The data require very high electron column densities and compact sizes (light days), which, when coupled with their high luminosities, can be explained only by SMBH accretion. The narrow intrinsic line cores imply black hole masses of 10^5-7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, two orders of magnitude lower than previous estimates. These are the lowest mass black holes known at high redshift, to our knowledge, and suggest a population of young SMBHs. They are enshrouded in a dense cocoon of ionized gas producing broad lines from which they are accreting close to the Eddington limit, with very mild neutral outflows. Reprocessed nebular emission from this cocoon dominates the optical spectrum, explaining most LRD spectral characteristics, including the weak radio and X-ray emission.

### 288) [2503.12019](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12019v3): Multi-copy Axion Transfer Function and Observational Implications of Effective de Broglie Scales

<p> Jiashuo Zhang, Tom Broadhurst, Jeremy Lim, Paloma Morilla, Sung Kei Li </p>
<p>
Ultra-light axions are viable fuzzy/wave-like dark matter (ψDM) candidates generically predicted by the String Axiverse paradigm with multiple particle copies, whereas most of the discussions/constraints on ψDM from astronomical observations to date are based on the assumption of a single particle copy. Here, we aim to complete this gap by exploring the generic multi-axion scenario motivated in the String Axiverse context, and investigate its astronomical implications in both the linear and nonlinear regimes. In the linear regime, with linear density perturbation analysis, we provide a simplified prescription for obtaining multi-copy axion transfer functions and also identify an "equivalence" among all axion copies owing to the mutual coupling to the gravitational potential. As a result of this 'equivalence', we argue the suppression to LSS is governed by an effective mass m_eff^-2=\sum_i w_i m_i^-2, with \ w_i\ being fractional contributions of different copies to the full cosmic dark matter density. In non-linear regime within galaxy halos, we show that similar notions of effective mass, with expressions provided, to govern the collective wave interference and hence determine the net stellar heating rates and the substructure-induced spread of JWST transients near critical curves. Distinctive to the multi-copy scenario, the effective mass within galaxy halos is generically anticipated to be radially decreasing following the stronger concentration of heavier copies to the galactic center. Such a spatial variation leads to radially increasing spreading scales for micro-lensed transients at different radial positions, a signature that may be tested with future JWST lensing observations.

### 289) [2503.04894](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04894v3): The THESAN-ZOOM project: central starbursts and inside-out quenching govern galaxy sizes in the early Universe

<p> William McClymont, Sandro Tacchella, Aaron Smith, Rahul Kannan, Ewald Puchwein, Josh Borrow, Enrico Garaldi, Laura Keating, Mark Vogelsberger, Oliver Zier, Xuejian Shen, Filip Popovic </p>
<p>
We explore the evolution of galaxy sizes at high redshift (3 &lt; z &lt; 13) using the high-resolution THESAN-ZOOM radiation-hydrodynamics simulations, focusing on the mass range of 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> &lt; M<sub>&ast;</sub> &lt; 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Our analysis reveals that galaxy size growth is tightly coupled to bursty star formation. Galaxies above the star-forming main sequence tend to form stars in a central starburst, which decreases their radial size. These galaxies quench inside-out, causing spatially extended star formation and increasing their radial size, leading to oscillatory behavior around the size-mass relation. Notably, we find a positive intrinsic size-mass relation at high redshift, consistent with observations but in tension with large-volume simulations. We attribute this discrepancy to the bursty star formation captured by our multi-phase interstellar medium framework, but missing from simulations using the effective equation-of-state approach with hydrodynamically decoupled feedback. We also find that the normalization of the size-mass relation follows a double power law as a function of redshift, with a break at z≈6, because the majority of galaxies at z &gt; 6 show rising star-formation histories, and therefore are in a compaction phase. We demonstrate that Hα emission is systematically extended relative to the UV continuum by a median factor of 1.7, consistent with recent JWST studies. However, in contrast to previous interpretations that link extended Hα sizes to inside-out growth, we find that Lyman-continuum (LyC) emission is spatially disconnected from Hα. Instead, a simple Strömgren sphere argument reproduces observed trends, suggesting that extreme LyC production during central starbursts is the primary driver of extended nebular emission.

Pirzkal, G. Yang </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revolutionizing our understanding of the Universe by unveiling faint, near-infrared dropouts previously beyond our reach, ranging from exceptionally dusty sources to galaxies up to redshift z ~ 14. In this paper, we identify F200W-dropout objects in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey which are absent from existing catalogs. Our selection method can effectively identify obscured low-mass (log M_* ≤ 9) objects at z ≤ 6, massive dust-rich sources up to z ~ 12, and ultra-high-redshift (z &gt; 15) candidates. Primarily relying on NIRCam photometry from the latest CEERS data release and supplementing with Mid-Infrared/(sub-)mm data when available, our analysis pipeline combines multiple SED-fitting codes, star formation histories, and CosMix - a novel tool for astronomical stacking. Our work highlights three 2&lt;z&lt;3 dusty dwarf galaxies which have larger masses compared to the typical dusty dwarfs previously identified in CEERS. Additionally, we reveal five faint sources with significant probability of lying above z&gt;15, with best-fit masses compatible with ΛCDM and a standard baryons-to-star conversion efficiency. Their bi-modal redshift probability distributions suggest they could also be z&lt;1.5 dwarf galaxies with extreme dust extinction. We also identify a strong line emitter galaxy at z ~ 5 mimicking the near-infrared emission of a z ~ 13 galaxy. Our sample holds promising candidates for future follow-ups. Confirming ultra high-redshift galaxies or lower-z dusty dwarfs will offer valuable insights into early galaxy formation, evolution with their central black holes and the nature of dark matter, and/or cosmic dust production mechanisms in low-mass galaxies, and will help us to understand degeneracies and contamination in high-z object searches.

### 291) [2501.09854](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09854v2): Chasing the Light: Shadowing, Collimation, and the Super-Eddington Growth of Infant Black Holes in JWST BLAGNs

<p> Piero Madau </p>
<p>
Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered a substantial population of high-redshift broad-line active galactic nuclei (BLAGNs) characterized by moderate luminosities, weak X-ray emissions, and faint high-ionization lines. We propose that a subset of these BLAGNs, the so-called "Little Blue Dots'' (LBDs) are accreting at super-Eddington rates and use geometrically thick, non-advective disk models to investigate photon scattering and shadowing within the polar funnel. Our models predict extremely-blue optical-UV continuum slopes and highly collimated radiation fields where isotropic-equivalent luminosities exceed the Eddington limit in the polar direction while shadowing suppresses emission at higher inclinations. This "searchlight" configuration naturally generates a stratified ionization structure: coronal and high-excitation narrow lines are produced along the symmetry axis, while the equatorial broad-line region (BLR) remains shielded from the hardest ionizing photons. We show that the anisotropic illumination of the BLR explains the observed faintness of high-ionization lines despite strong Balmer emission. For M_BH=10^7.5&ndash;10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> accretors at Eddington ratio ~10, standard BLR conditions predict HeII lambda 4686/Hbeta in the range 0.08&ndash;0.28. Notably, because inherently blue disk spectra provide a much higher ratio of ionizing to optical photons than standard quasar composites, the observed large Balmer equivalent widths are matched with typical BLR covering factors without invoking enshrouded geometries. Taken together, these findings support the view that super-Eddington accretion flows, shaped by thick disk geometries, may naturally account for the ionizing SED and emission line diagnostics of high-z LBDs, while offering a plausible pathway to rapid black hole growth at cosmic dawn.

<p>
We present JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of the z=7.152 galaxy system B14-65666, as part of the GA-NIFS survey. Line and continuum emission in this massive system (log10(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/Msol)=9.8+/-0.2) is resolved into two strong cores surrounded by diffuse emission, as seen in recent JWST/NIRCam imaging. Our dataset contains detections of [OII]3726,3729, [NeIII]3869,3968, Balmer lines, [OIII]4959,5007, HeI5875, and weak [OIII]4363. Each spectrum is fit with a model that consistently incorporates interstellar medium conditions (i.e., electron temperature, Te, electron density, ne, and colour excess, E(B-V)). The resulting line fluxes are used to constrain the gas-phase metallicity (Zg~0.2-0.3 solar) and HBeta-based SFR for each region. Common line ratio diagrams (O32-R23, R3-R2, Ne3O2-R23) reveal that each line-emitting region lies at the intersection of low- and high-redshift galaxies, suggesting low ionisation and higher metallicity compared to the predominantly lower-mass galaxies studied with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU so far at z&gt;5.5. Spaxel-by-spaxel fits reveal evidence for both narrow (FWHM&lt;400 km s-1) and broad (FWHM&gt;500 km s-1) line emission, the latter of which likely represents tidal interaction or outflows. Comparison to ALMA [CII]158um and [OIII]88um data shows a similar velocity structure, and we explore optical-far-infrared diagnostics. The two core galaxies both lie on the mass-metallicity relation at z&gt;4, but show contrasting properties (e.g., M<sub>&sext;</sub>, Zg), suggesting distinct evolutionary pathways. Combining the NIRSpec IFU and ALMA datasets, our analysis opens new windows into the merging system B14-65666.

### 293) [2412.00182](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00182v2): Investigating cosmic strings using large-volume hydrodynamical simulations in the context of JWST's massive UV-bright galaxies

<p> Sonja M. Koehler, Hao Jiao, Rahul Kannan </p>
<p>
Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered an unexpectedly large abundance of massive, UV-bright galaxies at high redshifts, presenting a significant challenge to established galaxy formation models within the standard ΛCDM cosmological framework. Cosmic strings, predicted by a wide range of particle physics theories beyond the Standard Model, provide a promising potential explanation for these observations. They may act as additional gravitational seeds in the early universe, enhancing the process of high-redshift structure formation, potentially resulting in a more substantial population of massive, efficiently star-forming galaxies. We numerically investigate this prediction in large-volume hydrodynamical simulations using the moving-mesh code AREPO and the well-tested IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model. We evaluate the simulation results in the context of recent JWST data and find that sufficiently energetic cosmic strings produce UV luminosity and stellar mass functions that are in slightly to substantially better agreement with observations at high redshifts. Moreover, we observe that the halos seeded by cosmic strings exhibit a greater efficiency of star formation and enhanced central concentrations. Interestingly, our findings indicate that the simulations incorporating cosmic strings converge with those from a baseline ΛCDM model by redshift z ~ 6. This convergence suggests that the modified cosmological framework effectively replicates the successful predictions of the standard ΛCDM model at lower redshifts, where observational constraints are significantly stronger. Our results provide compelling evidence that cosmic strings may play a crucial role in explaining the galaxy properties observed by JWST at high redshifts while maintaining consistency with well-established models at later epochs.

<p> Harley Katz, Martin P. Rey, Corentin Cadiou, Taysun Kimm, Oscar Agertz </p>
<p>
We introduce MEGATRON, a new galaxy formation model for cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations of high-redshift galaxies. The model accounts for the non-equilibrium chemistry and heating/cooling processes of ≥ 80 atoms, ions, and molecules, coupled to on-the-fly radiation transfer. We apply the model in a cosmological setting to the formation of a 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> halo at z=6, and run 25 realizations at pc-scale resolution, varying numerous parameters associated with our state-of-the-art star formation, stellar feedback, and chemical enrichment models. We show that the overall budget of feedback energy is the key parameter that controls star formation regulation at high redshift, with other numerical parameters (e.g. supernova clustering, star formation conditions) having a more limited impact. As a similar feedback model has been shown to produce realistic z=0 galaxies, our work demonstrates that calibration at z=0 does not guarantee strong regulation of star formation at high-redshift. Interestingly, we find that subgrid model variations that have little impact on the final z=6 stellar mass can lead to substantial changes on the observable properties of high-redshift galaxies. For example, different star formation models based on, e.g. density thresholds or turbulence inspired criteria, lead to fundamentally distinct nebular emission line ratios across the interstellar medium (ISM). These results highlight the ISM as an important resource for constraining models of star formation, feedback, and galaxy formation in the JWST era, where emission line measurements for &gt;1,000 high-redshift galaxies are now available.

<p> Georgios Panagiotis Nikopoulos, Pratika Dayal </p>
<p>
Recent observations by the James Webb Telescope (JWST) have unveiled numerous galaxy candidates between z ~ 9 - 16.5, hinting at an over-abundance of sources at the bright-end of the UV Luminosity Function (UV LF) at z ≳ 11. Complementarily, the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA) has started yielding dust mass estimates at z ~ 5 - 7. In this work, we develop an analytic formalism baselined against the latest ALMA results, jointly exploring the impact of bursty star formation and its associated dust enrichment, on the visibility of early galaxies, while also modelling sources scattered off the main sequence of star formation. We incorporate dust production in type II Supernovae, dust destruction, ejection, growth and sputtering. Our key results are: (i) explaining the UV LF at z ~ 5 - 13 requires an average star formation efficiency that evolves as f_*(z) = 10^0.13z-3.5, with a number of observations exceeding this main sequence by a factor of 10. (ii) The dust enrichment of early systems is driven by dust production in SNII ejecta, while growth and sputtering impact the dust mass by 60&percnt; and 40&percnt; respectively at z ~ 7. (iii) galaxies at z ≳ 9 can retain significant dust, reaching average dust-to-stellar mass ratios of 0.19&percnt; (0.14&percnt;) at z ~ 9 (z ~ 11). Dust attenuation decreases with redshift as dust becomes more dispersed within halos. (iv) observations by ALMA at z ~ 5 and 7 are not representative of the average population that makes up the UV LF.

<p> Danial Langeroodi, Jens Hjorth </p>
<p>
We introduce genesis-metallicity, a gas-phase metallicity measurement python software employing the direct and strong-line methods depending on the available oxygen lines. The non-parametric strong-line estimator is calibrated based on a kernel density estimate in the 4-dimensional space of O2 = [O II]λλ3727,29/Hβ; O3 = [O III]λ5007/Hβ; Hβ equivalent width EW(Hβ); and gas-phase metallicity 12 + log(O/H). We use a calibration sample of 1510 galaxies at 0 &lt; z &lt; 10 with direct-method metallicity measurements, compiled from the JWST/NIRSpec and ground-based observations. In particular, we report 122 new NIRSpec direct-method metallicity measurements at z &gt; 1. We show that the O2, O3, and EW(Hβ) measurements are sufficient for a gas-phase metallicity estimate that is more accurate than 0.09 dex. Our calibration is universal, meaning that its accuracy does not depend on the target redshift. Furthermore, the direct-method module employs a non-parametric T_e(O II) electron temperature estimator based on a kernel density estimate in the 5-dimensional space of O2, O3, EW(Hβ), T_e(O III), and T_e(O II). This T_e(O II) estimator is calibrated based on 1004 spectra with detections of both [O III]λ4363 and [O II]λλ7320,30, notably reporting 20 new NIRSpec detections of the [O II]λλ7320,30 doublet. We make genesis-metallicity and its calibration data publicly available and commit to keeping both up-to-date in light of the incoming data.

<p>
We present new results on the rest-frame UV luminosity function (UVLF) and stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratio of bright (M_UV≲-20 mag) spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at z=7-9 derived from the BoRG-JWST survey, a unique data set of NIRSpec prism follow up of HST-selected sources from random-pointing imaging. By selecting galaxies from over 200 independent sight lines, the survey minimizes cosmic variance ensuring a statistically robust sample of the bright-galaxy population during the epoch of reionization. The data is used to constrain, for the first time, the bright end of the UVLF at z=7-9 from spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies over eight independent fields. We find that the bright end of the UVLF is higher than found using imaging over JWST legacy fields, suggesting the latter may be significantly affected by cosmic variance, and thus reducing the tension with recent findings from JWST at z&gt;10 and comparable to models invoking little dust attenuation and bursty star formation. Additionally, we use the galaxies' JWST spectra to infer their stellar masses and M/L ratios relative to other HST and JWST studies. We show that the stellar mass scales almost linearly with UV luminosity (M_* &prop; L_UV^0.85±0.12), albeit with large (~0.5 dex) intrinsic scatter, consistent with stochastic bursts of star formation in early galaxy formation.

### 298) [2406.11188](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11188v2): Characterizing Dust Extinction and Spatially Resolved Paschen-α Emission within 97 Galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;1.6 with JWST NIRCam Slitless Spectroscopy

We present results on the Paschen-α (Paα) emitting galaxies observed as part of the JWST FRESCO survey in the GOODS-North and GOODS-South fields. Utilizing the JWST NIRCam wide field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS), we analyze emission line fluxes, star formation rates (SFRs), and spatially resolved flux distributions of 97 Paα emitters at 1&lt;z&lt;1.6. To assess dust extinction within our sample, we combine Paα fluxes with archival Hα data taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3 G141 grism. Our analysis reveals a significant correlation between dust extinction and galaxy stellar mass, where more massive galaxies exhibit greater dust extinction. We employ two-dimensional Paα and F444W mapping to trace the distributions of star formation and stellar mass, respectively. Our observations indicate that lower mass galaxies are almost dust free in Paα and exhibit smaller sizes both in star formation and underlying stellar continuum. In contrast, galaxies with a stellar mass greater than 10^9.5M<sub>&odot;</sub> display diverse dust extinction and star formation patterns. This variation suggests that the structures and properties of massive galaxies evolve through different phases, which involve, e.g., star formation in massive clumps, compaction, and inside-out quenching. This study demonstrates the capabilities of JWST WFSS in conducting systematic investigations of emission line galaxies and highlights the pivotal role of Paα in advancing our understanding of dust extinction and obscured star formation in the early universe.

### 299) [2402.17140](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17140v3): Direct Detection of Dark Photon Dark Matter with the James Webb Space Telescope

In this study, we propose an investigation into dark photon dark matter (DPDM) within the infrared frequency band, utilizing highly sensitive infrared light detectors commonly integrated into space telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The presence of DPDM induces electron oscillations in both the reflectors and the interior of the detectors. Consequently, these oscillating electrons can emit monochromatic electromagnetic waves with a frequency almost equivalent to the mass of DPDM. By employing the stationary phase approximation, we can demonstrate that when the size of the reflector significantly exceeds the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave, the contribution to the electromagnetic wave field at a given position primarily stems from the surface unit perpendicular to the relative position vector. This simplification results in the reduction of electromagnetic wave calculations to ray optics. Through a careful analysis of photon generation induced by DPDM on the various optical elements of JWST, we find that the contribution of these photons to the detected signal is negligible. Nevertheless, we propose a modified configuration of the JWST mirrors that would enable the DPDM-induced photons to be focused onto the detector. This approach can be applied to future space telescopes during their ground-testing phases. Using the JWST parameters as a representative example, the achievable upper limits on the DPDM-photon mixing constant are ε~ 10^-12-10^-14 in the frequency range 10-500~THz at the 95&percnt; confidence level. This reveals the strong potential of future space telescopes for DPDM detection during ground testing, with sensitivities exceeding current limits by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude compared with the XENON1T result and the solar cooling bound.

### 300) [2311.15447](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15447v3): WISDOM project &ndash; XVIII. Molecular gas distributions and kinematics of three megamaser galaxies

The co-evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) underpins our understanding of galaxy evolution, but different methods to measure SMBH masses have only infrequently been cross-checked. We attempt to identify targets to cross-check two of the most accurate methods, megamaser and cold molecular gas dynamics. Three promising galaxies are selected from all those with existing megamaser SMBH mass measurements. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) 12CO(2-1) and 230-GHz continuum observations with angular resolutions of about 0.5". Every galaxy has an extended rotating molecular gas disc and 230-GHz continuum source(s), but all also have irregularities and/or non-axisymmetric features: NGC1194 is highly inclined and has disturbed and lopsided central 12CO(2-1) emission; NGC3393 has a nuclear disc with fairly regular but patchy 12CO(2-1) emission with little gas near the kinematic major axis, faint emission in the very centre and two brighter structures reminiscent of a nuclear ring and/or spiral; NGC5765B has a strong bar and very bright 12CO(2-1) emission concentrated along two bisymmetric offset dust lanes and two bisymmetric nuclear spiral arms. 12CO(2-1) and 12CO(3-2) observations with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope are compared with the ALMA observations. Because of the disturbed gas kinematics and the impractically long integration times required for higher angular resolution observations, none of the three galaxies is suitable for a future SMBH mass measurement. Nonetheless, increasing the number of molecular gas observations of megamaser galaxies is valuable, and the ubiquitous disturbances suggest a link between large-scale gas properties and the existence of megamasers.
