<p>
We present JWST/NIRSpec PRISM observations of a robust galaxy candidate at z≃14, selected from pure-parallel NIRCam imaging; PAN-z14-1. The NIRSpec spectrum allows confirmation of this source at z<sub>spec</sub>=13.53^+0.05_-0.06 through modeling of the Lyman-α break. PAN-z14-1 is the fourth most distant galaxy known to date and is extremely luminous (M_UV=-20.6±0.2), with a blue UV-continuum slope (β=-2.26±0.08) and a large physical size (r_c=233±10  pc). We fail to detect any rest-frame UV emission lines at ≥ 2σ significance, with upper limits sufficiently constraining to exclude the possibility of strong line emission. In terms of its physical properties, PAN-z14-1 is remarkably similar to the previously confirmed z<sub>spec</sub>=14.18 galaxy GS-z14-0. The lack of strong emission lines and large physical size is consistent with an emerging picture of two potentially distinct galaxy populations at z&gt;10, distinguished by star-formation rate surface density. In this scenario, PAN-z14-1 is a second example of a "normal'', extended, luminous, star-forming galaxy at z ≃ 14, and differs markedly from the other class of extremely compact galaxies with strong emission lines recently uncovered at extreme redshifts with JWST. These results highlight the importance of further spectroscopic confirmation of z&gt;10 galaxy candidates in order to fully understand the diversity of properties displayed by the first galaxies.

### 2) [2601.11466](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11466v1): Pseudo Little Red Dot: an Active Black Hole Embedded in a Dense and Dusty, Metal-Poor Starburst Galaxy at z=5.96

<p> Karina I. Caputi, Ryan A. Cooper, Pierluigi Rinaldi, Rafael Navarro-Carrera, Edoardo Iani </p>
<p>
We present a study of Pseudo-LRD-NOM (Pseudo little red dot with no metal lines), a highly magnified low-mass galaxy behind the lensing cluster Abell 370 at z=5.96. We classify this object as a pseudo-LRD because its red rest-frame optical colour is mainly driven by a prominent Halpha line (with EW0 &gt;~ 800 Angstroms) present in its JWST NIRSpec spectrum. Halpha is dominated by a narrow component and also has a minor broad component indicative of an active black hole with M_BH = 2.9x10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. A narrow Hbeta emission line is also detected (with S/N = 8), producing a Balmer decrement (narrow) Halpha/Hbeta = 11. The rest-frame UV spectral slope is beta_UVspec = -1.2. All these features can be ascribed to high dust attenuation. However, no [OIII]5007 or any other metal lines are detected in the spectrum, so [OIII]5007/Hbeta &lt; 0.25, at odds with a simple dust-attenuation explanation. Accounting for all the spectral properties requires the model of a starburst with moderate colour excess E(B-V)=0.18-0.45, high gas density (n_H &gt;~ 10^6 cm^-3) and extremely low gas/stellar metallicities (Z = 0.01-0.1 Zsun). The demagnified stellar mass is 1.62^+1.54_-0.79 x10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and the stellar-mass surface density is Sigma* = 418^+725_-310 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/pc^2, similar to that of massive/nuclear star clusters. Pseudo-LRD-NOM provides evidence of massive black-hole growth occurring in a high-density, dusty starburst which is at the early stages of its chemical enrichment, and is likely a precursor to a real LRD.

### 3) [2601.11434](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11434v1): FEAST: Probing Hierarchical Star Formation with the Spatial Distributions of Young Star Clusters

Faustino Vieira, Max Hamilton, Kelsey Johnson, Thomas S. -Y Lai, Sean T. Linden, Subhransu Maji, Matteo Messa, Göran Östlin, Alex Pedrini, E. Sabbi, Linda J. Smith </p>
<p>
We apply the angular two-point correlation function (TPCF) to the spatial distribution of young star clusters (YSCs) in four nearby star forming galaxies (NGC 628, NGC 4449, M51, and M83) in order to investigate their underlying hierarchical structuring. Using newly constructed catalogs of YSCs in the emerging phase (eYSCs), identified in the infrared with JWST, and optical YSCs detected in archival HST data, we compute TPCFs for various cluster samples and age bins across the four galaxies as part of the FEAST (Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic Star ClusTers) program. We find clear evidence of hierarchical structuring, especially in eYSCs and YSCs with ages &lt; 10 Myr (referred to as oYSCs), which show similar TPCFs within each galaxy. NGC 628 exhibits a clear distinction between the TPCFs of eYSCs and oYSCs, implying a shorter randomization timescale. In contrast, clusters aged 10 to 300 Myr exhibit progressively more random spatial distributions, becoming effectively random after ~ 100 Myr, consistent with earlier studies. The two-dimensional fractal index D_2 of the YSCs underlying distribution is calculated from model fits to TPCFs. Our values of D_2 derived from the youngest YSC populations align better with the expected value of D_2 ~ 1.3 for a universal star formation process compared to previous findings.

### 4) [2601.11125](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11125v1): Discovery of a gas-enshrouded broad-line AGN at z ~ 7

<p> Qianqiao Zhou, Xin Wang, Hang Zhou, Emanuele Daddi, Luis C. Ho, Shengzhe Wang, Ruancun Li, Zuyi Chen, Cheng Cheng, Xihan Ji, Yuxuan Pang, Mengting Ju </p>
<p>
The Lyman-alpha (Lyα) absorption profile in star-forming galaxies serves as a powerful tracer of the extended, dense neutral hydrogen in their surroundings during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). We report a unique galaxy, A2744-z7DLA, at z≈ 6.87 gravitationally lensed by the foreground galaxy cluster Abell 2744, which exhibits both moderate Lyα emission and damped Lyα absorption, suggesting the presence of a dense neutral hydrogen environment. Our analysis suggests that the UV continuum turnover near Lyα is more likely shaped by a damped Lyα system rather than nebular continuum from two photon process. We analyze the physical properties of A2744-z7DLA with spectroscopic and photometric data from the JWST and the HST. The galaxy shows a compact morphology (r_e ~ 0.3 kpc) and a broadened Hα emission line, suggesting possible AGN activity. The broad component of Hα has a FWHM of 2721 ± 200 km s<sup>-1</sup>, corresponding to a black hole mass of M_BH=2.90^+2.35_-1.28× 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and a black hole-to-stellar mass ratio of log (M_BH/M_stellar) = -1.58^+0.45_-0.34. The Balmer decrement (Hα/Hβ) yields a dust attenuation of A_V ≈ 1.15 ± 0.23, indicating that this system is less dust-rich than some "little red dots". Furthermore, we perform SED fitting using both stellar and AGN models. The results show that the UV and optical wavelengths are dominated by star-forming regions, while the AGN component contributes primarily at longer wavelengths. This work provides new insights into the interplay between star formation, neutral gas, and potential AGN activity in galaxies during the EoR.

### 5) [2601.11092](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11092v1): Emission-line Diagnostics at z≳ 2: A Probe of the Ionizing Spectrum and α Enhancement Beyond Cosmic Noon

<p> Leonardo Clarke, Natalie Lam, Alice E. Shapley, Michael W. Topping, Gabriel B. Brammer, Ryan L. Sanders, Naveen A. Reddy, Shreya Karthikeyan </p>
<p>
We analyze several key rest-optical emission-line ratios in a sample of 763 galaxies as well as composite spectra from JADES DR3 in the range 1.4 &lt; z &lt; 7. These emission-line ratios include: [O III]&lambda;5008/Hβ, [N II]λ6585/Hα, [S II]λλ6718,6733/Hα, [O I]λ6302/Hα, O32, R23, Ne3O2, and RO2Ne3. We find evidence for a harder ionizing spectrum at z~ 3.5 compared to z~ 2 at fixed gas-phase metallicity, resulting in a pronounced shift in the star-forming galaxy locus on the [N II]/Hα BPT diagram and the O32 vs. R23 diagram. At z≳ 3.5, star-forming galaxies occupy a common locus, indicating that ISM ionizing conditions at fixed gas-phase metallicity do not evolve strongly at these early cosmic times. There is a connection between ISM ionizing conditions and the chemical abundance patterns (i.e., α/Fe) in massive stars providing the ionizing radiation field. Therefore, the lack of evolution in ISM ionizing conditions at z≳ 3.5, followed by evolution towards a softer ionizing spectrum at fixed nebular metallicity as cosmic time proceeds to z~ 2 and lower redshift mirrors the chemical abundance patterns in Milky Way stars as a function of iron abundance. Our results highlight the diagnostic power of emission-line diagrams in the era of JWST to further our understanding of the ISM conditions into the Epoch of Reionization.

### 6) [2601.11068](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11068v1): A Portrait of the Cosmic Reionisation History in the Context of the Early Dark Energy Model

<p> Weiyang Liu, Xin Wang, Hu Zhan, Karl Glazebrook, Mengtao Tang, Michele Trenti </p>
<p>
Recent JWST observations of Lyman-α emission at z ~ 11-6 indicate a rapid reionization of the intergalactic medium within the first ~700 Myr. The required Lyman continuum (LyC) photon budget may naturally arise from the unexpectedly high galaxy number densities revealed by JWST, reducing the need for scenarios invoking very high LyC escape fractions (f<sub>esc</sub>≳0.2) or dominant contributions from ultra-faint galaxies (M_UV&gt;-15) in the standard ΛCDM framework. In this work, we model the reionization history under the Early Dark Energy (EDE) paradigm &ndash; originally proposed to ease the Hubble tension &ndash; which also explains the observed over-abundance of high-z galaxies without extreme star formation efficiencies. The EDE model yields reionization histories consistent with current constraints while requiring only moderate LyC escape fractions and UV luminosity densities (f<sub>esc</sub>~ 0.05-0.1, M_UV≲ -17 to -15). Our results suggest that, once key astrophysical parameters are better constrained, the reionization history could serve as an independent and complementary probe of EDE cosmologies.

### 7) [2601.11011](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11011v1): CHILES XI: Resolved HI morphologies and the evolution of the H2/HI ratio over the last five billion years

<p>
We present the neutral gas morphology of four galaxies from z = 0.22 to 0.47 obtained with the COSMOS HI Large Extragalactic Survey (CHILES). The HI is resolved at the highest redshift with the 7.5 arcsec beam of CHILES and 43 kpc linear scale, with all four galaxies having extended HI. Three are massive galaxies (Mstellar &gt; 3 e10 Mo), with HI masses of 1.6 - 6.7 e10 Mo, and active star formation (3 - 30 Mo/yr). The morphology and kinematics of the galaxies vary from regular to disturbed, including an asymmetric HI disk surrounding the fourth smaller galaxy (Mstellar ~ e9 Mo). CO(1-0) observations of the sample, obtained with the LMT, confirm the redshifts of three of the four galaxies and we derive H2 masses of 0.4 - 5.2 e10 Mo. JWST imaging with four combined NIRCam filters reveals disturbed stellar components with compact knots in two of the galaxies. We combine our new higher-redshift galaxies with previously published observations to conduct a more complete study of HI and H2 evolution in the redshift range 0 - 0.5. With our HI flux-limited observations compared to similar lower redshift galaxies with high stellar mass (Mstellar &gt; e10 Mo), the results show the mean H2/HI ratio at the highest redshift is 10.3 +- 3.4 larger than the mean H2/HI ratio in the local Universe.

<p>
The transient and variable optical sky is relatively poorly characterised on fast (&lt;1 hr) timescales. With the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), the Deeper, Wider, Faster programme (DWF) probes a unique parameter space with its deep (median of g~22.2 AB mag), minute-cadence imaging. In this work, we present DWF's first data release which comprises high cadence photometry extracted from ~12000 images and 166 hours of telescope time. We present a novel data processing pipeline, ttdwf-postpipe, developed to identify sources and extract their light curves. The accuracy of the photometry is assessed by cross-matching to public catalogues. In addition, we injected a population of synthetic GRB afterglows into a subset of the DWF DECam imaging to compare the efficiency of our pipeline with a standard difference imaging approach. Both pipelines show performance and reliably recover injected transients with peak magnitudes g&lt;22 AB mag with an efficiency of 97.24^+0.7_-1.0 percent for ttdwf-postpipe and 96.14^+0.9_-1.1 percent for a difference imaging approach. However, we find that ttdwf-postpipe is less likely to recover transients appearing in galaxies that are brighter or comparable in brightness to the transient itself. To demonstrate the power of the data in this release, we conduct a search for uncatalogued variable stars in a single night of DWF DECam imaging and find ten pulsating variables, two eclipsing binaries and one ZZ ceti. We also conduct a search for variable phenomena in the Chandra Deep Field South, a Rubin deep drilling field, and identify two flares from likely UV ceti type stars.

### 9) [2601.10573](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10573v1): Origins of the UV continuum and Balmer emission lines in Little Red Dots: observational validation of dense gas envelope models enshrouding the AGN

<p> Yoshihisa Asada, Kohei Inayoshi, Qinyue Fei, Seiji Fujimoto, Chris Willott </p>
<p>
We present a statistical study on the origins of the UV continuum and narrow/broad emission lines in little red dots (LRDs), a newly discovered class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Leveraging all archived JWST/NIRSpec data, we build a sample of 28 spectroscopically-confirmed LRDs at 5&lt;z<sub>spec</sub>&lt;7.2, by requiring broad Hα emission, blue UV colors, V-shaped continua, and compact morphologies. We define a control sample of 9 blue, compact, broad-line AGNs without red optical continua (hereafter little blue dots; LBDs), and examine correlations between rest UV and the narrow/broad Hα luminosities in these populations. In LRDs, both narrow and broad Hα components are tightly correlated with the UV continuum, and the luminosity ratios are consistent with those in young starburst galaxies. In contrast, the UV to broad Hα ratios in LBDs closely match local unobscured AGNs and are statistically different from LRDs. The Lyα occurrence rates and strengths do not differ between LRDs and LBDs and are comparable to normal star-forming galaxies. These results are consistent with a scenario where the central BH in LRDs is enshrouded by a dense opaque gas envelope &ndash; in this model, the UV continuum as well as narrow and even broad Hα emissions are not powered by AGNs but predominantly by young massive stars surrounding the envelope, while the envelope radiates as a ~ 5000 K blackbody. As the envelope dissipates, direct AGN emission can emerge, potentially transforming LRDs into LBDs and marking the end of a short-lived phase of rapid black hole growth.

### 10) [2601.10372](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10372v1): Active Galactic Nuclei and STaR fOrmation in Nearby Galaxies (AGNSTRONG). II: Results for Jetted Type-I AGNs with Strong Ionized Gas Outflows

<p> Chen Qin, Huynh Anh N. Le, Yongquan Xue, Shifu Zhu, Xiaozhi Lin, Kim Ngan Nhat Nguyen </p>
<p>
We investigate the correlation between ionized gas outflows, jets, and star formation in a sample of 42 local type-I active galactic nuclei (AGNs) exhibiting significant [O III] outflows. This study uses both new submillimeter (sub-mm) observations and archival data from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. Our analysis, which includes a correction for jet emission in the sub-mm bands, fitting spectral energy distribution, and analyzing spectra, enables us to derive star-formation rates (SFRs) through various methods. By comparing radio power and SFRs, we select a sub-sample of jetted AGNs of which radio emission is mostly from the jets. We find that jetted AGNs predominantly lie above the main sequence of star-forming galaxies, suggesting a correlation between jet activity and star formation. By comparing dust extinction, we demonstrate that jetted AGNs do not have more dust which is the fuel of both star formation and AGN activity. Therefore, this correlation is more likely to arise from AGN feedback. We also find that the Eddington ratio does not impact the specific SFRs (sSFRs) of our sample. Additionally, for jetted AGNs, stronger radio emission corresponds to higher sSFRs, suggesting that jet emission may promote star formation, i.e., positive feedback. Our results not only shed light on the feedback mechanisms of AGNs but also underscore the complex interplay between black hole activity and star formation in galaxy evolution.

### 11) [2601.10304](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10304v1): Effect of Primordial Black Holes on the global 21-cm signal

<p> Atrideb Chatterjee </p>
<p>
The 21-cm global signal, a treasure trove of information about the nature of the first luminous sources of the Universe, has traditionally been modelled assuming that these early sources were predominantly star-forming galaxies. However, recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed several AGNs as early as z ~ 10 - 10.4 . In light of this, it is important to investigate the contribution of such AGNs to the 21-cm signal. Assuming that these AGNs are seeded by Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and employing an analytical PBH model, consistent with existing cosmological and astrophysical constraints, we show that these exotic objects can have a significant impact on the redshift evolution of the global signal.

### 12) [2601.10097](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10097v1): Caught in Swallowtails: Discovery of Two Swallowtail Image Formations in MS 0451.6-0305

<p> Ashish K. Meena, Wenlei Chen, Lukas J. Furtak, Johan Richard, Adi Zitrin, Jose M. Diego, Mathilde Jauzac, Patrick L. Kelly, Rogier A. Windhorst </p>
<p>
We report the discovery of two swallowtail image formations at z=2.91 and z=6.70 behind the galaxy cluster MS 0451.6-0305 in JWST-NIRCam imaging. We find that in both of the above lensed systems, the complex image morphology cannot be reproduced by simple fold/cusp caustics, and detailed lens modeling reveals higher-order swallowtail caustic configurations. In the z=2.91 lens system, a small part of the source galaxy (which itself is part of a galaxy group) containing atleast two compact knots sits inside the swallowtail caustic, producing a quadruply imaged arc. At two of the image positions of these knots, we infer point source magnifications of ≳ 300, implying lensing-corrected effective radii of ≲ 0.8-1.5 pc. The z=6.70 system exhibits even more complex image formation. We therefore only use the most confidently identified counter-images of knots in this system as constraints in our lens modeling. The resulting model predicts magnifications ~20-200 and lensing-corrected effective radii of ≲ 0.8-18.5 pc for various knots. Together, these two systems represent the first example of observations of multiple swallowtail image formations in a single galaxy cluster and demonstrate the ability of swallowtail caustics to magnify individual substructures at sub-parsec scales, from intermediate redshifts to the first billion years of the Universe.

### 13) [2601.09948](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09948v1): Beyond UV: Rest-frame B-band and Apparent Luminosity Functions of z=5-9 Galaxies

<p> Nicha Leethochawalit, Takahiro Morishita, Tirawut Worrakitpoonpon, Michele Trenti </p>
<p>
We present new measurements of galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) from JWST/NIRCam imaging over the redshift range z=4.5-9.7, using photometric catalogs from JADES and public extragalactic fields. Our analysis includes rest-frame UV and B-band LFs, as well as apparent LFs in F090W, F115W, F200W, F356W, and F444W. We present the first constraints on the rest-frame B-band LF at z~7-8 and extend existing measurements at z~5 to M(B) = -18 mag. The B-band LFs evolve more strongly with redshift than UV LFs, though both decline more gradually than predicted by simulations at z&gt;5. No single existing simulation reproduces all observed trends, with discrepancies likely driven by assumptions about binary evolution and stellar population synthesis models. The apparent LFs in F356W and F444W show hints of a bright-end excess at all redshifts, extending to fainter magnitudes at higher redshift. While extreme emission line galaxies may partially account for it, the excess may also indicate a population of moderately red, optically bright sources - potentially dusty star-forming galaxies or obscured AGNs. Finally, we find that rest-frame B-band luminosity correlates more tightly with stellar mass than UV, making it a powerful tracer of mass assembly and reinforcing the diagnostic value of rest-frame optical LFs in uncovering the physical processes that drive early galaxy formation.

### 14) [2601.09810](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09810v1): Calibrating Mid-Infrared Emission Features As Diagnostics of Star Formation in Infrared-Luminous Galaxies via Radiative Transfer Modeling

<p>
Luminous infrared galaxies are key sites of obscured stellar mass assembly at z &gt; 0.5. Their star formation rates (SFRs) are often estimated using the luminosities of the 6.2 micron and 11.2 micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features, or those of the [Ne II] and [Ne III] fine-structure lines, as they are minimally affected by obscuration. It is uncertain whether the calibration of these features as SFR tracers depends on the starburst bolometric luminosity or the level of Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) activity. We here investigate the relationship between the luminosities of PAH and Neon lines with star formation rate for highly luminous objects using radiative transfer modeling and archival observations of 42 local Ultraluminous (≥ 10^12 L_sun) Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs). We find that PAH and [Ne II] features arise mainly in star-forming regions, with small contributions from the AGN or host, but that the [Ne III] line has a mixed contribution from both star formation and AGN activity. We present relations between L_PAH and L_NeII, and both starburst luminosity and SFR. We find relations for lower luminosity (L_IR ~= 10^10-10^12 L_sun) systems underestimate the SFRs in local ULIRGs by up to ~1 dex. The 6.2 micron and 11.2 micron PAH features, and the [Ne II] line, are thus good tracers of SFR in ULIRGs. We do not find that a more luminous AGN affects the relationship between SFR and PAH or Neon luminosity, but that it can make PAH emission harder to discern. Our results and derived relations are relevant to studies of star-forming and composite galaxies at z &lt; 3 with the James Webb Space Telescope.

### 15) [2601.09778](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09778v1): The X-Ray Dot: Exotic Dust or a Late-Stage Little Red Dot?

<p>
JWST's "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) are increasingly interpreted as active galactic nuclei (AGN) obscured by dense thermalized gas rather than dust as evidenced by their X-ray weakness, blackbody-like continua, and Balmer line profiles. A key question is how LRDs connect to standard UV-luminous AGN and whether transitional phases exist and if they are observable. We present the "X-Ray Dot" (XRD), a compact source at z=3.28 observed by the NIRSpec WIDE GTO survey. The XRD exhibits LRD hallmarks: a blackbody-like (T_eff ≃ 6400 K) red continuum, a faint but blue rest-UV excess, falling mid-IR emission, and broad Balmer lines (FWHM ~ 2700-3200 km s<sup>-1</sup>). Unlike LRDs, however, it is remarkably X-ray luminous (L_rm2-10 keV = 10^44.18 erg s<sup>-1</sup>) and has a continuum inflection that is bluewards of the Balmer limit. We find that the red rest-optical and blue mid-IR continuum cannot be reproduced by standard dust-attenuated AGN models without invoking extremely steep extinction curves, nor can the weak mid-IR emission be reconciled with well-established X-ray&ndash;torus scaling relations. We therefore consider an alternative scenario: the XRD may be an LRD in transition, where the gas envelope dominates the optical continuum but optically thin sightlines allow X-rays to escape. The XRD may thus provide a physical link between LRDs and standard AGN, offering direct evidence that LRDs are powered by supermassive black holes and providing insight into their accretion properties.

### 16) [2601.09644](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09644v1): A New Constraint on the Optical Depth from the Reionization History Independent of CMB Large-Scale E-Mode Polarization

<p> Yuta Kageura, Masami Ouchi, Fumihiro Naokawa, Hiroya Umeda, Akinori Matsumoto, Yuichi Harikane, Minami Nakane, Tran Thi Thai </p>
<p>
Recent studies report a mild discrepancy between baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements within the ΛCDM framework. This discrepancy could be explained if the optical depth τ inferred from the CMB large-scale E-mode polarization is underestimated, which may be biased by foreground-subtraction or instrumental systematics. In this work, we present a determination of τ independent of the large-scale E-mode polarization, using the latest measurements of the redshift evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction x_HI(z), which is constrained by Lyman-α forest and damping-wing absorption measurements at z~5-14, based on ground-based optical and JWST observations. Combining x_HI(z) with the Planck CMB power spectra excluding the large-scale E-mode polarization, we obtain τ=0.0552^+0.0019_-0.0026, a stringent constraint consistent with the previous CMB results including the large-scale E-mode. We also evaluate a potential systematic error in our method associated with absorption modeling, obtaining τ=0.0552^+0.0075_-0.0049. Using this constraint on τ, we resolve the degeneracy in the τ-Ω_m plane and find a 2.4σ tension with the DESI DR2 BAO results, thereby confirming the claimed mild discrepancy suggestive of physics beyond ΛCDM. Finally, we derive an upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses, Σm_ν&lt;0.0550 (0.0717) eV at the 95% (99%) confidence level. This limit favors the normal mass ordering and, when combined with the lower limits from neutrino oscillation experiments, yields a further constraint, Σm_ν=0.0594_-0.0007^+0.0113 eV. However, the cosmological upper limit and the oscillation-based lower limit show a mild 2.2σ tension, providing an independent indication of possible physics beyond ΛCDM.

<p>
We present observations of jets within 2000 au of three deeply embedded protostars using 2.9-27 micron observations with JWST. These observations show the morphologies and kinematics of the collimated jets from three protostars, the low-mass Class 0 protostars B335 and HOPS 153, and the intermediate-mass protostar HOPS 370. These jets are traced by shock-ionized fine-structure line emission observed with the JWST NIRSpec and MIRI IFUs. We find that [Fe II] emission traces the full extent of the inner 1000 to 2000 au of the jets, depending on distance to the protostar, while other ions mostly trace isolated shocked knots. The jets show evidence of wiggling motion in the plane of the sky as well as asymmetries between blue and red-shifted lobes. The widths of the jets increase non-monotonically with distance from the central protostar, with opening angles ranging from 2.1 degrees to &lt; 10.1 degrees for the three protostars in the sample. The jets have total velocities ranging from 147 to 184 km/s after correcting for disk inclination. For B335, an 8-month gap between NIRSpec and MIRI MRS observations enabled measurement of the tangential velocity of a shocked knot; in combination with the radial velocity, this shows that the jet has a different inclination than the outflow cavity. We find multiple knots before and during a recent outburst in B335, although the knots were more frequent during the burst. The asymmetries between blue- and red-shifted lobes strongly suggest complex interactions between the circumstellar disks and magnetic fields.

### 18) [2601.08939](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08939v1): One cloud is not enough: extreme conditions bias chemical abundances in high-redshift galaxies

<p>
Since its launch, JWST has opened an unprecedented opportunity to characterise the ionised ISM of high-redshift galaxies using well-established rest-frame UV/optical diagnostics from the local Universe. At the same time, these observations challenge the validity of such classical methods when applied to the extreme environments typical at high redshift. We present an in-depth analysis of the ISM in three representative case studies at z=2 - 6 (MARTA 4327, the Sunburst Arc and RXCJ2248-ID) conducted within a multi-cloud photoionisation modelling framework (HOMERUN). We show that even a small fraction of unresolved high-density clumps can contribute more than half of the observed flux of auroral lines, while only negligibly to standard optical density tracers. As a result, T_e-method metallicities can be underestimated by ~ 0.15 - 0.3 dex, as for MARTA 4327. By modelling rest-frame UV and optical data, we demonstrate that discrepancies between abundances obtained from diagnostics tracing different zones do not necessarily imply chemical inhomogeneities. In RXCJ2248-ID, the disagreement between UV and optical N/O may naturally arise from ionisation and density structure alone. In contrast, we find evidence for genuine chemical stratification in the Sunburst Arc, where a component enriched in nitrogen coexists with a chemically normal one. Finally, we argue that very-high-ionisation lines may be explained within a pure star-formation scenario invoking matter-bounded regions. However, in the case of RXCJ2248-ID, we cannot rule out a minor contribution from an AGN based solely on the observed fluxes. These results indicate that classical diagnostics can be significantly biased in high-redshift galaxies and that self-consistent, physically motivated tools are therefore essential to properly interpret the complex ISM conditions and chemical enrichment in the early Universe.

### 19) [2601.08936](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08936v1): A possible pathway to UHZ1-type systems at z~10 by heterogeneous mass primordial black holes as dark matter

<p> Alexander Kashlinsky, Fernando Atrio-Barandela, Diego Martín-González </p>
<p>
Recent space-based observations discovered several unusual objects, exhibiting similar properties, at redshifts z≳ 10. Among them is the UHZ1 system at z=10.1, containing ~ 10^8M<sub>&odot;</sub> in stars, with a similarly massive central black hole of ~ 10^7-8M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Here we propose a possible mechanism for forming such systems which hinges on the presence of primordial black holes (PBHs) covering a range of masses while contributing a significant fraction of the dark matter (DM). We evaluate the accurate expression for the small-scale power responsible for the collapse of the first halos in the presence of the PBH population. The extra power in the matter density field, produced by the granulation term, will cause an earlier collapse of DM halos, populated by PBHs of different masses. In these collapsed and virialized systems the PBHs will undergo 2-body relaxation, driving the more massive PBHs to the halo center under dynamical friction. We quantify this evolution for a distribution of PBH orbital parameters and halo properties. The analysis shows that PBHs can have appropriate mass functions capable of producing systems with parameters similar to what is observed for UHZ1. We suggest that the proposed mechanism could account for a subset of other systems newly discovered with the JWST at high redshifts, including the Little Red Dots.

### 20) [2601.08693](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08693v1): Stellar masses of optically dark galaxies: uncertainty introduced by the attenuation law and star-formation histories

<p>
JWST observations have suggested that some high-redshift galaxies may be ultra-massive, thereby challenging standard models of early galaxy formation and cosmology. We analyse the stellar masses using different modelling assumptions and with new data of three galaxies (S1, S2 and S3), whose NIRCam/grism redshifts were consistent with z&gt;5. These three optically dark galaxies have previously been reported to host exceptionally high stellar masses and star-formation rates, implying extremely high star-formation efficiencies. Recent NIRSpec/IFU observations for S1 indicate a spectroscopic redshift of z<sub>spec</sub>=3.2461^+0.0001_-0.0002, which is lower than previously reported. Using the Bayesian spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling tool ttProspector, we investigate the impact of key model assumptions on stellar mass estimates, such as the choice of star-formation history (SFH) priors (constant versus rising SFH base for the non-parametric prior), the dust attenuation law, and the treatment of emission line fluxes. Our analysis yields revised stellar masses of log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≈ 10.36^+0.47_-0.32, 10.95^+0.11_-0.10 and 10.31^+0.24_-0.19 for S1, S2, and S3, respectively. We find that adopting a rising SFH base prior results in lower inferred stellar masses compared to a constant SFH base prior. We identify a significant degeneracy between the dust attenuation curve slope, the amount of dust attenuation, and stellar mass. Our results highlight various systematics in SED modelling due to SFH priors and dust attenuation that can influence stellar mass estimates of heavily dust obscured sources. Nevertheless, even with these revised stellar mass estimates, two of the three galaxies remain among the most massive and actively star-forming systems at their respective redshifts, implying high star-formation efficiencies.

### 21) [2601.08212](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08212v1): Diverse Origins of Broad Hα Lines in Heavily Obscured AGNs Revealed by Multi-epoch Spectroscopy

<p>
According to the classical AGN model, broad emission lines originate from the broad-line region (BLR) and are observable only when the attenuation by the dusty torus is small. However, we recently found several heavily-obscured (A_V &gt; 50 mag) AGNs with broad Hα detections: MCG -3-34-64, UGC 5101, and Mrk 268. To investigate the origin of the observed broad line in these AGNs, we performed multi-epoch optical spectroscopic observations to search for flux variability of the broad Hα line. For MCG -3-34-64 and UGC 5101, no significant variability was detected, suggesting that the broad line of these AGNs may arise from sources other than the BLR. Spectral fitting analysis suggests possible large contribution of ionized outflows to the observed broad component of MCG -3-34-64, while both the outflow and scattering by polar material can explain that of UGC 5101. For Mrk 268, we detected a significant (4.3σ) flux variation of the broad Hα line by using the flux ratio of the Hα complex and the [SII]λ&lambda;6716, 6731 doublet, indicating that the broad line originates directly from the BLR. The lack of significant flux variation in the optical continuum implies that the line of sight to the nucleus of Mrk 268 is mildly obscured. Our results demonstrate that the observed broad Hα lines in obscured AGNs likely have multiple origins. Such complexity may introduce additional uncertainties in black hole mass measurements of distant AGNs revealed by e.g., JWST.

<p>
This letter presents an analysis of the infrared (~ 3-28 μm) spectra extracted from the nuclear (r &lt; 150 pc) regions of four low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN), observed by JWST NIRSpec/IFU and MIRI/MRS as an extension of the Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS). We find that, compared to higher-luminosity AGN, these low-luminosity AGN exhibit distinct properties in their emission of ionized gas, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>). Specifically, the low-luminosity AGN exhibit relatively weak high-ionization potential lines (e.g., [Ne V] and [O IV]), and the line ratios suggest that fast radiative shocks (with v_s of ~ 100s km s<sup>-1</sup>) are the primary excitation source of ionized gas therein. Under the low-excitation conditions of their nuclear regions, these low-luminosity AGN generally exhibit a higher fraction of PAHs with large size (N_C ≳ 200), reflecting the preferential destruction of smaller PAH molecules by AGN feedback. Furthermore, the H<sub>2</sub> transitions in these low-luminosity AGN are not fully thermalized, with slow, plausibly jet-driven molecular shocks (with v_s ≤ 10 km s<sup>-1</sup>) likely being the extra excitation source. Taken together with results from the literature, these findings indicate that feedback operates in both low- and high-luminosity AGN, albeit its impact varies with AGN luminosity. In particular, systematic variations in PAH band ratios are found across AGN, demonstrating the differing influence of feedback in AGN of varying luminosities and highlighting the potential of PAH band ratios as diagnostics for distinguishing kinetic- and radiative-mode AGN feedback.

### 23) [2601.07912](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07912v1): Relatively Fast and Reasonably Furious: Evidence for Increased Burstiness in Smaller Halos at Cosmic Dawn

<p> Julian B. Muñoz, John Chisholm, Guochao Sun, Jenna Samuel, Jordan Mirocha, Emily Bregou, Alessandra Venditti, Mahdi Qezlou, Charlotte Simmonds, Ryan Endsley </p>
<p>
We introduce an effective framework to model star-formation burstiness and use it to jointly fit galaxy UV luminosity functions (UVLFs), clustering, and Hα/UV ratios, providing the first robust empirical evidence that early galaxies hosted in lower-mass halos are burstier. Using z~ 4-6 observations, we find that galaxies show approximately 0.6 dex of SFR variability if hosted in halos of M_h = 10^11  M<sub>&odot;</sub> (typical of M_UV≈ -19 galaxies at z = 6). This translates into a scatter of σ_M_UV≈ 0.75 in the UVLF, in line with past findings. Strikingly, we find that burstiness grows for galaxies hosted in smaller halos, reaching ≳ 1 dex for M_h ≤ 10^9  M<sub>&odot;</sub> (corresponding to σ_M_UV ≈ 1.5 for faint M_UV ≳ -15 galaxies). Extrapolating to higher redshifts, when small halos were more prevalent, the inferred mass-dependent burstiness can reproduce observed UVLFs up to z~ 17 within 1σ, potentially alleviating the tension between pre- and post-JWST galaxy-formation models. Current observations allow us to constrain burst timescales to approximately 20 Myr, consistent with expectations from supernova feedback, and suggest broad distributions of ionizing efficiencies at fixed M_UV. Our results demonstrate that mass-dependent burstiness, as predicted by hydrodynamical simulations, is critical for understanding the mass assembly of early galaxies.

### 24) [2601.07374](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07374v1): Possible evidence for a pair-instability supernova nature of ultra-early JWST sources

<p> Andrea Ferrara, Stefano Carniani, Takahiro Morishita, Massimo Stiavelli </p>
<p>
Recent JWST observations have revealed a population of unexpectedly bright sources at ultra-high redshift (z &gt; 15), challenging current models of early galaxy formation. One extreme example is 'Capotauro', an F356W-dropout identified in the CEERS survey and initially interpreted as a luminous galaxy at z~30, but subsequently found to be variable over an ~ 800 day baseline. Motivated by this variability, we explore the alternative hypothesis that Capotauro is a pair-instability supernova (PISN) originating from a massive (250-260 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), metal-free star. Using state-of-the-art PISN light curves, spectral energy distributions, and synthetic spectra, we show that a PISN at z≃ 15 can plausibly reproduce the observed brightness, temporal evolution, photometry, and NIRSpec spectrum. We compare this scenario with alternative interpretations, including a local Y0 brown dwarf, and discuss observational tests to discriminate among them. If confirmed, this event would provide a rare window onto Population III stars, and highlights the importance of transient contamination in ultra-high redshift galaxy samples.

<p>
Using deep medium-resolution JWST rest-optical spectra of a sample of typical star-forming galaxies (Lyman break galaxies and Lyman-α emitters) from the LyC22 survey at z ~ 3, we determined the nebular abundances of N, O, and Ne relative to H for a subsample of 25 objects with the direct method, based on auroral [OIII]4363 line detections. Our measurements increases the number of accurate N/O determinations at z ~ 2-4 using a homogeneous approach. We found a mean value of log(N/O)=-1.29^+0.25_-0.21 over a metallicity range 12+log(O/H)=7.5 to 8.44. The observed N/O ratio and scatter are indistinguishable from that observed in low-z galaxies and HII regions over the same metallicity range, showing thus no redshift evolution of N/O for typical galaxies over a significant fraction of cosmic time. We also show that typical z ~ 3 galaxies show a similar offset in the BPT diagram as galaxies from the low-z Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS), when compared to the average of SDSS galaxies, and show that this offset is not due to enhanced nitrogen abundances. Our results establish a basis for future studies of the evolution of N and O at higher redshifts.

### 26) [2601.06255](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06255v1): GA-NIFS: high prevalence of dusty and metal-enriched outflows in massive and luminous star-forming galaxies at z~3-9

We present a search for and characterization of ionized outflows in 15 star-forming systems at z~3-9 with no evidence of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), observed with JWST/NIRSpec IFU as part of the GA-NIFS program. The targets often show satellites and complex substructure, from which we isolate 40 galaxies/regions. The sample probes the high-mass end of the galaxy population, with most sources having log_10~(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=9.5-11, extending previous studies on high-z star formation driven outflows that mainly focused on lower-mass galaxies. Using the [OIII]5007 and Hα emission lines, we identify broad kinematic components consistent with galactic outflows in 14 galaxies/regions. We find that the outflowing gas is more dust attenuated (by A_V~0.59 mag on average) and metal-enriched (0.13 dex) than the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxies, but its velocities are insufficient to escape the galaxies and reach the circumgalactic medium, suggesting that outflows mainly redistribute dust and metals around their hosts. The outflows identified in this study display velocity dispersions within σ_out=130-340~km~s<sup>-1</sup> and outflow velocities v_out=170-600~km~s<sup>-1</sup>, and, when combined with less luminous and less massive star-forming galaxies from previous works, reveal a statistically significant correlation between v_out and star formation rate (SFR). The typically low mass-loading factors (η=M&#775;_out/SFR≤1, in 9 out of 14 the outflows) indicate that these outflows do not strongly suppress star formation. Overall, our results suggest that ejective feedback via ionized outflows is inefficient in massive, luminous star-forming galaxies within the first 2 Gyr of the Universe.

<p>
We report the identification of a pair of faint little red dots (LRDs), dubbed Red Eyes, in a strongly-lensed galaxy at z~7 behind the PLCKG004.5-10.5 cluster, identified from the JWST Treasury program VENUS. Red Eyes are spatially resolved on the image plane with distinct colors, while the critical curve lies far north of Red Eyes, clearly requiring two different LRDs rather than a single LRD. Red Eyes is an extremely close pair of LRDs separated by ~70 pc in the source plane with a magnification of μ~20, which consistently explains another counter-image detected to the north-west. Red Eyes is hosted in a typical star-forming galaxy with M_UV,int~ -19, but its own UV emission is very faint (M_UV,int ≳ -16). Moreover, Red Eyes does not reside at the galaxy center but lies at an offset position of approximately one effective radius R_e away from the galaxy center. If observed without lensing, Red Eyes would appear as a typical star-forming galaxy at z~ 7 with M_UV~ -19, showing no apparent LRD signatures in either morphology or SED. These results suggest that multiple off-center LRDs, similar to Red Eyes, may be commonly hidden in a typical high-z star-forming galaxy. In this case, various plausible scenarios may emerge, one of which is that intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with M_BH~10^4&ndash;6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> may form in star clusters on a stellar disk and contribute to the growth of the central supermassive black hole via mergers, with some IMBHs detectable as luminous LRDs in a sufficiently active and massive phase.

<p>
Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) can form from the near-complete collapse of massive stars, causing them to abruptly disappear. The star M31-2014-DS1 in the Andromeda galaxy was reported to exhibit such a disappearance between 2014 and 2022, with properties consistent with the failed explosion of a ≈ 12 - 13 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yellow supergiant leading to the formation of a ≈ 5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> BH. We present mid-infrared (MIR) observations of the remnant obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and X-ray observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory in 2024. The JWST MIRI/NIRSpec data reveal an extremely red source, showing strong blueshifted absorption from molecular gas (CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, SO<sub>2</sub>) and deep silicate dust features. Modeling the dust continuum confirms continued bolometric fading of the central source to log(L/L<sub>&odot;</sub>)≈3.88 (≈7-8% of the progenitor luminosity), surrounded by a dust shell spanning ≈40-200 au. Modeling of the molecular gas indicates ~ 0.1 M<sub>&odot;</sub> of gas expanding at ≈ 100 km s<sup>-1</sup> near the inner edge of the dust shell. No X-ray source is detected down to a luminosity limit of L_X≲1.5×10^35 erg s<sup>-1</sup>. We show that the panchromatic observations are explained by (i) a low-energy (≈10^46 erg) ejection of the outer H-rich progenitor envelope and (ii) a fading central BH powered by inefficient (~0.1% in mass) accretion of loosely bound fallback material. The analysis robustly establishes the bolometric fading of M31-2014-DS1 and provides the first cohesive insights into BH formation via low-energy explosions and long-term fallback.

### 29) [2601.05333](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05333v1): Cosmic wallflowers: the circumgalactic origins of isolated ultra-compact star clusters at z&gt;7

<p> Floor van Donkelaar, Lucio Mayer, Pedro R. Capelo, Debora Sijacki, Angela Adamo </p>
<p>
The discovery of gravitationally lensed stellar clusters at high redshift with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed extremely compact, massive star-forming systems in galaxies at z &gt; 6, providing a new window into early cluster formation. In this work, we investigate star cluster formation in the circumgalactic environments of gas-rich galaxies with stellar masses spanning between ~10^8 - 10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z &gt; 7, using the MassiveBlackPS cosmological hydrodynamical simulation with 2 pc resolution. We identify 55 baryon-dominated clusters forming outside galactic discs but within the virial radius of the primary halo. Star formation in these systems proceeds rapidly, reaching peak stellar surface densities above 10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> pc^-2, closely matching the compact clusters recently discovered by JWST in the lensed Cosmic Gems Arc at z ≈ 9.6. Such extreme densities are a key pre-requisite to trigger runaway stellar collisions, indicating that a subset of our clusters would be a likely host of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). We find that massive star clusters can form efficiently in the circumgalactic medium at early times through filament fragmentation, whereby high gas densities lead to rapid local collapse via a combination of thermal and gravitational instabilities. This formation pathway implies that some compact clusters formed in the quiet outskirts of forming galaxies rather than within their discs. Small variations in filament properties, including metallicity, density, and dark-matter content, influence the likelihood of a star cluster being able to form an IMBH seed. The formation of clusters in circumgalactic environments points to a potential evolutionary pathway connecting early off-disc clusters, present-day globular clusters, and the seeds of massive BHs.

### 30) [2601.04988](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04988v1): Through Thick and Thin: The Cosmic Evolution of Disk Scale Height

Faisst, Ghassem Gozaliasl, Kartik Sheth, Jeyhan S. Kartaltepe, Can Xu, Aryana Haghjoo, Xuheng Ding, Zhaoxuan Liu, Jacqueline McCleary </p>
<p>
To investigate the formation and evolution of vertical structures in disk galaxies, we measure global \operatornamesech^2 scale heights, averaging thin and thick components when present, for 2631 edge-on disk galaxies with M_*&gt;10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at 0&lt; z &lt; 3.5 from the JWST COSMOS-Web survey. We show that dust extinction systematically overestimates scale heights at shorter rest-frame wavelengths, and therefore adopt a fixed rest-frame wavelength of 1 μm. After further correcting for projection-induced bias using a new accurate method, we find that the median disk scale height increases from 0.56±0.03 kpc at z=3.25 to 0.84±0.04 kpc at z=1.25, and subsequently decreases to 0.67±0.06 kpc at z=0.25. The disk length-to-height ratio remains constant at 2.7±0.2 for z&gt;1.5, but rises to 4.0±0.4 at z=0.25. These results imply that the high-redshift progenitors of present-day thick disks were of intermediate thickness, neither thin nor thick, yet dynamically hot and dense. The observed radial variation of scale height is consistent with the artificial flaring expected from observational effects, disfavoring minor mergers as the primary mechanism of disk thickening. Instead, we suggest that the high-redshift intermediate-thickness disks were single-component systems that increased their vertical scale height through decreasing surface mass density and/or violent gravitational instabilities, eventually producing thick disks. Thin-disk growth begins at z≈2 and dominates at z≲1, yielding a vertically more compact system with decreasing scale heights from z≈1 to 0. The inferred thin-disk mass fraction increases from 0.1±0.03 at z=1 to 0.6±0.1 at z=0. Together, these findings reveal a continuous evolutionary link between high-redshift single-component disks and present-day thick thin disk systems.

### 31) [2601.04955](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04955v1): Rapid emergence of overmassive black holes in the early Universe

<p> Sunmyon Chon, Shingo Hirano, Tomoaki Ishiyama, Seok-Jun Chang, Volker Springel </p>
<p>
The origin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains a long-standing problem in astrophysics. Recent JWST observations reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of overmassive black holes at z&gt;4-6, where the BH masses lie far above local scaling relations and not reproduced by current cosmological models. How such overmassive black holes form and rapidly grow within young galaxies has remained unclear. Here we present fully cosmological radiation-hydrodynamic simulations that, for the first time, self-consistently follow the birth, early growth, and emergent observable signatures of SMBHs in proto-cluster environments. We find that heavy seeds of order 10^6 M_sun naturally form, exceeding typical theoretical expectations by an order of magnitude. These seeds rapidly develop dense, optically thick disks whose strong electron scattering produces broad Hα emission comparable to that seen in little red dots (LRDs). Sustained super-Eddington accretion then drives fast growth to ~ 3 × 10^7 ~M_sun by z ~ 8. These results provide a unified physical scenario in which LRDs correspond to a short-lived, enshrouded phase of heavy-seed formation, naturally evolving into the overmassive quasars detected by JWST and ultimately the progenitors of today's SMBHs.

### 32) [2601.04344](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04344v1): Nitrogen enhancement of GN-z11 by metal pollution from supermassive stars

<p> Sho Ebihara, Michiko S. Fujii, Takayuki R. Saitoh, Yutaka Hirai, Yuki Isobe, Chris Nagele </p>
<p>
Spectroscopic observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed young, compact, high-redshift (z) galaxies with high nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) ratios. GN-z11 at z=10.6 is one of these galaxies. One possible scenario for such a high N/O ratio is pollution from supermassive stars (SMSs), from which stellar winds are expected to be nitrogen-rich. The abundance pattern is determined by both galaxy evolution and SMS pollution, but so far, simple one-zone models have been used. Using a galaxy formation simulation, we tested the SMS scenario. We used a cosmological zoom-in simulation that includes chemical evolution driven by rotating massive stars (Wolf-Rayet stars), supernovae, and asymptotic giant branch stars. As a post-process, we assumed the formation of an SMS with a mass between 10^3 and 10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and investigated the contribution of its ejecta to the abundance pattern. The N/O ratio was enhanced by the SMS ejecta, and the abundance pattern of GN-z11, including carbon-to-oxygen and oxygen-to-hydrogen ratios, was reproduced by our SMS pollution model if the pollution mass fraction ranges within 10-30 per cent. Such a pollution fraction can be realized when the gas ionized by the SMS is polluted, and the gas density is 10^4-10^5 cm^-3 assuming a Strömgren sphere. We also compared the abundance pattern with those of other N/O-enhanced high-z galaxies. Some of these galaxies can also be explained by SMS pollution.

<p>
The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and the James Webb Space Telescope are transforming our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution in the early Universe. By combining their capabilities, these observatories provide unprecedented insights into the gas, dust, and stars of high-redshift galaxies at spatially resolved scales, unveiling the complexities of their interstellar medium, kinematics, morphology, active galactic nuclei, and star formation activity. This review summarizes recent breakthroughs in the study of galaxies during the first billion years of cosmic history, highlighting key discoveries, open questions, and current limitations. We discuss how observations, theoretical models, and simulations are shaping our understanding of early galaxy evolution and identify promising directions for future research. While significant progress can be achieved through optimized use of existing facilities and collaborative efforts, further advances will require enhanced angular resolution and sensitivity, motivating upgrades to current instruments and the development of next-generation observatories.

### 34) [2601.03705](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03705v1): Identification of solid N2O in interstellar ices using open JWST data

<p> V. Karteyeva, R. Nakibov, I. Petrashkevich, M. Medvedev, A. Vasyunin </p>
<p>
Context. There are only six molecules containing N-O bond that are detected in gaseous phase in interstellar medium. One of those is nitrous oxide (N2O), which was searched for but not found in solid form from as early as Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) mission was launched. The observational capabilities of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) present a possibility to identify solid interstellar N2O. Aims. We aim to identify nitrous oxide in open JWST spectra of interstellar ices towards a sample of Class 0, 0/I and flat protostars using the relevant laboratory mixtures of N2O-bearing interstellar ice analogues. Methods. A set of laboratory infrared transmission spectra was obtained for the following mixtures: N2O:CO2=1:20, N2O:CO=1:20, N2O:N2=1:20, N2O:CO2:CO=1:15:5, N2O:CO2:N2=1:15:13 at 10-23 K. A search for N2O in JWST NIRSpec spectra towards 50 protostars was performed by fitting the 4.44-4.47 um (2250-2235 cm-1) NN-stretch absorption band with new laboratory mixtures of N2O-bearing ices. Results. We claim the first secure identification of N2O in 16 protostars. The fitting results show that N2O is formed predominantly within the apolar layer of the ice mantles, rich in CO, CO2 and N2. The abundance of solid N2O is estimated as 0.2-2.1% relative to solid CO. We present band strengths for N2O in the mixtures corresponding to the apolar layer. Also, an identification of the C-N stretch band at 4.42 um (2260 cm-1) is reported, which we tentatively assign to HNCO, the simplest C-N bond carrier.

### 35) [2601.03339](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03339v1): Early thin-disc assembly revealed by JWST edge-on galaxies

<p> Marloes van Asselt, Francesca Rizzo, Luca Di Mascolo </p>
<p>
The vertical structure of stellar discs provides key constraints on their formation and evolution. Nearby spirals, including the Milky Way, host thin and thick components that may arise either from an early turbulent phase or from the subsequent dynamical heating of an initially thin disc; measuring disc thickness across cosmic time therefore offers a direct test of these scenarios. We present a new methodology to measure the thickness of edge-on galaxies that explicitly accounts for small departures from perfectly edge-on orientations by fitting a full three-dimensional model with forward modelling. This improves on traditional approaches that assume an inclination of 90&deg; and can bias thicknesses high. Applying the method to itJWST imaging of galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3 with stellar masses ≳ 10^9~M<sub>&odot;</sub> from four major surveys, we measure a median scale height of z_0 = 0.25±0.14~kpc and a median ratio h_r/z_0 = 8.4±3.7. These values are consistent with the Milky Way and local thin discs, but imply scale heights ~ 1.6 times smaller than those inferred for local galaxies from single-disc fits. This result implies that thin discs are already present at z~3. We further show that a thick disc contributing 10&percnt; of the thin-disc luminosity would be detectable in the data considered in this work, implying that any thick disc present must be fainter and favouring a scenario in which thick discs build up progressively through dynamical heating.

### 36) [2601.03338](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03338v1): Fast rotations in galaxies at cosmic noon indicate central concentration of stars, dark matter or massive black holes

<p> Fernanda Roman-Oliveira, Francesca Rizzo, Filippo Fraternali </p>
<p>
The rotation curves of regularly rotating disc galaxies are a unique probe of the gravitational potential and dark matter distribution. Until recently, matter decomposition of rotation curves at z&gt;0.5 was challenging, not only due to the lack of high resolution kinematic data but also of both suitable photometry to accurately trace the stellar surface density and spatially-resolved sub-mm observations to trace the cold gas distribution. In this paper, we analyse three galaxies from the Archival Large Program to Advance Kinematic Analysis (ALPAKA) sample, combining highly resolved cold gas observations from ALMA with rest-frame near-infrared imaging from JWST to investigate their dynamical properties and constrain their dark matter halos. The galaxies, initially classified as regularly rotating discs based on ALMA observations alone, appear in JWST as extended and symmetric stellar discs with spiral arms. Our dynamical models reproduce the rotation of the discs in the outer parts well, but they systematically underpredict the inner rotation velocities, revealing a deficit of central mass relative to the data. This discrepancy indicates either an underestimation of the bulge masses due to variations in the stellar mass-to-light ratio or dust attenuation or the presence of overmassive black holes. Alternatively, it may suggest departures from standard dark-matter halo profiles, including enhanced central concentrations.

We present JWST/MIRI imaging of eight nearby Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) from the GATOS survey to investigate the physical conditions of extended dust in their narrow line regions (NLRs). In four galaxies (ESO 428-G14, NGC 4388, NGC 3081, and NGC 5728), we detect spatially resolved dust structures extending ~100-200 pc along the NLR. In these systems, we find a strong link between the morphology of the dust, the radio ejecta, and the coronal [Si VI] emission, implying that dust carries imprints of the processes shaping the NLR. Using spatially resolved spectral energy distributions, we show that dust in the NLR has systematically steeper slopes than star forming clumps. This dust emits at temperatures in the range 150 - 220 K, at a distance of ~150 pc from the nucleus. Using simple models, we show that, even under optimistic assumptions of grain size and AGN luminosity, the excess MIR emission cannot be explained by AGN illumination alone. We interpret this excess heating as in-situ. We show that shocks with velocities of v_shock ~ 200- 400   km/s in dense gas can close this gap, and in some cases even account for the total observed emission. This, combined with multiple lines of evidence for shocks in these regions, supports a scenario in which shocks not only coexist with dust but may be playing a key role in heating it. Our findings reveal shocks may be an important and previously overlooked driver of extended dust emission in the central hundreds of parsecs in AGN.

We present photometric properties of 161 galaxy candidates at z=7-14 selected from the second data release (DR2) of BEACON, a JWST Cycle 2 pure-parallel NIRCam imaging program. Carefully selected from 36 independent pointings (corresponding to ~350 arcmin<sup>2</sup> sky coverage), and hence with reduced cosmic variance, our galaxy candidates provide an unbiased sample for investigating galaxy properties over a wide range of environments. We measure the physical properties, including UV continuum slope (β_UV), stellar mass (M_*), star formation rate (SFR), and sizes. Our highest redshift galaxy candidate at z=13.71±0.15 has a remarkably bright UV luminosity of M_UV=-21.19±0.08, making it the brightest galaxy at z&gt;12 if spectroscopically confirmed. With an extremely blue UV slope, compact morphology, and high star formation rate surface density (Σ_SFR), this candidate may have extremely low metallicity, high ionizing photon escape fraction, or contributions from an AGN. Among our multiple independent sightlines, we identify three fields of galaxy number overdensity with &gt;3σ significance. The properties of galaxies in various environments do not exhibit significant differences, implying either that accelerated galaxy evolution in overdense regions is not yet widespread at z&gt;7, or that the current constraints are limited by sample size. Our simulations indicate that increasing the sample by an order of magnitude would allow such environmental trends to be robustly confirmed or ruled out, underscoring the importance of future pure-parallel observations.

### 39) [2601.02469](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02469v1): Hunting for the First Explosions at the High-Redshift Frontier

<p> Junehyoung Jeon, Volker Bromm, Alessandra Venditti, Steven L. Finkelstein, Tiger Yu-Yang Hsiao </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has spectroscopically confirmed galaxies up to z~14, 300 Myr after the Big Bang, and several candidates have been discovered at z~15-25, with one candidate as high as z~30, only 100 Myr after the Big Bang. Such objects are unexpected, since theoretical studies have not predicted the existence of detectable galaxies at z~30. While any z~30 candidates may be contaminants at lower redshifts, we explore whether such extreme redshift sources could be consistent with hyper-energetic transient events linked to the formation of the first, metal-free, stars. Specifically, we consider pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), a predicted class of extreme thermonuclear explosions that leave no remnant behind. Using cosmological simulations, we investigate an overdense cosmic region, where star formation and subsequent PISNe occur at z~30-40, even within standard cosmology. Assessing the likelihood of such a region, the corresponding number of PISNe at z≳20, and their observed flux, we find that JWST has a non-negligible chance to detect a PISN event at extremely high redshifts. If a transient event were confirmed at z~30, this would provide a direct glimpse into the epoch of first star formation, dramatically extending the empirical reach of astronomy.

<p>
We investigate the presence and origin of neutral gas outflows and inflows in 13 post-starburst (PSB) and quiescent galaxies at redshifts 1.8 ≤ z ≤ 4.6, using JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy from the EXCELS survey. NaD absorption profiles reveal that 3 out of 13 exhibit blueshifted absorption indicative of outflows, and a further 2 objects show signs of inflowing gas. Outflow velocities range from ≈ 300 - 1200 kms<sup>-1</sup>, and we find gas flows are detected exclusively in objects that quenched \lt 600 Myr ago. This result holds when we include comparable objects from recent literature. We derive mass outflow rates over two orders of magnitude higher than current levels of star formation in our sample, indicating that the winds are unlikely to be driven by supernovae, and likely play a significant role in keeping the galaxies quenched. The majority of the outflow sample have anomalously high energy and momentum outflow rates compared to those predicted for current levels of star formation or AGN activity. We conclude that we are likely observing fossil outflows driven by previous, more luminous AGN activity which has since faded. We then compare with the EAGLE simulation to explore a potential 'outflow cycle', finding that our observations are consistent with a model in which z ~ 3 quiescent galaxies undergo short ≃ 5 Myr periods of AGN activity strong enough to drive outflows, which occur every ≃ 40 Myr on average. This AGN activity drives observable outflows that persist for up to ≃ 10 Myr after the AGN fades, followed by a ≃ 20 Myr lull, and a subsequent short inflow, which eventually re-ignites AGN activity, and the cycle repeats.

<p>
We present the Parallel Application of Slitless Spectroscopy to Analyze Galaxy Evolution (PASSAGE) spectroscopic redshift catalog in the COSMOS field. PASSAGE is a JWST Cycle 1 Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) wide-field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) pure-parallel survey, obtaining near-infrared spectra of thousands of extragalactic sources. 15 out of 63 PASSAGE fields fall within the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) COSMOS footprint, of which 11 overlap with COSMOS-Web, a JWST treasury survey providing additional space-based photometry. We present our custom line-finding algorithm and visual inspection effort used to identify emission lines and derive the spectroscopic redshifts for line-emitting sources in PASSAGE. The line-finding algorithm identifies between ~200 and 950 line-emitting candidates per field, of which typically 47% were identified as true emission lines post visual inspection. We identify 2183 emission line sources at 0.08&lt;z&lt;4.7, 1896 of which have available COSMOS photometric redshifts. We find excellent redshift agreement between the COSMOS photometric redshifts and the PASSAGE spectroscopic redshifts for strong (S/N&gt;5), multi-line emitting sources. This agreement weakens for PASSAGE single-line emitters with ambiguous identities. These single-line emitters are likely mis-identified around 18% of the time based on comparisons to photometric redshifts. We derive stellar masses using PASSAGE photometry and spectroscopic redshifts, in broad agreement with existing COSMOS-Web stellar masses, but with some discrepancy driven by redshift disagreements. We publicly release this spectroscopic redshift catalog, which will enable community-led science in prime extragalactic fields and serve as a crucial dataset for validating Euclid and Roman spectroscopy.

### 42) [2601.02104](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02104v1): Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion onto ultra dense dark matter halos and direct collapse black holes

<p> Kandaswamy Subramanian, Bikram Phookun </p>
<p>
We suggest a formation scenario of black holes with intermediate mass ~ 10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, by post recombination Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion into ultra dense dark matter halos (UDMH) of ~ 10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, which have formed around the recombination epoch. Such UDMH can result from rare curvature fluctuations on small scales whose amplitude is still well below the current Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectral distortion limits. Gas accreted by the UDMH is heated to virial temperatures above which atomic cooling is efficient, cools rapidly to about ~ 8000 K and collapses on the free fall time of few 10^4 yr to the halo core, until supported by rotation. Further fragmentation due to molecular cooling is prevented by the suppression of H<sub>2</sub> molecule formation by the CMB photons at redshifts z&gt; 200-400. We find that the rotationally supported gas disk will be compact and massive enough to undergo self-gravitational instability in some cases, plausibly where accretion is into a nearly spherical UDMH which has formed from a rare peak in the density field. This results in a further, rapid transfer of mass inwards due to viscous forces and gravitational torques leading to the formation of a supermassive star and/or black hole of about 10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at redshifts of a few hundred, with abundances comparable to galaxies. Such intermediate mass black holes formed at high redshifts can seed the first super massive black holes and help explain the abundance of active galaxies detected now at increasingly larger redshifts by the James Webb Space Telescope.

<p>
We present the spectroscopic confirmation and in-depth analysis of AURORA-LQG1, a low-mass quiescent galaxy at z<sub>spec</sub>=2.0834 with log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=9.6 observed with medium-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy. The deep medium-resolution spectrum enables the measurement of its stellar velocity dispersion (σ<sub>&sext;</sub> = 95_-33^+38 km s<sup>-1</sup>), the smallest value recorded among spectroscopically confirmed quiescent galaxies at z~2. Coupled with a compact size (0.41±0.03  kpc), it yields a dynamical mass estimate of log(M_dyn/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=9.75_-0.38^+0.29. Its star formation history suggests that half of the stellar mass was in place ~1 Gyr before the observed epoch, with quenching occurring ~0.2 Gyr prior to z=2.08. These results confirm that AURORA-LQG1 is genuinely quenched, rather than in a temporary phase of suppressed star formation rate. AURORA-LQG1 is consistent with the mass fundamental plane at z~2, previously constrained only by massive quiescent systems. Compared with more massive counterparts at the same epoch observed with NIRSpec grating spectroscopy, the time since quenching for AURORA-LQG1 is among the shortest observed. The galaxy resides in a possible dense group-scale (~50 kpc) environment containing one companion with tentative spectroscopic redshift and five companion candidates, and it is embedded in a known protocluster on Mpc scales. A potential environmental influence on its evolution could explain the outside-in quenching suggested by the positive gradient of size with wavelength. This study demonstrates that deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy enables low-mass quiescent galaxies at Cosmic Noon to be characterized with a level of detail long reserved for massive systems, offering valuable new insights into how quenching operates in these underexplored low-mass systems.

### 44) [2601.01697](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01697v1): Accelerated evolution of galaxy host halo masses during Cosmic Dawn from deep JWST clustering

<p> Nicolò Dalmasso, Giovanni Ferrami, Nicha Leethochawalit, Emanuele M. Ventura, Michele Trenti </p>
<p>
We present the deepest clustering analysis of early galaxies to date, analyzing N_g ≃ 6500 photometrically-selected Lyman Break Galaxies from JWST's Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) to reveal how galaxies and dark matter evolved during cosmic dawn (5 ≤ z &lt; 11). Using halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling of the two-point angular correlation function, we trace the galaxy-halo relationships across the first billion years of cosmic history. Our analysis reveals that galaxies at z = 10.6 reside in dark matter halos over an order of magnitude less massive (M_h ~ 10^10.12 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) than their counterparts at z = 5.5 (M_h ~ 10^11.45 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), while exhibiting correspondingly higher effective bias values (b_g^eff = 8.13^+0.04_-0.02 compared to 5.64^+0.10_-0.13). Correspondingly, the satellite galaxy fraction hints at a declining trend with decreasing redshift, reaching &lt;1&percnt; by z ~ 5-6. However, the significant systematic and random uncertainties in the data-model comparison prevent us from drawing robust conclusions on the evolution - if any - of the satellite fraction during the epoch of reionization. These results provide the first view of the coevolution between galaxies and dark matter evolved at redshift ≳ 10, offering additional and independent constraints on early galaxy formation models tuned to reproducing luminosity function evolution.

### 45) [2601.01034](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01034v2): Testing supermassive primordial black holes with lensing signals of binary black hole merges

<p> Huan Zhou, Bin Liu, Zheng-Xiang Li, Xi-Jing Wang, Kai Liao </p>
<p>
Next-generation ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors are expected to observe millions of binary black hole mergers, a fraction of which will be strongly lensed by intervening galaxies or clusters, producing multiple images with characteristic distribution of time delay. Importantly, the predicted rate and properties of such events are sensitive to the abundance and distribution of strong lensing objects which directly depends on cosmological models. One such scenario posits the existence of supermassive primordial black holes (SMPBHs) in the early universe, which would enhance the formation of dark matter halos. This mechanism has been proposed to explain the abundance of high-redshift galaxies observed by James Webb Space Telescope. Crucially, the same cosmological model with SMPBHs would also leave a distinct imprint on the population of strongly lensed GWs. It predicts both an increased event rate and a modified distribution of time delays between the multiple images. Therefore, we propose statistical measurements of the rate and time delay distribution of strong lensing GW events as a powerful probe to directly constrain the abundance of SMPBHs. Considering ΛCDM cosmology with (non-)clustered SMPBHs, we find that the abundance of SMPBHs f_PBH with masses above 10^8~M<sub>&odot;</sub> is constrained to be ~10^-4 at 95&percnt; confidence level. It will be comparable and complementary to the currently available constraint from large scale structure observations.

<p>
Massive quenched galaxies at z&gt;3 challenge models of early galaxy evolution, as their rapid formation and abrupt quenching require efficient feedback, often linked to active galactic nuclei (AGN). The quiescent galaxy GS10578 at z=3.1 is a key example of this population. Previous JWST/NIRSpec IFU data revealed an AGN outflow and uncovered a compact pair of AGN separated by ~5 kpc. In addition, VLT/MUSE spectroscopy has identified a third AGN candidate at a projected distance of ~30 kpc, associated with a luminous Lya emitter (LAE2) characterised by high-ionisation UV lines, although rest-frame optical diagnostics were not previously available. We aim to confirm the nature of LAE2 using rest-frame optical diagnostics enabled by new JWST data, and to characterise the physical and ionisation properties of both LAE2 and a distinct nearby Lya emitter (LAE1) that lacks any detectable continuum counterpart. We analyse new NIRSpec IFU observations targeting the optical nebular lines of LAE1 and LAE2, complemented with MUSE data, as part of the GA-NIFS project. We extract integrated and spatially resolved spectra, construct emission-line maps, and use standard diagnostic diagrams to determine ionisation sources and kinematics. LAE2 exhibits line ratios fully consistent with an embedded AGN. Its optical lines display a clumpy morphology and irregular kinematics on sub-kpc scales. Except for Lya, LAE1 remains undetected in all nebular lines and in JWST imaging. The similarity of the LAE1 and LAE2 Lya profiles in both velocity and flux suggests that LAE1 traces resonantly scattered emission rather than in-situ star formation. Our analysis reveals that the environment of GS10578 contains both multi-black-hole activity and gas structures on tens-of-kpc scales, offering new insights into how feedback and satellite interactions influence the late evolutionary stages of quenched massive galaxies.

<p> Andreas A. C. Sander </p>
<p>
Massive stars are the engines of the Cosmos, shaping their environments and driving galaxy evolution across cosmic time. Yet, this general textbook picture faces many challenges when trying to turn abstract insights into quantitative predictions. Recent discoveries, such the surprisingly high metallicity and early nitrogen enrichment in high-redshift galaxies discovered by JWST, are challenging current descriptions of massive star evolution and add new pieces to a puzzle that is yet everything but complete. The oncoming era of large surveys and advances in computational modeling create the potential to reach breakthroughs in our understanding. Yet, to resolve current problems and conflicting conclusions, we will also need to reconsider what we think we know. Are the objects we observe what we think they are? Are the models we use describing what is actually going on? And what can we learn from previous misconceptions? This short review highlights major open questions from individual stars and stellar systems back to the first galaxies while also discussing two examples - the weak-wind problem as well as the different flavours and impact of Wolf-Rayet stars - where recent discoveries might point in a new direction.

<p> David D Vaida, Ryan Jeffrey Farber </p>
<p>
Since the launch of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in late 2021, our understanding of high-redshift objects has faced several upheavals. JWST has discovered much more massive galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBH) than cosmological models had expected. Furthermore, JWST observations have revealed an entirely novel population of high-redshift objects. Characterized by a dominant red rest-frame component and point-like morphology, these "little red dots'' (LRD) have set off a flurry of observational and theoretical follow-up. The current identity of LRD is highly debated, yet falling into two main scenarios: active galactic nuclei (i.e., SMBH) or compact star-forming regions. If star-forming, LRD would represent the highest stellar densities ever observed. If SMBH, their high Eddington fractions, and already high masses, help elucidate the growth of the most massive SMBH found by JWST in the early Universe (z ≳4). In this mini-review, we present the observational evidence accumulated to date, including sub-millimeter probes of LRD dust masses, constraints on radio and X-ray emission from stacking, and rest-frame ultraviolet \& optical measurements provided by JWST. Furthermore, we highlight how identifying additional LRD that are truly primarily SMBH-driven may help to shed light on the formation of `overly massive' SMBH discovered by JWST within the first billion years since the Big Bang.

Red supergiants (RSGs) are important for our understanding of supernova progenitors, stellar populations, stellar evolution, mass loss and dust production. Extragalactic surveys of RSGs have a long history in the Local Group, but few studies exist beyond that due to the limited resolution and sensitivity of ground-based and previous space-based infrared observatories. Here we demonstrate the combined power of HST and JWST to push systematic searches of RSGs out to ~20 Mpc. We introduce a catalog of 97057 RSGs &ndash; the largest single-survey release of RSGs &ndash; with masses ≳10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> in 19 galaxies from the PHANGS HST+JWST Treasury program. We use HST F814W and JWST F200W photometry to select stars as RSGs based on predicted colors and magnitudes from PARSEC isochrones. The spatial distribution of our recovered RSGs follow the familiar pattern of mostly being concentrated in active star-forming regions such as spiral arms and central starburst rings. The RSG number density on kpc-scales is strongly correlated (r_s~0.82) with local star-formation rate density (Σ_SFR) traced by extinction-corrected far-ultraviolet (FUV) from GALEX+WISE, and weakly correlated (r_s~0.57) with the total stellar mass density (Σ_*), traced by near-infrared emission from WISE+Spitzer. The number of RSGs per mass of stellar populations with ages 6-30 Myr (the likely age range of RSGs &gt;10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) is ~1 per 10^3.77±0.27 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, assuming constant star-formation rates from FUV+W4. Our sample will be a useful resource for tracking progenitors and feedback sites of future supernovae in PHANGS, age-dating stellar populations, and more.

### 50) [2512.24895](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24895v1): Resolving the Origins and Pathways of Ionizing Radiation Escape with UV Integral Field Spectroscopy

<p> Cody Carr, Renyue Cen, Brian Fleming, Sophia Flury, Stephan McCandliss, Sally Oey, Allison Strom </p>
<p>
The Epoch of Reionization marks the last major phase transition in the early Universe, during which the majority of neutral hydrogen once filling the intergalactic medium was ionized by the first galaxies. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is now identifying promising galaxy candidates capable of producing sufficient ionizing photons to drive this transformation. However, the fraction of these photons that escape into intergalactic space&ndash;the escape fraction&ndash;remains highly uncertain. Stellar feedback is thought to play a critical role in carving low-density channels that allow ionizing radiation to escape, but the dominant mechanisms, their operation, and their connection to observable signatures are not well understood. Local analogs of high-redshift galaxies offer a powerful alternative for studying these processes, since ionizing radiation is unobservable at high redshift due to intergalactic absorption. However, current UV space-based instrumentation lacks the spatial resolution and sensitivity required to fully address this problem. The core challenge lies in the multiscale nature of LyC escape: ionizing photons are generated on scales of 1&ndash;100 pc in super star clusters but must traverse the circumgalactic medium which can extend beyond 100 kpc. The proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will provide a platform for future UV instruments capable of resolving these scales. In this article, we present a science case for understanding how LyC photons escape from star-forming galaxies and define the observational requirements for future instruments aboard HWO, including a UV integral field spectrograph (IFS).

### 51) [2601.00044](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00044v1): Born in the Dark: The Catastrophic Collapse of Fuzzy Dark Matter Solitons as the Origin of Little Red Dots

<p> Tak-Pong Woo </p>
<p>
JWST surveys have uncovered a population of compact, red sources ("Little Red Dots," LRDs) at z ≥ 5 that exhibit broad Balmer emission yet remain X-ray faint, implying heavy obscuration with N_H ≥ 10^24 cm<sup>2</sup>. We propose that LRDs may trace a short-lived, obscured phase associated with rapid baryonic inflow inside the deep solitonic cores of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) halos. Combining the soliton size scaling with (i) the observed compact radii (r_e ~ 30-100 pc) and (ii) the requirement that Compton-thick columns be achievable within a region of order the core radius, we find that particle masses m few × 10^-22 eV are plausible for soliton masses M_s ~ 10^8 - 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>; we adopt m_22=2 as a fiducial choice. A conservative mass-budget estimate for the obscuring column, together with isothermal hydrostatic stratification, indicates that configurations reaching N_H ≥ 10^24 - 10^25 cm<sup>2</sup> require densities for which radiative losses (cooling and/or diffusion) occur faster than the dynamical time, suggesting that a long-lived static hot atmosphere is unlikely (an "Opacity Crisis") and that rapid inflow or radiation-pressure-driven evolution is favored. Using 512^3 pseudo-spectral Schrödinger-Poisson simulations of idealized soliton mergers, we illustrate that compact, high-density soliton cores can form via violent relaxation under representative scalings. We discuss observational implications and tests, and outline the need for future radiation-hydrodynamic modeling to predict demographics and detailed spectra.

### 52) [2512.23789](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23789v1): Dark Recipe for the First Giants: From Population III Stars to Early Supermassive Black Holes via Dark Matter Capture

<p> Sulagna Bhattacharya, Debajit Bose, Basudeb Dasgupta, Jaya Doliya, Ranjan Laha </p>
<p>
The presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshifts (z&gt;5), as revealed by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), challenges standard black hole (BH) formation scenarios. We propose a mechanism in which non-annihilating dark matter (DM) with non-gravitational interactions with the Standard Model (SM) particles accumulates inside Population III (Pop III) stars, inducing their premature collapse into BH seeds having the same mass as the parent star. Owing to their early formation, these seeds can accrete for longer periods and grow into the SMBHs observed at early cosmic times. Focusing on spin-dependent (SD) DM-proton interactions, we identify regions of parameter space that account for the observed high-redshift SMBH population, their mass function, and the SMBH-stellar mass relation. Portions of this parameter space are testable by forthcoming direct detection experiments. The scenario may lead to distinctive gravitational wave (GW) signatures from SMBH mergers, accessible to Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and pulsar timing array (PTA) observations.

We present Hα luminosity function (LF) measurements at redshifts z~1.3 and z~2.0 using JWST NIRISS grism data from the GLASS-JWST survey. Based on emission lines spectroscopically identified in the F115W, F150W and F200W filters, we select 99 Hα emitters. Through detailed effective volume and completeness analysis for each source, we construct the Hα LF in two redshift bins. Thanks to the sensitivity of NIRISS WFSS and gravitational lensing magnification, our sample reaches intrinsic Hα luminosities ~10 times deeper than previous grism surveys, down to L_Hα~10^40.5~erg~s<sup>-1</sup> at z~1.3 and L_Hα~10^40.9~erg~s<sup>-1</sup> at z~2.0 with completeness larger than 0.8, corresponding to star formation rates of 0.4 and 1.0 M<sub>&odot;</sub>~yr^-1, respectively. We robustly constrain the faint-end slope of the Hα luminosity function to be -1.50^+0.14_-0.08 at z~1.3 and -1.60^+0.17_-0.09 at z~2.0 after considering the cosmic variance of ~ 20&percnt;, consistent with previous estimations. The emission-line samples presented here will enable further detailed studies of galaxy properties including metallicities. We find a negligible contribution from bright active galactic nuclei in our sample. We estimate integrated cosmic star formation rate densities of 0.097^+0.015_-0.016~M<sub>&odot;</sub>~yr^-1~Mpc^-3 at z~1.3 and 0.129^+0.025_-0.030~M<sub>&odot;</sub>~yr^-1~Mpc^-3 at z~2.0. The methodology presented here can be readily applicable to other JWST slitless spectroscopic datasets and future wide-field slitless surveys, including those from Euclid, Roman, and the Chinese Space Station Telescope.

(Shortened)Context: We analyze the optical variability of the FSRQ Ton 599 using BVRI photometry from the WEBT collaboration (2011-2023), complemented by photometric and spectroscopic data from the Steward Observatory.\ Aims: To characterize short- and long-term optical variability &ndash; including flux distributions, intranight changes, color evolution, and spectra &ndash; to constrain physical parameters and processes in the central engine.\ Methods: We tested flux distributions in each filter against normal and log-normal, explored the RMS-flux relation and derived PSDs. We quantified intranight variability using a χ^2 test and fractional variability. From variability timescales, we estimated the emitting region size and magnetic field. Long-term variability was studied by segmenting the light curve into 12 intervals and analyzing flux statistics. For multi-filter flares, we computed spectral slopes, redshift-corrected fluxes, monochromatic luminosities and generated Color-magnitude and color-time diagrams. From low-flux spectra, we measured Mg II line and estimated the black hole mass.\ Results: Ton 599 showed strong optical variability. Log-normal distributions fit the fluxes better, and all bands show a positive RMS-flux relation with red-noise PSDs.Intranight variability is detected, and used in constraining the emission region and magnetic field.The R band reaches a peak flux of 23.5 mJy, corresponding to a monochromatic luminosity of log(νLν)= 48.48 [erg/s]. We found a redder-when-brighter trend at low fluxes (thermal), achromatic behavior at intermediate levels (possibly due to jet orientation changes), and a bluer-when-brighter trend at high fluxes (synchrotron). Long-term color changes are modest, short-term are significant, with a negative correlation between the amplitude of color changes and the average flux. The estimated SMBH mass is order of 10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>.

### 55) [2512.21927](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21927v1): A large, long-lived, slowly-expanding superbubble across the Perseus Arm

<p> Bingqiu Chen, Guangxing Li, Haibo Yuan, Maosheng Xiang, Jixuan Zhou, Pinjian Chen, Martin Krause, Ashley Coombs </p>
<p>
Stellar feedback is a crucial mechanism in galactic evolution, as demonstrated by the widespread bubbles observed with JWST. In this study, we combine data from Gaia and LAMOST to obtain a sample of young O-B2 stars with full three-dimensional velocity information. Focusing on the largest known superbubble in the Milky Way, we identify groups of O-B2 stars at its periphery, exhibiting a transverse velocity of 25.8 km/s and an expansion velocity of 6.2 km/s. Using these velocities, we calculate a crossing time t_cross ~ 20 Myr and an expansion timescale t_expansion ~ 80 Myr. We estimate a survival timescale t_survival ~ 250 Myr and a supernova interval t_SN ~ 0.1 Myr. Together with the Galactic shear timescale t_shear ~ 30 Myr, these values satisfy t_SN &lt; t_shear &lt; t_survival. The energy and momentum from supernovae are sufficient to sustain the bubble's growth against ambient pressure. This indicates that repeated supernovae replenish energy faster than shear and turbulent distort the cavity. Our analysis classifies the Giant Oval Cavity as a large, quasi-stationary superbubble, similar to the Phantom Bubble observed by JWST, stabilised by the interplay between stellar feedback and Galactic disk dynamics.

### 56) [2512.21632](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21632v1): Can A Kinematically Hot and Thick Disk Form A Bar? : Role of Highly Spinning Dark Matter Halos

<p> Sandeep Kumar Kataria </p>
<p>
Recent JWST observations claim the existence of a significant fraction of bars in the kinematically hotter and thicker disk at high redshift Universe. These observations challenge the current understanding of disk stability in galaxies similar to the Milky Way. The analytical work and N-body simulations suggest that the kinematically hot (dispersion-dominated) and thick disk are stable against bar formation. In this work, we perform the controlled N-body simulations of a kinematically hot and thick disk, which is residing in a non-rotating and spinning dark matter halo. We report that the disk, which is classically stable against bar instability in the live and non-rotating halo, leads to bar formation in a spinning halo environment. The spinning halo model is 8 times more efficient in transporting angular momentum from the disk to the halo compared to the non-spinning halo. We claim that Ostriker-Peebles and ELN bar formation criteria do not predict bar formation for both the non-roating and spinning halo. The recent criteria from Jang-Kim successfully predict the bar stability for the non-rotating halo model, but not for the spinning halo model. These results provide an important insight into the bar formation processes for thick and hot disks at high redshift.

<p>
Mid-infrared (mid-IR) observations are crucial for understanding galaxy evolution, tracing star formation, and active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity via dust emission. This work presents mid-IR galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 6, derived from the JWST Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES) program. We combine 8 MIRI bands (5-25 μm) of SMILES and archival 23-band HST+JWST NIRCam photometry to construct an extensive catalog containing 2,813 galaxies with sub-μJy level completeness in the mid-IR. We obtain monochromatic (in 5.6, 7.7, 10, 12.8, 15, 18, 21, and 25.5 μm), L_IR, and AGN LFs, with a limiting luminosity down to 10^9.5 L<sub>&odot;</sub> at z=0.5-1.0, ~10^10.5 L<sub>&odot;</sub> at z=2.0-4.0, and to ~10^11 L<sub>&odot;</sub> at z=4.0-6.0. With the unprecedented sensitivity and resolution of JWST, here we better constrain the faint-end slope and its evolution of the mid-IR LFs, quantifying the dusty cosmic star formation and black hole accretion histories out to z ~ 5. These results provide essential insights to refine our understanding of the obscured star formation and galaxy-AGN co-evolution over cosmic time.

Sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) ice has been tentatively detected in protostellar envelopes, but its reliability as a solid-state sulfur reservoir remains unclear. We present new measurements of SO<sub>2</sub> ice from 6.8-8.5 μm toward four Class 0 protostars observed with JWST's Mid-Infrared (MIRI) Medium Resolution Spectrometer, as part of the COMs ORigin Investigated by the Next-generation Observatory in Space (CORINOS) program. The sample spans a luminosity range from 1 L<sub>&odot;</sub> (B335, IRAS 15398-3359) to 10 L<sub>&odot;</sub> (L483, Ser-emb~7). To assess continuum placement uncertainty in absorption spectra, we apply randomized polynomial fits over the restricted region. We fit laboratory spectra from the Leiden Ice Database for Astrochemistry (LIDA) using the open-source Python library Omnifit. We detect the 7.7 μm CH_4 band in all sources and find its column density robust to baseline choice, providing a reference for evaluating the weaker SO<sub>2</sub> feature on its blue shoulder and quantifying baseline-related uncertainty. Three SO<sub>2</sub> laboratory ices were tested: pure SO<sub>2</sub> ice yields 0.3-1.2% of volatile sulfur may be locked in SO<sub>2</sub> ice (lower and upper limits); CH_3OH:SO<sub>2</sub> ice gives 0.02-0.18%, but with lower quality fitting. The best-fitting H<sub>2</sub>O:SO<sub>2</sub> ice yields 0.2-0.9%, which we consider the most realistic. These ranges define plausible bounds on SO<sub>2</sub> ice abundances in our sample. We find evidence for SO<sub>2</sub> in Ser-emb 7, L483, and IRAS 15398-3359, but emphasize the noisy spectrum of B335 prevents a definitive detection. Comparing SO<sub>2</sub> ice abundances across the different environments, we assess how conditions influence role of SO<sub>2</sub> as a potential sulfur reservoir and implications for the longstanding "missing sulfur'' problem.

<p>
In order to account for reionization of the early Universe, galaxies at that time must have had significantly higher escape fractions of Lyman Continuum (LyC) than observed in the present Universe. Any explanation invoked to explain LyC escape must agree with this dramatic cosmic evolution. Galaxy mergers are often suggested as such a regulating mechanism. They occur an order or magnitude more frequently at z ≥ 3 than in the local Universe, and they can trigger LyC escape either by inducing strong nuclear starbursts, or by tidally displacing the neutral ISM from the bulk of the stars. In the local Universe, LyC escape has been found to correlate with a range of physical and observable properties closely associated with strong star formation. For this reason, interest in mergers as drivers of LyC escape have been mainly focused on their capacity to induce strong star formation. However, at z ≥ 2, these correlations are weaker, and we observe a much more diverse Lyman Continuum Emitter (LCE) population. This suggests that processes external to the LCE galaxies are more important for facilitating the escape at higher redshifts, which makes tidal displacement an interesting explanatory model; however, this has only been conclusively observed once before. In this letter, we present archival JWST/NIRSpec IFU and HST UVIS and IR imaging observations of the z = 3 Lyman-Continuum emitter LACES104037. We find that its Lyman-Continuum escape originates in a tidal bridge in the direction towards an interacting companion galaxy first identified in this work. LyC escape from tidal stripping or in-situ formed stars in tidal features could help explain both the higher cosmic LyC escape fraction and the greater diversity of LCE galaxy properties at higher redshifts.

The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will provide a revolutionary measurement of the Universe's expansion kinematics, driven by dark matter and dark energy, out to z ≈ 3. The accuracy of this measurement is predicated on the assumption that standardized Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) luminosities do not evolve with redshift. If present, SN Ia luminosity evolution is expected to be most detectable in the dark matter-dominated era of the Universe (z ≳ 1.5), with its effects becoming more easily distinguishable from dark energy variation at increasing redshift. We present JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec observations of SN 2025ogs, a normal SN Ia at z = 2.05 ± 0.01. This SN offers a key point of comparison for interpreting future high-redshift SN Ia samples. The NIRCam light curve indicates a blue color (B - V = -0.27 ± 0.06 mag) and a moderately fast decline (Δm_15(B) = 1.55 ± 0.15 mag), both within standard criteria for inclusion in cosmological analyses. Its luminosity distance is in 1.0σ agreement with a standard flat ΛCDM model, as well as with current cosmological constraints from the Dark Energy Survey (DES 5yr) and Pantheon+. The NIRSpec spectrum displays all of the hallmark absorption features of a normal SN Ia observed at peak brightness. We find that the rest-frame optical color, rest-frame near-ultraviolet properties, and Si II line strengths are all consistent with the moderately fast decline inferred from the light curve. Multiple absorption features (Ca II H&K, O I &lambda;7774, and the Ca II NIR triplet) all appear at a lower blueshift relative to a sample of low-z SNe Ia. Together, these results suggest that SN Ia standardization remains robust at z ≈ 2, and also highlight the importance of JWST spectroscopy for uncovering evolutionary effects that could impact Roman's high-precision cosmology.

JWST has discovered an early period of galaxy formation that was more vigorous than expected, which has challenged our understanding of the early Universe. In this work, we present the longest spectroscopic integration ever acquired by JWST/MIRI. This spectrum covers the brightest rest-frame optical nebular emission lines for the luminous galaxy JADES-GS-z14-0 at z &gt; 14. Most notably, we detect [OIII] λλ4959,5007 at ≈ 11 σ and Hα at ≈ 4 σ with these ultra-deep observations. These lines reveal that JADES-GS-z14-0 has low dust attenuation with a recent star-formation rate of SFR ≈ 10 ± 2 M<sub>&odot;</sub> / yr, star-formation rate surface density of Σ_SFR ≈ 23 ± 5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr/kpc<sup>2</sup>, and ionizing photon production efficiency of ξ<sub>ion</sub> ≈ 10^25.3 ± 0.1 Hz/erg. Using standard strong-line diagnostics, we infer a gas-phase oxygen abundance of [O/H] ≈ -1.1 ± 0.4 (≈ 10&percnt; Z<sub>&odot;</sub>), carbon-to-oxygen ratio of [C/O] ≈ -0.4 ± 0.4, ionization parameter of log_10(U) ≳ -2.4, and density of n_H ≈ 720 ± 210 cm^-3. Using detailed photoionization modeling, we instead derive [O/H] ≈ -0.3_-0.4^+0.4 (≈ 50&percnt; Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) and log_10(U) ≈ -1.5_-0.4^+0.3. The inferred properties of JADES-GS-z14-0 are similar to those measured for similarly luminous galaxies at z &gt; 10 with previous MIRI/Spectroscopy, such as GHZ2/GLASSz12, GN-z11, and MACS0647-JD1. Existing simulations are unable to reproduce the empirical and inferred properties of JADES-GS-z14-0. This work demonstrates an important step toward understanding the formation of the first stars and heavy elements in the Universe. [Abridged]

### 62) [2512.19666](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19666v1): A cosmologist's take on Little Red Dots

<p> Valerio De Luca, Loris Del Grosso, Gabriele Franciolini, Konstantinos Kritos, Emanuele Berti, Daniel D'Orazio, Joseph Silk </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a population of compact, high-redshift sources, the Little Red Dots (LRDs), which may host supermassive black holes (BHs) significantly heavier than their stellar content compared with local scaling relations. These objects challenge standard models of early galaxy formation and may represent an extreme class of early BH hosts. In this paper, we investigate whether these BHs could have a primordial origin. We first show that the direct formation of these BH masses in the early Universe is excluded by stringent CMB μ-distortion limits. We then investigate the assembly of massive BHs from lighter, observationally allowed primordial black holes (PBHs) via hierarchical mergers, finding that, although this channel can operate depending on the merger history, it faces challenges in explaining the observations due to the rarity of the required high-redshift dark matter halos. Finally, we estimate gas accretion onto intermediate-mass PBHs, while jointly tracking metallicity evolution, and identify regions of parameter space in which such growth could reproduce the observed properties of LRDs. As a special case, we focus on the strongly lensed source QSO1, whose extremely low metallicity and large mass provide a stringent test of these formation channels.

### 63) [2512.19175](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19175v1): DESI DR2 Constraints on the R_h=ct Universe: Model Viability and Comparison with ΛCDM

<p> Amritansh Mehrotra, S. K. J. Pacif, A. F. Santos </p>
<p>
We carry out a comparative analysis of the standard ΛCDM cosmological model and the alternative R_h=ct framework using recent observational data from cosmic chronometers, Type Ia supernova, and baryon acoustic oscillations. The study evaluates the ability of each model to reproduce the observed expansion history of the Universe through a joint statistical assessment based on the chi-squared statistics, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), and Bayes factor. While both models yield acceptable fits, ΛCDM consistently attains lower information-criterion values and higher likelihood, indicating a superior overall performance. An examination of the redshift evolution of the Hubble parameter H(z) and the deceleration parameter q(z) shows that ΛCDM naturally captures the transition from early-time deceleration to late-time acceleration, where as R_h=ct predicts a strictly linear expansion. We also estimate the age of the Universe within both models, finding that ΛCDM prediction agrees with the Planck 2018 result, while the linear expansion in R_h=ct leads to an older cosmic age. Recent JWST observations of unexpectedly mature high-redshift galaxies have reopened the discussion regarding whether the Universe may be older than implied by the standard model; although these results remain under active investigation, they underscore that fully resolving cosmic evolution may require refinements beyond the concordance paradigm.

<p>
We present a spatially-resolved analysis of galaxy quenching within the Spiderweb Protocluster at z ~ 2.16, combining deep imaging from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Utilizing pixel-by-pixel spectral energy distribution fitting, we derive maps of stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), specific SFR (sSFR), and rest-frame UVJ colors. Quiescent galaxies, predominantly found at log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 10.5, exhibit clear mass-dependent inside-out quenching, with central sSFR approximately an order of magnitude lower than outer regions, while lower-mass star-forming galaxies show flat sSFR profiles. Central star formation activity fundamentally anti-correlates with Sérsic index, indicating reduced activity in bulge-dominated systems. Spatially resolved UVJ colors reveal heterogeneous internal star formation, distinguishing star-forming regions in quiescent hosts from those in globally star-forming systems. These findings demonstrate that quenching mechanisms were effectively operating by z ~ 2, with the observed inside-out patterns and morphological correlations consistent with AGN-driven feedback processes. Our study provides key observational constraints on galaxy evolution during this critical epoch.

### 65) [2512.18000](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18000v1): The Clustering of Little Red Dots from Ultra-Strongly Self-Interacting Dark Matter

<p> M. Grant Roberts, Aarna Garg, Tesla Jeltema, Stefano Profumo </p>
<p>
We predict the effective clustering bias parameter, b_eff, at z~5 for Little Red Dots (LRDs) seeded by Ultra-Strongly Self-Interacting Dark Matter (uSIDM). From our model, we find that b_eff~4.5, thus we infer that LRDs seeded by uSIDM would populate halos of typical masses ~ 8×10^10~M<sub>&odot;</sub>; this bias factor is consistent with LRDs being a distinct population from high redshift quasars. To the extent that we are aware, this is the first formation-based theoretical prediction of LRD clustering from a model consistent with the LRD mass function. We find that this bias and clustering is insensitive to a wide range of the underlying uSIDM microphysics parameters, including the uSIDM cross-section σ/m and uSIDM fraction f. This is therefore a robust prediction from the uSIDM model, and will allow for direct probes of the uSIDM paradigm as the origin of LRDs in the next few years. Upcoming ttJWST observations will constrain the population of LRDs, including directly measuring their clustering.

### 66) [2512.17997](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17997v1): Pulsational Instability of Quasi-Stars: Interpreting the Variability of Little Red Dots

<p> Matteo Cantiello, Jake B. Hassan, Rosalba Perna, Philip J. Armitage, Mitchell C. Begelman, Yan-Fei Jiang, Taeho Ryu, Richard H. D. Townsend </p>
<p>
The JWST discovery of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) has revealed a population of compact, red sources at z ~ 5-10 that likely host supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Recent observations of the gravitationally lensed LRD R2211-RX1 reveal century-scale photometric variability and a hysteresis loop in the luminosity-temperature plane, strongly suggesting that the optical emission originates from a pulsating, stellar-like photosphere rather than an accretion disk. This supports the "quasi-star" hypothesis, where a rapidly growing black hole seed is embedded within a massive, radiation-pressure supported envelope. In this work, we investigate the stability of these envelopes using the stellar evolution code MESA coupled with the non-adiabatic oscillation code GYRE. We identify a theoretical "Quasi-Star Instability Strip" with a blue edge at T_eff ≈ 5000-5200 K. Models hotter than this threshold are stable, consistent with the non-variable LRD R2211-RX2 (T_eff ≈ 5000 K), while cooler models are unstable to radial pulsations driven by the κ-mechanism in helium and hydrogen ionization zones. For quasi-star masses in the range M<sub>&sext;</sub> ~ 10^4-10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, we find that the unstable fundamental radial modes (&ell; =0, n_p=1) have periods in the range ~ 20-180 years. The first overtone (&ell; =0, n_p=2) is also unstable or marginally stable in some of our models, with typical pulsation timescales ~ 10-30 years. These oscillations match the co-moving frame variability timescale of RX1. We argue that these violent pulsations likely drive enhanced mass loss analogous to super-AGB winds, which could affect the duration of the quasi-star phase and regulate the final mass of the seeded black hole.

### 67) [2512.17339](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17339v1): Uncovering the population of compact binary mergers and their formation pathways with gravitational waves through the Einstein Telescope

<p>
Ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) observatories have transformed our view of compact-object mergers, yet their reach still limits a comprehensive reconstruction of the processes that generate these systems. Only next-generation observatories, with order-of-magnitude improvements in sensitivity and access to lower frequencies, will be capable of radically extending this detection horizon. GW observations will make it possible to detect the complete population of binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to redshifts of z ≃ 100. This capability will deliver an unprecedented map of merger events across cosmic time and enable precise reconstruction of their mass and spin distributions, while for several thousand events the signal-to-noise ratio will surpass 100, enabling precision physics of BHs and neutron stars (NSs). The access to lower frequencies will also open the intermediate-mass window, detecting systems of order ~ 10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, potentially in coordination with multi-band observations from LISA. At higher redshifts, where Population III stars have so far remained beyond reach - even for the James Webb Space Telescope - GW observations by next-generation detectors will routinely provide observations of BH mergers thought to originate from these primordial stellar populations. Such measurements are expected to play a central role in clarifying the early assembly of supermassive black holes. A single detection of a binary BH system at z ≳ 30, or of a compact object with sub-solar mass and no tidal deformability, would constitute strong evidence for the existence of primordial black holes. Such a discovery would have profound consequences for our understanding of dark matter and the early Universe. Ultimately, the GW observations will become revolutionary for identifying the physical channels responsible for compact binary formation.

### 68) [2512.17162](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17162v1): A robust morphological classification method for galaxies using dual-encoding contrastive learning and multi-clustering voting on JWST/NIRCam images

<p> Xiaolei Yin, Guanwen Fang, Shiying Lu, Zesen Lin, Yao Dai, Chichun Zhou </p>
<p>
The two-step galaxy morphology classification framework \tt USmorph successfully combines unsupervised machine learning (UML) with supervised machine learning (SML) methods. To enhance the UML step, we employed a dual-encoder architecture (ConvNeXt and ViT) to effectively encode images, contrastive learning to accurately extract features, and principal component analysis to efficiently reduce dimensionality. Based on this improved framework, a sample of 46,176 galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;4.2, selected in the COSMOS-Web field, is classified into five types using the JWST near-infrared images: 33&percnt; spherical (SPH), 25&percnt; early-type disk (ETD), 25&percnt; late-type disk (LTD), 7&percnt; irregular (IRR), and 10&percnt; unclassified (UNC) galaxies. We also performed parametric (Sérsic index, n,and effective radius, r_e) and nonparametric measurements (Gini coefficient, G, the second-order moment of light, M_20, concentration, C, multiplicity, Ψ, and three other parameters from the MID statistics) for massive galaxies (M_*&gt;10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) to verify the validity of our galaxy morphological classification system. The analysis of morphological parameters is consistent with our classification system: SPH and ETD galaxies with higher n, G, and C tend to be more bulge-dominated and more compact compared with other types of galaxies. This demonstrates the reliability of this classification system, which will be useful for a forthcoming large-sky survey from the Chinese Space Station Telescope.

<p>
A deep understanding of the life-cycle of galaxies, particularly those of high mass, requires clarifying the mechanisms that regulate star formation (SF) and its abrupt shutdown (quenching), often capable of stopping SF rates of hundreds of solar masses per year. What initially triggers quenching, and what sustains the quiescent state thereafter, especially given the frequent presence of large gas reservoirs or even massive gas inflows, are unsolved key issues. Ultimately, the crucial connection between the galaxy life-cycle and the surrounding Intergalactic (IGM) and Circumgalactic (CGM) Medium remains largely unclear. Addressing these issues requires studying star formation, chemical enrichment, and quenching homogeneously up to high redshift. The upcoming AO-assisted Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), will deliver sharper and deeper data than the JWST. SHARP is a concept study for a near-IR (0.95-2.45 mu) spectrograph designed to fully exploit the capabilities of ELT. Designed for multi-object slit spectroscopy and multi-Integral Field spectroscopy, SHARP points to achieve angular resolutions (~30 mas) far superior to NIRSpec at JWST(100 mas) to decipher and reconstruct the life-cycle oa galaxies.

<p>
We present new constraints on the Mass &ndash; Metallicity (MZR) and Fundamental Metallicity Relations (FMR) using a sample of 34 galaxies at 1.38≤~z≤~3.5 (median z=2.28). These galaxies have direct T_e measurements from [O\sciii]4363Å~and/or [O\scii]7320,7331Å~auroral emission lines detected with itJWST/NIRSpec as part of the AURORA survey. The detection of both oxygen auroral lines allows for dual-zone direct T_e measurements and expands the dynamic range in 12+log(O/H) (7.68 to 8.65 dex), stellar mass (10^8 to 10^10.4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), and star-formation rate (1 to 100 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1) compared to previous direct T_e studies of the high-redshift MZR and FMR. We characterize the z~2 MZR and find a slope of 0.27±0.04 and normalization of 12+log(O/H) = 8.44±0.04 at 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> with an intrinsic scatter of 0.10 dex, consistent with past strong-line MZR measurements. Comparisons with z~2 predictions from six simulations reveal that none reproduce our observed MZR normalization evolution between z~0 and z~2. This discrepancy suggests current models do not fully capture the chemical enrichment and feedback processes occurring at cosmic noon. However, all 34 galaxies are on or above the star-forming main sequence such that our sample may be biased towards lower 12+log(O/H) if the FMR persists at z~2. Correcting for this selection effect would increase O/H by ≈0.1 dex at 10^9.3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> (the median mass of our sample) bringing our MZR into better agreement with that of ttTNG. Lastly, we find our z~2.3 sample is consistent with the z~0 FMR within 0.1 dex in O/H, indicating that the smooth secular mechanisms regulating chemical enrichment, star formation, stellar mass, and outflows were in place at cosmic noon.

### 71) [2512.16987](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16987v1): Reviving sub-keV warm dark matter: a UVLF-based analysis

<p> Raymond T. Co, Siu Cheung Lam, Sai Chaitanya Tadepalli, Tomo Takahashi </p>
<p>
Thermal warm dark matter (WDM) particles with m_WDM ≤ 1~keV are ruled out at more than 4σ by multiple observational probes, owing to the strong suppression of small-scale structure induced by early-time free-streaming. Recently, it was highlighted that a small admixture of ~1&percnt; (f_CDM ~\!0.01) cold dark matter (CDM) endowed with a blue-tilted isocurvature spectrum could offset the WDM-induced suppression and relax the WDM mass bound by a factor of O(10). If viable, this ''warm + cold-isocurvature'' scenario would allow sub-keV WDM particles to constitute nearly the full dark matter abundance while potentially alleviating some small-scale tensions. In this work, we test this mechanism by constraining the WDM mass m_WDM while marginalizing over CDM isocurvature parameters. We combine ultraviolet luminosity function measurements from the itHubble Space Telescope and itJames Webb Space Telescope over redshift 4 ≤ z ≤ 11 with CMB, BAO, and SNe data. For a pure WDM model, our joint analysis yields a lower bound m_WDM &gt; 1.8~keV (95% credible intervals). When CDM isocurvature is introduced at f_CDM = 0.01, the limit relaxes to m_WDM &gt; 0.27~keV (95% credible intervals), reflecting a shallow degeneracy in which blue-tilted isocurvature fluctuations partially compensate for WDM suppression. These results provide new constraints on thermal WDM in the presence of CDM isocurvature fluctuations and quantify the extent to which such fluctuations can mask the small-scale signatures of light relics.

### 72) [2512.16981](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16981v1): The accretion of quasars at the epoch of reionisation: JWST catches the primeval monsters slowly feasting

<p>
Quasars (QSOs) emit an enormous amount of light as a result of the accretion of gas onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Thanks to their luminosity, the most distant known QSOs allow us to trace the growth of SMBHs deep into the epoch of reionisation. In this work, we employed JWST/NIRSpec observations of eight luminous (log(L_3000 A&deg;/(erg   s<sup>-1</sup>))&gt;45.7) QSOs at z≥5.9 to constrain their accretion properties, namely black hole mass, accretion disc (AD) luminosity, and Eddington ratio (M_BH, L_AD, λ_Edd), by fitting the rest-frame UV and optical emission with different AD models. This method provided self-consistent measurements of both M_BH and L_AD. The uncertainties on M_BH and L_AD, obtained within the AD-modelling framework (σ^AD_M_BH~0.2 dex; σ^AD_L_AD~0.1 dex), are significantly smaller than the systematic uncertainties associated with single-epoch M_BH (~0.4 dex) and L_AD derived via bolometric corrections (~0.2 dex). Based on these results, in our sample we found an average Eddington ratio of &langle; log(λ_Edd) &rangle;=-0.9, with a dispersion of ~0.2 dex. Assuming that our high-z QSOs are representative of optically-selected bright blue QSOs, we derive a fraction of systems accreting above the Eddington limit of ~0.2%. In conclusion, this work i) demonstrates the suitability of JWST to test AD models on high-redshift (z≳4) QSOs, thanks to the large NIRSpec spectral coverage; ii) shows that AD modelling can yield robust M_BH and L_AD measurements, with smaller uncertainties than the typical calibrations; and iii) provides compelling evidence for sub-Eddington accretion in bright high-z QSOs, challenging the widespread paradigm of near- or super-Eddington accretion occurring in these sources.

We report the unprecedented Lyα properties of AMORE6, an extremely metal-poor (12+log(O/H) &lt; 6), low-mass (M<sub>&sext;</sub> = 4.4×10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), and ultra-compact (effective radius ≲30 pc) dwarf galaxy at z=5.7253, gravitationally lensed by the cluster A2744. A prominent, narrow, and nearly-symmetric Lyα emission line is detected at the systemic redshift (the latter traced by Hβ, from JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopy), with rest-frame EW=150±10 Å, FWHM=58±1 km s<sup>-1</sup>, and a slight asymmetry, resulting in a ~10&percnt; flux excess in the red wing of the line. The negligible velocity offset from systemic (dv = 4±67 km s<sup>-1</sup>, 3σ uncertainty), together with the sharpness and symmetry of the profile, indicates minimal radiative transfer effects implying a neutral hydrogen column density consistent with an optically thin medium, compatible with a non-zero ionizing photon escape fraction. If indirect spectral diagnostics calibrated at z&lt;4.5 remain the only viable tools to identify LyC leakers during reionization, then based on its strongest indicator (Lyα), AMORE6 stands out as one of the most compelling LyC-leaking candidates yet discovered in the reionization epoch.

We investigated the James Webb Space Telescope photometric color classification of mid-infrared (MIR) selected galaxies at high redshifts, toward cosmic noon. The aim of the present work is to obtain a z-dependent mid-infrared (MIR) photometric galaxy classification tool based on broad spectral emission and absorption lines using the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) and its broadband filters. We used the largest Spitzer MIR spectral database to obtain synthetic photometry in the JWST/MIRI filters. We formed MIRI filter combinations to trace the strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features and the 9.7 micron silicate feature in seven redshift windows from z = 0.25-2.10. Results. We present z-dependent MIRI color-color plots that separate active galactic nuclei (AGN), star-forming galaxies (SFGs), and silicate absorption-dominated galaxies up to z~2. We applied the photometric MIR colors to the largest (~34 arcmin square) MIRI survey called the Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES), to identify AGN, SFGs, and Si-absorption dominated galaxies out to substantial redshifts. Our JWST/MIRI SFGs sample includes galaxies with total IR luminosities of 10^9.2 ~ 10^11.9 L<sub>&odot;</sub> at 0.9 ≤z &lt; 1.57. The majority of them are consistent with the z~1 main sequence. We also identified the first examples of z~1 galaxies with deep silicate absorption.

<p>
The semi-forbidden CIII] λλ1907,1909 doublet is a key tracer of high-ionization emission in the early universe. We present a study of CIII] emission in galaxies at z=5-7, using publicly available JWST/NIRSpec prism data from programs including CEERS, JADES, RUBIES and CAPERS. We built a sample of 61 CIII]-emitting galaxies, and we classified them as star-forming or active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies using (1) rest-frame UV and optical emission-line diagnostic diagrams, and (2) the presence/absence of broad Balmer emission lines. The UV diagnostics are based on the combination of the rest-frame equivalent width (EW) of CIII] versus CIII]/HeII λ1640, and the EW of CIV versus CIV/HeII λ1640. For optical diagnostics, we employ the OHNO diagram, which combines [OIII] λ5007, Hβ, [NeIII] λ3869, and [OII] λλ3727,3729- and we find it has a low efficiency on separating AGN from SFG. We find that half of the sources in our sample (29 out of 61 galaxies) exhibit at least one secure indication of AGN activity while 13 are potential AGNs based on the CIII] diagnostic. Physical properties, including stellar mass and star formation rate, are derived through spectral energy distribution modeling with Bagpipes. Our analysis reveals that JWST is uncovering a population of strong CIII] emitters at high redshift (5&lt;z&lt;7) with a median EW of 22.8 A. This EW is higher than that of a control sample of CIII] emitters at redshift 3&lt;z&lt;4 with a median EW of 4.7 A. We find that for the same range of Muv, the CIII] EW increases by ~0.67 dex from 3&lt;z&lt;4 to 5&lt;z&lt;7, indicating strong redshift evolution in the line's strength. Finally, we identify five sources in our sample as Little Red Dots (LRDs); while four of these have already been identified as LRD in the literature, one is presented here for the first time.

### 76) [2512.16316](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16316v2): Hydrodynamic Evolution and Detectability of Nova Remnants in the Galactic Center

<p> Zhao Su, Zhiyuan Li </p>
<p>
Thousands of X-ray sources have been detected in the Galactic center (GC), most believed to be cataclysmic variables (CVs). As a potential probe of the old stellar population, in particular CVs, the existence and detectability of novae in the GC remain elusive, due to the prohibitive extinction toward the GC and their relatively low occurrence rate. Nova remnants evolving in the characteristic hot (T~10^6~K) and dense (n_e~10~cm^-3) interstellar medium in the GC may shed light on recent novae and provide useful insight on the GC ecosystem. In this work, we perform hydrodynamical simulations of putative nova remnants in the GC environment and calculate their time-dependent multiwavelength emission to estimate the detectability. Among 79 models sampling the nova parameter space (primarily ejecta mass and velocity), 6, 44, and 51 modelled nova remnants are detectable at their X-ray, radio, and Paschen-α maximum, respectively, for existing Chandra, VLA, and HST observations of the GC. The predicted peak luminosities are ~10^32~erg~s<sup>-1</sup>, ~10^31~erg~s<sup>-1</sup>, and ~10^36~erg~s<sup>-1</sup> in these three bands and the detectable window ranges from weeks to notably hundred years. By specifying a CV population of the nuclear star cluster, we estimate the probability of detecting at least one remnant to be 20%, 8%, and 18% in X-rays, radio, and Paα. The nova remnant would be best resolved in the X-ray band. Our study highlights the potential for detecting nova remnants through further observations, leveraging JWST and the potentially forthcoming AXIS and SKA.

We exploit a new sample of around 400 bright dusty galaxies from the ALMA CHAMPS Large Program, together with the rich JWST multi-band data products in the COSMOS field, to explore and validate new selection methods for identifying dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). Here, we present an effective empirical selection criterion based on a newly defined parameter: I_star = log(M_star) x log(SFR). Incorporating the F277W-F444W color as a second parameter further improves the purity of the selection. We then apply this method to the COSMOS2025 catalog to search for fainter dusty galaxy candidates below the ALMA CHAMPS detection limit and, through a stacking technique, identify a population of high-redshift (z=6-8) DSFGs with an average flux density ofS_1.2mm = 0.15uJy and a space density of ~6E-6 Mpc^-3. This faint population seems to have been missed by most of the previous submillimeter/millimeter surveys, and ground- and space-based UV-to-NIR surveys. Finally, we discuss the possibility of an evolutionary connection between the z &gt; 10 UV-bright galaxies recently discovered by JWST, the faint dusty z=6-8 galaxies identified here, and the population of z=3-5 massive quiescent galaxies, potentially linked as progenitor-descendant populations based on their abundance, redshifts, and stellar masses.

JWST has uncovered a substantial population of Massive (M<sub>&sext;</sub> ≳ 10^10  M<sub>&odot;</sub>), Quenched Galaxies (MQGs) in the early Universe (z ≳ 2), whose properties challenge current galaxy formation models. In this paper, we examine this population of MQGs within the new COLIBRE cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We report number densities and stellar mass functions in broad agreement with the latest observations. The predicted quenching and formation timescales are qualitatively consistent with observational inferences. Leveraging the state-of-the-art physics in COLIBRE, the model predicts that MQGs have dust and H<sub>2</sub> fractions more than 1 dex lower than their massive star-forming counterparts; while their sizes and kinematics remain broadly similar. We further explore the processes driving galaxies to become massive and quenched in COLIBRE, identifying active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback as the primary quenching mechanism. Compared to star-forming galaxies of similar mass, MQGs host more massive black holes (BHs) and exhibit higher star formation efficiencies. These differences arise from their environments, particularly at local (0.3 cMpc) to intermediate scales (1.0 cMpc) before quenching, where overdense regions are associated with enhanced gas inflows, higher BH accretion and, hence, feedback power. We find that about 55&percnt; of MQGs survive as the main progenitors of z=0 galaxies when they are selected at z=3, although up to 55&percnt; experience rejuvenation episodes. Our results provide robust predictions for MQGs, show that tensions with observations are reduced when an effective observational uncertainty is forward-modelled, and clarify the mechanisms behind their origin.

The earliest stages of star formation are highlighted by complex interactions between accretion, outflow, and radiative processes, which shape the chemical and physical environment of the emerging protostar. James Webb Space Telescope observations of the low-mass, low-luminosity Class 0 protostar IRAS 16253-2429 reveal a central compact source. This object exhibits a rich mid-infrared emission spectrum of OH pure rotational lines and CO<sub>2</sub> ro-vibrational lines. Unusually for a young stellar object, it has no mid-infrared line emission from H<sub>2</sub>O to match the other molecules. We demonstrate that the emitting OH molecules arise from UV photodissociation of H<sub>2</sub>O in its second absorption band at λ= 114-145 nm, and that the OH emission is a fluorescent cascade starting with highest-excitation rotational states. This situation offers the opportunity of using the infrared OH spectrum to measure the UV flux from the central protostar. Thereby we determine the disk-star accretion rate to be 3 × 10^-10  M_\sun  year^-1, and demonstrate that the system luminosity arises mostly from the protostar's photosphere rather than from accretion luminosity. The result is in accord with the measured outflow rate of IRAS 16253-2429 and lies within the outflow/accretion-flow rate trend often inferred for protostars; and with episodic accretion as the dominant mechanism by which this protostar has grown.

Luminous quasars at the redshift frontier z&gt;7 serve as stringent probes of super-massive black hole formation and they are thought to undergo much of their growth obscured by dense gas and dust in their host galaxies. Fully characterizing the symbiotic evolution of SMBHs and hosts requires rest-frame optical observations that span spatial scales from the broad-line region to the ISM and CGM. JWST now provides the necessary spatially resolved spectroscopy to do so. But the physical conditions that regulate the interplay between SMBHs and their hosts at the highest redshifts, especially the nature of early feedback phases, remain unclear. We present JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of J0313-1806 at z=7.64, the most distant luminous quasar known. From the restframe optical spectrum of the unresolved quasar, we derive a black hole mass of M_BH=(1.63 ± 0.10)×10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> based on Hβ and an Eddington rate of λ=L/L_Edd=0.80± 0.05, consistent with previous MgII-based estimates. J0313-1806 exhibits no detectable [O III] emission on nuclear scales. Most remarkably, we detect an ionized gas shell extending out to ~ 1.8 kpc traced by Hβ emission that also lacks any significant [O III], with a 3σ upper limit on the [O III] λ5007 to Hβ flux ratio of log_10 ≤ft( F([OIII])/F(Hβ))=-1.15. Through photoionization modelling, we demonstrate that the extended emission is consistent with a thin, clumpy outflowing shell where [OIII] is collisionally de-excited by dense gas. We interpret this structure as a fossil remnant of a recent blowout phase, providing evidence for episodic feedback cycles in one of the earliest quasars. These findings suggest that dense ISM phases may play a crucial role in shaping the spectral properties of quasars accross cosmic time.

One of JWST's most unexpected discoveries is the emergence of "Little Red Dots'' (LRDs): compact sources at z ≳ 3 with blue rest-frame UV continua, red optical slopes, and broad Balmer emission lines that challenge standard models and suggest a population of early, unusual active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Using a comprehensive photometric selection and public NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy across six JWST deep fields, we identify a large sample of 118 LRDs with high-S/N spectra, enabling a population-wide analysis of their UV-optical continuum and emission lines. We find clear correlations between rest-frame color ([0.3-0.9 μm]) and slopes: bluer LRDs have blue UV slopes (β_ν,UV ~ 0.3) and red optical slopes, while redder LRDs exhibit redder UV slopes (β_ν,UV ~ 1.1). The continuum shape shows a similar trend: redder LRDs display prominent Balmer breaks and curvature, while bluer LRDs follow power-law-like optical SEDs. From literature compilations, ~60% of known broad-line AGNs satisfy our LRD criteria, and up to 90% of LRDs show broad Balmer lines. Emission-line diagnostics reveal a shift from high H_α/H_β and low [OIII]&lambda;5007/H_β in redder LRDs to the opposite in bluer ones, along with stronger narrow-line equivalent widths, suggesting a transition from AGN- to host-dominated emission. We fit the spectra with a two-component model combining a gas-enshrouded black hole (BH) and a galaxy host. Redder LRDs require higher-luminosity, unreddened BHs and modestly reddened hosts; bluer LRDs require lower-luminosity, reddened BHs and dust-free galaxies. This framework reproduces the diversity in colors and spectral shape by varying BH luminosity, obscuration, and host-to-BH luminosity ratio.

Over the last 15 years, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has revolutionized astrophysics by providing unprecedented resolution and sensitivity in observing the cold universe, including the formation of stars, planets, and galaxies. With groundbreaking discoveries ranging from the first detailed images of protoplanetary disks to the kinematics of galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization, ALMA has showcased the vast discovery potential of the (sub-)mm wavelength regime. However, in another 15 years from now&ndash;in the 2040s&ndash;the science landscape will have changed dramatically as new major observational facilities will have started their operations or have come towards advanced maturity in their scientific outcome (e.g., JWST, Rubin Observatory, ELT, Euclid, Gaia, Plato, Ariel, Roman Space Telescope, SPHEREx, LiteBIRD, LISA, SKA and others). At the same time, ALMA's current Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade will have been in place for ~10 years, and ALMA itself will have been operational for 30 years. To fully exploit this era, the community needs a next-generation facility operating at (sub-)mm wavelengths with capabilities far beyond those possible within ALMA's current infrastructure. To this end, ALMA2040 is a community-driven initiative to define the key scientific questions of the 2040s and translate them into a technical vision for a next-generation transformational (sub-)millimeter facility. Our goal with this document is to summarize the current status of the effort, synthesize outcomes from the 2025 workshops, outline next steps toward a reference design concept, and invite broad participation from the global mm/sub-mm community to help shape this future facility. In the following we provide details on the process and scope. We invite everyone who wishes to join the effort and/or contribute to the dedicated White Papers planned for 2026.

The JWST MIRI detector exhibits a flux deficit persistence, but its timescales and impacts remain largely uncharacterized, particularly at the longest imaging wavelengths. In this study, we analyze full-field MIRI imager observations at 21 μm (F2100W) to quantify detector persistence following a saturation event by a bright (K = 5.65 mag) nearby (8.12 ± 0.04 pc) mid M-dwarf star, IRAS 21500+5903. Unlike typical persistence that appears as excess flux, this effect presents as a flux deficit in pixels previously illuminated by the saturating or near saturating source. We measure persistence at two post-saturation epochs: shortly after saturation (11.6 minutes) and an hour later (1.39 hours). Immediately after the saturation event, we detect a persistence level of 1.69 ± 0.10%. By fitting a Bayesian exponential decay model to the two epochs, we estimate that persistence decreases to one-tenth of its initial value after 5.16^+1.49_-0.94 hours. We examine the implications of persistence for MIRI high-contrast imaging using the imager (not coronagraphy). Specifically, we discuss how MIRI detector persistence can produce false-positive exoplanet signals in direct imaging surveys, as well as degrade PSF subtraction, particularly at small inner working angles. We also outline mitigation strategies to avoid these impacts in future observations.

### 84) [2512.15127](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15127v2): Stellar Morphology of Optically Dark or Faint Galaxies at z&gt;3 with JWST

JWST offers an unprecedented view of optically dark or faint galaxies (OFGs), previously missed by HST. They are likely massive, heavily dust-obscured star-forming galaxies (SFGs) that substantially contribute to the cosmic SFR density at z&gt;3. To identify drivers of their high dust attenuation and their role in early universe galaxy evolution, we analyse the stellar morphology of 65 OFGs (from 1892 SFGs at 3&lt;z&lt;4) using NIRCam/F444W imaging from the PRIMER and CEERS fields. We study correlations between dust attenuation (A_v) and galaxy properties, like stellar mass, size, and orientation, and compare scaling relations between OFGs and typical SFGs. We find that OFGs are ~8-9 times more massive and ~4 times more dust attenuated than the parent sample. Structurally, OFGs resemble parent SFGs in median R_e and median Σ_R_e but may be slightly rounder on average. While A_v strongly correlates with stellar mass, it does not show significant dependence on stellar mass-normalised effective radius and stellar mass surface density, Sérsic index, axis ratio, or SFR surface density. The mass-size and mass-surface density relations place OFGs as a higher-mass extension of SFGs, with no concrete proof of evolutionary differences between them. This suggests that OFGs are heavily dust-obscured primarily due to their high stellar masses, which facilitates dust production and retention, with older stellar populations likely contributing as well. Although some OFGs exhibit high Σ_R_e and occupy regions of the mass-size plane similar to quiescent galaxies, the overall sample is not representative of this. Their current structures resemble typical SFGs, with no concrete signs of rapid compaction. Diversity in their physical properties shows that OFGs span a range of evolutionary states with few showing reduced star formation, while most remain actively star-forming.

High-redshift (z &gt; 3), massive quiescent galaxies (QGs) offer a significant window into early Universe galaxy formation. Previous works have predicted miscellaneous properties for these quiescents, from an overdensity of neighbors to elevated quenched fractions among such neighbors (i.e. galactic conformity). However, due to a scarcity in highly-resolved deep-field observations until recently, these properties have not been closely examined and pose unresolved questions for galaxy evolution. With new photometric-redshift catalogs from JWST data in the COSMOS-Web field, we present the S\hatONG sample, comprising 171 photometrically selected massive (≥10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) QGs with 3≤ z<sub>phot</sub> &lt; 5. We look for low-mass neighbors around our sample and find substantial populations of star-forming galaxies (SFGs), contrasting the conformity effect at low-z. Our QGs also exhibit diverse clustering, from having no neighbors to potentially residing in environments no denser than star-forming equivalents, to being accompanied by SFGs with more stellar mass than the QG itself. Using a geometric method, we also report filamentary signals for 4&percnt; of our sample, suggestive of some QGs' rejuvenation via cold gas accretion. We reapply the analysis on seven spectroscopically confirmed QGs in COSMOS-Web (M_* ~ 10^9-10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) and note similar patterns. Lastly, we report on Saigon, the most distant low-mass quiescent galaxy known to date (z = 4.55, M_* = 1.33 ×10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>); this spectroscopically confirmed QG resides in a protocluster candidate with 11 SFGs. These results pave new paths towards understanding QG environment, while also signaling an opportune era to examine their evolution with JWST.

### 86) [2512.14874](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14874v1): GA-NIFS: the highest-redshift ring galaxy candidate from a head-on collision

Collisional ring galaxies are a rare class of interacting systems, making up only ~0.01% of galaxies in the local Universe. Their formation is typically attributed to a head-on collision of a massive galaxy with a compact satellite (intruder), triggering density waves that, propagating outward, produce the characteristic ring morphology. Here, we present the discovery and detailed analysis of GS18660, the most distant ring galaxy known to date, at z=3.08, identified in JWST/NIRSpec IFS observations as part of the GA-NIFS programme. This work aims to characterise the physical and dynamical properties of GS18660 and shed light into the formation of its ring. Specifically, we analyse the ionized gas properties, stellar populations, and gas kinematics of the system, and use the observed geometry to constrain the timescale of the collision. Our analysis is based on NIRSpec IFS data, including low-resolution (R~100) spectroscopy covering ~0.2-1.3um rest-frame, and high-resolution (R~2700) spectroscopy covering 0.4-0.8um rest-frame. Multi-wavelength techniques are applied to derive nebular gas conditions and stellar population properties. Gas kinematic analysis reveals that GS18660 exhibits a rotating disk component with an additional radial expansion velocity of ~200 km/s, consistent with a propagating collisional wave. Nebular line diagnostics indicate intense star formation (SFR ~100 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr) along the ring and in the nucleus. Stellar population analysis shows that the most recent star formation episode, occurring within the last ~50 Myr, predominantly took place in the ring. We also identify a close companion, the intruder galaxy responsible for the collision, moving away with a relative velocity of ~425 km/s. The evidence strongly favours a collisional origin for the ring in GS18660, though the presence of a recently formed bar (and hence a resonance ring) cannot be completely excluded.

### 87) [2512.14844](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14844v1): Doubling NIRSpec/IFS capability to calibrate the single epoch black hole mass relation at high redshift

<p> Eleonora Parlanti, Bartolomeo Trefoloni, Stefano Carniani, Francesco D'Eugenio, Michele Perna, Giulia Tozzi, Hannah Übler, Giacomo Venturi, Sandra Zamora </p>
<p>
The recent discovery of a large population of overmassive black holes (BHs) in the early Universe challenges the validity of the BH-host galaxy coevolution framework. However, the reliability of the estimated BH masses (M_BH) is being questioned, as these are typically derived using single-epoch (SE) relations calibrated locally. Calibrating SE relations at high redshift would therefore enable more accurate M_BH estimates and help identify potential biases. In this work, we release a data-reduction technique for JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations that doubles the effective wavelength coverage, enabling detection of otherwise inaccessible emission. Whenever adjacent dispersers are required, observers should carefully evaluate the tradeoff between integrating longer in the bluer configuration alone versus distributing the exposure time across two dispersers. We apply this pipeline to a sample of 5 quasars at z~2 with M_BH independently measured through reverberation mapping (RM). This enables a joint analysis of both Hβ and Hα; the latter lying beyond the nominal wavelength range. We assess the reliability of the most widely adopted SE calibrations, finding that Hβ yields the closest agreement with RM-based M_BH estimates, whereas Hα-based estimators exhibit a larger scatter. For the least massive BH in our sample (M_BH,RM~10^7.5M<sub>&odot;</sub>), which is accreting at a rate close to the Eddington limit (λ_Edd=0.8), all SE calibrators overestimate M_BH, RM by one order of magnitude. This may indicate a systematic overestimation of M_BH for highly accreting BHs at high redshift. Finally, we provide the first high-redshift SE calibration based on Hα and Hβ. Although a larger sample is needed to reduce the uncertainties, our calibration can already be applied to the newly discovered BH population in the early Universe.

Pirzkal </p>
<p>
The dust content of star-forming galaxies is generally positively correlated with their stellar mass. However, some recent JWST studies have shown the existence of a population of dwarf galaxies with an unexpectedly large dust attenuation. Using the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) data, we identified a sample of 1361 highly extincted low-mass (HELM) galaxies, defined as dwarf galaxies (M_*&lt;10^8.5) with Av&gt;1mag or more massive galaxies with an exceptionally high dust attenuation given their stellar mass (i.e., Av&gt;1.6log_10(M_*/Mo)-12.6). The selection is performed using the multiparameter distribution obtained through a comprehensive spectral energy distribution fitting analysis, based on optical to near-infrared data. After excluding possible contaminants, like brown dwarfs, little red dots, high-z (z&gt;8.5) and ultra-high-z (z&gt;15) galaxies, the sample mainly includes sources at z&lt;1, with a tail extending up to z=7.2. The sample has a median stellar mass of 10^7 Mo and a median dust attenuation of Av=2mag. We analysed the morphology, environment and star-formation rate of these sources to investigate the reason of their large dust attenuation. In particular, HELM sources have sizes (effective radii, Re) similar to non-dusty dwarf galaxies and no correlation is visible between the axis ratios (b/a) and the dust attenuation. This findings indicate that it is unlikely that the large dust attenuation is due to projection effects, but a prolate or a disk-on oblate geometry are still possible, at least for a subsample of the sources. We have found that the distribution of HELM sources is slightly skewed toward more clustered environments than non-dusty dwarfs and tend to be slightly less star forming. This finding, if confirmed by spectroscopic follow-up, indicates that HELM sources could be going through some environmental processes, such as galaxy interactions.

### 89) [2512.14695](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14695v1): JWST Observations of the Double Nucleus in NGC 4486B: Possible Evidence for a Recent Binary SMBH Merger and Recoil

<p>
A recent study of the compact elliptical galaxy NGC 4486B using JWST-NIRSpec IFU kinematics confirmed a supermassive black hole (SMBH) of mass M_BH=3.6±0.7×10^8 (~8% of the stellar mass). In addition to its double nucleus, the nuclear kinematics show pronounced asymmetries: a velocity-dispersion peak displaced by 6 pc from the galaxy center and a ~16 km/s offset in the mean stellar line-of-sight velocity near the SMBH. We examine the origin of the 12 pc double nucleus and these asymmetries and show that the observations favor an SMBH surrounded by an eccentric nuclear disk (END). END formation models require the SMBH to experience a gravitational wave (GW) recoil following a binary SMBH merger. Our orbit-superposition models contain ~50% retrograde stars at the edge of the nuclear region, in striking agreement with END-formation simulations. We infer a pre-merger mass ratio q&gt;0.15 and a recoil kick of ~340 km/s. Our N-body simulations show that with such a kick, the SMBH returns to the center within ~30 Myr. Its flat central core is also consistent with earlier binary black hole scouring. We test two alternative mechanisms-buoyancy-driven oscillations and a pre-merger SMBH binary-but neither reproduces the observed offsets, favoring the GW-kick scenario. Our direct N-body simulations further show that a prograde SMBH binary in a rotating host can stall in a corotation resonance, delaying coalescence. Thus, although NGC 4486B is an old, relaxed galaxy near the Virgo cluster center, its SMBH appears to have merged only recently, making its nucleus a rare nearby laboratory for studying post-merger SMBH dynamics.

We present deep ALMA Band 7 observations of the [OIII] 88μm line and underlying dust continuum emission in four UV-bright, gravitationally lensed (magnification μ= 1.4-3.8), JWST-selected galaxies at z = 8.5 - 10.3, with observed magnitudes -22.5 ≲ M_UV ≲ -20.5. [OIII] 88μm is confidently detected in UNCOVER-10646 at z=8.5080 ± 0.0011 (15σ) and DHZ1 at z=9.3113 ± 0.0005 (6σ), with both being intrinsically luminous systems [L_[OIII] = (1.1 - 1.6) × 10^9 L<sub>&odot;</sub>] that follow the local [OIII]-SFR relation. [OIII] 88μm remains undetected in the two z&gt;10 targets, including in the z=10.07 X-ray AGN UHZ1, where we obtain a deep limit of L_[OIII] &lt; 6 × 10^7 L<sub>&odot;</sub>. Dust emission is not detected in any individual source nor in a stack (&lt;3σ). The high S/N [OIII] 88μm detection in UNCOVER-10646 uniquely reveals an additional broad component (FWHM = 1366_-329^+473 km/s; ΔBIC≈20) indicative of an ionized outflow. We infer a high outflow rate of M&#775;_out = 128_-46^+80 M<sub>&odot;</sub>yr^-1, corresponding to a mass loading factor η= M&#775;_out/SFR = 2.9_-1.0^+1.8 that is broadly consistent with theoretical predictions and JWST-based studies of ionized outflows at high redshift. While high-resolution ALMA follow-up is required to confirm the outflow, this first systematic study at z&gt;8 highlights the unique diagnostic power of [OIII] 88μm in characterizing galaxies in the early Universe.

Full sky coverage with 30-40 meter-class telescopes is essential to answer fundamental questions in Astrophysics, Cosmology, and Physics, such as the composition of the Universe and the formation of the first stars and supermassive black holes. An ELT/TMT-like telescope in the Northern Hemisphere is a fundamental and necessary facility to provide multiplexing of observing power, diversity of instrumentation, rapid response, and statistical power required to address the questions and the problems, current and future, unveiled by full sky observatories such as JWST, Euclid, or Roman space telescopes. The Northern ELT/TMT will expedite the study of unique, extreme, rare, transient, and/or high-energy events which will give the most information about fundamental Physics problems in the era of multi-messenger and time-domain Astronomy.

<p>
Observational campaigns with JWST have revealed a higher-than-expected abundance of UV-bright galaxies at z≳10, with various proposed theoretical explanations. A powerful complementary constraint to break degeneracies between different models is galaxy clustering. In this paper, we combine PANORAMIC pure parallel and legacy imaging along 34 independent sightlines to measure the cosmic variance (σ_CV) in the number count of Lyman break galaxies at z~10 which is directly related to their clustering strength. We find σ_CV=0.96^+0.20_-0.18, 1.46^+0.54_-0.44, and 1.71^+0.72_-0.59 per NIRCam pointing (~9.7 arcmin<sup>2</sup>, ≲1.5 pMpc at z~10) for galaxies with M_UV&lt;-19.5, -20, and -20.5. Comparing to galaxies in the UniverseMachine, we find that σ_CV is consistent with our measurements, but that the number densities are a factor ≳5 lower. We implement simple models in the UniverseMachine that represent different physical mechanisms to enhance the number density of UV-bright galaxies. All models decrease σ_CV by placing galaxies at fixed M_UV in lower mass halos, but they do so to varying degrees. Combined constraints on σ_CV and the UVLF tentatively disfavor models that globally increase the star formation efficiency (SFE) or the scatter in the M_UV-M_halo relation, while models that decrease the mass-to-light ratio, or assume a power-law scaling of the SFE with M_halo agree better with the data. We show that with sufficient additional independent sightlines, robust discrimination between models is possible, paving the way for powerful constraints on the physics of early galaxy evolution through NIRCam pure parallel imaging.

### 93) [2512.14066](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14066v1): Primordial Black Holes as Seeds for Extremely Overmassive AGN Observed by JWST

<p> Saiyang Zhang, Boyuan Liu, Volker Bromm, Florian Kühnel </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently identified Abell 2744-QSO1 as a compact, metal-poor, black hole (BH) dominated galaxy at z≃ 7. This system exhibits an extreme black-hole-to-stellar mass ratio and unusually low metallicity, posing significant challenges to BH seeding models. Motivated by these discoveries, we perform high-resolution cosmological simulations with a massive primordial black hole (PBH; M_BH=5×10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) seed, incorporating for the first time a fully coupled treatment of PBH accretion, BH feedback, and Population~III/II star formation and stellar feedback. Although PBHs accelerate structure formation through the seed effect, the associated strong thermal feedback from the accretion delays the onset of star formation to z≲ 10, producing short, bursty episodes throughout the subsequent evolution. PBH-driven outflows expel enriched gas from the nucleus, while sustained inflows from the intergalactic medium continuously replenish pristine material. This feedback-regulated cycle naturally yields low accretion rates (m&#775;_BH/m&#775;_edd ~ 1-10&percnt;), subsolar metallicities (Z/Z<sub>&odot;</sub>≲10^-2) and extreme M_BH/M<sub>&sext;</sub> ratios during both the initial star-forming phase and the subsequent quenching phases, in excellent agreement with JWST observations. Our results demonstrate that massive PBHs offer a viable pathway for forming the most extreme high-redshift systems, providing a physically motivated explanation for the extraordinary properties of Abell 2744-QSO1, as a sub-class of the broader population of JWST-discovered "little red dots".

We leverage the overmassive black holes (M_BH/M<sub>&ast;</sub> ≈0.1) present in a realization of the BRAHMA cosmological hydrodynamic simulation suite to investigate their role in the emission of the unique "little red dot'' (LRD) objects identified by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We find that these black holes can produce LRD-like observables when their emission is modeled with a dense gas cloud shrouding the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Between redshifts 5 and 8, we find the number density of LRDs in this simulation to be 2.04 ± 0.32 × 10^-4 \space Mpc^-3, which is broadly consistent with current estimates for the total LRD population from JWST. Their emission in the rest-frame visible spectrum is dominated by their AGN, which induces the red color indicative of LRDs via a very strong Balmer break. Additionally, the elevated mass of the black holes reduces the temperature of their accretion discs. This shifts the peak of the AGN emission towards longer wavelengths, and increases their brightness in the rest-frame visible spectrum relative to lower mass black holes accreting at the same rate. These simulated LRDs have very minimal dust attenuation (A_V = 0.21 ± 0.12), limiting the amount of dust re-emission that would occur in the infrared, making them very likely to fall below the observed detection limits from observatories like the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). In contrast to the BRAHMA box, the ASTRID simulation produces systematically smaller black holes and predicts LRD number densities that are more than two orders of magnitude lower than current measurements. We therefore conclude that the presence of black holes that are overmassive relative to their host galaxy, and enshrouded in dense gas, is necessary for AGN-dominated LRD models to reproduce both the observed properties and abundances of JWST LRD populations.

### 95) [2512.13932](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13932v1): Cold Gas Infall onto A Brightest Group Galaxy via A Gas-Rich Minor Merger

<p> Ming-Yang Zhuang, Jinyi Shangguan, Yuan Bian, Yue Shen, Luis C. Ho, Min Du, Junyao Li, Zhao-Yu Li, Jing Wang </p>
<p>
Dust and cold gas are not uncommon in nearby early-type galaxies (ETGs), and represent an important aspect of their evolution. However, their origin has been debated for decades. Potential sources include internal processes (e.g., mass loss from evolved stars), external mechanisms (e.g., minor mergers or cooling flows), or a combination of both. Gas-rich minor mergers have long been proposed as an important channel for cold gas fueling in both observations and simulations, but direct evidence of cold gas transportation via gas-rich minor mergers remains elusive, particularly in galaxy groups and clusters where environmental effects are prevalent. In this letter, we present the first unambiguous case of direct cold gas transportation onto a brightest group galaxy (BGG) at z=0.25, driven by an ongoing close-separation gas-rich minor merger with a mass ratio of ~1:56. High-resolution JWST imaging reveals a heavily obscured, low-mass satellite that is barely visible at restframe optical wavelengths. Tidal stripping from this satellite deposits gas and dust onto the BGG, forming prominent ~10 kpc dust lanes in situ. Cosmological simulations indicate that such interactions preferentially occur in gas-rich satellites undergoing their first infall in highly eccentric orbits. Our results highlight the pivotal role of gas-rich minor mergers in replenishing cold gas reservoirs and shaping the evolution of central ETGs in galaxy groups.

### 96) [2512.13778](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13778v2): Resolving dust and Lyα emission in a lensed galaxy at the epoch of reionization with JWST/CANUCS

<p>
Lyman α emission is highly sensitive to dust and neutral hydrogen and is therefore expected to be strongly suppressed in dusty or gas-rich galaxies during the epoch of reionization (EoR). Nevertheless, numerous moderately dusty Lyα emitters (LAEs) are observed at this epoch, suggesting that complex interstellar medium (ISM) geometries and feedback-driven outflows may facilitate Lyα escape. We investigate the dust, gas, and stellar properties of the gravitationally lensed LAE HCM 6A at z=6.5676 to characterize its multiphase ISM and the physical conditions regulating Lyα escape. We combine JWST/NIRISS slitless spectroscopy, HST+JWST/NIRCam imaging, and JWST/NIRSpec slit spectra from the CANUCS program. Using a customized BAGPIPES SED-fitting framework with a flexible attenuation law, we derive stellar, nebular, and dust properties on integrated (~kpc), slit-level (~0.1 kpc), and pixel-level (~25 pc) scales, enabled by strong lensing (μ≈ 8.3-9.1). A Lyα map from SLEUTH traces the spatial distribution of Lyα emission. We measure an unlensed stellar mass of log M<sub>&ast;</sub> = 8.3-8.4 and an intrinsic UV magnitude of M_UV = -19.8 ± 0.1. The older region (S1) is moderately dusty with consistent stellar and nebular attenuation indicators, implying a uniform ISM geometry, while the youngest region (S3) shows strong discrepancies among dust tracers, indicating a feedback-shaped multiphase ISM. Lyα emission arises primarily from S3, where a dust-cleared central clump enables efficient Lyα escape. We find Calzetti-like attenuation curves with a UV bump that strengthens with stellar age and decreasing A_V. Our observations provide a uniquely detailed, spatially resolved view of a moderately dusty LAE during the EoR, demonstrating how feedback and multiphase ISM structure govern Lyα escape.

<p> C. Ventura, M. Tailo, P. Ventura, F. D'Antona, A. P. Milone, A. F. Marino, C. Fiumi </p>
<p>
Context: The study of the Globular Cluster 47 Tuc offers the opportunity to shed new light on the debated issue on the presence of multiple populations in Globular Clusters, as recent results from HST photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy outlined star-to-star differences in the surface chemical composition. Aims: The goal of the present investigation is the interpretation of recent JWST data of the low main sequence of 47 Tuc, in order to explore the stellar to sub-stellar transition, to derive the mass distribution of the individual sources and to disentangle stars from different populations. Methods: Stellar evolution modelling of low-mass stars of metallicity [Fe/H]=-0.78 and oxygen content [O/Fe]=+0.4 and [O/Fe]=0 is used to simulate the evolution of the first and the second generation of the cluster. The comparison between the calculated sequences with the data points is used to characterize the individual objects, to split the different stellar components and to infer the current mass function of the cluster. Results: The first generation of 47 Tuc harbours 45 % of the overall population of the cluster, the remaining 55 % making up the second generation. The transition from the stellar to the sub-stellar domain is found at 0.074 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and 0.07 M<sub>&odot;</sub> for the first and second generations, respectively. The mass function of both the stellar generations are consistent with a Kroupa-like profile down to 0.22 M<sub>&odot;</sub>.

<p> Moka Nishigaki, Kimihiko Nakajima, Masami Ouchi, Peter Behroozi, Minami Nakane, Yui Takeda, Hiroya Umeda, Hidenobu Yajima, Hiroto Yanagisawa </p>
<p>
We present the statistics of line ratios and direct Te-based metallicities from JWST medium-resolution spectra of 292 galaxies at z=2-10, combining DREAMS observations with those of JADES and CEERS. To remove systematics caused by stellar mass (M<sub>&sext;</sub>) and star formation rate (SFR), we construct stacked spectra binned by redshift within fixed M<sub>&sext;</sub> and SFR ranges, as well as across the full ranges. We find that the [OII]3727/Hb ratio drops by a factor of five from z~3 to 8 at fixed M<sub>&sext;</sub> and SFR, in contrast to the nearly constant [OIII]5007/Hb ratio. We derive metallicities via the direct Te method using the [OIII]4363 line, and identify that high-z galaxies lie on the low-metallicity end of the anti-correlation between ionization parameter and metallicity at z~0. Photoionization modeling demonstrates that the redshift evolution, where metallicity decreases and ionization parameter increases, self-consistently explains the observed line ratios. We then examine the mass-metallicity (MZ) and fundamental (MZ-SFR) relations. Including additional galaxies at z~10-12, we find that the MZ relation monotonically decreases from z~3 to 10 at fixed M<sub>&sext;</sub>, while the MZ-SFR relation shows a significant decline at z&gt;8. Based on the ChemicalUniverseMachine model, this evolutionary trend can be explained by enhanced gas inflow (outflow) by a factor of ~5 (~1.7) at z&gt;8.

<p> Nadara Hudson, Ryan Endsley, John Chisholm </p>
<p>
JWST continues to reveal an astonishing number of massive quiescent galaxies at z&gt;4, with number densities ≳10× higher than model predictions. NIRSpec spectra imply that many of these systems underwent intense starburst episodes (SFR ≳300M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr), though direct evidence of such starbursts in the Gyr largely comes from exceptionally rare dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) selected in the far-infrared. Here, we report the discovery of an extremely red (β=-0.6) yet UV-bright (F115W = 26.0 mag) z~6 star-forming system selected as a Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) over ≈500 arcmin<sup>2</sup> of deep NIRCam imaging. This galaxy (UDS_43065) shows photometric colors implying a prominent Balmer break and strong Hα emission, consistent with a dramatic burst of star formation (SFR ≈ 500-1000 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr) occurring 5-10 Myr ago that formed 20-40% of its total stellar mass (≈1.5×10^10M<sub>&odot;</sub>) with little activity since. This galaxy is one of only two objects with M<sub>&ast;</sub>&gt;10^10M<sub>&odot;</sub> across our full sample of 813 z~6 star-forming LBGs, and the only galaxy with a confident extremely-red UV slope (β&gt;-1). UDS_43065 is clearly resolved yet compact in F444W (r_e=400±10 pc) indicating a very high stellar mass surface density of log(Σ_eff/(M<sub>&odot;</sub> kpc^-2))=10.25±0.13 comparable to quenched z~2-7 galaxies. If the inferred star formation history (SFH) of UDS_43065 is corroborated with further observations, this object would seemingly represent a rarely-seen transitional phase between massive DSFGs and passive systems in the first Gyr, helping resolve the puzzling abundance of early massive quenched galaxies.

To date, many spectroscopic confirmations of z&gt;7 galaxies have been obtained using JWST/NIRSpec prism observations, with most of their physical properties inferred from these observations and corresponding imaging. What is needed are higher-resolution spectra at deeper depths to study these sources in detail. We present The High-(Redshift+Ionization) Line Search (THRILS) program: deep (&gt;8 hr) observations in two pointings of JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy to 1) probe high ionization spectral features in z&gt;8 galaxies that are indicative of top-heavy initial mass functions or growing massive black holes, 2) search for accreting supermassive black holes in typical galaxies at z~4-9 through broad Balmer line emission, and 3) probe the stellar-mass growth histories of massive galaxies. We include spectroscopic redshift measurements for 89 sources from the THRILS data, as well as a detection threshold for the full and half depth integration times of the program.

### 101) [2512.11989](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11989v1): NGDEEP: A New Non-Parametric Measure of Local Star-Formation and Attenuation at Cosmic Noon

<p> Grace M. Forrey, Raymond C. Simons, Jonathan R. Trump, Lu Shen, Anton M. Koekemoer, Micaela B. Bagley, Steven L. Finkelstein, Casey Papovich, Nor Pirzkal </p>
<p>
We introduce a new non-parametric technique to quantify the spatially-resolved relationship between the local star-formation rate (SFR) and dust attenuation. We then apply it to 14 star-forming galaxies at 1.0&lt;z&lt;2.5 using JWST/NIRISS slitless spectroscopy from the NGDEEP survey. First, we construct spatially resolved (~1~kpc per pixel) Balmer decrement (Hα/Hβ) maps of these galaxies and derive their corresponding dust attenuation and intrinsic SFR maps. We then rank-order the map pixels by attenuation and construct a cumulative distribution curve of the total SFR as a function of increasing attenuation. We define A^SFR_10&percnt;, A^SFR_50&percnt;, and A^SFR_90&percnt; as the dust attenuation levels behind which 10&percnt;, 50&percnt;, and 90&percnt; of the total integrated SFR is screened, respectively. These metrics quantify the probability that a given star-forming region lies behind a given level of attenuation. Across the full sample, 50&percnt; of the local star formation occurs behind an attenuation of 3.41 mag or higher (A^SFR_50&percnt;). This indicates that the bulk of star formation in these galaxies is significantly attenuated by dust. The value of A^SFR_10&percnt; equals 1.45 for the average profile, indicating that even the least attenuated star-forming regions are still highly attenuated. The globally measured attenuation more closely matches A^SFR_10&percnt; than A^SFR_50&percnt;. This suggests that the global value is weighted toward the least dust-obscured star-forming regions and significantly underestimates the typical attenuation a star-forming region encounters. Our results demonstrate a new approach for understanding the extremely dusty local conditions of the star-forming interstellar medium in SF galaxies at cosmic noon.

<p>
We present a catalog of 57 high-redshift z&gt;6 galaxy candidates, including 14 spectroscopic confirmations (z = 6.10 &ndash; 9.25), 2 Little Red Dots (z = 4.77, 5.81), and 2 interlopers (z = 3.23, 3.72), based on \JWST NIRCam imaging (7 filters), NIRSpec spectroscopy (PRISM and G395H), and archival \HST imaging (17 filters) of the strong lensing galaxy cluster MACS0647. Our highest redshift confirmation (z = 9.25) is an Extremely Blue Galaxy (presented in~\citealtYanagisawa2024), and here we identify a spectral turnover likely due to damped Lyman-α. We identify an overdensity of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts z = 6.1, confirming the z ~ 6 overdensity identified in \HST images. In one of these galaxies, our high-resolution G395H spectroscopy reveals two spatially resolved components with a velocity difference of ~90 km/s; if these components are gravitationally bound, this would imply a dynamical mass on the order of ~ 10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> given their projected separation. We present spectral line fluxes, widths, and derived physical properties, including stellar masses (10^8 - 10^9  M<sub>&odot;</sub>) and metallicities (10&percnt; - 40&percnt;  Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) for our spectroscopic sample. We note half of our NIRSpec data was obtained with standard 3-slitlet nods and half was obtained with single slitlets yielding similar results, demonstrating the power to observe more sources on a densely packed NIRSpec MSA.

<p>
We present deep JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy of GLIMPSE-16043, a promising z~6 Pop III candidate originally identified through NIRCam photometry as having weak [OIII]λ&lambda;4959,5007 emission. Our follow-up reveals clear [OIII] emission, ruling out a genuine zero-metallicity nature. However, the combination of the measured line fluxes and photometry indicates that its spectral energy distribution requires an extraordinarily strong Balmer jump (-1.66 ± 0.47 mag) and Hα equivalent width (3750±1800 Å), features that cannot be reproduced by current stellar+nebular or pure nebular photoionization models. The only models approaching the observations to almost within 1σ involve a hot (T_eff\!≃\!10^4.7 K) single blackbody embedded in a low-T_e nebular environment, suggestive of scenarios such as a tidal-disruption event or a microquasar with strong disk winds. This cautions that photometric Pop~III selections are vulnerable to contamination when the rest-frame optical continuum is undetected. Motivated by this, we refine the photometric Pop III selection criteria to exclude the locus of extreme Balmer-jump objects. The revised criteria also recover the recently reported spectroscopic candidate AMORE6, demonstrating that the updated selection preserves sensitivity to genuine Pop III-like sources while removing key contaminants. Applying the refined criteria across legacy survey fields and five newly released CANUCS lensing cluster fields, we revisit the Pop III UV luminosity function and estimate the Pop III cosmic star-formation rate density to be ≈[10^-6&ndash;10^-4]~M<sub>&odot;</sub>~yr^-1~cMpc^-3 at z≃6&ndash;7, falling in the range of current theoretical predictions.

<p> Atte Keitaanranta, Peter H. Johansson, Alexander Rawlings, Toni Tuominen, Antti Rantala, Thorsten Naab, Shihong Liao, Bastián Reinoso </p>
<p>
We present a cosmological zoom-in simulation targeting the high redshift compact progenitor phase of massive galaxies, with the most massive galaxy reaching a stellar mass of M<sub>&sext;</sub>=8.5× 10^10  M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z=5. The dynamics of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is modelled from seeding down to their coalescence at sub-parsec scales due to gravitational wave (GW) emission by utilising a new version of the KETJU code, which combines regularised integration of sufficiently massive SMBHs with a dynamical friction subgrid model for lower-mass SMBHs. All nine massive galaxies included in this study go through a gas-dominated phase of early compaction in the redshift range of z~ 7-9, starting at stellar masses of M<sub>&sext;</sub>≳ 10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and ending at a few times M<sub>&sext;</sub>~ 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. The sizes, masses and broad band fluxes of these compact systems are in general agreement with the population of systems observed with JWST known as `Little Red Dots'. In the compact phase, the stellar and SMBH masses grow rapidly, leading to a sharp decline in the central gas fractions. The outer regions, however, remain relatively gas-rich, leading to subsequent off-centre star formation and size growth. Due to the very high central stellar densities (ρ<sub>&sext;</sub>≳ 10^13 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/kpc^3), the SMBHs merge rapidly, typically just ~ 4-35 Myr after the SMBH binaries have become bound. Combining KETJU with the phenomenological PhenomD model resolves the complete evolution of the GW emission from SMBH binaries through the Pulsar Timing Array frequency waveband up to the final few orbits that produce GWs observable with the future LISA mission.

<p>
It has been over 24 years since the iconic Crab Nebula has been visited by the high spatial resolution eye of the Hubble Space Telescope. The expanding nebula is dynamic on these timescales, with many of the outer filaments of the nebula known to show proper motions of 0.3'' or more per year. Over time, it has become increasingly difficult to compare the fine scale structure of the nebula with recent data at other wavelengths. We have re-observed the Crab in an HST Cycle 31 program using the WFC3 camera and filters similar to those previously used to make the existing mosaic that dates from 1999-2000 and was obtained with the WFPC2 camera. Two central fields were observed with the F487N filter, providing an uncontaminated hydrogen band for comparison. We also observed two primarily continuum band filters (F547M and F763M), allowing us to study the optical synchrotron nebula component of the Crab's emission. We compare these new data to the first epoch of WFPC2 data as well as to more contemporaneous NIR/MIR imagery from JWST. Finally, we highlight two previously unrecognized groupings of filaments with similar emission characteristics that are nearly diametrically opposed from the pulsar but whose origin remains uncertain.

### 106) [2512.11050](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11050v1): Balmer Transition Signatures from Gas-Enshrouded, Dust-Poor Active Galactic Nuclei

<p> Zu Yan, Kohei Inayoshi, Kejian Chen, Jingsong Guo </p>
<p>
Little red dots (LRDs), a population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) recently discovered by JWST, show distinctive Balmer-transition features, including prominent Balmer absorption, pronounced Balmer breaks, and large equivalent widths of broad Hα emission, all of which indicate the presence of dense gas surrounding their central black holes. A further key property of LRDs is their large Balmer decrements with broad Hα/Hβ line-flux ratios far exceeding the Case B recombination value. These ratios of Hα/Hβ&gt;3 have often been interpreted as evidence for heavy dust extinction (A_V≳ 3 mag), however such dust would inevitably produce strong near-to-mid infrared re-emission that is hardly seen in JWST/MIRI observations. To investigate the physical origin of these observed Balmer features, we perform radiation transfer calculations through dust-free, dense gas. We show that the observed large Balmer decrements (Hα/Hβ and Hα/Hγ) naturally arise from Balmer resonance scattering without invoking dust. At sufficiently high densities (n_H ≳ 10^8-10~cm^-3), the elevated multiple Balmer-line ratios converge to values that closely mimic dust reddening, explaining why LRD spectra resemble obscured AGNs. Furthermore, when the Balmer break and broad Balmer lines originate in the same dense gas, their strengths are physically linked, allowing us to constrain the density structure and infer a low broad-line region gas mass of ~ O(10~M<sub>&odot;</sub>). Such a small gas reservoir would be enriched by even a single supernova, implying that LRDs with observed low-metallicity signatures likely experienced minimal star formation in their nuclei.

### 107) [2512.11042](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11042v1): MIRACLE III. JWST/MIRI expose the hidden role of the AGN outflow in NGC 1068

Zanchettin </p>
<p>
We present new JWST IFS observations of the active galaxy NGC 1068, combining Mid-IR and optical IFS data from MIRI and MUSE to characterize the multi-phase circumnuclear gas properties and its interaction with the AGN outflow and radio jet. MIRI data trace the multiphase gas emission up to 400 pc from the nucleus at 20&ndash;60 pc resolution, unveiling a clumpy ionized structure around the radio hot-spots and a rotating warm molecular disc. Innovative Mid-IR diagnostic diagrams highlight the role of the AGN as the main excitation source for the ionized gas in the entire MIRI field of view, consistent with optical diagnostics, and supporting the AGN-driven wind scenario. Density sensitive [NeV] and [ArV] Mid-IR transitions reveal high-density clumps (n_e &gt; 10**4 cm**-3) along the edges of the jet and outflow, tracing gas compression by the expanding wind. We combined multi-cloud kinematic (MOKA) and photo-ionization (HOMERUN) modeling to characterize the ionized outflow properties and found that [OIV] traces an outflow 300 km/s faster than that inferred from [OIII], showing that the two lines originate from distinct gas components. This kinematic dichotomy is confirmed by the photoionization analysis, which requires a dust-poor component dominating the optical lines and a dust-rich component responsible for the Mid-IR emission. The Mid-IR-revealed dusty component carries a significantly larger ionized-gas mass than what can be inferred from optical lines alone, showing that most of the outflowing mass is hidden from classical optical diagnostics. Our modelling point to a two-stage acceleration scenario, with velocities up to ~2000 km/s, consistent with an energy-driven wind. Our findings indicates that the outflow entrains up to a few 10**6 solar masses of ionized gas and couples efficiently with the surrounding ISM, injecting turbulence and impacting the host-galaxy environment.

### 108) [2512.11022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11022v1): An Active Galaxy Cluster Merger at Cosmic Noon Revealed by JWST Weak Lensing and Multiwavelength Probes

<p>
The galaxy cluster XLSSC 122 is a rare system at z = 1.98, hosting surprisingly evolved member galaxies when the Universe was only one-third of its present age. Leveraging deep JWST/NIRCam imaging, we perform a weak-lensing analysis and reconstruct the cluster's mass distribution, finding a mass peak that coincides with both the X-ray peak and the position of the brightest cluster galaxy. We obtain mass and concentration estimates of M_200c=1.6 ± 0.3× 10^14~M<sub>&odot;</sub> and c_200 c=6.3 ± 0.3, respectively, in agreement with recent strong-lensing estimates. The high concentration in particular motivates tests against empirical and simulation-derived mass&ndash;concentration relations. Placing our weak-lensing mass map in the context of Chandra X-ray data, MeerKAT radio imaging, ALMA+ACA/ACT Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) mapping, and a new JWST intracluster light measurement, we identify consistent NE&ndash;SW elongation across datasets and a pronounced offset along the same axis between the SZ and mass/X-ray peaks, pointing to significant merger activity. XLSSC 122 thus serves as a JWST pilot study for high-z lensing, demonstrating the telescope's unique ability to map cluster mass distributions at z~2 and motivating a uniform sample of analogous systems with joint lensing, X-ray, SZ, and radio data to probe cluster assembly at Cosmic Noon.

We present a comprehensive study of the ionizing properties of 1721 galaxies at 5.6&lt;z&lt;6.5 using deep JWST/NIRCam photometric imaging from the NEP, JADES, and PRIMER surveys spanning an unmasked area ~550arcmin<sup>2</sup> across UV magnitudes -22≲ M_UV≲-17.5. Our 90&percnt; stellar mass complete sample suggests little relation of UV slope with magnitude, β_UV=(-0.040±0.022)M_UV-2.88^+0.43_-0.44, implying f<sub>esc</sub>^LyC≃5&percnt; based on calibrations from the Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS). We measure a constant ionizing photon production efficiency with UV magnitude, log_10(ξ<sub>ion</sub>, 0/Hz erg^-1) = -0.006^+0.019_-0.017~M_UV + 25.05^+0.39_-0.34, consistent with HST canonical values. The total production rate of photons escaping into the IGM is computed as log_10(\dotn<sub>ion</sub>/s<sup>-1</sup>Mpc^-3)=50.31^+0.07_-0.06 for M_UV&lt;-17 galaxies from our star forming and smouldering UV luminosity functions (UVLFs), which differ in the faint-end slope (α_SFG=-2.2±0.2; α_sm=-1.7±0.2). Extrapolating to the latest UVLF turnover limits from the massive lensing galaxy cluster Abell S1063 (M_UV, lim=-13.5) implies that a recombination-weighted HII clumping factor C_HII, rec=6.2^+4.1_-2.1 is required to produce fully stably reionized at z≃6. A clumping factor of this magnitude resolves the ionizing photon budget crisis. Our methodology paves the way for indirect clumping measurements from galaxies which will provide insight into earlier stages of the EoR when the Lyα-forest becomes saturated and more direct quasar measurements become impossible.

### 110) [2512.10516](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10516v2): Isotopomer-Specific Carbon Isotope Ratio of Complex Organic Molecules in Star-Forming Cores

<p> Ryota Ichimura, Hideko Nomura, Kenji Furuya, Tetsuya Hama, T. J. Millar </p>
<p>
The recent observation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar ices by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), along with previous gas-phase detections, underscores the importance of grain surface and ice mantle chemistry in the synthesis of COMs. In this study, we investigate the formation and carbon isotope fractionation of COMs by constructing a new astrochemical reaction network that distinguishes the position of ^13C within species (e.g., H^13COOCH_3 and HCOO^13CH_3 are distinguished). We take into account the position of ^13C in each species in gas and solid phase chemistry. This new model allows us to resolve isotopomer-specific ^12C/^13C ratios of COMs formed in the star-forming cores. We consider thermal diffusion-driven radical-radical reactions on the ice surface and non-thermal radiolysis chemistry in the bulk (surface + mantle) ice. We find that carbon isotope fractionation of the functional groups in COMs appears through both non-thermal radiolysis in cold environments and thermal diffusion in warm environments, depending on the COMs. In particular, COMs containing methyl groups show isotopomer differences in ^12C/^13C ratios that reflect their formation pathways and environments. These isotopomer-resolved fractionation patterns provide a diagnostic tool to probe the origins of COMs in star-forming cores. Our results suggest that future comparisons between high-sensitivity isotopic observations and isotopomer-specific models will be helpful for constraining the relative contributions of thermal and non-thermal formation processes of COMs.

### 111) [2512.09996](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09996v1): GA-NIFS: Powerful and frequent outflows in moderate-luminosity AGN at z~3-6

The period between z ~ 3-6, a key transformational phase in galaxy evolution preceding `cosmic noon' (z ~ 1-3), is very poorly explored in terms of feedback from AGN acting through gas outflows. In this work, we study the properties of outflows in AGN (mostly X-ray-selected) from the GOODS-S field, exploiting JWST NIRSpec IFU observations as part of the GA-NIFS GTO survey. Together with its twin sub-sample from COSMOS reported in a previous GA-NIFS work, this constitutes the largest spatially resolved sample of AGN outflows at these redshifts to date, comprising 16 targets with outflows (out of a total of 19 AGN), and probes the unexplored regime of AGN at z ~ 3-6 with bolometric luminosities ~10^45-46 erg/s. We mapped the rest-optical ionised gas emission lines at sub-kpc scales and spectrally isolated the broad wings tracing fast outflows from the gas at rest in the host galaxies. The incidence of ionised outflows in the GOODS-S + COSMOS GA-NIFS sample is high (&gt;75&percnt;), among the highest at any redshift. We inferred outflow velocities between ~600-2000 km/s, maximum radii of &lt;1-4 kpc, and ionised gas mass outflow rates of ~0.1-100 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr, which in some cases can exceed the host galaxy star formation rate (SFR). We find that the outflow properties inferred for the GOODS-S + COSMOS GA-NIFS AGN sample and their relations with L_bol and SFR generally align with those observed for other spatially resolved literature samples of AGN outflows across different redshifts and AGN luminosities. Nonetheless, after accounting for any luminosity bias, our analysis suggests a cosmic evolution of the outflow properties, with higher median mass outflow rates (and possibly also mass loading factors) at higher redshifts, especially at z&gt;3, indicating that AGN outflows were stronger in the early Universe than at later times, and thus potentially more capable of affecting their host galaxy.

### 112) [2512.09980](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09980v1): UV Luminosity Functions from HST and JWST: A Possible Resolution to the High-Redshift Galaxy Abundance Puzzle and Implications for Cosmic Strings

<p> Mattéo Blamart, Adrian Liu, Robert Brandenberger, Julian B. Muñoz, Bryce Cyr </p>
<p>
Recent observations of high redshift galaxies by the James Webb Space Telescope suggest the presence of a bright population of galaxies that is more abundant than predicted by most galaxy formation models. These observations have led to a rethinking of these models, and numerous astrophysical and cosmological solutions have been proposed, including cosmic strings, topological defects that may be remnants of a specific phase transition in the very early moments of the Universe. In this paper, we integrate cosmic strings, a source of nonlinear and non-Gaussian perturbations, into the semi analytical code Zeus21, allowing us to efficiently predict the ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF). We conduct a precise study of parameter degeneracies between star-formation astrophysics and cosmic-string phenomenology. Our results suggest that cosmic strings can boost the early-galaxy abundance enough to explain the measured UVLFs from the James Webb and Hubble Space Telescopes from redshift z = 4 to z = 17 without modifying the star-formation physics. In addition, we set a new upper bound on the string tension of Gμ≤ssapprox 10^-8 (95&percnt; credibility), improving upon previous limits from the cosmic microwave background. Although with current data there is some level of model and prior dependence to this limit, it suggests that UVLFs are a promising avenue for future observational constraints on cosmic-string physics.

### 113) [2512.09815](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09815v1): Footprints in the Wind: Probing X-ray Outflows in NGC 7469 using Near-Infrared Emission Lines

<p> Léa M. Feuillet, Steve Kraemer, Anna Trindade Falcão, Valentina Braito, Marcio Meléndez, Henrique R. Schmitt, James N. Reeves, Riccardo Middei, Travis C. Fischer, Mitchell Revalski </p>
<p>
AGN winds play an important role in the co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies, yet their driving mechanisms and impact on star formation remain subjects of active investigation. Critically, the lack of X-ray Integral Field Units currently limits our ability to acquire spatially resolved velocity information in the X-ray regime. However, instead, this can be achieved using the James Webb Space Telescope. As part of an ongoing investigation of the nuclear feedback processes in the nearby luminous AGN NGC 7469, we present an analysis of the kinematics of the X-ray emitting outflows using near-infrared footprint lines such as [Mg VIII] 3.03 um. These high-ionization emission lines are associated with the same gas analyzed in the X-ray, and thus can be used to probe the footprint of the X-ray wind's velocity structure and ionization state. Thanks to the wide wavelength range available with JWST we also use nebular (e.g. [S IV] 10.51 um) and coronal (e.g. [Ne V] 14.32 um) emission lines to offer a comprehensive multi-phase view of the outflows. We present mass and kinetic energy outflow rates, and find that while the feedback processes in NGC 7469 are not efficient by theoretical benchmarks, the most massive and energetic component is the high ionization X-ray gas.

### 114) [2512.09512](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09512v1): SLICE &ndash; Combining Strong Lensing and X-ray in AC 114. Insights into the Merger Scenario

<p>
AC114 is a historically significant galaxy cluster, being one of the first strong lensing clusters detected from the ground in the early 1990s, prior to the launch of the HST. Despite this early prominence, no detailed lensing analyses have been carried out for more than fifteen years. We here study this cluster using JWST imaging obtained as part of the SLICE program, complemented by archival HST and X-ray observations. JWST data reveal ten new multiply imaged systems and enable the identification of conjugate substructures in several of the sixteen systems, significantly increasing the number of strong lensing constraints. Using these data, we construct a parametric mass model with Lenstool and extend it by explicitly incorporating the Chandra data in a combined strong lensing+X-ray fit. Our best-fit model reproduces the multiple images with an RMS of 0.4" while simultaneously matching the X-ray data. The dark matter distribution is unimodal and centered on the brightest cluster galaxy, with a large core radius of 83+-5kpc, consistent with values reported in other strong lensing clusters. The strong lensing constraints require the inclusion of an external shear component which position angle points unambiguously towards a nearby (~1Mpc), well defined mass concentration at the same redshift in the North-West, for which we propose the naming AC114b. The spatial coverage of the XMM-Newton data encompasses the whole structure, allowing us to probe the X-ray properties of the companion cluster and the thermodynamics of AC114, providing evidence for a major merger, in line with previous signatures seen in Chandra, radio and optical spectroscopic data. Our results shed new light on the merging scenario, revealing a major merger caught in a late post-collisional phase, where AC114 is the dominant system and Ac114b has likely been stripped of its hot gas.

<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed an unexpected excess of UV-bright galaxies at z&gt;10, unaccounted for by extrapolations from pre-JWST observations and theoretical models. Understanding the physical properties and star formation histories (SFH) of high redshift systems is key to distinguish between the different proposed scenarios. We identify and analyse a sample of 2420 robust candidates at z~7-14 drawn from the ASTRODEEP-JWST dataset over ~0.2 deg<sup>2</sup> and model their properties with non-parametric SFHs to derive their specific star formation rate (sSFR) and stellar population properties. We find that the median sSFR and M/L remain roughly constant across the probed redshift range. We show that this result is robust against potential systematics unless a hidden population of dust-enshrouded starbursts, undetectable in current data, exists at these redshifts. In any case, the absence of observed high-sSFR systems at the highest redshifts suggests that any dust-free starburst phase must be short-lived. The observed sSFR evolution is in tension with most (though not all) theoretical models, making it a key quantity for discriminating among competing scenarios. The sample shows a wide range of physical conditions and galaxy classes, including systems with low sSFR and high mass-to-light ratios (M/L) up to z~10, indicative of already evolved galaxies only a few hundred Myr after the Big Bang, and different degrees of dust attenuation. We finally attempt to reconstruct the assembly histories of two sub-samples: a) the highest-M/L galaxies at z~7-8, which appear to have formed the bulk of their stars at least 500 Myr before observation, implying progenitors observable as UV-bright sources at z&gt;20, and b) z&gt;11 galaxies, which formed through stochastic SFH, remaining UV-faint for most of their early evolution, before undergoing recent (~50 Myr old) episodes of major growth.

<p>
We investigate the host galaxy of the long gamma-ray burst GRB 230307A, which is associated with a kilonova candidate likely produced by a binary neutron-star (BNS) merger. The transient occurred at a projected offset of ~ 40 kpc from its spiral-galaxy host. We consider two explanations for this large distance: (i) NSs that merge inside a remote globular cluster, or (ii) a BNS that formed in the disk whose orbit was strongly modified by the NS natal kicks. Using JWST data and comparisons with known globular clusters, we show that a globular-cluster origin is extremely unlikely, ruling out case (i). Considering case (ii), using JWST and MUSE data, we derive the host galaxy morphology, stellar mass, estimate the atomic gas (HI+He) contribution, and the host rotation curve. Assuming an NFW halo and applying Bayesian inference, we obtain a mass model for the host galaxy. From this model, we compute the time required for a disk-formed BNS, with a given natal kick, to reach the observed offset while marginalizing over uncertainties and over the initial position in the disk. We compare these results with BNS-merger simulations from the SEVN population-synthesis code combined with PARSEC stellar evolutionary tracks, which provide the coalescence time and kick velocity for each realization. The two approaches have an overlap in the kick-time diagram, but only 0.1&percnt; of the simulated systems fall within the 2σ region of the galaxy mass model. This indicates that a disk origin is possible, but requires fine-tuned conditions for the kilonova to occur at such a large distance from the host galaxy.

Understanding the physical conditions and feedback mechanisms in early massive galaxies is essential to uncover how they formed and evolved during the first billion years of the Universe. In this context, the galaxy EGSY8p7/CEERS-1019 at z=8.6 provides an excellent benchmark, given its stellar mass of 10^9.3M<sub>&odot;</sub> and elevated N/O abundance despite its sub-solar metallicity. In this study, we present new JWST/NIRSpec observations offering the first spatially resolved spectroscopy of this galaxy, with higher sensitivity and spectral resolution than previous studies. We identify broad (FWHM=650km/s) Hβ and [OIII] emission components whose emission is located between the two rest-frame UV clumps of the galaxy and extended over a distance of ~1kpc. The morphology and kinematics of these components indicate that the broad emission arises from outflowing gas rather than from an AGN broad-line region. The kinetic energy injection rate from stellar feedback is an order of magnitude higher than that of the outflow, while the radiation pressure rate is comparable to the outflow momentum rate. These results suggest that stellar feedback alone can drive the outflow, with radiation pressure potentially providing the required momentum transfer. We derive a low mass-loading factor (η=0.16) and ionizing photon escape fraction (f<sub>esc</sub>=0.021±0.014). Together with the high electron density measured (n_e=2200cm^-3), these results support the interpretation that most of the gas remains confined within the galaxy. Comparisons of diagnostic emission-line ratios with photoionization and shock models support a star-formation-driven ionization scenario, ruling out any excitation by AGN radiation. Finally, the absence of detectable Wolf-Rayet features suggests that alternative mechanisms must be considered to explain the high N/O ratio in this galaxy.

### 118) [2512.08543](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08543v1): High-Redshift Galactic Outflows: Orientation Effects, Kinematics, and Metallicity in TNG50 and SERRA

<p>
Context: Recently, JWST/NIRSpec observations have provided the first detections of warm ionised outflows in low-mass galaxies at high redshifts (z&gt;3), revealing an occurrence rate of 25-40% depending on the intensity of the emission lines. This fraction is lower than predicted by simulations, which suggest that fast outflowing gas should be a common feature of all star-forming galaxies in the early Universe. Aims: In order to better understand the discrepancies between simulations and observations, we identify and characterize outflows in high-redshift galaxies using the TNG50 cosmological and SERRA zoom-in simulations. Our study examines how outflow detectability depends on the line of sight, explores the properties of the fast gas, and investigates its relationship with key galactic properties. Methods: We analyse approximately 60000 galaxies from TNG50 and 3000 galaxies from SERRA over the redshift ranges z=3-5 and z=4-5, respectively, spanning stellar masses of Mstar=10^7.5-10^11M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Outflows in the immediate vicinity of each galaxy are identified using a Gaussian mixture model algorithm that uses the gas velocity, star-formation-rate, and location as input parameters. We subsequently compare the simulated outflows to those observed in the JWST/JADES NIRSpec survey. Results: Outflow masses in both TNG50 and SERRA broadly reproduce the JWST/JADES measurements within roughly 0.5dex, though simulations tend to predict slightly higher values, suggesting that optical emission lines capture only a fraction of the multiphase outflow. However, simulated outflow velocities are typically an order of magnitude lower than those inferred from observations. TNG50 indicates a clear orientation dependence as outflows in face-on galaxies are approximately 15% more likely to be detected than in edge-on systems, with this difference increasing to nearly 40% for more massive, disc-shaped galaxies.

We present spatially resolved analysis of stellar populations in the brightest z&gt;6 galaxy known to date (AB mag 23), the strongly lensed MACS0308-zD1 (dubbed the "Cosmic Spear'') at z<sub>spec</sub>=6.2. New JWST NIRCam imaging and high-resolution NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy span the rest-frame ultraviolet to optical. The NIRCam imaging reveals bright star-forming clumps and a tail consisting of three distinct, extremely compact star clusters that are multiply-imaged by gravitational lensing. The star clusters have effective radii of R_eff ~ 5 pc, stellar masses of M_* ~ 10^6-10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, and high stellar mass surface densities of Σ_* &gt; 10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>~pc^-2. While their stellar populations are very young (~ 5-9 Myr), their dynamical ages exceed unity, consistent with the clusters being gravitationally bound systems. Placing the star clusters in the size vs.~stellar mass density plane, we find they occupy a region similar to other high-redshift star clusters within galaxies observed recently with JWST, being significantly more massive and denser than local star clusters. Spatially resolved analysis of the brightest clump reveals a compact, intensely star-forming core. The ionizing photon production efficiency (ξ<sub>ion</sub>) is slightly suppressed in this central region, potentially indicating a locally elevated Lyman continuum escape fraction facilitated by feedback-driven channels.

<p>
We present a comprehensive analysis of the nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) abundance ratio in star-forming galaxies at redshift z~1-6, with a median redshift of z=2.7, using deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy. Leveraging detections of faint auroral emission lines in 76 galaxies at z&gt;1 from both the MARTA survey and a large compilation of high-redshift literature objects, we derive direct electron temperature-based abundances for nitrogen and oxygen using rest-frame optical lines. We establish the first high-redshift calibrations of strong-line N/O diagnostics based on direct abundance measurements, finding no significant evolution for either N2O2 = [NII]6585/[OII]3727,3729 and N2S2 = [NII]6585/[SII]6717,6731 diagnostics compared to local realisations. We then investigate the N/O-O/H relation across cosmic time using both direct abundances and strong-line based measurements (additional 430 galaxies). We find evidence for mild but systematic nitrogen enhancement at high redshift: galaxies at z&gt;1 exhibit N/O ratios elevated by ~0.18 dex (median offset) at fixed O/H compared to the local relation, with a more pronounced enhancement at low metallicity (12+log(O/H) &lt; 8.1) where the offset reaches up to ~0.3-0.4 dex. We consider several scenarios to explain the observed trends, including bursty star formation, differential metal loading, and inflows of pristine gas. Our results provide the most extensive confirmation of elevated N/O ratios at high-redshift to date based on rest-optical diagnostics and within a self-consistent frame.

We present six galaxy-scale strong lenses with HST imaging modeled using GIGA-Lens. This is Paper V of the DESI Strong Lens Foundry series. These systems were discovered in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys using ML/AI methods and confirmed with DESI, Keck/NIRES, and VLT/MUSE spectroscopy. They span z_d = 0.39 - 1.1 and z_s = 1.4 - 3.3. This is the first HST strong lens sample modeled with full forward modeling &ndash; all lens and source parameters sampled simultaneously in a single inference &ndash; with explicit convergence validation using both \widehatR and effective sample size (ESS) for each system. All inferred parameters satisfy \widehatR &lt; 1.1 and ESS ≳ 10,000, demonstrating that GIGA-Lens achieves statistically robust inference even for some of the most complex galaxy-scale lenses known. These results pave the way for scaling to much larger, high-resolution strong lens samples from HST, Euclid, JWST, and Roman. Convergence-validated modeling will be critical for key science goals, including constraining the mass-density profile of galaxies, detecting low-mass dark matter (sub)halos, and delivering precise and accurate cosmological constraints.

<p>
Methods: We obtained adaptive optics-assisted integral field spectroscopy in the near-infrared (IR) K band (1.93-2.47 μm) with VLT/SINFONI, complemented by VLA X and C bands (3-6 cm) and ALMA band 3 (~3.3 mm) observations. Results: The near-IR continuum reveals two infrared sources, IRS 2 and IRS 7, while the main protostellar core IRAS 18162-2048 remains undetected up to 2.47 μm. IRS 7 shows a peculiar Hydrogen Recombination Line Brγ profile with a narrow emission component superimposed on a broad absorption feature, consistent with a B2/B3 zero-age main-sequence star. Extended H<sub>2</sub> emission exhibits a `sawtooth' pattern in the excitation diagram, characteristic of UV radiation in a PDR rather than shock excitation. The radiative transfer model Cloudy reproduces the H<sub>2</sub> ro-vibrational populations for T_gas=600 K and n_H=7.9×10^3 cm^-3. VLA X and C bands observations reveal a compact radio source previously reported as a stationary condensation (SC) and coincident with IRS 7. For the first time, we detect IRS 7/SC in mm wavelengths. The spectral index in the 3-6 cm and 3.3 mm regime is consistent with optically thin free-free emission. Conclusions: Our near-IR and radio observations reveal that IRS 7/SC is a B2/B3 ZAMS star that has begun to photoionise its environment, giving rise to an extended PDR and a compact \ionH ii region. The coexistence of this source with the deeply embedded protostar IRAS 18162-2048 and other bubble-like structures in the field, suggests a multigenerational star-forming environment. Future itJames Webb Space Telescope observations targeting the H<sub>2</sub> pure rotational lines (3-28 μm) and other HRLs less affected by extinction will be essential to characterise the cooler molecular and ionised gas to fully disclose the formation history of the region.

### 123) [2512.07050](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07050v1): JWST reveals extended stellar disks for ALMA-bright dusty star-forming galaxies in the Spiderweb protocluster

<p>
We present JWST/NIRCam imaging of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) detected by Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the Spiderweb protocluster at z=2.16. We identify 22 DSFGs detected by both ALMA and JWST, 10 of which are spectroscopically confirmed as protocluster members. This is the first systematic analysis of a statistical DSFG sample in z~2 protocluster environments using JWST/NIRCam data. Most of the DSFG members exhibit very red colors and reside in the dusty star-forming region of the rest-frame UVJ diagram, indicating strong dust obscuration. The Gini-M20 diagram suggests that most DSFGs in this protocluster are late-type disks, with a significant fraction displaying clumpy and disturbed rest-frame UV/optical morphologies, but few showing clear merger signatures. The DSFG members exhibit relatively large stellar disks and effective radii with a median stellar mass of log(M/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 10.8 +/- 0.3, placing them above coeval field DSFGs and typical protocluster galaxies in the size-mass relation at both rest-frame optical and near-infrared wavelengths. These sizes are comparable to those of more evolved field DSFGs at z~1-2, indicating accelerated structural growth in dense environments. Moreover, these DSFG members show a decreasing trend in stellar size from shorter to longer wavelengths, with a moderately steep slope comparable to coeval field DSFGs. These results may support an inside-out growth scenario for protocluster evolution, in which massive galaxies near the center are more evolved and more strongly affected by AGN feedback and environmental effects, e.g., ram-pressure stripping. We propose that the cold gas accretion at the protocluster outskirts drives intense star formation and stellar disk growth in ALMA-detected DSFGs, which are expected to evolve into massive elliptical galaxies at later stages.

<p>
The visibility of Lyman-α emission at z&gt;7 provides crucial insights into the reionization process and the role of galaxies in shaping the ionized intergalactic medium. Using JWST FRESCO data, we investigate the environments of Lyman-α emitters (LAEs) in the GOODS-N and GOODS-S fields by identifying [OIII] emitters and analyzing their large-scale distribution. Using the FRESCO redshifts, we recover eight new LAEs from archival Keck/MOSFIRE observations at z=7.0-7.7, including a potential AGN candidate at z ~ 7.2. Complemented by six literature LAEs, our sample consists of 14 LAEs in total, all of which are [OIII] emitters except for one very faint source not detected by FRESCO. We define seven groups of [OIII] emitters centered around the brightest LAEs and find that these bright LAEs do not reside in more overdense environments than the average galaxy population. The overdensity parameters for LAEs and [OIII] emitters without Lyman-α, calculated for sources with M_UV&lt;-19.5 to ensure completeness, are similar, indicating that overdensities alone cannot fully explain Lyman-α visibility. While LAEs have slightly higher recent star formation (SFR_10/SFR_50 ≈ 1.3×) and [OIII] EW (≈1.5×), they show no significant differences from [OIII] emitters in UV slope (β), UV magnitude (M_UV), or stellar mass (log_M<sub>&sext;</sub>). Our results suggest that other factors may contribute to the observability of Lyman-α emission. Future spectroscopic surveys with broader wavelength coverage and more complete sampling will be crucial for refining our understanding of reionization.

<p>
Galactic-scale outflows are a crucial component of galaxy evolution, yet their properties in the early universe remain poorly constrained. We present the first statistical investigation of cool gas outflows in galaxies spanning a wide cosmic timeline from z ≈ 1 to z ≈ 10. Using thousands of public JWST/NIRSpec spectra, we employ a signal-to-noise weighted spectral stacking technique on the \ionMg 2 λ&lambda;2796, 2803 absorption doublet. We robustly detect blueshifted \ionMg 2 absorption in all stellar mass and redshift bins. The outflow equivalent width exhibits a strong, positive correlation with stellar mass (M_*) at all epochs, increasing from ~ 1~Å at M_* ≈ 10^9~M<sub>&odot;</sub> to over 3~Å at M_* &gt; 10^10.5~M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Our work provides the first statistical constraints on cool outflows in the low-mass (M_* ≲ 10^9.5~M<sub>&odot;</sub>), high-redshift (z &gt; 3) regime, vital for constraining feedback in the numerous progenitors of typical present-day galaxies. Crucially, the scaling relation between outflow properties and stellar mass shows no significant evolution at z &gt; 3. This suggests a persistent, unevolving feedback mechanism governing the baryon cycle in the early universe, placing strong constraints on models that invoke a fundamental change in feedback physics at Cosmic Dawn, such as the feedback-free starburst model.

<p>
Rotating galaxies with relaxed gaseous disks have been discovered across cosmic time, from the local Universe to high redshift (z&gt;4). But few such sources have been confirmed at z&gt;4, making them a precious sample to examine what conditions result in such ordered kinematics in an early, more chaotic Universe. One of the best examples of this sample is the galaxy DLA0817g1 (z=4.2603), which shows remarkably clear rotation in ALMA [CII] data. We present recent JWST/NIRSpec IFU data (R~2700) of DLA0817g1, which we combine with archival ALMA [CII] observations to place constraints on its ISM conditions and morpho-kinematics. From a combination of line ratios, we find a high gas-phase metallicity (~0.7 solar), high fraction of obscured star formation, low ionisation (compared to other high-redshift galaxies observed with JWST), and no significant evidence for AGN (based on the WHAN diagnostic). Dynamical modelling with 3DBarolo reveal nearly identical rotation in Halpha and [CII], but with a higher velocity dispersion in the former. Using our metallicity estimate and previous CO and [CII] detections, we derive a new estimate of the molecular gas mass, relieving a previous strain in the mass budget. Altogether, we suggest that this is a 'smouldering' galaxy, where past star formation resulted in significant chemical enrichment (i.e., Zgas and Mdust), but the current activity is low (i.e., lower ionisation parameter and electron temperature). These new observations have opened a window into questions regarding the interplay of gas, metallicity, star formation, and kinematics in a prototypical early disk galaxy.

"Little red dots" (LRDs) represent a new population of astronomical objects uncovered by JWST whose nature remains debated. Although many LRDs are suspected as active galactic nuclei (AGN), they show little variability on days-years timescales. We report the discovery of two gravitationally lensed LRDs at redshift ~4.3 behind the cluster RXCJ2211-0350, one of which (RX1) is quadruply imaged with time delays spanning ~130 years. RX1 exhibits intrinsic color and brightness variations of up to 0.7 magnitude among its images. These changes are consistent with blackbody-temperature variations of a photosphere, indicating long-term variability analogous to Cepheid-like pulsations but in a far more extended (R ~ 2000 AU) and massive (M ≳ 10^6   M<sub>&odot;</sub>) systems. These results suggest LRDs as a distinct class of AGN with stellar-like envelopes.

Determining the physical properties of galaxies during the first billion years after the big bang is key to understanding both early galaxy evolution and how galaxies contributed to the epoch of reionization. We present deep ALMA observations of the redshifted [OIII] 88um line for the gravitationally lensed (μ= 11.4±1.9) galaxy A383-5.1 (z=6.027) that has previously been detected in [CII] 158um. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging identified this sub-L* galaxy as a ''Little Red Dot'' (LRD). With a line luminosity of L_[OIII] = (1.29±0.24)×10^8 L<sub>&odot;</sub> (corrected for lensing magnification) A383-5.1 is one of the faintest galaxies with combined [CII] and [OIII] detections. The ALMA data reveal no dust continuum emission, consistent with previous observations. The high line luminosity ratio of [OIII]/[CII] ~ 14±5 is consistent with A383-5.1 being low-metallicity and dust-poor. The non-detection of dust continuum in bands 6 and 8 is consistent with the high [OIII]/[CII] ratio and suggests a presence of a strong ultraviolet radiation field, which would be less affect by dust attenuation, implying that galaxies of this type could contribute significantly to the ionization of the intergalactic medium. The presence of strong ionizing field could provide an important piece of information for understanding the nature of LRDs and their role in cosmic reionization.

### 129) [2512.05041](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05041v1): Probing AGN Feedback in Dwarf Galaxies with Spatially Resolved NIR Coronal Lines from JWST

<p>
We present the first spatially resolved investigation of near-infrared coronal lines in dwarf galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN), using JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy. Coronal lines (CLs), which are forbidden transitions from highly ionized species with ionization potentials up to 450 eV, act as sensitive tracers of the AGN ionizing continuum and feedback processes. Across four dwarf galaxies with ionized gas outflows traced by the optical [O III] lines, we report the detection of 16 unique species of near-infrared CLs. Line ratio diagnostics indicate that photoionization from the AGN dominates the excitation of CLs. We find that the coronal line region in dwarf galaxies, traced by the various CLs, extends up to 0.5 kpc, and can constitute up to 10% of their host galaxy size. Correlations between CL luminosities and [O III] ionized gas outflow properties are consistent with a scenario in which AGN-driven outflows likely facilitate the detection of CLs and contribute to their extent. Several CLs, including [Si VI], [Si VII], and [Mg VIII], exhibit a secondary broad component (W_80 &gt; 300 km/s). If we interpret this spatially compact gas as part of an outflow, this would indicate that the outflowing gas includes a wide range of ionizations. The estimated energetics imply this highly ionized component is compact yet powerful enough to perturb gas in the central regions of the host dwarfs. These results indicate that AGN in low-mass galaxies may produce outflows capable of influencing their structure and evolution.

### 130) [2512.04208](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04208v1): A Black-Hole Envelope Interpretation for Cosmological Demographics of Little Red Dots

<p> Hiroya Umeda, Kohei Inayoshi, Yuichi Harikane, Kohta Murase </p>
<p>
Little red dots (LRDs) newly discovered with JWST are active galactic nuclei (AGN) that may represent black hole (BH) growth at the earliest cosmic epochs. These sources show puzzling features unlike typical AGNs, including red optical continua, weak hot-dust emission, and a lack of detectable X-rays. Previously, LRDs have often been interpreted as dust-reddened AGNs, leading to severe inconsistencies with the luminosity and BH mass densities inferred for previously known AGNs over 0&lt;z&lt;5. The BH-envelope (BHE) model has been proposed to explain these characteristics, in which an accreting BH is enshrouded by a dense, optically thick gaseous envelope. In this Letter, we reanalyze the SEDs of ~ 400 photometric LRDs in the COSMOS-Web survey using the BHE model and reassess their implications for cosmological BH evolution. We find that the optical-NIR spectra of LRDs are well reproduced by blackbody emission with an effective temperatures of 4000-6000~\K. Within the BHE framework, the inferred bolometric luminosities decrease by ≳1-2 orders of magnitude compared to dust-reddened AGN assumptions. As a result, the revised luminosity function, BH accretion density, and BH mass function become consistent with those of AGNs at z&lt;5. The stellar masses of LRD hosts are estimated by attributing the UV excesses to star formation. Although the resulting M_BH/M<sub>&sext;</sub> ratio remains higher than the local empirical value, the excess is modest. Overall, the BHE model not only resolves the spectral features of LRDs but also brings their statistical properties into agreement with the broader cosmological BH population.

### 131) [2512.04166](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04166v1): JWST Confirmation of a Runaway Supermassive Black Hole via its Supersonic Bow Shock

<p> Pieter van Dokkum, Connor Jennings, Imad Pasha, Charlie Conroy, Ish Kaul, Roberto Abraham, Shany Danieli, Aaron J. Romanowsky, Grant Tremblay </p>
<p>
We present JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of a candidate runaway supermassive black hole at the tip of a 62 kpc-long linear feature at z=0.96. The JWST data show a sharp kinematic discontinuity at the tip, with a radial velocity change of ≈ 600 km/s across 0.1'' (1 kpc). The velocity gradient, together with the projected post-shock flow velocity of ≈ 300 km/s, is well described by a simple shock-compression model of a supersonic object, with a velocity of v_BH = 954^+110_-126 km/s and an inclination i=29^+6_-3 deg. The previously puzzling kinematics along the linear feature, with the observed radial velocity decreasing from ≈ 300 km/s near the tip to ≈ 100 km/s closer to the former host galaxy, are naturally explained as gradual downstream mixing of shocked gas with the circumgalactic medium through turbulent entrainment. The runaway black hole interpretation is further supported by the morphology of the gas at the tip of the wake and an analysis of the [OIII]/Hα, [NII]/Hα, [SII]/Hα, and [SIII]/[SII] line ratios. The line ratios are consistent with fast radiative shocks and rapid cooling, with best-fit shock velocities that are in good agreement with expectations from the black hole velocity and the shock geometry. Energy conservation over the lifetime of the wake suggests a SMBH mass of M_BH ≳ 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. These results confirm that the wake is powered by a supersonic runaway supermassive black hole, a long-predicted consequence of gravitational-wave recoil or multi-body ejection from galactic nuclei.

### 132) [2512.04163](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04163v2): Galactic bars are already mature at Cosmic Noon: bar strength and flatness at z ~ 1.5

<p> Boris S. Kalita, Luis C. Ho, John D. Silverman, Frédéric Bournaud, Miroslava Dessauges-Zavadsky, Emanuele Daddi, Annagrazia Puglisi, Xuheng Ding, Si-Yue Yu </p>
<p>
In this work, we explore the nature of z&gt;1 galactic bars. Once thought to be highly transient, our results demonstrate otherwise. Our sample consists of nine massive (&gt;10^10.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) star-forming barred-spiral galaxies at z<sub>spec</sub> ~ 1.5. Using rest-frame near-IR (F444W) JWST/NIRCam imaging, we apply ellipse fitting along with 1D and 2D morphological modeling to directly measure bar properties. We find that five galaxies host flat surface brightness profiles (bar Sérsic index &lt;0.4), indicative of highly evolved, "mature" bars. By contrast, only two galaxies show exponential profiles, characteristic of young bars, and these are also shorter in absolute length than the flat bars. We therefore conclude that a large fraction of bars at this epoch have already matured, thereby indicating the presence of well-settled disks required to facilitate bar formation and sustained evolution well before z~1.5. To assess the gravitational impact of the bars, we calculate the maximum transverse-to-radial force ratio (Q_b). We find that Q_b values are comparable to, or weaker than, those of bars in the local Universe, Seven of the nine bars show only a marginal increase in strength with maturity (from exponential to flat bars). Contrarily however, the remaining two bars are flat, but have the lowest Q_b values in our sample. We hence propose that the mature bars at z~ 1.5 may experience phases of weakening due to rapid gas inflows and/or minor mergers. In conclusion, our work sheds light on the rapidly evolving nature of high-z bars and paves the way for larger statistical studies.

<p>
The mid-infrared spectrum of star-forming, high metallicity galaxies is dominated by emission features from aromatic and aliphatic bonds in small carbonaceous dust grains, often referred to as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In metal-poor galaxies, the abundance of PAHs relative to the total dust sharply declines, but the origin of this deficit is unknown. We present JWST observations that detect and resolve emission from PAHs in the 7% Solar metallicity galaxy Sextans A, representing the lowest metallicity detection of PAH emission to date. In contrast to higher metallicity galaxies, the clumps of PAH emission are compact (0.5-1.5'' or 3-10 pc), which explains why PAH emission evaded detection by lower resolution instruments like Spitzer. Ratios between the 3.3, 7.7, and 11.3 μm PAH features indicate that the PAH grains in Sextans A are small and neutral, with no evidence of significant processing from the hard radiation fields within the galaxy. These results favor inhibited grain growth over enhanced destruction as the origin of the low PAH abundance in Sextans A. The compact clumps of PAH emission are likely active sites of in-situ PAH growth within a dense, well-shielded phase of the interstellar medium. Our results show that PAHs can form and survive in extremely metal-poor environments common early in the evolution of the Universe.

### 134) [2512.04043](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04043v1): The Nature of Nitrogen Enhanced High Redshift Galaxies

<p> Peixin Zhu, James Trussler, Lisa J. Kewley </p>
<p>
Recent JWST observations have revealed a population of high-redshift galaxies (z≳5) exhibiting unexpectedly bright ultraviolet (UV) nitrogen emission lines. The strong N III] and N IV] features imply nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratios (N/O) as high as -0.8 ≲ log(N/O) ≲ 0.4 in these low-metallicity galaxies (12+log(O/H) ≲ 8.2), compared to the local value of log(N/O)≈-1.5. If confirmed, this level of nitrogen enrichment challenges existing models of nucleosynthesis and galaxy evolution. However, the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can affect spectral diagnostics, and previous studies often excluded AGN contamination using photoionization models based on local N/O ratios. In this work, we compare nitrogen-enhanced AGN and H II region models to observed spectra of eight high-redshift galaxies to constrain their nitrogen abundance, excitation source, gas-phase metallicity, ionization parameter, and gas pressure, simultaneously. We find seven galaxies (GHZ9, GS 3073, GN-z9p4, CEERS-1019, GHZ2, GN-z11, and GS-z9-0) are best described by nitrogen-enhanced AGN models, while RXCJ2248-ID is best reproduced by the nitrogen-enhanced H II model. The presence of AGN does not significantly impact (≲0.1 dex) the derived N/O ratio. We also find that equivalent width (EW)-based diagrams are the most robust UV diagnostic diagrams to distinguish AGNs and star-forming galaxies for situations where the nitrogen abundance is varying. All nitrogen-enhanced galaxies have moderate to high gas pressure (7.0≤log (P/k)≤9.8) and high ionization parameter (log(U)≳-2.0), indicating a dense and compact environment. We suggest that super star clusters containing Wolf-Rayet stars and massive stars are the most likely contributors to the elevated nitrogen abundance in these galaxies.

### 135) [2512.03456](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03456v1): Improving Accretion Diagnostics for Young Stellar Objects with Mid-infrared Hydrogen lines from JWST/MIRI

<p>
We present a comprehensive study of mid-infrared neutral hydrogen (H~sci) emission lines in 79 nearby (d &lt; 200 pc) young stars using JWST/MIRI. We aim to identify mid-infrared H~sci transitions that can serve as reliable accretion diagnostics in young stars, and evaluate their utility in deriving physical conditions of the accreting gas. We identify and measure 22 H~sci transitions in the MIRI wavelength regime (5-28 μm) and perform LTE slab modelling to remove the Hsubscript2O contribution from selected H~sci transitions. We find that mid-IR H~sci line emission is spatially compact, even for sources with spatially extended [Ne~scii] and [Fe~scii] jets, suggesting minimal contamination from extended jet. Although Pfund~α (H~sci~6&ndash;5) and Humphreys~α (H~sci~7&ndash;6) are the strongest lines, they are blended with H<sub>2</sub>O transitions. This blending necessitates additional processing to remove molecular contamination, thereby limiting their use as accretion diagnostics. Instead, we identify the H~sci~(8&ndash;6) at 7.502 μm and H~sci~(10&ndash;7) at 8.760 μm transitions as better alternatives, as they are largely unaffected by molecular contamination and offer a more reliable means of measuring accretion rates from MIRI spectra. We provide updated empirical relations for converting mid-IR H~sci line luminosities into accretion luminosity for 6 different H~sci lines in the MIRI wavelength range. Moreover, comparison of observed line ratios with theoretical models shows that MIR H~sci lines offer robust constraints on the hydrogen gas density in accretion columns, n_H = 10^10.6 to 10^11.2 cm^-3 in most stars, with some stars exhibiting lower densities (&lt;10^10~cm^-3), approaching the optically thin regime.

### 136) [2512.03331](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03331v2): Radio Detection of a Local Little Red Dot

<p> L. F. Rodriguez, I. F. Mirabel </p>
<p>
Context. One of the most important discoveries by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the unexpected existence in the Early Universe (z &gt; 4) of very large quantities of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs), compact luminous red galaxies of intriguing physical properties. One of those intriguing properties is the absence of radio detections in high redshift LRDs. Aims. We wish to know if LRDs have radio emission that may be produced by accreting Intermediate/Supermassive Black Holes (IMBHs/SMBHs) or by frequent supernovae (SNe) from a cluster of massive stars. Methods. Assuming LRDs at high redshifts have not been detected at radio wavelengths due to their large distances and/or present limitations of observational capabilities, we analyse here archive Very Large Array radio observations of J1047+0739 and J1025+1402, two analog candidates of LRDs in the Local Universe (LLRDs) at redshifts z = 0.1 - 0.2. Results. The LLRD source J1047+0739 at z = 0.1682 is detected at 6.0 GHz in 2018 with the VLA-A (Very Large Array) as a compact source with radius less than 0.2 arcsec (&lt;700 pc at d = 750 Mpc). Its flux density was 117±8 μJy and its in-band spectral index was -0.85±0.24, which is typical of optically-thin synchrotron emission. It was also detected at 5.0 GHz in 2010 with the VLA-C, showing a flux density of 130±9 μJy. Conclusions. The observed flux densities can be provided by either a radio luminous supernova or an accreting IMBH/SMBH. However, the lack of important variation in flux density over eight years favors the IMBH/SMBH hypothesis. Radio time monitoring of this and other LLRDs could help clarify the mystery of the radio silence of its cosmological counterparts.

<p> Caroline Baccus, Xinfeng Xu </p>
<p>
We present a sample of 252 broad-line Active Galactic Nuclei (BLAGNs), incorporating 171 newly identified sources, spanning a redshift interval from z = 0.8 to 7.2. We have analyzed spectroscopic data from the NIRSpec instrument aboard the James Webb Space Telescope, using the G140H, G140M, G235H, G235M, G395H, and G395M gratings to survey N ~ 80,000 galaxies for BLAGNs. Through emission-line fitting, using a sum of Gaussian models for Hα, Hβ, [N II] λ&lambda;6548, 6584, and [O III] λ&lambda;4959, 5007, we separate AGN broad-line components from narrow-line emission. We find the detection rate of BLAGNs to be relatively consistent across our redshift range. Compared to typical low-z AGNs (z ≲ 1), the high-z BLAGNs are systematically fainter and less massive, yet they accrete more efficiently, with most showing Eddington ratios between 0.1 and 1.0. This confirms the rapid black hole growth during the early cosmic epochs. The detection of faint, low-mass BLAGNs at high redshift also helps bridge the observational gap between local supermassive black holes and remote luminous quasars, providing a more complete view of black hole-galaxy coevolution across cosmic time.

### 138) [2512.03239](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03239v1): (Re)solving the complex multi-scale morphology and V-shaped SED of a newly discovered strongly-lensed Little Red Dot in Abell 383

<p> Josephine F. W. Baggen, Pieter van Dokkum, Ivo Labbé, Gabriel Brammer </p>
<p>
We present a luminous Little Red Dot (LRD) at z=6.027, doubly imaged by the galaxy cluster Abell 383 and observed with JWST/NIRCam. The source shows the characteristic "V-shaped" SED and pronounced Balmer break that define the LRD population. Owing to its large magnifications, μ~11 for image S1 and μ~7 for S2, the system is exceptionally bright and highly stretched, providing a rare, spatially resolved view of an LRD. The images reveal a complex morphology with a compact red dot, a spatially offset blue dot, and faint emission bridging and surrounding the two. After correcting for lensing, we find that both dots are extremely small but resolved, with rest-frame UV sizes of ~ 20 pc (red) and ~60 pc (blue). These compact dots are embedded in a more extended, line-dominated cloud traced most clearly in F356W ([OIII]+Hβ), which reaches scales of order ~1 kpc. SED decomposition shows that the blue component has a flat UV continuum consistent with a young stellar population, whereas the red component has a steep red SED that can be interpreted as either an evolved stellar population with high stellar mass (log M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>&gt;10) or a reddened AGN. If this object is representative of the LRD population, our results imply that the V-shaped SEDs of LRDs do not arise from individual compact sources but instead from the superposition of two physically distinct components. Separated by only ~300 pc in the source plane, these components would blend into a single compact source in unlensed observations with the canonical LRD colors. This system therefore provides a rare opportunity to resolve the internal structure of an LRD and to gain direct insight into the physical nature of this population.

JWST has revealed unexpectedly bright galaxies in the first 500 Myr after the Big Bang. Their overabundance suggests that they are preferentially observed during burst phases, where their star formation rates increase dramatically. In cosmological simulations, such bursts transition into short (≈ 40 Myr) periods without star formation or naps. Using JWST/NIRCam medium-band observations, we report the discovery of the galaxy CANUCS-A370-2228423 (z = 5.95 ± 0.06, log(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 9.14 ± 0.09), dubbed The Sleeper. Its star formation history indicates rapid assembly in the first 300 Myr (z ≳ 14), where it formed a log(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 8.7^+0.3_-0.4 M<sub>&odot;</sub> progenitor, comparable in stellar mass to the few spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at those redshifts. Unexpectedly, this is followed by several hundred million years of suppressed star formation, in stark contrast to nappers. This results in a remarkably strong hydrogen Balmer break, exceeding that of any galaxy observed within the first billion years by a factor of ≈ 3. Furthermore, Sleeper-like systems are overabundant in the observed survey volume compared to theory, as the probability of finding such galaxies in simulations is &lt; 0.2&percnt;. The discovery of The Sleeper therefore disrupts the current narrative that all luminous galaxies in the first few hundred million years grow into massive descendants. Instead it presents an alternative evolutionary pathway in which these unusually luminous galaxies fade into inefficient dwarfs after an early starburst, revealing greater diversity in the first stages of galaxy evolution.

<p> Boseong Young Cho, M. James Jee, Hyungjin Joo, Sangjun Cha, Kim HyeongHan </p>
<p>
We present the first robust virial masses of the Bullet Cluster's three individual components from a joint weak+strong lensing analysis combining JWST/NIRCam and DECam observations. Despite its status as the benchmark system for dark matter and merger studies, inferred mass ratios for the Bullet Cluster have spanned a wide range from ~2:1 to ≳10:1 over more than two decades. We revisit this tension through three key advances: (1) JWST's exceptional data quality enables us to resolve three distinct halos, (2) DECam's wide-field coverage beyond its virial radius eliminates the need for extrapolation, and (3) high-fidelity strong-lensing priors mitigate weak-lensing model bias. We obtain M_200c = 15.11^+2.48_-2.10 × 10^14M<sub>&odot;</sub> for the main cluster and 1.49^+0.32_-0.25 × 10^14M<sub>&odot;</sub> for the subcluster, yielding a mass ratio of 10.14^+3.22_-2.47, definitively classifying the Bullet Cluster as a minor merger. This result reconciles the long-standing tension in the mass ratio and provides updated initial parameters for future modeling of this iconic system.

### 141) [2512.03129](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03129v1): Taming the Tarantula: How Stellar Wind Feedback Shapes Gas and Dust in 30 Doradus

<p> Jennifer A. Rodriguez, Laura A. Lopez, Lachlan Lancaster, Anna L. Rosen, Omnarayani Nayak, Sebastian Lopez, Tyler Holland-Ashford, Trinity L. Webb </p>
<p>
Observations of massive star-forming regions show that classical stellar wind models over-predict the luminosity of the X-ray emitting gas, indicating a significant fraction of wind energy is lost. In this paper, we present a multi-wavelength analysis of the giant HII region 30 Doradus and its central star cluster R136 using 2 Ms of Chandra X-ray Observatory data, combined with James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope imaging and Spitzer spectral-energy distributions, to investigate how the hot gas energy is lost through turbulent mixing, radiative cooling, and physical leakage. We compare the spatial and spectral properties of the hot gas with those of the warm ionized gas and dust. We find no significant correlation between the dust and hot gas temperatures, suggesting they are not directly coupled and that the dust resides in the swept-up shells where it is heated radiatively. Hα and X-ray surface brightness profiles show that the X-rays peak interior to the Hα shells, demonstrating partial confinement of the hot gas. The fragmented shell structure and bright X-ray interior that declines near the Hα shell reflect efficient cooling from turbulent mixing at the hot-cold interface. We compare against recent simulations of stellar-feedback driven bubbles which have broad agreement with the morphology of the X-ray and Hα emission, but the simulations produce a dip in the interior X-ray surface brightness and a lack of hard X-rays compared to the observations. These differences may suggest thermal conduction is important as mass-loading of the hot bubble could reproduce the X-ray observables.

### 142) [2512.03130](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03130v1): A Critical Evaluation of the Physical Nature of the Little Red Dots

<p> Kohei Inayoshi, Luis C. Ho </p>
<p>
Little Red Dots (LRDs) are a newly identified class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) uncovered by JWST deep surveys. Their enigmatic properties challenge the canonical AGN paradigm and have stimulated ideas on early massive black hole (BH) formation. In this review, we summarize how early BHs shape the characteristic features of LRDs, how their nuclear environments differ from those of normal AGNs, and how future observations can distinguish between competing scenarios. Our main conclusions are as follows: (1) LRDs show broad-line emission consistent with mass accretion onto BHs with M_BH≃ 10^6-7~M<sub>&odot;</sub>, suggesting that AGN activity is a plausible origin of their dominant red optical emission. (2) Stellar components can reproduce the continuum energetics through dusty star formation. However, the required stellar mass would be too large to remain consistent with other LRD properties. Therefore, a purely stellar origin is unlikely to be the dominant power source, although star formation may still contribute to the UV emission. (3) The coexistence of broad-line emission with Balmer absorption and break features on LRD spectra, neither of which can be explained by stellar populations, suggests that nuclear BHs are enshrouded by dense gas with a high covering fraction. (4) Gas-enshrouded AGNs can produce red optical spectra without requiring dust reddening through a combination of gas attenuation and thermal self-emission with an effective temperature of T_eff≃ 5000~K, which also accounts for the flat infrared continuum. (5) From the spectral features and redshift evolution, LRDs are likely a transient phase in early BH growth, possibly the first accretion episodes of newborn BHs. (6) Testing models for LRD spectra and origins through time variability, ionizing sources, post-LRD objects, and low-redshift analogs is particularly promising.

### 143) [2512.03134](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03134v1): The Mass-Metallicity Relation and its Observational Effects at z~3-6

Whitaker, Christina C. Williams </p>
<p>
The correlation between galaxy stellar mass and gas-phase metallicity, known as the mass-metallicity relation (MZR), gives key insights into the processes that govern galaxy evolution. However, unquantified observational and selection biases can result in systematic errors in attempts to recover the intrinsic MZR, particularly at higher redshifts. We characterize the MZR at z~3-6 within a fully Bayesian framework using JWST NIRSpec spectra of 193 galaxies from the RUBIES survey. We forward model the observed mass-metallicity surface using prospector-generated spectra to account for two selection biases: the survey selection function and success in observing high signal-to-noise emission lines. We demonstrate that the RUBIES selection function, based on F444W magnitude and F150W-F444W color, has a negligible effect on our measured MZR. A correct treatment of the non-Gaussian metallicity uncertainties from strong-line calibrations lowers the derived MZR normalization by 0.2 dex and flattens the slope by ~20%; forward-modeling the effect of emission line observability steepens the slope by ~15%. Both of these biases must be taken into account in order to properly measure the intrinsic MZR. This novel forward modeling process motivates careful consideration of selection functions in future surveys, and paves the way for robust, high-redshift chemical enrichment studies that trace the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation across cosmic time.

### 144) [2512.02629](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02629v1): Silicate emission in a type-2 quasar: JWST/MIRI constraints on torus geometry and radiative feedback

<p>
Type-2 quasars (QSO2s) are AGN seen through a significant amount of dust and gas that obscures the central supermassive black hole and the broad line region. Despite this, recent mid-infrared spectra of the central 0.5-1.1 kpc of five QSO2s at z~0.1, obtained with the MRS module of JWST/MIRI, revealed 9.7, 18, and 23 micron silicate features in emission in two of them. This indicates that the high angular resolution of JWST/MIRI now allows us to peer into their nuclear region, exposing some of the directly illuminated dusty clouds that produce silicate emission. To test this, we fitted the nuclear mid-infrared spectrum of the QSO2 with the strongest silicate features, J1010, with two different sets of torus models implemented in an updated version of the Bayesian tool \tt BayesClumpy. These are the CLUMPY and the CAT3D-WIND models. The CAT3D-WIND model is preferred by the observations based on the marginal likelihood and fit residuals, although the two torus models successfully reproduce the spectrum by means of intermediate covering factors (C_T=0.45±^0.26_0.18 and C_T=0.66±^0.16_0.17 for the CLUMPY and CAT3D-WIND models) and low inclinations (i=50&deg;±^8&deg;_9&deg; and i=13&deg;±^7&deg;_6&deg;). Indeed, four of the five QSO2s with JWST/MIRI observations, including J1010, are in the blowout or ''forbidden'' region of the Eddington ratio-column density diagram, indicating that they are actively clearing gas and dust from their nuclear regions, leading to reduced covering factors. This is in contrast with Seyfert 2 galaxies observed with JWST, which are in the ''permitted'' regions of the diagram and show 9.7 micron silicate features in absorption. This supports a scenario where the more luminous the AGN and the higher their Eddington ratio, the lower the torus covering factor, driven by radiation pressure on dusty gas.

<p> Marco Martorano, Arjen van der Wel, Andrea Gebek, Maarten Baes, Eric F. Bell, Gabriel Brammer, Sharon E. Meidt, Angelos Nersesian, Katherine Whitaker, Stijn Wuyts </p>
<p>
We present the redshift evolution of radial color gradients (in rest-frame itU - itV and itV - itJ) for galaxies in the range 0.5&lt; z &lt;2.5 and investigate their origin and dependence on stellar mass. We select ~ 10,200 galaxies with stellar masses M<sub>&sext;</sub>&gt;10^9.5~M<sub>&odot;</sub> from publicly available JWST/NIRCam-selected catalogs. Using 2D Sérsic profile fits to account for PSF broadening, we perform spatially resolved SED fitting on HST and JWST/NIRCam photometry retrieving accurate rest-frame itU - itV and itV - itJ color gradients within 2R_e, F444W. Star-forming galaxies generally exhibit negative itV - itJ color gradients that are strongly mass and redshift dependent. For massive star-forming galaxies (M<sub>&sext;</sub>&gt;10^10.5~M<sub>&odot;</sub>) at z&gt;1.5 itV - itJ colors are ≈ 0.5 mag redder within the effective radius than outside, on average. We find that, at all redshifts and across the entire stellar mass range, itV - itJ gradients strongly correlate with global attenuation (A_V), suggesting that they predominantly trace dust attenuation gradients. Edge-on galaxies are redder and have stronger gradients at all z, although the correlation weakens at higher z. The itU - itV and itV - itJ color gradients in the quiescent galaxy population, in contrast, are weakly negative (from ≈ -0.1 to ≈- 0.2 mag), though significant, and show little or no dependence on stellar mass, redshift or axis ratio. The implication is that quiescent galaxies must be largely transparent, with low A_V, and color gradients mostly attributable to stellar population gradients.

A complete overview of the stellar, gas and dust contents of galaxies is key to understanding their assembly at early times. However, an estimation of molecular and atomic gas reservoirs at high redshift relies on various indirect tracers, while robust dust mass measurements require multi-band far-infrared continuum observations. We take census of the full baryonic content of the main-sequence star-forming galaxy HZ10 at z=5.65, a unique case study where all necessary tracers are available. We present new ALMA Band 10 (λ_rest=50μm) and Band 4 (300μm) observations towards HZ10, which combined with previously taken ALMA Band 6 through 9 data (70-200μm) constrains its dust properties. We complete the baryonic picture using archival high-resolution [CII] observations that provide both a dynamical mass and molecular and atomic gas mass estimates, a JVLA CO(2-1)-based molecular gas mass, and JWST metallicity and stellar mass measurements. We detect continuum emission from HZ10 in Bands 10 and 4 at the 3.4-4.0σ level, and measure a dust temperature of T_dust = 37_-5^+6K and dust mass log(M_dust/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 8.0 ± 0.1. Leveraging the dynamical constraints, we infer its total gas budget, and find that commonly used [CII]-to-H<sub>2</sub> and [CII]-to-HI conversions overpredict the gas mass relative to the dynamical mass. For this reason, we derive a [CII]-to-total ISM mass (atomic + molecular) conversion factor, which for HZ10 corresponds to α_[CII]^ISM = 39^+50_-25M<sub>&odot;</sub> L<sub>&odot;</sub>^-1. We also find that HZ10 falls below the local scaling relation between dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity, suggesting inefficient ISM dust growth. These results demonstrate a powerful synergy between ALMA and JWST in disentangling the baryonic components of early galaxies, paving the way for future studies of larger samples.

<p> Owen Jessop, Adrian Jenkins, Andrew Pontzen, Joop Schaye, Matthieu Schaller, John C. Helly </p>
<p>
We use the FLAMINGO galaxy formation model to quantify the impact of baryon-CDM isocurvature perturbations on galaxy formation in ΛCDM. In linear theory, these perturbations represent local, compensated variations in the ratio between the baryon and CDM densities; they freeze in amplitude at late times, with an RMS amplitude of 1.5&percnt; on the Lagrangian scale of a 10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub> halo (0.85  Mpc). Although such perturbations arise naturally within ΛCDM, most cosmological simulations and semi-analytic models to date omit them. These perturbations are strongly anti-correlated with the matter overdensity field such that halos form with baryon fractions below the cosmic mean, with earlier-collapsing halos exhibiting stronger baryonic suppression. To isolate the galaxy response, we analyse three hydrodynamical simulations with identical initial matter overdensity fields that: i) include isocurvature modes, ii) omit them, or iii) invert their amplitude. At z=8, isocurvature perturbations reduce the mean baryon fraction and star formation rates of resolved halos by 5&percnt; and 12&percnt;, respectively, relative to the null-isocurvature case. These effects are almost independent of halo mass and diminish steadily with time, reaching 0.1&percnt; and 1&percnt; by z=0. We develop a model based on spherical collapse that accurately reproduces the mean baryon fraction suppression. As high-redshift observations become increasingly routine, incorporating isocurvature perturbations into simulations and semi-analytic models will be important for robust predictions of early galaxy and black hole formation in the JWST era.

We report the discovery of a doubly-imaged Little Red Dot (LRD) candidate behind the galaxy cluster Abell 383, which we dub A383-LRD1. Initially classified as a dropout galaxy in HST imaging with several ground-based emission line detections placing it at z<sub>spec</sub>=6.027, new JWST/NIRCam observations taken as part of the cycle 4 VENUS survey now reveal that the source consists of two underlying components: A red point-source with a V-shaped SED consistent with LRD selection criteria, and a nearby (~ 380 pc) compact blue companion which was the main contributor to the previous rest-frame UV detections. Based on lensing symmetry and its SED, the LRD appears to lie at a similar redshift as well. The magnification of the two images of A383-LRD1 is μ_A=16.2±1.2 and μ_B=9.0±0.6, respectively, and the predicted time delay between them is Δt_grav=5.20±0.14 yr (~0.7 yr in the rest-frame). After correcting for the lensing magnification, we derive an absolute magnitude of M_UV,LRD=-16.8± 0.3 for the LRD, and M_UV,BC=-18.2± 0.2 for the blue companion. We perform SED fits to both components, revealing the LRD to be best fitted with a black hole star (BH*) model and a substantial host galaxy, and the blue companion with an extremely young, emission-line dominated star-forming nebula. A383-LRD1 represents the second known multiply-imaged LRD detected to date, following A2744-QSO1, and to our knowledge, the first LRD system with a confirmed detection of [C _II]&lambda;158  μm emission from ALMA observations. Thanks to lensing magnification, this system opens a unique door to study the relation between a LRD, its host galaxy, and its environment, and represents a prime candidate for deep JWST spectroscopy and high-resolution ALMA follow-up observations.

<p>
We present ClumPyLen, a Python-based simulator designed to produce realistic mock observations of strongly lensed, high-redshift, clumpy star-forming galaxies. The tool models galaxy components such as disks, bulges, and spiral arms using Sérsic profiles, and it populates them with stellar clumps whose properties are sampled from physically motivated distributions. ClumPyLen includes the effects of gravitational lensing through user-provided deflection angle maps and simulates realistic observational conditions by accounting for instrumental effects, Point-Spread-Function convolution, sky background, and photon noise. The simulator can support a wide range of filters and instruments; here we focus on HST/ACS, HST/WFC3-IR, and JWST/NIRCam. We demonstrate the capabilities of the code through two examples, including a detailed simulation of the z = 6.145 source Cosmic Archipelago lensed by MACS J0416.1-2403. The simulated images closely match the morphology and limiting magnitudes of real observations. ClumPyLen is designed to explore the detectability of stellar clumps in terms of mass and size, especially in the low-mass regime, and it allows the study of clump blending effects. Thanks to its modular design, the code is highly adaptable to a wide range of scientific goals, including lensing studies, galaxy evolution, and the generation of synthetic datasets for machine learning or forward modeling applications.

<p>
Interstellar objects (ISOs), particularly those with cometary activity, provide unique insight into the primordial physical and chemical conditions present during the formation of the planetary system in which they originated. Observations in the sub-mm regime allow for direct measurements of several parent molecules released from the comet nucleus into the coma. Here we present observations of the third ISO, 3I/ATLAS, with the `Ū`ū heterodyne receiver on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), which targeted emission from HCN(J = 3 - 2) and CO(J = 2 - 1). Our observations, taken between 16 July 2025 and 21 July 2025 (UT), when 3I/ATLAS was at a heliocentric distance between 4.01 and 3.84 au, provide the earliest sub-mm constraints on its activity. We do not detect HCN or CO in these epochs, with 3σ upper-limits on the production rates of Q(HCN) &lt; 1.7 × 10^24 s<sup>-1</sup> at r_h = 4.01 - 3.97 au and Q(CO) &lt; 1.1 × 10^27 s<sup>-1</sup> at r_h = 3.94 - 3.84 au, respectively. We combine this HCN limit with later JCMT observations of HCN to constrain its temporal evolution. Fitting the HCN detections with a Q(HCN) &prop; r_h^-n model and accounting for the upper-limits yields n = 12.7^+6.9_-2.5. This slope is steeper than those of typical Solar System comets, but consistent with the production rate slopes measured for other species in the coma of 3I/ATLAS.

### 151) [2512.02096](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02096v1): Discovery of two little red dots transitioning into quasars

<p>
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a new population of compact objects that show a unique V-shaped spectral energy distribution (SED) in the UV and optical wavelength range. These so-called "little red dots" (LRDs) often exhibit broad Balmer emission lines, indicative of the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). They generally lack detection of X-ray, radio, and mid-IR radiation, which is fundamentally different from typical AGNs. Various models, including super-Eddington-accreting black holes enshrouded in dense and dust-poor gas, have been proposed to explain these features. However, the nature of LRDs remains debated, and their evolutionary fate is unclear. Here we report two unusual LRDs at redshift z = 2.868 and 2.925 that are in a transitional phase towards typical AGNs. Their V-shaped SEDs, compact optical morphology, and broad emission lines satisfy the defining criteria of LRDs. On the other hand, they exhibit intense X-ray, radio, and mid-IR radiation that is much stronger than previously known LRDs. These hybrid properties suggest that the dense gas envelope around their central black holes is dispersing, allowing high-energy photons and radio emission to escape. Meanwhile, a dust torus is forming. This finding provides a direct insight into the nature of LRDs and indicates that at least some LRDs will evolve into AGNs or quasars at later times.

<p>
We report the discovery of two broad-line X-ray AGNs cid_414 and cid_947 at z~3 that exhibit prominent He Iλ10830+ Paγ emission and absorption, identified from the JWST Cycle 3 large GO treasury program COSMOS-3D using NIRCam F444W grism spectroscopy. Additional UV/optical line measurements (e.g., Lyα, Si IV, C IV) come from complementary COSMOS-field spectroscopy. Both sources are robustly detected in the mid-infrared, with detections in MIRI F1000W for both AGNs and an additional detection in MIRI F2100W for cid_414, indicating the presence of hot dust emission. The source cid_947 shows a higher He Iλ10830 absorption column density and X-ray-inferred N_H, and displays strong outflow signatures in He I, Si IV, and C IV with velocity offsets exceeding 5000 km/s. The source cid_414 shows a narrow Lyα emission line with luminosity log L_Lyα=42.49±0.01~erg~s<sup>-1</sup> and a higher intrinsic 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity. Host-galaxy decomposition and multi-component SED fitting indicate that cid_947 hosts a more massive black hole but lower star formation rate than cid_414. From simplified photoionization modeling, we infer that the dense absorbing gas has a characteristic size comparable to the nuclear broad-line region and is likely kinematically coupled to the obscuration associated with the dust torus. He Iλ1083 absorption has also been identified in several compact little red dots at similar redshifts. Together with the two AGNs reported here, these findings suggest that dense circumnuclear gas are plausibly prevalent at high redshift and plays an important role in regulating AGN obscuration and black hole&ndash;host co-evolution.

<p>
We present NIRSpec/IFS observations of a rest-frame UV-bright, massive (M_* ~ 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, z_AB=20.5) galaxy highly magnified by gravitational-lensing observed just after the end of the epoch of reionization (z=5.04, \barμ~90). With JWST accessing the restframe UV and optical spectrum of this galaxy with high fidelity, we classify this UV-bright galaxy as post-starburst in nature &ndash; due to weak/absent emission lines and strong absorption features &ndash; making this an example of a new class of UV-bright but significantly quenched galaxies being discovered in this epoch. With a median E(B-V)=0.44±0.14, we identify the presence of stellar absorption across the arc both in Balmer lines and the MgII doublet, indicative of older stellar populations dominated by A stars (and potentially B stars). Using spatially-resolved maps of rest-optical strong emission lines, we find a heterogeneous distribution of nebular metallicities across the arc, potentially hinting at different enrichment processes. With a low median lensing-corrected Hα star formation rate of SFR_Hα = 0.024 ± 0.001 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1, we find in the most "star-forming" clumps indications of lower ionization (log_10U ~ -3.2), lower nebular metallicities (12+log_10O/H ≲ 8.3), and hints of higher densities that suggest a possible recent infall of more pristine (low metallicity) gas onto the galaxy. Investigating the regions with no detectable Hβ emission, we find (for the first time at z&gt;5) signatures of diffuse ionized gas (DIG). Separating DIG from HII regions within a galaxy has predominantly been demonstrated at lower redshifts, where such spatial resolution allows clear separation of such regions &ndash; highlighting the immense power of gravitational lensing to enable studies at the smallest spatial scales at cosmic dawn.

### 154) [2512.01998](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01998v1): Constraining Dark Acoustic Oscillations with the High-Redshift UV Luminosity Function

<p> Jared Barron, David Curtin, Hongwan Liu, Julian Munoz, Sandip Roy </p>
<p>
Dark acoustic oscillations (DAOs) in the matter power spectrum can arise in many different dark sector models, and can imprint on a variety of cosmological observables. In this work we use measurements of the galactic UV luminosity function (UVLF) at high redshifts to constrain the dark acoustic oscillation feature at small scales in a model-agnostic way. We introduce a phenomenological transfer function model for a dark sector with a species undergoing DAOs which can accommodate sub-dominant dark matter abundances, and obtain constraints on its parameters. In order to predict the UVLF, we employ an Extended Press-Schechter formalism which we calibrate using N-body simulations with initial conditions featuring DAOs. Using measurements from the Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, Subaru Telescope, and Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we constrain the wave number of the first DAO peak to be at k ≳ 50 h/Mpc, unless the fraction of dark matter undergoing DAOs is less than 0.07.

<p> Jie Song, Enci Wang, Cheng Jia, Cheqiu Lyu, Yangyao Chen, Jinyang Wang, Fujia Li, Weiyu Ding, Guanwen Fang, Xu Kong </p>
<p>
By combining high-resolution observations from JWST and HST, we have measured the stellar masses, star formation rates (SFRs), and multi-wavelength morphologies of galaxies in the CANDELS fields. Furthermore, based on rest-frame 1 μm morphologies, we have derived spatially resolved stellar mass and SFR surface density (Σ_* and Σ_SFR) profiles for 46,313 galaxies with reliable structural measurements at 0&lt;z&lt;4 and log(M<sub>&ast;</sub> /M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&gt;8, and provide the corresponding catalogue. For star-forming galaxies (SFGs), our results show excellent consistency with previous studies in terms of the star formation main sequence and the size-mass relation, demonstrating the robustness of our stellar mass and SFR measurements. For spatially resolved profiles, we find that at higher redshifts (z&gt;2.5), the median radial profile of Σ_SFR is nearly parallel to but slightly steeper than that of Σ_*. This results in mildly negative gradients in the specific SFR (sSFR) profiles across all stellar mass bins considered. These findings indicate that galaxies at z&gt;2.5 cannot grow in size via only in-situ star formation, challenging the understanding of galaxy size evolution beyond the cosmic noon. In contrast, at z&lt;2.0, the sSFR profiles transition to exhibit more and more positive gradients at lower redshifts, consistent with an inside-out growth scenario where star formation preferentially expands the galactic outskirts.

### 156) [2512.01547](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01547v1): Exploring the ultra-faint dwarf Bootes I using JWST and HST: Metallicity distribution and binaries

<p>
Ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) are among the oldest and most metal-poor stellar systems in the Universe. Their metallicity distribution encodes the fossil record of the earliest star formation, feedback, and chemical enrichment, providing crucial tests of models of the first stars, galaxy assembly, and dark matter halos. However, due to their faint luminosities and the limited number of bright giants, spectroscopic studies of UFDs typically probe only small stellar samples. Here, we present an analysis of multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope observations of the UFD Bootes I. Using deep color-magnitude diagram in the F606W and F322W2 bands, extending from the subgiant branch to the M-dwarfs, and stellar proper motions to identify likely members, we obtained an unprecedentedly clean census of the system. The exquisite quality of the diagram, combined with the sensitivity of M-dwarf colors to metallicity, allowed us to constrain the metallicity distribution in a large stellar sample. As a first step, we derived the binary fraction in Bootes I. This is crucial, since binaries can bias kinematic mass estimates, affect stellar population analyses, and shape the photometric signatures used to infer metallicity. We find that 20±2% of stellar systems in Bootes I are binaries with mass ratios larger than 0.4, corresponding to a total binary fraction of ~30%. This value is comparable to the binary fractions observed in globular clusters of similar stellar mass, suggesting that the presence of dark matter does not significantly affect the binary properties of Bootes I. We then exploited the metallicity sensitivity of M-dwarf colors to derive the metallicity distribution function. We find that most of the stars ~85% have [Fe/H]&lt;-2, and that roughly ~17% have [Fe/H]&lt;-3.

<p>
Our comprehension of the history of star formation at z&gt;3 relies on rest-frame UV observations, yet this selection misses the most dusty and massive sources, yielding an incomplete census at early times. Infrared facilities such as Spitzer and the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed a hidden population at z=3-6 with extreme red colours, named HIEROs (HST-to-IRAC extremely red objects), identified by the criterion H_E-ch2&gt;2.25. Recently, Euclid Early Release Observations (ERO) have made it possible to further study such objects by comparing Euclid data with ancillary Spitzer/IRAC imaging. We investigate a 232 arcmin<sup>2</sup> area in the Perseus field using VIS and NISP photometry, complemented by the four Spitzer channels and ground-based MegaCam bands (u, g, r, Hα, i, z). Applying the colour cut yields 121 HIEROs; after removing globular clusters, brown dwarfs, and unreliable cases through visual inspection of multiband cutouts, we obtain a final sample of 42 robust HIEROs. Photometric redshifts and physical properties are estimated with the SED-fitting code Bagpipes. From the resulting z<sub>phot</sub> and M_* values, we compute the galaxy stellar mass function at 3.5&lt;z&lt;5.5. Even after excluding possible AGN hosts or systems where the stellar mass may be overestimated, the high-mass end remains comparable to previous determinations, suggesting the true abundance could be higher. These results highlight the importance of further study of this obscured population to assess its role in the cosmic star-formation rate density and its consistency with galaxy-formation models, demonstrating Euclid's capability to advance our understanding of dust-hidden star formation across early epochs.

<p> Xuheng Ma </p>
<p>
We determine the z=6-8 ultraviolet (UV) LF in the JWST UNCOVER field behind Abell 2744, through a depth-tied completeness model and source-plane selection taking multiple images into account. We compute the intrinsic M_UV LFs and lens-dependent effective volumes V_eff,&ell;(M_UV) for two of them (CATS, GLAFIC), and construct binned LFs with statistical (Gehrels) errors presented separately from the lens-model spread. When fitting each lens model independently with both the original and turnover-extended form (while keeping M^*=-20.5), we obtain decisive model selection in favour of a faint-end turnover. The peak of the turnover posteriors is at α≃ -1, β≃ 1.6, and drive M_T to the high side of our prior (~ -18) and the difference in normalization between CATS-GLAFIC is absorbed into φ^*. A similar magnification-bias test in the image plane gives a B(μ) trend matching to what is expected, which provides an internal consistency of our selection and volumes. Our results indicate an early suppression of the UV LF at z=6-8, and carry implications for the ionizing contribution of ultra-faint systems during reionization.

<p>
A galaxy's metallicity and its relation to stellar mass encode the history of gas accretion, star formation, and outflows within cosmic ecosystems. We present new constraints on the low-mass end of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) at z~2-3 from ultra-deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of seven continuum-faint galaxies in the Chemical Evolution Constrained using Ionized Lines in Interstellar Aurorae (CECILIA) Faint sample (Raptis et al. 2025). Our sample includes Lyα-selected and other low-luminosity star-forming galaxies with stellar masses log(M<sub>&sext;</sub> / M<sub>&odot;</sub>)~7.2-9.7 and moderately faint rest-UV magnitudes (-20.7 ≲ M_UV ≲ -17.3). Gas-phase oxygen abundances, calculated using empirical calibrations of [O III]/Hβ together with [N II]/Hα constraints, span ~0.04-0.5 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>. We measure a steep MZR slope of γ= 0.48 ± 0.11, suggesting a rapid increase in metal retention efficiency with mass, consistent with energy-driven outflows. Comparison with lower- and higher-redshift studies indicates an evolution in normalization from z~0 to z~2, reflecting less metal enrichment in early galaxies. We find no significant evolution in the MZR between z~2 and the Epoch of Reionization, suggesting that our galaxies may serve as useful analogs of reionization-era systems. Expanded samples and direct T_e-based abundance measurements will be crucial to fully trace the build-up of metals in low-mass galaxies during the peak epoch of cosmic star formation and to test the reliability of strong-line calibrations in these galaxies.

### 160) [2511.23164](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23164v1): Bursty star formation, chemical enrichment, and star cluster formation in numerical analogues of GN-z11

<p> Takayuki R. Saitoh, Yutaka Hirai, Michiko S. Fujii, Yuki Isobe </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope reveals anomalous nitrogen enrichment (high N/O ratios) in compact, star-forming galaxies, such as GN-z11 at z~10. The origin of this chemical signature provides an insight into the early star and galaxy formation processes, yet remains unclear. We performed high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of massive galaxies at high redshift (z~10) in rare density peaks, incorporating various chemical evolution channels including stellar winds, core-collapse, Type Ia supernovae, and asymptotic giant branch stars. Our simulations reproduce several key features of high-redshift galaxies: (1) stars form with high efficiencies (&gt;0.1) at the center of rare peak halos, creating very compact galaxies similar to GN-z11; (2) high N/O ratios emerge during the first 10-20 Myr of intense starburst, before being diluted by CCSNe; (3) multiple star clusters form in and around the galaxy with high efficiency (~20&percnt;), some of which exhibit high N/O ratios and sodium-oxygen anti-correlations similar to those observed in local globular clusters. Although our simulations can reproduce the high log(N/O) values (up to -0.61, exceeding the solar value by 0.25 dex), they remain below the observational lower limits of GN-z11, indicating room for improvement through additional chemical evolution channels, such as supermassive stars.

<p>
We use the DAWN JWST Archive to construct and characterise a sample of 116 little red dots (LRDs) across 2.3&lt;z&lt;9.3, selecting all sources with v-shaped UV-optical continua from NIRSpec/PRISM spectra and compact morphologies in NIRCam/F444W imaging. We show that LRD continuum spectra are ubiquitously well described by modified blackbodies across ~0.4-1.0μm, with typical T~5000K or λ_peak~0.65μm across 2 dex in luminosity, and a tail toward T~2000K. LRDs therefore trace a locus in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram that is directly analogous to stars on the Hayashi track, strongly supporting the picture that LRDs are AGN embedded in thermalised dense gas envelopes in approximate hydrostatic equilibrium. Hotter LRDs with λ_peak&lt;0.65μm typically have strong Balmer breaks, redder UV slopes and high optical luminosities; other LRDs show weak or no Balmer breaks, and wide variety in β_UV and L_5100. Crucially, we demonstrate that the UV-optical continuum shapes and luminosities are strongly linked to the Hα, Hβ, [OIII] and OI line properties. There is a tight linear relation between the Hα and optical continuum luminosities, as well as Hα and OI_8446, indicating that Balmer, OI and optical emission must primarily be powered by the same source. The Balmer decrement increases strongly toward higher L_Hα, L_5100 and Balmer break strength, providing key evidence for luminosity-dependent effects of collisional (de-)excitation and resonant scattering in the gaseous envelopes. In contrast, we show that [OIII] emission likely originates from star-forming host galaxies, and that its strong correlation with Balmer break strength arises naturally from variation in the AGN-to-host ratio. Our work presents an empirical description of the nature and structure of LRDs, defining a new benchmark for ongoing LRD model developments.

### 162) [2511.21618](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21618v1): A Super-Eddington, Lensing-Magnified Quasar at z=5.07 observed with JWST

We present JWST/NIRCam F070W and F480M imaging for a quasar at z = 5.07, J0025-0145, which is magnified by a foreground lensing galaxy. Existing Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging does not have sufficient spatial resolution to determine whether the background quasar is multiply imaged. Exploiting the sharp PSF of the F070W band, we confirm that the background quasar can be well-described by a single point spread function (PSF), essentially ruling out the existence of multiple lensed images. We do not detect the quasar host galaxy in either the F070W or the F480M band. Using the HST and JWST photometry, we fit the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of the foreground galaxy. The estimated mass (log(M_* / M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 11.15 ± 0.16) and redshift (z<sub>phot</sub> = 3.62_-0.04^+0.06) of the foreground galaxy are consistent with a single-image lensing model. We estimate the maximum possible magnification of the quasar to be μ_max = 3.2, which implies that the intrinsic Eddington ratio of the quasar is at least λ_Edd^intrinsic &gt; 4.9. Therefore, J0025-0145 has one of the highest Eddington ratios among z&gt;5 supermassive black holes known so far, suggesting the viability of super-Eddington growth for supermassive black holes in the early universe.

<p> Steven Chen, Jeremy Hare, Oleg Kargaltsev, Hui Yang, Denis Cioffi, Maximilian Häberle, Anil Seth </p>
<p>
We analyze JWST observations of the central region of the globular cluster ω Centauri (NGC 5139, ω Cen hereafter), around the position of the candidate IMBH inferred by Haberle et al. (2024a) from the motion of fast-moving stars in multi-epoch HST observations. We performed PSF-fitting photometry for sources in NIRCam (F200W and F444W) and MIRI (F770W and F1500W) and constructed UV to IR SEDs for sources within the central region of the cluster by using HST photometry from oMEGACat (Haberle et al. 2024b). None of the SEDs of reliably measured sources within this region resembles the SEDs computed from models of Pesce et al. 2021 for IMBHs accreting from intracluster medium at low rates. Our JWST limits place constraints on combinations of IMBH mass and accretion efficiency, either due to the amount of material available to be accreted, or due to the fraction of accreting matter that actually falls into the IMBH. Our non-detection then does not contradict the mass range of the IMBH inferred from the fast moving stars. We discuss these constraints in the context of the model of Pesce et al. 2021. We find that JWST limits are more restrictive than the existing radio limits for IMBH masses ≲ 20,000 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. It is also possible that the faint IMBH emission is dominated by the light of a nearby star. Tighter limits on accretion onto the candidate IMBH can be placed with deeper observations, a more precise localization of the IMBH, and better measurements of the local intracluster medium density and temperature at the center of the cluster.

Dust production is a fundamental aspect of the baryonic cycle of star formation. It is known that dust is injected into the interstellar medium during early star formation by supernovae and later on by evolved stars. From individual objects, these mechanisms are well understood, but the overall dust production in star clusters at different evolutionary stages is still challenging to quantify. We present 22 massive (&gt; 105M<sub>&odot;</sub>) extra galactic star clusters with ages between 3 and 100 Myr exhibiting a compact dust morphology seen with JWST-MIRI. We only find PAH features associated with one star cluster and nineteen have already cleared themselves from their natal dust. Their main characteristic is a significant enhancement at 10μm, which is likely due to silicate emission and cannot be explained by ionized gas. We discuss several possible explanations including dust production from evolved stars such as red super giants, more exotic star types like yellow hypergiants and luminous blue variable stars. Stochastic dust injection from supernovae or a single supernova in dense gas can also create significant silicate emission. However, for this scenario secondary tracers such as a X-ray signal are expected which we only observe in three star clusters. We find the most luminous 10μm emitter to be the three most massive star clusters (&gt; 106M<sub>&odot;</sub>) which is at least a magnitude stronger than any known stellar sources indicating a rare mechanism that only appears at extreme masses and a short lifetime.

We present ECOology for Galaxies using ALMA archive and Legacy surveys (ECOGAL), an ALMA data mining project. Using the footprints of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we query and uniformly reprocess ALMA data to produce continuum images and two complementary source catalogues: (i) a prior-based catalogue anchored to optical/near-infrared detections, and (ii) a blind catalogue based on significant ALMA detections. Detection thresholds are established through peak SNR statistics and analysis of inverted maps. In this paper, we focus on the ALMA-accessible CANDELS fields (COSMOS, GOODS-S, and UDS), covering ~130,000 optical/NIR-selected galaxies spanning 0.0 &lt; z &lt; 15.0. We identify 1288 detections (622 unique) with optical/NIR counterparts across the two methods, of which 832 detections (395 unique) appear in both. Among the 622 unique sources, 307 have spectroscopic redshifts from 0.12 &lt; z &lt; 6.85. ECOGAL expands the parameter space previously explored by A^3COSMOS and A^3GOODS-S by incorporating the UDS field and integrating publicly available JWST datasets from the DAWN JWST Archive (DJA). We also highlight several science cases enabled by ECOGAL, including the evolution of cosmic gas and dust masses, obscured star formation and optically dark systems. ECOGAL provides science-ready data sets for the community and showcases the power of combining over a decade of accumulated public data with other legacy datasets. The data product is made publicly available and accompanies a post demonstrating the usage of the catalogue on the DJA webpage.

### 166) [2511.20484](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20484v1): Discovery of new N-emitters over a wide redshift range

JWST observations have revealed rare galaxies with UV spectra exhibiting intense lines of nitrogen, indicative of super-solar N/O abundances at low metallicity. To better understand these enigmatic objects and provide new constraints on proposed scenarios, we have undertaken a systematic search for galaxies with UV emission lines of nitrogen. Using public JWST NIRSpec data, we have identified 45 N-emitters with robust NIII] or NIV] detections, including 4 previously known objects. We find N-emitters from redshift z~ 3-11 among a broad diversity of galaxies, in terms of morphology, UV magnitude, stellar mass, SFR, metallicity, and rest-optical line strengths. The UV nitrogen lines show typical equivalent widths between ~ 5-50 Å. Carbon lines are generally fainter than the N lines. Using strong line calibrations established at high-redshift, we find metallicities 12+log(O/H)~ 7.15-8.5, including thus also high metallicities. The Hβ equivalent width of N-emitters varies strongly, and sources with low EWs show clear signs of a Balmer break, indicative of composite stellar populations combining both young (&lt; 10 Myr) stars responsible of the UV emission lines and an older population contributing to the rest-optical spectrum. Supersolar N/O ratios are found in all N-emitters. C/O abundances are comparable to those of galaxies at the same metallicity, and all N-emitters show high N/C ratios or lower limits (log(N/C) &gt; 0.5), independently of metallicity. The observed abundance ratios are compatible with ejecta from H-burning and do not show signs of Carbon enhancements, even at higher metallicities. Finally, we find that the fraction of N-emitters increases with redshift, and we quantify this evolution. Our study increases the sample of known N-emitters by a factor ~ 3, reveals a diversity of properties among N-emitters, and provides new constraints on their nature.

### 167) [2511.20414](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20414v1): Black Hole merger rates in the first billion years in light of JWST data

<p>
Context. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discoveries have unveiled an abundance of faint and massive Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) at high redshifts (z=4-9), that surpass by 10 to 100 times the extrapolated bolometric (Bol) and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions (LF) from previous AGN campaigns. The two main models that are put forward to explain these observations correspond to light seeds (150 Msol) accreting in episodes of super Eddington, and heavy seeds (10^3 - 10^5 Msol) growing at the Eddington limit. Future gravitational observatories like the Laser Interferometer Satellite Antenna (LISA) will help disentangle these models by reporting the BH-BH merger events from mid to high redshifts. Aims. This work aims to report the predicted merger rates in the heavy seed scenario in light of recent JWST data. In our models we explore (i) instantaneous merging between BHs, (ii) delayed merging after a dynamical timescale, as well as extreme spin configurations (a=0.99, a=-0.99) to bracket BH mass growth. Methods. We use Delphi, a semi-analytical model that tracks baryonic physics over a hierarchical evolution of dark matter halos through cosmic time within the first billion years of the Universe. We calibrate this model for it to simultaneously reproduce galaxy and JWST-AGNs observables. Results. We show reasonable agreement with the Bolometric Luminosity function at z=6, where BHs must accrete 10-100 times more gas than in previous works calibrated to pre-JWST data. However, we underpredict (overpredict) the bright end 10^45.5 erg s<sup>-1</sup> (all luminosity range) at z=7 (z=5) by 1-3.2 dex (0.22-1.6 dex). Regarding BH-BH merger events, the instantaneous (delayed) models predict a total of 28.06 (19.61) yr^-1 for BHs at z≥5, which is within the range of merger rates reported in previous literature.

<p> Christos G. Tsagas </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope has recently detected massive, fully formed, galaxies at redshifts corresponding to few hundred million years after the Big-Bang. However, our current cosmological model cannot produce such massive systems so early in the lifetime of the universe. A number of theoretical solutions have been proposed, but they all appeal to exotic new physics and introduce rather excessive fine-tuning. In this essay, we outline a theoretical answer to the early galaxy-formation question, which operates within standard general relativity and standard cosmology, without appealing to any new physics. Instead, we account for the effect of a well established feature of our universe. This feature, which has so far been kept in the margins of mainstream cosmology, are the peculiar velocities.

<p>
We present the mass-metallicity relation for star-forming galaxies in the MUSE Quasar Nebula 01 (MQN01) field, a massive cosmic web node at z ~ 3.245, hosting one of the largest overdensities of galaxies and AGNs found so far at z &gt; 3. Through James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) spectra and images from JWST and Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we identify a sample of 9 star-forming galaxies in the MQN01 field with detection of nebular emission lines (Hβ, [OIII], Hα, [NII]), covering the mass range of 10^7.5M<sub>&odot;</sub> - 10^10.5M<sub>&odot;</sub>. We present the relations of the emission-line flux ratios versus stellar mass for the sample and derive the gas-phase metallicity based on the strong line diagnostics of [OIII]&lambda;5008/Hβ and [NII]&lambda;6585/Hα. Compared to the typical, field galaxies at similar redshifts, MQN01 galaxies show relatively higher [NII]&lambda;6585/Hα and lower [OIII]&lambda;5008/Hβ at the same stellar mass, which implies a higher metallicity by about 0.25± 0.07 dex with respect to the field mass-metallicity relation. These differences are decreased considering the "Fundamental Metallicity Relation'', i.e. if the galaxies' Star Formation Rates (SFR) are also taken into account. We argue that these results are consistent with a scenario in which galaxies in overdense regions assemble their stellar mass more efficiently (or, equivalently, start forming at earlier epochs) compared to field galaxies at similar redshifts.

<p>
JWST has revealed an abundance of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) at high redshifts (z &gt; 3), pushing the limits of black hole (BH) science in the early Universe. Results have claimed that these BHs are significantly more massive than expected from the BH mass-host galaxy stellar mass relation derived from the local Universe. We present a comprehensive census of the BH populations in the early Universe through a detailed stacking analysis of galaxy populations, binned by luminosity and redshift, using JWST spectroscopy from the CEERS, JADES, RUBIES, and GLASS extragalactic deep field surveys. Broad Hα detections in 31&percnt; of the stacked spectra (5/16 bins) imply median BH masses of 10^5.21 - 10^6.13~ M<sub>&odot;</sub> and the stacked SEDs of these bins indicate median stellar masses of 10^7.84 - 10^8.56 ~M<sub>&odot;</sub>. This suggests that the median galaxy hosts a BH that is at most a factor of 10 times over-massive compared to its host galaxy and lies closer to the locally derived M_BH-M_* relation. We investigate the seeding properties of the inferred BHs and find that they can be well-explained by a light stellar remnant seed undergoing moderate Eddington accretion. Our results indicate that individual detections of AGN are more likely to sample the upper envelope of the M_BH-M_* distribution, while stacking on "normal" galaxies and searching for AGN signatures can overcome the selection bias of individual detections.

<p> Ankita Bera, Sultan Hassan, Robert Feldmann, Romeel Davé, Kristian Finlator </p>
<p>
The elevated UV luminosity functions (UVLF) from recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have challenged the viability of existing theoretical models. To address this, we use a semi-analytical framework &ndash; which couples a physically motivated source model derived from radiative-transfer hydrodynamic simulations of reionization with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler &ndash; to perform a joint calibration to JWST galaxy surveys (UVLF, φ_UV and UV luminosity density, ρ_UV) and reionization-era observables (ionizing emissivity, N&#775;<sub>ion</sub>, neutral hydrogen fraction, x_HI, and Thomson optical depth, τ). We find that models with weak feedback and a higher contribution from faint galaxies reproduce the reionization observables but struggle to match the elevated JWST UVLF at z &gt; 9. In contrast, models with stronger feedback (i.e., rapid redshift evolution) and a higher contribution from bright galaxies successfully reproduce JWST UVLF at z ≥ 10, but over-estimate the bright end at z &lt; 9. The strong-feedback model constrained by JWST UVLF predicts a more gradual and extended reionization history, as opposed to the sudden reionization seen in the weak-feedback models. This extended nature of reionization (z~ 16 - 6) yields an optical depth consistent (at 2-σ) with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) constraint, thereby alleviating the photon-budget crisis. In both scenarios, reionization is complete by z ~ 6, consistent with current data. Our analysis highlights the importance of accurately modeling feedback and ionizing emissivities from different source populations during the first billion years after the Big Bang.

<p>
Binaries that host a carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet (WC) star and an OB-type companion can be copious dust producers. Yet the properties of dust, particularly the grain size distribution, in these systems remain uncertain. We present Band 6 observations of WR 112 by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array telescope (ALMA), which are the first millimeter observations of a WC binary system capable of resolving its dust emission. By combining ALMA observations with James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) images, we were able to analyze the spatially resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) of WR 112. We found that the SEDs are consistent with emissions from hydrogen-poor amorphous carbon grains. Notably, our results also suggest that the majority of grains in the system have radii below one micrometer, and the extended dust structures are dominated by nanometer-sized grains. Among four parameterizations of the grain radius distribution that we tested, a bimodal distribution, with abundant nanometer-sized grains and a secondary population of 0.1-micron grains, best reproduces the observed SED. This bimodal distribution helps to reconcile the previously conflicting grain size estimates reported for WR 112 and for other WC systems. We hypothesize that dust destruction mechanisms such as radiative torque disruption and radiative-driven sublimation are responsible for driving the system to the bimodal grain size distribution.

### 173) [2511.18479](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18479v2): Kinematic Mapping of Giant Arcs: A New Method to Locate Lensing Critical Curves

<p> Ruwen Zhou, Liang Dai, Lingyuan Ji, Massimo Pascale, Jose M. Diego, Fengwu Sun, Yoshinobu Fudamoto </p>
<p>
Proximity of lensing critical curves features highly magnified portions of lensed galaxies. Accurate knowledge of the location and shape of the critical curve will be useful for understanding the nature of highly magnified stellar sources near critical curves and for revealing sub-galactic dark matter structures within the lens. In galaxy-cluster lenses, however, prediction of critical curves can be uncertain due to complexity in global mass modeling. We explore and validate a kinematics-based method for locating the critical curve. This method leverages the continuous line-of-sight velocity profile of the lensed galaxy mapped through integral field spectroscopy of emission lines, and combines an agnostic local lens model and a disk rotation model. Applying our method to a highly magnified region of the Dragon Arc in the Abell 370 cluster lensing field using archival VLT/MUSE IFU mapping of the Hβ line, we constrain the critical curve to an uncertainty band with a half-width of 0.23" (1σ). This result reveals locations of recently detected extremely magnified stars biased toward the negative-parity side of the critical curve, as predicted for intracluster microlensing. With future JWST/NIRSpec IFU mapping of the Hα line at SNR ≃ 10 (20), uncertainty could improve to 0.12" (0.08"). A measurement of this type with sufficiently small uncertainty may reveal small-scale wiggles in the shape of the critical curve, which can arise from the lensing perturbation of sub-galactic dark matter substructure. Our approach is generally applicable to caustic-crossing giant arcs and can be incorporated into global lens modeling.

### 174) [2511.17738](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17738v1): JADES: Low Surface Brightness Galaxies at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.8 in GOODS-S

Low surface brightness galaxies (LSBs) are an important class of galaxies that allow us to broaden our understanding of galaxy formation and test various cosmological models. We present a survey of low surface brightness galaxies at 0.4 &lt; z<sub>phot</sub> &lt; 0.8 in the GOODS-S field using JADES data. We model LSB surface brightness profiles, identifying those with \barμ_eff &gt; 24 mag arcsec^-2 in the F200W JWST/NIRCam filter. We study the spatial distribution, number density, Sérsic profile parameters, and rest-frame colours of these LSBs. We compare the photometrically-derived star formation histories, mass-weighted ages, and dust attenuations of these galaxies with a high surface brightness (HSB) sample at similar redshift and a lower redshift (z<sub>phot</sub> &lt; 0.4) LSB sample, all of which have stellar masses ≲ 10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. We find that both the high and the low redshift LSB samples have low star formation (SFR_100 ≲ 0.01 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1) compared with the HSB sample (SFR_100 ≳ 0.01 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1). The star formation histories show that the LSBs and HSBs possibly come from the same progenitors at z ≳ 2, though the histories are not well constrained for the LSB samples. The LSBs appear to have minimal dust, with most of our LSB samples showing A_V &lt; 1 mag. JWST has pushed our understanding of LSBs beyond the local Universe.

### 175) [2511.17712](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17712v1): PROJECT-J: the shocking H2 outflow from HH46

<p>
We analyze the H2 emission observed in the HH46 Class I system as part of PROJECT-J (Protostellar Jets Cradle Tested with JWST), to investigate the origin and excitation of the warm molecular outflow. We used NIRSpec and MIRI spectral maps (1.6-27.9 microns) to trace the structure and physical conditions of the outflow. By fitting the H2 rotational diagrams with a multi-temperature gas model, we derived key physical parameters including temperature, extinction, column densities, and the ortho-to-para ratio. This information is combined with a detailed kinematical analysis and comparison with irradiated shock models. We find no evidence of H2 temperature or velocity stratification from the axis to the edge of the outflow, as would be expected in MHD disk-wind models and as observed in other outflows. Instead, the observations suggest that the H2 emission arises from shock interactions between jet bow shocks and/or wide-angle winds with the ambient medium and cavity walls. NIRSpec emission and velocity maps reveal expanding molecular shells, likely driven by the less luminous source in the binary system. We infer an accretion rate of less than 10^-9 solar masses per year for the secondary source, approximately one order of magnitude lower than that of the primary. The H2 emission is consistent with excitation by low-velocity (approximately 10 km/s) J-type shocks, irradiated by an external UV field that may originate from strong dissociative shocks driven by the atomic jet. Future JWST observations will further constrain the evolution of the expanding shell and the mechanisms driving the outflow.

### 176) [2511.17385](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17385v1): Discovering periodic and repeating nuclear transients in the XMM-Newton archives

<p> Natalie A. Webb, Vincent Foustoul, Robbie Webbe, Matteo Bachetti, Erwan Quintin, Laurent Michel </p>
<p>
The regions around massive black holes can show X-ray variability on timescales from seconds to decades. Observing many black holes over different timescales can enhance our chances of detecting variability coming from (partial) tidal disruption events, massive black hole binaries, changing state AGN, blazar activity and much more. X-ray catalogues with hundreds of thousands of detections are treasure troves of such sources, which require innovative methods to identify these black holes. We present the current XMM-Newton catalogues available and describe several examples of tidal disruption events (TDEs) and quasi-periodic eruption sources that have been found whilst mining this data. We describe preliminary work on a search for periodic variables in the XMM-Newton EPIC archival data, with the example of finding new massive black hole binaries. We also describe the STONKS pipeline that is now in the XMM-Newton automatic reduction pipeline and the near real-time alert system that allows the follow-up of new and fading transients. We provide examples of fading sources that are newly identified candidate TDEs.

### 177) [2511.16752](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16752v1): Finding He II: Testing Novel Models of Binary Populations across Cosmic Time

<p> Beryl Hovis-Afflerbach, Allison L. Strom, Alberto Saldana-Lopez, Sophia R. Flury </p>
<p>
Our understanding of massive stars remains incomplete. Many high-z galaxies and nearby analogs exhibit strong He II emission, indicating an abundance of photons with energies &gt;54.4 eV that standard single-star population models cannot explain. Recent studies show that binary evolution and non-solar abundance patterns are required to explain the distinct spectra of high-z galaxies observed by JWST. However, treatments of these properties vary drastically between models. We present the first results from a comparison of models with different treatments of binaries, including BPASS and novel stripped star models, with rest-UV-optical spectra of high-z galaxies' local analogs. This type of investigation can provide insights into which aspects of binary evolution are important to reproduce observations and identify priorities in ongoing efforts to improve models. By constraining the properties of massive stars at high redshift, we can learn about the processes at play in high-z galaxies and massive star evolution more broadly.

### 178) [2511.16256](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16256v1): Accelerating Reionization Constraints: An ANN-Emulator Framework for the SCRIPT Semi-numerical Model

<p> Saptarshi Sarkar, Tirthankar Roy Choudhury </p>
<p>
Constraining the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) with physically motivated simulations is hampered by the high cost of conventional parameter inference. We present an efficient emulator-based framework that dramatically reduces this bottleneck for the photon-conserving semi-numerical code SCRIPT. Our approach combines (i) a reliable coarse-resolution MCMC to locate the high-likelihood region (exploiting the large-scale convergence of SCRIPT) with (ii) an adaptive, targeted sampling strategy to build a compact high-resolution training set for an artificial neural network based emulator of the model likelihood. With only ≈ 10^3 high-resolution simulations, the trained emulators achieve excellent predictive accuracy (R^2 ≈ 0.97&ndash;0.99) and, when embedded within an MCMC framework, reproduce posterior distributions from full high-resolution runs. Compared to conventional MCMC, our pipeline reduces the number of expensive simulations by a factor of ~ 100 and lowers total CPU cost by up to a factor of ~ 70, while retaining statistical fidelity. This computational speedup makes inference in much higher-dimensional models tractable (e.g., those needed to incorporate JWST and upcoming 21 cm datasets) and provides a general strategy for building efficient emulators for next generation of EoR constraints.

### 179) [2511.16119](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16119v1): Chemical evolution of bulges of active galactic nuclei in the early Universe: roles of accreting stars

<p> Shuo Zhai, Jian-Min Wang, Yan-Rong Li, Wei-Jian Guo, Gang Zhao </p>
<p>
JWST/NIRCam observations reveal dense stellar cores in high-redshift galactic bulges, indicative of sustained star formation and potential stellar accretion. We introduce accretion-modified star (AMS) as a new component in the chemical evolution of high-redshift bulges hosting active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The gas-phase chemical evolution of bulge environments containing AMS is modeled within 1 Gyr by combining population evolution and galactic chemical evolution formalisms, and observational signatures are tracked via photoionization modeling on Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagrams. Sustained high accretion onto AMSs leads to rapid gas-phase metal enrichment of the bulge, producing abundance peaks up to five times solar metallicity within 0.1 Gyr and significantly modifying elemental ratios in the gas phase. Atypical gas-phase abundance patterns during early, high-accretion phases and gradually diminish as the accretion rate declines. In BPT diagrams, high-AMS-accretion scenarios shift the modeled emission-line sequence toward the local AGN branch and extend into the high-metallicity regime. Super-solar narrow-line regions observed in AGNs at z&gt;15 may reflect such AMS-driven gas-phase enrichment of host bulge under extreme gas densities. While direct detection of AMSs within AGN bulges remains challenging, the model provides testable predictions for future spectroscopic surveys and motivates further exploration of non-canonical stellar populations in AGN host bulges.

### 180) [2511.16003](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16003v1): JWST observations of cosmic-ray-excited H<sub>2</sub> in Barnard 68: spatial variations and constraints on cosmic-ray attenuation

<p>
We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec observations of the starless dark cloud Barnard 68 that reveal the spatially-resolved signature of cosmic-ray excited molecular hydrogen (CRXH<sub>2</sub>) emissions for the first time. Following up on our initial detection of CRXH<sub>2</sub> emissions from B68 (Bialy et al. 2025), we now exploit JWST's sensitivity and spatial multiplexing to map CRXH<sub>2</sub> rovibrational lines across 16 sight lines through the cloud. By disentangling the CRXH<sub>2</sub> and UV-pumped H<sub>2</sub> components, we isolate the para-H<sub>2</sub>-dominated spectrum attributable to cosmic-ray excitation. We find that there are significant spatial variations in the ratio of the CRXH<sub>2</sub> line intensity to the line-of-sight H<sub>2</sub> column density; these cannot be accounted for by dust extinction alone and demonstrate a clear attenuation of the cosmic-ray flux with increasing shielding column. Modeling B68 as a Bonnor-Ebert sphere, we constrain both the unshielded cosmic-ray ionization rate, ζ_H<sub>2</sub>, and how it decreases with shielding column. At a reference depth of N(H<sub>2</sub>) = 3 × 10^21 cm<sup>2</sup>, we infer ζ_H<sub>2</sub> ≈ 1.4 × 10^-16 s<sup>-1</sup>, a factor of ≈ 3 higher than the average value derived from H_3^+ absorption studies. These results provide the most direct probe to date of cosmic-ray penetration into cold, dense gas, offering new constraints on both the microphysics of CR-H<sub>2</sub> interactions and the attenuation of low-energy cosmic rays in molecular clouds. Our findings establish CRXH<sub>2</sub> emission as a powerful new diagnostic of the cosmic-ray environment in interstellar space.

<p> Fabio Fontanot, Roberto Decarli, Gabriella De Lucia, Olga Cucciati, Lizhi Xie, Michaela Hirschmann </p>
<p>
We discuss the properties of a sample of z&gt;6 bright (bolometric luminosity L_bolo&gt;10^46.25 erg/s) Quasars drawn from a realization of the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) model coupled with the Planck Millennium Simulation. We focus on the properties and environment of host galaxies, and their evolution down to z=0, with the aim of assessing how well the bright high redshift QSOs population traces the progenitors of most massive haloes in the local Universe. Our results show that at z&gt;6 bright QSOs live in a variety of environments, and that secular processes like disc instability are responsible for triggering roughly the same number of QSOs as galaxy mergers. Half of cubic (7.5 h^-1 cMpc size) mock fields built around these high-z QSOs include other active galaxies (with L_bolo&gt;10^44 erg/s) in sizeable number, the other host galaxies being relatively isolated. The large field-to-field variance in the the number of companions (both active and non-active) recently reported from JWST observations is fairly well reproduced by GAEA predictions. Descendants of host galaxies at z=0 cover a wide range of physical properties and environments with only a small fraction of the hosts of high-z QSOs ending up in massive galaxy clusters. Viceversa, GAEA predicts that only a small fraction of Bright Central Galaxies have a bright z&gt;6 QSOs among their progenitors. Our results suggest that luminous high-z QSO loosely trace the progenitors of low-z galaxy clusters, and that additional information about the environment of high-z QSOs are required to identify the most promising proto-cluster candidates.

[abridged] The previously inaccessible star formation tracer Paα can now be spatially resolved by JWST NIRCam slitless spectroscopy in distant galaxies up to cosmic noon. In the first study of its kind, we combine JWST NGDEEP NIRISS and FRESCO NIRCam slitless spectroscopy to provide the first direct comparison of spatially resolved dust-obscured (traced by Paα) versus unobscured (traced by Hα) star formation across the main sequence. We stack Paα and Hα emission-line maps, along with stellar continuum images at both wavelengths of 31 galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;1.8 in three bins of stellar mass. Surface brightness profiles are measured and equivalent width (EW) profiles computed. Increasing Paα and Hα EW profiles with galactocentric radius across all stellar masses probed provide direct evidence for the inside-out growth of galaxies both via dust-obscured and unobscured star formation for the first time. For galaxies on the main sequence, a weakly positive (0.1±0.1) Paα/Hα line profile as a function of radius is found at 8.8≤log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;9.9 with a negative (-0.4±0.1) Paα/Hα line profile found at 9.9≤log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;11.0. Low mass galaxies (7.7≤log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;8.8) with high sSFRs are found to have a negative (-0.5±0.1) Paα/Hα line profile gradient. Our results demonstrate that while inside-out growth via star formation is ubiquitous across the main sequence just after cosmic noon, centrally concentrated dust attenuation is not. Along with other recent work in the literature, our findings motivate future studies of resolved SFR profiles in large samples of individual cosmic noon galaxies across the main sequence, to understand the intrinsic scatter in spatially resolved star formation.

<p> Nikolaos Samaras </p>
<p>
Milgromian Dynamics (MOND) has been particularly successful in predicting scaling relations for galactic systems, namely the baryonic Tully-Fisher for spirals, the Faber-Jackson for ellipticals and the Radial Acceleration Relation for late-type galaxies. Its essential tenet is the modification of the gravity law at low accelerations. Nevertheless, despite MOND's passed tests, the puzzle of the missing mass on galaxy clusters' scales still persists. One proposed scenario to complete this deficit and apply it further to cosmology is the so-called νHDM model. It is composed of a sterile neutrino and the MOND gravity. In this Ph.D. thesis, I have put forward this cosmological idea, conducting hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the νHDM structure formation. In the debut attempt, the νHDM model was proven capable of reproducing the ΛCDM cosmology, imitating the same expansion history (Ω_m ≈ 0.3 and H_0 ≈ 67.6 km/s/Mpc), reproducing the CMB phenomenology, while the cosmic web is nicely formed. In the next step, I have optimized the νHDM model using Bayesian statistics, re-branding it to opt-νHDM. I managed to optimally fit the angular power spectrum of the CMB calculated by itPlanck, except its fourth peak, but the opt-νHDM cosmological parameters changed significantly with respect to its precursor, resulting in a much heavier cosmos, with Ω_m ≈ 0.5 and H_0 ≈ 55.6 km/s/Mpc. Next, I explore the opt-νHDM expansion history, its structure formation and the resulting mass function. The appearance of the early-time structures, firstly in the νHDM model, as well as in the opt-νHDM model occurs quiet late, at z≈4 and at z≈ 5.5, respectively. Although the resolution has improved from previous studies, the νHDM variants cannot explain easily the high-redshift galaxies, observed by JWST.

Fazio, Daryl Haggard, Joseph L. Hora, Bart Ripperda, Nadeen B. Sabha, Howard A. Smith, Gunther Witzel </p>
<p>
JWST/MIRI observations can place photometric limits on the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) near the Galactic Centre. The stellar complex IRS 13E, a co-moving conglomerate of young and massive stars, is a prime location to study because it has been speculated to be bound by an IMBH. Assuming a standard radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) and a minimum fractional variability of 10% of intrinsic luminosity, the wavelength of peak emission in the spectral energy distribution for an IMBH would lie in the mid-infrared (~ 5-25 μm), and variability would be detectable in MIRI time-series observations. Monitoring fails to detect such variable emission (other than from Sgr A*) in and around the IRS 13E complex, and upper limits on a putative IMBH's intrinsic variability on timescales of minutes to about 1 hour are ≲1 mJy at 12 μm and ≲2 mJy at 19 μm. These translate to luminosities ≲ 25 × 10^32 erg/s. The resulting limits on the IMBH mass and accretion rate rule out any IMBH with mass ≳ 10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> accreting at ≳ 10^-6 times Eddington rate at the location of IRS 13E. Further, the observations rule out an IMBH anywhere in the central 6" × 6" region that is more massive than ≈ 2 × 10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and accreting at ≳ 10^-6 of the Eddington rate. Assuming Bondi accretion scaled to typical RIAF-accretion efficiencies, albeit somewhat uncertain, also allows us to rule out IMBHs moving with typical velocities of about 200 km/s and masses ≳ 2 × 10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. These methods showcase the effectiveness of photometric variability measurements in constraining the presence of accreting black holes in Galactic centre-like environments.

<p>
S. D. von Fellenberg et al. (2025a, Paper I) reported the first mid-infrared detection of a flare from Sgr A*. The JWST/MIRI/MRS observations were consistent with an orbiting hotspot undergoing electron injection with a spectrum that subsequently breaks from synchrotron cooling. However, mid-infrared extinction measurements appropriate for these data were not yet determined, and therefore the temporal evolution of the absolute spectral index remained unknown. This work applies new Galactic Center extinction measurements to the flare observations. The evolution of the spectral index after the peak is fully consistent with that reported in Paper I with a maximum absolute mid-infrared spectral index α_MIR=0.45±0.01_stat±0.08_sys during the second mid-infrared flare peak, matching the known near-infrared spectral index during bright states (α_NIR≈0.5). There was a near-instantaneous change in the mid-infrared spectral index of Δα_MIR=0.33±0.06_stat±0.11_sys at the flare onset. We propose this as a quantitative definition for this infrared flare's beginning, physically interpreted as the underlying electron distribution's transition into a hard power-law distribution. This paper also reports the SMA millimeter polarization during the flare, which shows a small, distorted, but overall clockwise-oriented Stokes Q&ndash;U loop during the third mid-infrared peak. Extrapolating the mid-infrared flux power law to the millimeter yields a variable flux consistent with the observed 220 GHz emission. These results, together with the Paper I modeling, plausibly suggest a single hotspot produced both the mid-infrared and millimeter variability during this event. However, additional flares are required to make a general statement about the millimeter and mid-infrared connection.

We present JWST observations of the radio galaxy TGSSJ1530+1049, spectroscopically confirmed at z=4.0. NIRCam images and NIRSpec/IFU spectroscopy (R=2700) show that TGSSJ1530+1049 is part of one of the densest-known structures of continuum and line-emitting objects found at these redshifts. NIRCam images show a number of distinct continuum objects and evidence of interactions traced by diffuse emission, and the NIRSpec IFU cube reveals further strong line emitting regions. We identify six continuum and four additional strong Halpha emitting sources with weaker or no underlying continuum within the 3''x3'' IFU field. From spatial alignment with high-resolution radio data and emission line profiles, the radio AGN host galaxy is clearly identified. The bright Halpha emission (but not the optical components) is distributed remarkably linearly along the radio axis, suggestive of a biconical illumination zone by a central obscured AGN. The emission line kinematics indicate jet-gas interactions on scales of a few kpc. However, due to large relative velocities and presence of underlying continuum, the alignment with the radio structure appears to be, at least partly, caused by a particular configuration of interacting galaxies. At least four objects within a 10x10 (projected) kpc<sup>2</sup> area which includes the radio source have high stellar masses (log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&gt;10.3) and star formation rates in the range 70-163 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1. Using a stellar mass-based analysis, we predict a total dark matter halo mass of ≈10^13 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Based on the physical separations and velocity differences between the galaxies, it is expected that these galaxies will merge to form a massive galaxy within a few Gyr. The system qualitatively resembles the forming brightest cluster galaxies in cosmological simulations that form early through a rapid succession of mergers.

<p>
We examine the spatial distribution of star clusters in NGC 628 using the statistical tool INDICATE to quantify clustering tendencies. Our sample, based on HST and JWST observations, is the most complete to date, spanning ages from 1 Myr to &gt;100 Myr. We find cluster spatial behaviour varies with galactic position, age, and mass. Most emerging young clusters are tightly spatially associated with each other, while fully emerged clusters are in ~1.5 times looser spatial associations, irrespective of age. Young Massive Clusters (YMCs ≥ 10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) tend to associate with lower-mass clusters but not strongly with other YMCs, implying that intense star formation regions produce a few YMCs alongside many lower-mass clusters rather than multiple YMCs together. Young concentrated clusters show a wide radial distribution in the galactic disk, which narrows with age; with concentrated clusters &gt;100 Myr mostly residing between 2-6 kpc. This pattern may reflect either faster dispersal of isolated tight cluster spatial "structure" in a lower gas density outer disk or gradual inside-out growth, with the formation of this structure shifting outward over time. We also detect distinct spatial behaviours for clusters within 2 kpc, linked to the inner Lindblad resonance (≤1 kpc), nuclear ring (~0.5-1 kpc), and the start of spiral arms (~1.25-2 kpc), suggesting these regions exhibit strong radial motions that could hinder clusters from forming and remaining in tight concentrations. Our results highlight how spatially-resolved studies of clusters can reveal the influence of galactic dynamics on star formation and cluster evolution.

Measuring the ionizing photon production efficiency ξ<sub>ion</sub>,0 &ndash; the ratio of ionizing photon output rate Q_H^0 to UV continuum luminosity L_UV &ndash; in galaxies at z &gt; 6 is crucial for constraining their contribution to cosmic reionization. We present integrated and spatially resolved measurements of ξ<sub>ion</sub>,0 for 12 exceptionally bright (M_UV ~ -22 mag) star-forming galaxies at z ~ 7 from the REBELS survey. These measurements are based on JWST NIRSpec/IFU PRISM spectroscopy, probing the rest-frame UV and optical regime. Notably, in 8 of the 12 galaxies, the spectral coverage includes Hα, enabling self-consistent dust attenuation estimates in both the ionized gas and stellar continuum via the Balmer decrement and rest-UV slope, respectively. We find global logξ<sub>ion</sub>,0 values ranging from 25.19±0.11 to 25.61±0.11, with a weighted mean of 25.44±0.15, consistent with the canonical value of ~25.3. Using a sample of 25 star-forming clumps within these galaxies, we explore local variations in LyC production efficiency, finding a broader range, from 24.52±0.21 to 26.18±0.61. We identify strong correlations between ξ<sub>ion</sub>,0 and specific star formation rate, star formation surface density, Hβ equivalent width, and stellar mass. Clumps with the highest ξ<sub>ion</sub>,0 exhibit EW_0(Hβ) ≥ 150 Angstrom, consistent with young stellar ages. From previous Lyα measurements in three galaxies, we estimate a typical Lyα escape fraction of f<sub>esc</sub>, Lyα ~ 2&percnt;, suggesting similar or lower escape fractions for LyC photons. Combining this with our Hα measurements, we infer ionized bubble sizes ~ 1 pMpc, aligned with expectations from Lyα-detected systems and reionization models.

### 189) [2511.08685](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08685v3): Kinematic scaling relations of disc galaxies from ionised gas at z~1 and their connection with dark matter haloes

<p> Pavel E. Mancera Piña, Enrico M. Di Teodoro, S. Michael Fall, Antonino Marasco, Mariska Kriek, Marco Martorano </p>
<p>
We derive the Tully-Fisher (TFR, M<sub>&ast;</sub>-V_circ,f) and Fall (FR, j<sub>&ast;</sub>-M<sub>&ast;</sub>) relations at redshift z = 0.9 using a sample of 43 main-sequence disc galaxies with Hα IFU data and JWST/HST imaging. The strength of our analysis lies in the use of state-of-the-art 3D kinematic models to infer galaxy rotation curves, the inclusion and morphological modelling of NIR bands, and the use of SED modelling applied to our photometry measurements to estimate stellar masses. After correcting the inferred Hα velocities for asymmetric drift, we find a TFR of the form log(M<sub>&ast;</sub> / M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = a log(V_circ,f / 150~km s<sup>-1</sup>) + b, with a=3.82^+0.55_-0.40 and b=10.27^+0.06_-0.07, as well as a FR of the form log(j<sub>&ast;</sub> / kpc km s<sup>-1</sup>) = a log(M<sub>&ast;</sub> / 10^10.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) + b, with a=0.44^+0.06_-0.06 and b=2.86^+0.02_-0.02. Compared with their z=0 counterparts, we find moderate evolution in the TFR and strong evolution in the FR over the past 8 Gyr. We interpret our findings in the context of the galaxy-to-halo scaling parameters f_M=M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M_vir and f_j=j<sub>&ast;</sub>/j_vir. We infer that f_j shows little redshift evolution and depends very weakly on M<sub>&ast;</sub>, with typical values around f_j~0.8. As for f_M, we find it to be higher and less dependent on M<sub>&ast;</sub> at z=0.9 than at z=0. Interpreting our observed f_M-M<sub>&ast;</sub> relations within the Cold Dark Matter framework implies necessarily that the galaxy populations at z=0.9 and z=0 are not the progenitor/descendant of one another. The alternative scenario is that the z=0.9 relations are incorrect due to strong selection effects, unidentified systematics, or the possibility that Hα kinematics may not be a reliable dynamical tracer. Such problems would also affect previous studies on the same subject.

### 190) [2511.08477](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08477v2): Supermassive Dark Stars and their remnants as a possible solution to three recent cosmic dawn puzzles

<p> Cosmin Ilie, Jillian Paulin, Andreea Petric, Katherine Freese </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has begun to revolutionize our view of the Cosmos. The discovery of Blue Monsters (i.e., ultra-compact yet very bright high-z galaxies) and the Little Red Dots (i.e., very compact dustless strong Balmer break cosmic dawn sources) pose significant challenges to pre-JWST era models of the assembly of first stars and galaxies. In addition, JWST data further strengthen the problem posed by the origin of the supermassive black holes that power the most distant quasars observed. Stars powered by Dark Matter annihilation (i.e., Dark Stars) can form out of primordial gas clouds during the cosmic dawn era and subsequently might grow via accretion and become supermassive. In this paper we argue that Supermassive Dark Stars (SMDSs) offer natural solutions to the three puzzles mentioned above.

<p>
We present the full sample of measurements of the warm dust emission of 31 strongly-lensed, multiply imaged quasars, observed with JWST MIRI multiband imaging, which we use to constrain the particle properties of dark matter. The strongly lensed warm dust region of quasars is compact and statistically sensitive to a population of dark matter halos down to masses of 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. The high spatial resolution and infrared sensitivity of MIRI make it uniquely suited to measure multiply imaged warm dust emission from quasars and thus to infer the properties of low-mass dark halos. We use the measured flux ratios to test for a warm dark matter turnover in the halo mass function. To infer the dark matter parameters, we use a forward modeling pipeline which explores dark matter parameters while also accounting for tidal stripping effects on subhalos, globular clusters, and complex deflector macromodels with m=1, m=3,  and  m=4 elliptical multipole moments. Adopting a comparable prior on the projected density of substructure to our previous analyses, the data presented here provide a factor of 2 improvement in sensitivity to a turnover in the halo mass function. Assuming subhalo abundance predicted by the semi-analytic model galacticus we infer with a Bayes factor of 10:1, a half-mode mass m_hm &lt; 10^7.8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> (m&gt;5.6 keV for a thermally produced dark matter particle). If instead we use a prior from N-body simulations, we infer m_hm &lt; 10^7.6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> (m&gt;6.4 keV). This is one of the strongest constraints to date on a turnover on the halo mass function, and the flux ratios and inference methodology presented here can be used to test a broad range of dark matter physics.

We present a measurement of the free-streaming length of dark matter (DM) and subhalo abundance around 28 quadruple image strong lenses using observations from JWST MIRI presented in Paper III of this series. We improve on previous inferences on DM properties from lensed quasars by simultaneously reconstructing extended lensed arcs with image positions and relative magnifications (flux ratios). Our forward modeling framework generates full populations of subhalos, line-of-sight halos, and globular clusters, uses an accurate model for subhalo tidal evolution, and accounts for free-streaming effects on halo abundance and concentration. Modeling lensed arcs leads to more-precise model-predicted flux ratios, breaking covariance between subhalo abundance and the free-streaming scale parameterized by the half-mode mass m_hm. Assuming subhalo abundance predicted by the semi-analytic model \ttgalacticus (N-body simulations), we infer (Bayes factor of 10:1) m_hm &lt; 10^7.4 M<sub>&odot;</sub> (m_hm &lt; 10^7.2 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), a 0.4 dex improvement relative to omitting lensed arcs. These bounds correspond to lower limits on thermal relic DM particle masses of 7.4 and 8.4 keV, respectively. Conversely, assuming DM is cold, we infer a projected mass in subhalos (10^6 &lt; m/M<sub>&odot;</sub>&lt;10^10.7) of 1.7_-1.2^+2.6 × 10^7  M<sub>&odot;</sub>  kpc^-2 at 95 &percnt; confidence. This is consistent with \ttgalacticus predictions (0.9 × 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>  kpc^-2), but in mild tension with recent N-body simulations (0.6 × 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>  kpc^-2). Our results are among the strongest bounds on WDM, and the most precise measurement of subhalo abundance around strong lenses. Further improvements will follow from the large sample of lenses to be discovered by Euclid, Rubin, and Roman.

High-resolution JWST images of nearby spiral galaxies reveal polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission structures that trace molecular gas, including CO-dark regions. We identify ISM cloud structures in PHANGS-JWST 7.7 μm PAH maps for 66 galaxies, smoothed to 30 pc and at native resolution, extracting 108,466 and 146,040 clouds, respectively. Molecular properties were inferred using a linear conversion from PAH to CO. Given the tendency for clouds in galaxy centers to overlap in velocity space, we opted to flag these and omit them from the analysis in this work. The remaining clouds correspond to giant molecular clouds, such as those detected in CO(2-1) emission by ALMA, or lower surface density clouds that either fall below the ALMA detection limits of existing maps or genuinely have no molecular counterpart. Cross-matching with ALMA CO maps at 90 pc in 27 galaxies shows that 41 % of PAH clouds have CO associations. The converted molecular properties vary little across environments, but the most massive clouds are preferentially found in spiral arms. Fitting lognormal mass distributions down to 2×10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> shows that spiral arms host the highest-mass clouds, consistent with enhanced formation in arm gravitational potentials. Cloud molecular surface densities decline by a factor of ~ 1.5-2 toward 2 - 3 R_e. However, the trend largely varies in individual galaxies, with flat, decreasing, and even no trend as a function of galactocentric radius. Factors like large-scale processes and morphologies might influence the observed trends. We publish two catalogs online, one at the common resolution of 30 pc and another at the native resolution. We expect them to have broad utility for future PAH clouds, molecular clouds, and star formation studies.

Ram pressure stripping (RPS) plays a crucial role in shaping galaxy evolution in dense environments, yet its impact on the molecular and dusty phases of the interstellar medium remains poorly understood. We present JWST/NIRCam 3.3μm polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission maps for the nine most striking RPS galaxies in the Abell 2744 cluster at redshift z_cl=0.306, tracing the effects of environmental processes on small dust grains. Exploiting multi-band JWST/NIRCam and HST photometry, we performed a spatially resolved ultraviolet (UV) to mid-infrared (MIR) spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to characterise stellar populations in both galactic disks and clumps detected in the stripped tails. We detected PAH_3.3 emission in eight of the nine galaxies at 5σ, with morphologies revealing disk truncation and elongation along the RPS direction. In three galaxies, PAH_3.3 emission is also found in star-forming clumps embedded in the stripped tails up to a distance of 40kpc. Star formation rates inferred from PAH_3.3 emission are in agreement with those derived from SED fitting averaged over the past 100Myr within an intrinsic scatter of 0.4dex, but the relation appears to be age-dependent. The spatial correlation between the PAH strength, stellar age, and star formation rate (SFR) is consistent across disks and tails and demonstrates that PAH-carrying molecules can survive and become stripped by ram pressure. Finally, age gradients revealed by the SED fitting provide observational evidence of the fireball model in star-forming, stripped clumps of galaxies at z ~ 0.3. This work represents the first detailed study of PAH emission in cluster galaxies, offering new insights into the fate of dust and star formation in extreme environments.

The AXIS Community Science Book represents the collective effort of 592 scientists worldwide to define the transformative science enabled by the Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), a next-generation X-ray mission selected by NASA's Astrophysics Probe Program for Phase A study. AXIS will advance the legacy of high-angular-resolution X-ray astronomy with ~1.5'' imaging over a wide 24' field of view and an order of magnitude greater collecting area than Chandra in the 0.3-12 keV band. Combining sharp imaging, high throughput, and rapid response capabilities, AXIS will open new windows on virtually every aspect of modern astrophysics, exploring the birth and growth of supermassive black holes, the feedback processes that shape galaxies, the life cycles of stars and exoplanet environments, and the nature of compact stellar remnants, supernova remnants, and explosive transients. This book compiles 138 community-contributed science cases developed by five Science Working Groups focused on AGN and supermassive black holes, galaxy evolution and feedback, compact objects and supernova remnants, stellar physics and exoplanets, and time-domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. Together, these studies establish the scientific foundation for next-generation X-ray exploration in the 2030s and highlight strong synergies with facilities of the 2030s, such as JWST, Roman, Rubin/LSST, SKA, ALMA, ngVLA, and next-generation gravitational-wave and neutrino networks.

The Cosmic Vine is a massive protocluster at z=3.44 in the JWST CEERS field, offering an ideal laboratory for studying the early phases of cluster formation. Using the data from the DAWN JWST Archive, we conduct a comprehensive study on the large-scale structure, stellar mass function (SMF), quiescent members, and dark matter halos in the Cosmic Vine. First, we spectroscopically confirm 136 galaxies in the Vine at z=3.44, and an additional 47 galaxies belonging to a diffuse foreground structure at z=3.34 which we dub the Leaf. We identify four subgroups comprising the Cosmic Vine and two subgroups within the Leaf. Second, we identified 11 quiescent members with log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=9.5-11.0, the largest sample of quiescent galaxies in overdense environments at z&gt;3, which gives an enhanced quiescent galaxy number density 2x10^(-4)cMpc^(-3) that is three times above the field level at log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &gt; 10. Notably, these quiescent members form a tight red sequence on the color-magnitude diagram, making it one of the earliest red sequences known to date. Third, by constructing the SMFs for both star-forming and quiescent members, we find that both SMFs are top-heavy, with a significantly enhanced quiescent fraction at log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&gt;10.5 compared to field counterparts. The stellar mass-size analysis reveals that star-forming members are more compact at higher masses than their field counterparts. Finally, we estimate a halo mass of log(Mh/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=13.2+-0.3 for the protocluster core, and log(Mh/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=11.9-12.4 for satellite subgroups. The phase-space analysis indicates that three subgroups are likely infalling to the core. This work reveals a high abundance of massive galaxies and dark matter halos in a forming cluster, demonstrating the accelerated assembly of massive galaxies in massive halos when the Universe was less than 2 billion years old.

### 197) [2510.19959](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19959v2): Rapid, out of equilibrium metal enrichment indicated by a flat mass-metallicity relation at z~6 from NIRCam grism spectroscopy

We aim to characterise the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and the 3D correlation between stellar mass, metallicity and star-formation rate (SFR) known as the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) for galaxies at 5&lt;z&lt;7. Using ~800 [O III] selected galaxies from deep NIRCam grism surveys, we present our stacked measurements of direct-T_e metallicities, which we use to test recent strong-line metallicity calibrations. Our measured direct-T_e metallicities (0.1-0.2 Z<sub>&odot;</sub> for M<sub>&sext;</sub> ≈5×10^7-9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, respectively) match recent JWST/NIRSpec-based results. However, there are significant inconsistencies between observations and hydrodynamical simulations. We observe a flatter MZR slope than the SPHINX^20 and FLARES simulations, which cannot be attributed to selection effects. With simple models, we show that the effect of an [O III] flux-limited sample on the observed shape of the MZR is strongly dependent on the FMR. If the FMR is similar to the one in the local Universe, the intrinsic high-redshift MZR should be even flatter than observed. In turn, a 3D relation where SFR correlates positively with metallicity at fixed mass would imply an intrinsically steeper MZR. Our measurements indicate that metallicity variations at fixed mass show little dependence on the SFR, suggesting a flat intrinsic MZR. This could indicate that the low-mass galaxies at these redshifts are out of equilibrium and that metal enrichment occurs rapidly in low-mass galaxies. However, being limited by our stacking analysis, we are yet to probe the scatter in the MZR and its dependence on SFR. Large carefully selected samples of galaxies with robust metallicity measurements can put tight constraints on the high-redshift FMR and, help to understand the interplay between gas flows, star formation and feedback in early galaxies.

Galaxies exhibit a tight correlation between their star-formation rate and stellar mass over a wide redshift range known as the star-forming main sequence (SFMS). With JWST, we can now investigate the SFMS at high redshifts down to masses of ~10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, using sensitive star-formation rate tracers such as Hα emission &ndash; which allow us to probe the variability in star formation histories. We present inferences of the SFMS based on 316 Hα-selected galaxies at z~4-5 with log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 6.4 -10.6. These galaxies were identified behind the Abell 2744 lensing cluster with NIRCam grism spectroscopy from the "All the Little Things'' (ALT) survey. At face value, our data suggest a shallow slope of the SFMS (SFR &prop; M<sub>&sext;</sub>^α, with α=0.45). After correcting for the Hα-flux limited nature of our survey using a Bayesian framework, the slope steepens to α= 0.59^+0.10_-0.09, whereas current data on their own are inconclusive on the mass dependence of the scatter. These slopes differ significantly from the slope of ≈1 expected from the observed evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function and from simulations. When fixing the slope to α=1, we find evidence for a decreasing intrinsic scatter with stellar mass (from ≈ 0.5 dex at M<sub>&sext;</sub>=10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> to 0.4 dex at M<sub>&sext;</sub>=10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>). This tension might be explained by a (combination of) luminosity-dependent SFR(Hα) calibration, a population of (mini)-quenched low-mass galaxies, or underestimated dust attenuation in high-mass galaxies. Future deep observations across facilities can quantify these processes, enabling better insights into the variability of star formation histories.

Characterizing dust attenuation is crucial for revealing the intrinsic physical properties of galaxies. We present an analysis of dust attenuation in 18 spectroscopically confirmed star-forming main-sequence galaxies at z = 4.4-5.7 observed with JWST/NIRSpec IFU and NIRCam, selected from the ALPINE and CRISTAL ALMA large programs. We fit the emission line fluxes from NIRSpec and the broad-band photometry from NIRCam with Prospector, using both spatially integrated emission and ~0.6 kpc pixel-by-pixel measurements. We derive the stellar-to-nebular dust attenuation ratio (f=E(B-V)_star/E(B-V)_neb) from the SED fits and the Balmer decrement with Hα and Hβ. Although individual galaxies show large scatter, the best-fit value is f = 0.51^+0.04_-0.03, slightly higher than that measured for local starburst galaxies. We find weak correlations of f with galaxy properties, increasing with higher specific star-formation rates, younger stellar ages, and more recent star-formation. For the range of E(B-V)_star = 0.009-0.15 mag for in our sample, assuming f = 1 (often adopted in high-redshift studies) instead of f = 0.51 underestimate line luminosities and ionizing photon production efficiency ξ<sub>ion</sub> by ~3-36&percnt; and ~4-46&percnt;, respectively. We also find that the total stellar masses estimated from spatially-integrated SED fits with a delayed-τ star-formation histories are systematically smaller than the sum of pixel-by-pixel SED fits, with a median offset of ~ 0.26 dex, likely because the integrated fits are biased toward luminous young stellar populations.

### 200) [2510.17968](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17968v2): Rise of the forsaken relics: connecting present-day stellar streams and phase-mixed galaxies to the Epoch of Reionization

<p>
The `near-far' approach to studying reionization leverages the star formation histories of the Milky Way (MW) or Local Group (LG) galaxies, derived from resolved photometry, to infer the low-mass/faint-end of the stellar mass functions (SMFs) or the ultraviolet luminosity functions (UVLFs) of high-redshift galaxies (z ≳ 6), beyond the current JWST detection limits (M_UV ≳ -15). Previous works considered only intact low-mass galaxies in the MW and LG, neglecting disrupted galaxies such as stellar streams and phase-mixed objects. Using the FIRE-2 simulations, we show that these disrupted galaxies contribute up to ~50&percnt; of the total stellar mass budget of the proto-MW/LG at z =6-9. Including all the progenitors of these disrupted galaxies improves the normalization of the recovered SMFs/UVLFs by factors of ~2-3 and reduces the halo-to-halo variation in the slope by ~20-40&percnt;. This enables robust constraints down to at least the resolution limit of the simulations, near M<sub>&sext;</sub> ~ 10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> or M_UV ~ -10 at z ≳ 6. We also show that `fossil record' reconstructions - which assume each present-day system descends from a single reionization-era progenitor - are sensitive to the stellar mass/UV magnitude thresholds, which introduces bias in the inferred low-mass/faint-end slopes. Additionally, we demonstrate that neglecting disrupted systems underestimates the contribution of galaxies with M_UV ≲ -15 to the reionization-era UV luminosity density. Finally, we estimate that a significant fraction (~50&percnt;) of streams with M<sub>&sext;</sub> ≳ 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z=0 should be detectable from upcoming Rubin Observatory and Roman Space Telescope observations.

### 201) [2510.17952](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17952v2): Evolutionary Tracks and Spectral Properties of Quasi-stars and Their Correlation with Little Red Dots

<p>
JWST has revealed a population of red, compact, high-redshift (z~3-10) objects referred to as "Little Red Dots'' (LRDs). These objects exhibit unusual spectral features reminiscent of stellar spectra with blackbody-like SEDs, large hydrogen Balmer breaks, Balmer line absorption, and classical stellar absorption features such as calcium H&K and the calcium triplet. Following the recent suggestion that these may be actively accreting direct-collapse black holes in the process of assembly, i.e. quasi-stars, we present evolutionary models of quasi-stars using our recently released, publicly available MESA-QUEST modeling framework. We compute a grid of models spanning a range of black hole masses and predict the luminosities, temperatures, surface gravities, and lifetimes of these objects. We find that these models lie along a Hayashi track once they hit their "late-stage'' which constitutes the majority of their lives (~ 20~Myr). We present scaling relations for estimating the mass of a quasi-star as a function of the bolometric luminosity, as well as the bolometric luminosity as a function of the effective temperature for the Hayashi track. The short lifetimes in tandem with the observed number density of LRDs imply the possibility that every supermassive black hole was once a quasi-star. We compare synthetic spectra of our quasi-star models to observations of LRDs, and show that these models are broadly capable of reproducing the continuum spectra of observed LRDs. These results indicate that quasi-stars are promising candidates for the origin of supermassive black holes via direct collapse in the early universe.

To fully characterize the formation and evolution of galaxies, we need to observe their stars, gas, and dust on resolved spatial scales. We present the ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST survey, which combines kpc-resolved imaging and spectroscopy from HST, JWST, and ALMA for 18 representative main-sequence galaxies at z=4-6 and log(M/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &gt; 9.5 to study their star formation, chemical properties, and extended gas reservoirs. The co-spatial measurements resolving the ionized gas, molecular gas, stars, and dust on 1-2 kpc scales make this a unique benchmark sample for the study of galaxy formation and evolution at z~5, connecting the Epoch of Reionization with the cosmic noon. In this paper, we outline the survey goals and sample selection, and present a summary of the available data for the 18 galaxies. In addition, we measure spatially integrated quantities (such as global gas metallicity), test different star formation rate indicators, and quantify the presence of Hα halos. Our targeted galaxies are relatively metal rich (10-70% solar), complementary to JWST samples at lower stellar mass, and there is broad agreement between different star formation indicators. One galaxy has the signature of an active galactic nuclei (AGN) based on its emission line ratios. Six show broad Hα~emission suggesting type 1 AGN candidates. We conclude with an outlook on the exciting science that will be pursued with this unique sample in forthcoming papers.

<p>
Metal absorbers represent a powerful probe of galaxy feedback and reionization, as highlighted by both observational and theoretical results showing an increased abundance of low-ionised metal species at higher redshifts. The origin of such absorbers is currently largely unknown because of the low number of galaxy counterparts detected, suggesting that they might be surrounded by low-mass faint sources below the current detection threshold. We use the THESAN-ZOOM radiation hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the connection between properties of neutral oxygen (OI) absorbers and galaxies across redshift z = 5 - 8. We find that the virialised gas in haloes becomes progressively ionised with cosmic time, leading to a decrease of ≈ 0.2 in the covering fraction of neutral oxygen, while the total oxygen covering fraction remains constant. Comparing the OI line density obtained from our covering fractions with the trend suggested by blind quasar observations, we determine that the observable absorbers (N_OI ≳ 10^13 cm<sup>2</sup>) are not confined to haloes: at z ≥ 5 the majority (≳ 60&percnt;) arise beyond R_vir, consistent with recent JWST results. Close to OI absorbers, low-mass galaxies (M<sub>&sext;</sub> ≤ 10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) are more commonly found, while, depending on the simulated environment, we do not exclude the possibility of nearby more massive star-forming sources (≥ 5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1) similar to those suggested by the latest ALMA observations. These results establish OI absorbers as sensitive tracers of the evolving ionisation structure around faint galaxies to be probed by forthcoming deep spectroscopic surveys.

Since the launch of JWST, the sample size of reionization-era Lyman-alpha-emitters (LAEs) has been steadily growing; yet inferences about the neutral hydrogen fraction in the intergalactic medium exhibit increasing variance at redshift z ~ 7, possibly indicating significant field-to-field fluctuations in the progression of cosmic reionization. In this paper, we present new JWST/NIRSpec and Keck/LRIS spectra of nine LAEs in the redshift z ~ 7 protocluster, LAGER-z7OD1. Measurements of Lyman-alpha-transmission and Lyman-alpha velocity offset along multiple sightlines map the Lyman-alpha damping wing optical depth across the galaxy overdensity. In the standard context of inside-out ionization, we estimate radii of ionized bubbles (R(min) = 0.07 - 0.69 Mpc) based on the distance from each LAE to the first neutral patch along the sightline. The resulting 3D topology reveals three distinct sub-clusters where the ionized bubbles are approaching overlap. Five of the nine LAEs plausibly ionized their bubbles, a few bursts of star formation and a modest escape fraction are sufficient. We demonstrate, however, that the actual ionized volumes are likely larger, at least R(ism) = 0.42 - 1.29 Mpc, based on an empirical model for interstellar attenuation of Lyman-alpha. Modeling galactic attenuation of Lyman-alpha significantly increases the inferred intergalactic transmission (thus enlarging the ionized pathlength). The errorbars on the reddening correction allow fully overlapping bubbles, and our results are consistent with accelerated reionization in the protocluster.

### 205) [2510.12235](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12235v2): A census of quiescent galaxies across 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 8 with JWST/MIRI: Mass-dependent number density evolution of quiescent galaxies in the early Universe

Recent JWST observations have revealed a large population of quiescent galaxies (QGs) at high redshift (z ~ 4-8), challenging current models of early galaxy formation and quenching. Accurate number density estimates are crucial but remain uncertain. We present a systematic study of QGs at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 8 using a mass-complete sample from the JWST/PRIMER survey with deep NIRCam and MIRI imaging. We demonstrate that MIRI photometry is essential for refining the QG sample: it helps to mitigate contamination from dusty star-forming galaxies in the high-mass regime at z ~ 3-5 and aids in recovering lower-mass QG candidates at z &gt; 5 that are often missed without including MIRI data. We find that the evolution of the QG number density is strongly mass-dependent. The density of massive QGs (log (M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &gt; 10.6) declines rapidly, falling from n ≈ 1.32×10^-5~~Mpc^-3 at z ~ 3-4 to n &lt; 1 ×10^-6~~Mpc^-3 at z ~ 6, and becomes negligible at z &gt; 6. In contrast, low-mass QGs (9.5 &lt; log (M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &lt; 10.6) exhibit a remarkably constant number density of n ~ 3×10^-6~Mpc^-3 across the redshift range z = 4-8. This plateau suggests that these high-redshift, low-mass QGs may be galaxies undergoing temporary quenching episodes, likely subject to rejuvenation upon future gas accretion. Comparisons with leading galaxy formation models reveal significant tensions: most models underestimate the abundance of massive QGs at z &gt; 4 and fail to reproduce the flat density evolution observed for the low-mass population.

<p>
The origin of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed at redshifts z≥ 9 remains one of the most challenging open questions in astrophysics. Their rapid emergence suggests that massive "heavy seeds'' must have formed early, possibly through the direct collapse of pristine gas clouds in the first galaxies. We present MESA-QUEST, a new framework built upon the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code, designed to model the structure and evolution of quasi-stars &ndash; massive, radiation-supported envelopes hosting accreting black holes at their cores &ndash; believed to be the progenitors of direct-collapse black hole (DCBH) seeds. Our implementation introduces flexible boundary conditions representing both Bondi accretion and saturated-convection regimes, and explores the impact of several stellar wind and mass-loss prescriptions, including Reimers, Dutch, and super-Eddington radiation-driven winds. We find that quasi-stars can grow central black holes to ≥ 10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> under favorable conditions, with saturated-convection models yielding BH-to-total mass ratios up to 0.55M_* &ndash; five times higher than Bondi-limited cases. However, strong radiation-driven winds can dramatically curtail growth, potentially quenching heavy-seed formation unless balanced by sustained envelope accretion. Our results delineate the physical limits under which quasi-stars can remain stable and produce heavy seeds capable of evolving into the earliest SMBHs detected by JWST and Chandra. Future extensions will incorporate rotation, magnetic fields, and GR-radiation hydrodynamics to refine accretion physics and constrain the viability of the quasi-star pathway for early SMBH formation.

<p> Greta Zucchi, Xihan Ji, Piero Madau, Roberto Maiolino, Ignas Juodžbalis, Francesco D'Eugenio, Sophia Geris, Yuki Isobe </p>
<p>
Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered a substantial population of high-redshift, broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs), whose properties challenge standard models of black hole growth and AGN emission. We analyze a spectroscopic sample of 34 Type 1 AGNs from the JWST Advanced Deep Survey (JADES) survey, spanning redshifts 1.7 &lt; z &lt; 9, to constrain the physical nature of the accretion flows powering these sources with broad-line diagnostics statistically for the first time. At z &gt; 5, we find a marked suppression of high-ionization emission lines (HeII, CIV, NV) relative to prominent broad Halpha and narrow [OIII] features. This contrast places strong constraints on the shape of the ionizing spectral energy distribution (SED) and on the physical conditions in the broad-line region (BLR). By comparing the observations to photoionization models based on SEDs of black holes accreting at sub-Eddington ratios, we show that standard AGN continua struggle to reproduce the observed broad line ratios and equivalent widths across a wide ionization parameter range. These results suggest the need for modified SEDs &ndash; either intrinsically softened due to super-Eddington accretion or radiative inefficiencies in the innermost disk, or externally filtered by intervening optically thick gas that absorbs or scatters the highest-energy photons before they reach the BLR.

<p>
Determining the infrared extinction curve towards the Galactic centre is crucial for accurately correcting observed data and deriving the underlying stellar populations. However, extinction curves reported in the literature often show discrepancies. We aim to derive the infrared extinction curve towards the Galactic centre based on JWST-NIRCam data for the first time, using observations of the Sagittarius C region in the 1-5 μm range. We determined extinction ratios using two different methods, both based on measuring the reddening vector using the slope of red clump stars, whose intrinsic properties are well known, in observed colour-magnitude diagrams. The extinction curve derived in this work is in good agreement with previous results in the literature. We obtained the following extinction ratios relative to F162M: A_F115W : A_F162M : A_F182M : A_F212N : A_F360M : A_F405N : A_F470N : A_F480M = 1.84 ± 0.03 : 1.00 : 0.789 ± 0.005 : 0.607 ± 0.014 : 0.306 ± 0.011 : 0.248 ± 0.017 : 0.240 ± 0.019 : 0.21 ± 0.03. Besides, we found different values of the extinction index for the short- (λ~ 1-2.5 μm, α~ 2) and long-wavelength (λ~ 2.5-5 μm, α~ 1.4) regimes, with the extinction curve flattening at longer wavelengths. Comparison with extinction curves derived both inside and outside the Galactic centre suggests that the infrared extinction curve does not significantly vary in the central regions, and shows no significant evidence for variations between different lines of sight beyond the inner Galaxy within the uncertainties.

### 209) [2510.09972](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09972v2): PAH Spectral Diversity in NGC 7027 and the Evolution of Aromatic Carriers

<p> Charlotte Smith-Perez, Aidan Hembruff, Els Peeters, Alexander G. G. M. Tielens, Alessandra Ricca </p>
<p>
Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) constitute a significant fraction of the Universe's carbon budget, playing a key role in the cosmic carbon cycle and dominating the mid-infrared spectra of astrophysical environments in which they reside. Although PAHs are known to form in the circumstellar envelopes of post-AGB stars, their formation and evolution are still not well-understood. We aim to understand how pristine complex hydrocarbons and PAHs in circumstellar environments transition to the PAHs observed in the ISM. The mid-infrared PAH spectra (5-18 micron) of the planetary nebula, NGC 7027, are investigated using spectral cubes from JWST MIRI-MRS. We report the first detection of spatially-resolved variations of the PAH spectral profiles across class A, AB, and B in all major PAH bands (6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.2 micron) within a single source, NGC 7027. These variations are linked to morphological structures within NGC 7027. Clear correlations are revealed between the 6.2, 7.7, and 8.6 micron features, where the red components (6.26, 7.8, 8.65 micron) exhibit a strong correlation and the same is found for the blue components of the 6.2 and 7.7 (6.205 and 7.6 micron). The blue component of the 8.6 (8.56 micron) appears to be independent of the other components. We link this behaviour to differences in molecular structure of their PAH subpopulations. Decomposition of the 11.2 micron band confirms two previously identified components, with the broader 11.25 micron component attributed to emission from very small grains of PAH clusters rather than PAH emission. We show that PAH profile classes generally vary with proximity to the central star's UV radiation field, suggesting class B PAHs represent more processed species while class A PAHs remain relatively pristine, challenging current notions on the spectral evolution of PAHs.

<p>
One of the most remarkable discoveries of JWST is a population of compact, red sources at z &gt; 4, commonly referred to as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Spectroscopic identifications reported that most LRDs are active galactic nuclei (AGNs), which are preferentially found around z ~ 6 and could imply a key phase in the formation and growth of black holes (BHs) in the early universe. Photometric surveys at lower redshift have recently been carried out to trace their evolution across cosmic time, and a small number of LRD-like galaxies have been spectroscopically identified at both Cosmic Noon and in the local universe. Here we report the discovery of one of the lowest-z LRD-like galaxies, J204837.26-002437.2 (hereafter J2048) at z = 0.4330, using new Gemini-N/GMOS IFU observations combined with archival multi-band photometric SED data. The GMOS data reveal extended blue emission from starburst with a star formation rate of 400 solar mass per year, together with an extended, highly fast ionized outflow. This is the first spectroscopic confirmation of extended host emission and outflow in an LRD-like galaxy, providing a unique laboratory for understanding the nature of their high-redshift counterparts. Moreover, J2048 would host an extremely overmassive BH with a BH-to-stellar mass ratio of ~ 60%, with the BH mass and host stellar mass estimated to be 10^10.2 and 10^10.4 solar masses, respectively. We discuss the origin and evolutionary fate of J2048, and the implications that such low-z analogs have for interpreting the properties of high-z LRDs.

<p>
Ices imprint strong absorption features in the near- and mid-infrared, but until recently they have been studied almost exclusively with spectroscopy toward small samples of bright sources. We show that JWST photometry alone can reveal and quantify interstellar ices, and we present a new open-source modeling tool, icemodels, to produce synthetic photometry of ices based on laboratory measurements. We provide reference tables indicating which filters are likely to be observably affected by ice absorption. Applying these models to NIRCam data of background stars behind \refereeseveral Galactic Center (GC) clouds \referee(dust ridge clouds A [the Brick], C, and D), and validating against NIRSpec spectra of Galactic disk sources, we find clear signatures of CO, H<sub>2</sub>O, and CO<sub>2</sub> ices and evidence for excess absorption in the F356W filter likely caused by CH-bearing species such as methanol. The ice ratios differ between the Galactic disk and Center, with GC clouds showing a higher H<sub>2</sub>O fraction. \refereeA large ice abundance \refereeis observed in CO, H2O, and possibly complex molecules, \refereewhich implies that there is substantial freezeout and therefore potential for ice-phase chemistry in non-star-forming gas. Accounting for all likely ices, we infer that &gt;25% of the total carbon is frozen into CO ice in the GC, which exceeds the entire solar-neighborhood carbon budget. By assuming the freezeout fraction is the same in GC and disk clouds, we obtain a metallicity measurement indicating that Z_GC≳2.5Z<sub>&odot;</sub>. These results demonstrate that photometric ice measurements are feasible with JWST and capable of probing the metallicity structure of the cold interstellar medium.

The population of the Little Red Dots (LRDs) may represent a key phase of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. A cocoon of dense excited gas is emerging as key component to explain the most striking properties of LRDs, such as strong Balmer breaks and Balmer absorption, as well as the weak IR emission. To dissect the structure of LRDs, we analyze new deep JWST/NIRSpec PRISM and G395H spectra of FRESCO-GN-9771, one of the most luminous known LRDs at z=5.5. These reveal a strong Balmer break, broad Balmer lines and very narrow [O III] emission. We unveil a forest of optical [Fe II] lines, which we argue is emerging from a dense (n_H=10^9-10 cm^-3) warm layer with electron temperature T_e≈7000 K. The broad wings of Hα and Hβ have an exponential profile due to electron scattering in this same layer. The high Hα:Hβ:Hγ flux ratio of ≈10.4:1:0.14 is an indicator of collisional excitation and resonant scattering dominating the Balmer line emission. A narrow Hγ component, unseen in the other two Balmer lines due to outshining by the broad components, could trace the ISM of a normal host galaxy with a star formation rate ~5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1. The warm layer is mostly opaque to Balmer transitions, producing a characteristic P-Cygni profile in the line centers suggesting outflowing motions. This same layer is responsible for shaping the Balmer break. The broad-band spectrum can be reasonably matched by a simple photoionized slab model that dominates the λ&gt;1500 Å continuum and a low mass (~10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) galaxy that could explain the narrow [O III], with only subdominant contribution to the UV continuum. Our findings indicate that Balmer lines are not directly tracing gas kinematics near the SMBH and that the BH mass scale is likely much lower than virial indicators suggest.

Charting the Epoch of Reionization demands robust assessments of what drives the production of ionizing photons in high-redshift star-forming galaxies (SFGs), and requires better predictive capabilities from current observations. Using a sample of N=159 SFGs at 1&lt;z&lt;8, observed with deep medium-resolution spectroscopy from the JWST/NIRSpec EXCELS survey, we perform a statistical analysis of their ionizing photon production efficiencies (ξ<sub>ion</sub>). We consider ξ<sub>ion</sub>, measured with Balmer line measurements, in relation to a number of key galaxy properties including; nebular emission line strengths (W_λ(Hα) and W_λ( [OIII])), UV luminosity (M_UV) and UV slope (β_UV), as well as dust attenuation (E(B-V)_neb) and redshift. Implementing a Bayesian linear regression methodology, we fit ξ<sub>ion</sub> against the principal observables while fully marginalising over all measurement uncertainties, mitigating against the impact of outliers and determining the intrinsic scatter. Significant relations between ξ<sub>ion</sub> and W_λ(Hα), W_λ([OIII]) and β_UV are recovered. Moreover, the weak trends with M_UV and redshift can be fully explained by the remaining property dependencies. Expanding our analysis to multivariate regression, we determine that W_λ(Hα) or W_λ([OIII]), along with β_UV and E(B-V)_neb, are the most important observables for accurately predicting ξ<sub>ion</sub>,0. The latter identifies the most common outliers as SFGs with relatively high E(B-V)_neb≳0.5, possibly indicative of obscured star-formation or strong differential attenuation. Combining these properties enable ξ<sub>ion</sub>,0 to be inferred with an accuracy of ~0.15 dex, with a population intrinsic scatter of σ_int~0.035 dex.

The Main Sequence of Star-Forming Galaxies (SFGMS or MS) is a fundamental scaling relation that provides a global framework for studying galaxy formation and evolution, as well as insight into the complex star formation histories (SFHs) of individual galaxies. In this work, we combine large-area pre-JWST surveys (COSMOS2020, CANDELS), which probe high-M<sub>&sext;</sub> sources (&gt;10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), with SHARDS/CANDELS FAINT and JWST data from CANUCS, CEERS, JADES, and UNCOVER, to obtain a high-z, star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass (M<sub>&sext;</sub>) complete sample spanning both high- and low-M<sub>&sext;</sub> regimes. Completeness in both M<sub>&sext;</sub> and SFR is key to avoiding biases introduced by low-mass, highly star-forming objects. Our combined data set is 80% complete down to 10^7.6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z~1 (10^8.8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z~9). The overall intrinsic MS slope (based on the SFR_100 and M<sub>&sext;</sub> derived with Dense Basis and nonparametric SFHs) shows little evolution up to z~5, with values ~0.7 - 0.8. The slope in the low-M<sub>&sext;</sub> regime becomes steeper than that in the high-M<sub>&sext;</sub> end at least up to z~5, but the strength of this change is highly dependent on the assumptions made on the symmetry of the uncertainties in M<sub>&sext;</sub> and SFR. If real, the steepening suggests reduced star formation efficiency or declining gas content with decreasing M<sub>&sext;</sub>. The transition between the low-M<sub>&sext;</sub> regime and the canonical MS occurs around 10^9.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, independent of z. This critical value may coincide with the assembly of galaxies' disks, which can provide a mechanism for self-regulation that stabilizes them against feedback. The intrinsic scatter is compatible with canonical estimates, also at low-M<sub>&sext;</sub>, ranging from 0.2-0.3 dex. This is indicative of rapid variations in star formation being averaged out over ≲100 Myr.

We present a new stellar dynamical measurement of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 4258, a critical benchmark for extragalactic mass measurements. We use archival JWST/NIRSpec IFU data (G235H/F170LP grating) to extract high-resolution two-dimensional stellar kinematics from the CO bandhead absorption features within the central 3'' × 3''. We extract the stellar kinematics after correcting for instrumental artifacts and separating the stellar light from the non-thermal AGN continuum. We employ Jeans Anisotropic Models (JAM) to fit the observed kinematics, exploring a grid of 12 models to systematically test the impact of different assumptions for the point-spread function, stellar mass-to-light ratio (M/L) profile, and orbital anisotropy. All 12 models provide broadly acceptable fits, albeit with minor differences. The ensemble median and 68% (1σ) bootstrap confidence intervals of our 12 models yield a black hole mass of M_BH = (4.08^+0.19_-0.33) × 10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. This paper showcases the utility of using the full model ensemble to robustly account for systematic uncertainties, rather than relying on formal errors from a single preferred model, as has been common practice. Our result is just 5% larger than, and consistent with, the benchmark SMBH mass derived from water maser dynamics, validating the use of NIRSpec stellar kinematics for robust SMBH mass determination. Our analysis demonstrates JWST's capability to resolve the SMBH's sphere of influence and deliver precise dynamical masses, even in the presence of significant AGN continuum emission.

Recent photometric surveys with JWST have revealed a significant population of mysterious objects with red colours, compact morphologies, frequent signs of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, and negligible X-ray emission. These 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs) have been explored through spectral and photometric studies, but their nature is still under debate. As part of the BlackTHUNDER survey, we have observed UNCOVER_20466, one of the most distant LRDs known (z=8.5), with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU. Previous JWST/NIRCam and JWST/NIRSpec MSA observations of this source revealed its LRD nature, as well as the presence of an AGN. Using our NIRSpec IFU data, we confirm that UNCOVER_20466 is an LRD (based on spectral slopes and compactness) that contains an overmassive black hole. However, our observed Balmer decrements do not suggest strong dust attenuation, resulting in a lower Hbeta-based bolometric luminosity and Eddington luminosity (~10%) than previously found. This source lies on local relations between M_BH-sigma_* and M_BH-M_Dyn, suggesting that this could be a progenitor of the core of a lower-redshift galaxy. We explore the possible evolution of this source, finding evidence for substantial black hole accretion in the past and a likely origin as a heavy seed at high redshift (~10^3Msol). Lyman-alpha emission is strongly detected, implying f<sub>esc</sub>,Lya~30%. The extremely high [OIII]4363/Hgamma ratio is indicative of not only AGN photoionization and heating, but also extremely high densities (ne~10^7cm-3), suggesting that this black hole at such high redshift may be forming in an ultra-dense protogalaxy.

We present measurements of stellar population properties of a newly discovered spectroscopically confirmed z=11.10^+0.11_-0.26, gravitationally lensed galaxy, using JWST NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy and NIRCam imaging. The arc is highly magnified by the Bullet Cluster (magnification factor μ=14.0^+6.2_-0.3. It contains three star-forming components of which one is barely resolved and two are unresolved, giving intrinsic sizes of ≲ 10pc. The clumps also contain ~50% of the total stellar mass. The galaxy formed the majority of its stars ~150Myr ago (by z~14). The spectrum shows a pronounced damping wing, typical for galaxies deep in the reionisation era and indicating a neutral IGM at this line of sight. The intrinsic luminosity of the galaxy is 0.086^+0.008_-0.030 L^* (with L^* being the characteristic luminosity for this redshift), making it the lowest luminosity spectroscopically confirmed galaxy at z&gt;10 discovered to date.

Galaxies at Cosmic Noon (z~2-3) are characterized by rapid star formation that will lead to significant metal enrichment in the interstellar medium (ISM). While much observational evidence suggests that these galaxies are chemically distinct from those in the local Universe, directly measuring the ISM chemistry in large samples of high-z galaxies is only now possible with the observational capabilities of JWST. In this first key paper of the CECILIA program, we present the direct-method physical conditions and multi-element abundances in twenty galaxies at Cosmic Noon. Using a combination of archival Keck/MOSFIRE and new ~30-hr NIRSpec spectroscopy, we measure multiple electron gas densities and the temperature structure from the O^+ and S^2+ ions. We find that n_e[O II] and n_e[S II] are comparable but elevated with respect to n_e in local star-forming galaxies, and the simultaneous T_e[O II] and T_e[S III] generally agree with photoionization model T_e scaling relations. The O abundances in the CECILIA galaxies range from 12+log(O/H)=7.76-8.81 (12-131% solar O/H), representing some of the highest direct-method metallicities and lowest T_e (T_e[O II]≈6500 K) measured with JWST to date. The CECILIA galaxies exhibit significantly sub-solar S/O and Ar/O a signature of predominant enrichment from core collapse supernovae. The N/O-O/H trends in the CECILIA galaxies generally agree with the abundance trends in local nebulae, but the large scatter in N/O could be sensitive to the star-formation history. The CECILIA observations demonstrate that exceptionally deep JWST spectroscopy can unveil the multi-element ISM abundance patterns in typical high-z galaxies.

<p>
We present gas-phase abundances of carbon (C), α-elements (O, Ne, Si, and Ar) and iron (Fe) obtained from stacked spectra of high-z star-forming galaxies with the deep Near Infrared Spectrograph medium-resolution data from the James Webb Space Telescope Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey. Our 564 sources at z=4&ndash;7 have a median stellar mass of log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=8.46 and a median star-formation rate of log(SFR/M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1)=0.30, placing them close to the star-formation main sequence. We find that the stacked spectrum of all our 564 sources has relatively low [C/O]=-0.70, moderate [Ne/O]=-0.09, and low [Ar/O]=-0.28 values at a low gas-phase metallicity of 12+log(O/H)=7.71 (Z~ 0.1~Z<sub>&odot;</sub>), suggesting dominant yields of core-collapse supernovae evolved from massive stars. The detection of a weak SiIII] emission line in our stacked spectrum provides a silicon-to-oxygen abundance ratio of [Si/O]=-0.63, which is lower than that of stars in the Milky Way disc and lower than expected by chemical evolution models, suggesting silicon depletion onto dust grains. Likewise, this Si/O value is lower than that we newly derive for two individual z&gt;6 galaxies (GN-z11 and RXCJ2248) with negligible dust attenuation. By performing spectral stacking in bins of M_*, SFR, specific SFR (sSFR), and ultra-violet (UV) continuum slope β_UV, we identify [FeIII] line detections in the high-sSFR bin and the blue-β_UV bin, both of which exhibit supersolar Fe/O ratios, while their C/O, Ar/O, and Si/O ratios are comparable to those of the all-sources stack. Our findings support a chemically young gas composition with rapid dust depletion in the general population of high-z star-forming galaxies, while raising the possibility of anomalous, selective Fe/O enhancement at the very early epoch of star formation.

<p>
The Multi-Channel Imager (MCI) is a powerful near-ultraviolet (NUV) and visible imager onboard the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST). The MCI provides three imaging channels, which are the NUV channel, the Blue channel and the Red channel, with the wavelength range of 255-430 nm, 430-700 nm, and 700-1000 nm, respectively. MCI's three channels can target the same field simultaneously, which is unique compared to other imagers onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) or the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Each channel employs a CCD focal plane of 9216 x 9232 pixels and ~7\arcmin.5 x 7\arcmin.5 field of view (FOV), which are about ≳ 4 times greater than the FOVs of HST imagers. The MCI's three channels feature unprecedented sensitivities and field of views complement the NUV and visible capabilities of the CSST for high-precision photometry and weak-signal detection, which would help build a new standard-star system and the deepest UV-Optical exposures for CSST. Rich filter sets of MCI would help explore other sciences such as local emission line mapping, high-z Lyα emitters searching, etc. Here we present key design features, results of current ground tests, and suggested observing strategies of the MCI.

### 222) [2509.12308](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12308v2): Death by Impact: Evidence for Merger-Driven Quenching in a Collisional Ring Galaxy at Cosmic Noon

<p> Amir H. Khoram, Sirio Belli, Carlo Nipoti, Raffaele Pascale, Andrew B. Newman, Federico Marinacci, Richard S. Ellis, Letizia Bugiani, Matteo Sapori, Eric Giunchi </p>
<p>
The role of interactions and mergers in the rapid quenching of massive galaxies in the early Universe remains uncertain, largely due to the difficulty of directly linking mergers to quenching. Collisional ring galaxies provide a unique opportunity, as their morphology allows precise dating of the interaction, which can then be compared to quenching timescales inferred from star formation histories. We study a gravitationally bound system at z=1.61 in the UDS field, composed of a Host galaxy (M<sub>&sext;</sub> = 10^11.4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) with a collisional ring and an X-ray AGN, and the Bullet galaxy (M<sub>&sext;</sub> = 10^11.2 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), located at a projected distance of ~ 8 kpc. Combining JWST and HST imaging with Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy, we find compelling evidence for an ongoing starburst in the Host concurrent with rapid quenching in the Bullet. The ring, ~ 20 kpc in diameter, is expanding at 127^+72_-29 km s<sup>-1</sup>, implying the galaxies first collided 47&ndash;96 Myr ago. This timeline is consistent with the Host's current starburst and the Bullet's sudden quenching, strongly suggesting both phenomena were triggered by the interaction. Crucially, the Bullet shows no evidence of a preceding starburst, ruling out rapid gas consumption as the primary quenching channel. Instead, we suggest that merger-driven processes &ndash; such as enhanced turbulence and disk instabilities &ndash; may have suppressed star formation. An additional possibility, which we term the "Dragon Effect,'' is that AGN-driven outflows from the Host disrupted the Bullet's low-density molecular gas, thereby preventing efficient star formation and accelerating quenching.

<p> Sheng-Han Zhou, Tian-Nuo Li, Guo-Hong Du, Jun-Qian Jiang, Jing-Fei Zhang, Xin Zhang </p>
<p>
Early JWST observations reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of high-redshift candidate massive galaxies at z ≳ 7, and recent DESI measurements show a preference for dynamical dark energy, which together present a significant challenge to the standard ΛCDM cosmology. In this work, we jointly analyze high-redshift galaxy data from JWST, baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI DR2, and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and ACT, measuring the total neutrino mass \sum m_ν. We consider three dark energy models (ΛCDM, wCDM, and w_0w_aCDM) and three mass hierarchies. Our results indicate that in the w_0w_aCDM model, adding JWST data to CMB+DESI tightens the upper limit of \sum m_ν by about 5.8&percnt;-10.2&percnt;, and we obtain \sum m_ν &lt; 0.167~eV (2σ) in the normal hierarchy (NH) case. Furthermore, JWST also offers indicative lower limits on star formation efficiency parameter of f_*,10 ≳ 0.146-0.161. Bayesian evidence weakly favors the w_0w_aCDM+\sum m_ν(NH) model relative to the ΛCDM+\sum m_ν(NH) model using CMB+DESI+JWST data. These results suggest that the joint analysis of high-redshift JWST data and low-redshift DESI data provides compelling constraints on neutrino mass and merits further investigation.

<p> Yuting Liu, Masamune Oguri </p>
<p>
Time-delay cosmology offers an alternative approach to measuring the Hubble constant (H_0), which is distinct from the cosmic distance ladder and cosmic microwave background radiation methods. In this study, we present an improved strong lens mass modeling analysis of the cluster-lensed supernova Refsdal, incorporating the latest spectroscopic redshift data from the MUSE on the Very Large Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope CANUCS/Technicolor. The robustness of our lens models is confirmed using the Jackknife method. From our analysis that considers four lens mass models with different assumptions on profiles of dark matter halos and external perturbations, we derive a constraint on the Hubble constant of H_0=66.0±4.3\Mpc after combining best-fitted values of the four lens models.

<p> William M. Baker, Kei Ito, Francesco Valentino, Pengpei Zhu, Gianluca Scarpe, Rashmi Gottumukkala, Jens Hjorth, Laia Barrufet, Danial Langeroodi </p>
<p>
We present the discovery of two low-mass, high-redshift, quiescent galaxies, GS-z5-Q1 and COS-z5-Q1, using JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy alongside NIRCam and MIRI photometry. Observed at a redshift of z=5.39 and z=5.11 respectively, and with stellar masses of 10^9.6M<sub>&odot;</sub> and 10^9.5M<sub>&odot;</sub>, GS-z5-Q1 and COS-z5-Q1 are two of the most distant quiescent galaxies spectroscopically confirmed to-date, and are by far the least massive (~10× lower mass). Full spectrophotometric modelling reveals that COS-z5-Q1 appears to have quenched more than 300Myr prior to observation (z~ 7) and has a formation redshift of around z~11, whilst GS-z5-Q1 formed and quenched in a single burst around 150Myr prior to observation (z~6). GS-z5-Q1 is found to lie near the centre of a known high-z overdensity in GOODS-S, as would be expected by galaxy formation models, while COS-z5-Q1 lies towards the outskirts of an overdense region. This highlights the role that environment could play in accelerating galaxy evolutionary processes and could possibly be linked to the galaxies' quiescent nature. By modelling their stellar populations, we show that these types of low-mass quiescent galaxies could potentially be descendants of the higher-z "mini-quenched" galaxies. The discovery of these two low-mass z&gt;5 quiescent galaxies illuminates a previously undiscovered galaxy population and motivates dedicated follow-up surveys to investigate the overall population.

### 226) [2509.07913](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07913v3): Disclosing Submillimeter Galaxy Formation: Mergers or Secular Evolution?

<p> Siu-Wang Chan, Yiping Ao, Qinghua Tan </p>
<p>
We analyze the morphology of 125 submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) in the PRIMER-COSMOS field using double Sersic modeling on JWST NIRCam images across six bands (F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M and F444W), with SMGs being classified by bulge Sersic index (n_bulge) and bulge-to-total luminosity ratio (B/T). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test between the bright (SFR &gt; 175 M_sun yr^-1) and the faint group (SFR &lt; 175 M_sun yr^-1) reveals no significant statistical differences in morphology across bands. However, we notice that SMGs skew towards higher B/T ratios and lower n_bulge from shorter to longer wavelengths. In F444W, bright SMGs exhibit higher B/T and lower n_bulge, indicating flatter, disturbed bulges, while faint SMGs show lower B/T and higher n_bulge. Notably, SMGs with higher B/T tend to have low Sersic index, challenging the local universe dichotomy of classical bulges (B/T &gt; 0.5, n &gt; 4) versus pseudo-bulges (B/T &lt; 0.35, n &lt; 2). In the F277W band, non-parametric measurements indicate predominantly disk-dominated patterns, with only 24 percent of SMGs demonstrating merger signatures. After the removal of SMGs with disturbed morphology, the bulge classification scheme in F277W shows pseudo-bulges (21 percent) and clump migration bulges (16 percent) from secular evolution, compared to 4 percent merger-built bulges. Surprisingly, 48 percent of SMGs defy the classification scheme, showing high B/T (approximately 0.7) but low Sersic index (n_bulge ≤ 1). Bars are confirmed in 7 percent of SMGs. This work suggests that secular evolution takes precedence over major mergers, supporting the idea that isolated evolution fueled by filamentary gas inflow plays a non-negligible role in the SMG bulge formation.

<p>
Little red dots (LRDs) are a puzzling population of extragalactic sources whose origin is highly debated. In this work, we performed a comprehensive stacking analysis of NIRCam, MIRI, and ALMA images of a large and homogeneously selected sample of LRDs from multiple JWST Legacy fields. We report clear evidence of hot-dust emission in the median stacked spectral energy distribution (SED) that features a rising near-infrared continuum up to rest-frame λ_rest~ 3μm, which is best explained by a standard dusty active galactic nucleus (AGN) structure. Although LRDs are likely to be a heterogeneous population, our findings suggest that most (≳50 %) LRDs show AGN-heated dust emission, regardless of whether the optical and ultraviolet (UV) continua are stellar or AGN-dominated. In either case, the best-fit dusty-AGN SED, combined with the lack of X-ray detection in the deep Chandra stacks, suggests that Compton-thick (N_H&gt;3×10^24 cm<sup>2</sup>) gas obscuration is common, and likely confined within the dust sublimation radius (R_sub~0.1 pc). Therefore, we argue that AGN-heated dust does not directly obscure either the optical-UV continuum or the broad-line region emission, in order to explain the observed blue UV slopes and prominent Balmer features. While a gas-dust displacement is in line with several models, the formation scenario (in-situ or ex-situ) of this pre-enriched hot dust remains unclear.

We report the discovery of a faint (M_1700 ~ -12.2), oxygen-deficient strongly-lensed ionizing source &ndash; dubbed LAP2 (Lensed And Pristine 2) &ndash; at a spectroscopic redshift of z=4.19. LAP2 appears to be isolated and lies very close to the caustic produced by the lensing galaxy cluster Abell 2744. It was observed with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec MSA in prism mode as part of the UNCOVER program. The NIRSpec spectrum reveals prominent Lya emission (7.1 sigma), clear Ha emission (6.2 sigma), tentative Hb emission (2.8 sigma), and no detectable [OIII]4959,5007 (~ 7 times fainter than Ha). The inferred [OIII] 2 sigma upper limit corresponds to an R3 index &lt;0.85 (assuming the Ha/Hb ~ 2.86 case~B recombination ratio), which, under high-ionization conditions, implies a metallicity of Z &lt; 6 X 10^(-3) Z_sun. The combination of faint ultraviolet luminosity, large rest-frame Ha equivalent width (~ 650 A), and extremely compact size (&lt; 10 pc) suggests that LAP2 is being caught in an early, pristine formation phase consistent with an instantaneous-burst scenario, with an estimated stellar mass of at most a few 10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Deep VLT/MUSE observations further reveal copious Lya emission forming an arclet that straddles the critical line. LAP2 thus joins the rare class of extremely metal-poor star-forming complexes that JWST has started to unveil at redshifts 3 - 7, and provides a rare glimpse into a still very poorly explored faint-luminosity regime.

We select a mass-complete sample of 225 quiescent galaxies at z&gt;2 with M_* &gt; 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> from PRIMER and JADES photometry spanning a total area of ≃320 sq. arcmin. We restrict our analysis to only area with optical coverage in three HST ACS filters, and provide evidence that this is important for selecting the most complete and clean samples of z&gt;2 massive quiescent galaxy candidates. We investigate the contamination in our sample via JWST NIRSpec spectroscopic validation, Chandra X-ray imaging, and ALMA interferometry, calculating a modest total contamination fraction of 12.9_-3.1^+4.0 per cent. The removal of HST data increases star-forming galaxy contamination by ≃10 per cent and results in a ≃20 per cent loss of candidates recovered from HST+JWST data combined. We calculate massive quiescent galaxy number densities at 2&lt;z&lt;5, finding values three times larger than pre-JWST estimates, but generally in agreement with more-recent and larger-area JWST studies. In comparison with galaxy evolution simulations, we find that most can now reproduce the observed massive quiescent galaxy number density at 2&lt;z&lt;3, however they still increasingly fall short at z&gt;3, with discrepancies of up to ≃ 1 dex. We place 14 of our z&gt;3 massive quiescent galaxies on the BPT and WHaN diagrams using medium-resolution spectroscopic data from the EXCELS survey. We find a very high incidence of faint AGN in our sample, at a level of ≃50 per cent, consistent with recent results at cosmic noon. This is interesting in the context of maintenance-mode feedback, which is invoked in many simulations to prevent quenched galaxies from re-igniting star formation. To properly characterise the evolution of early massive quiescent galaxies, greater coverage in optical filters and significantly larger spectroscopic samples will be required.

JWST has uncovered a diverse population of extreme near-infrared dropouts, including ultra high-redshift (z&gt;15) galaxy candidates, dust-obscured galaxies challenging dust production theories, sources with strong Balmer breaks - possibly compact AGN in dense environments - and cold, sub-stellar Galactic objects. This work presents Capotauro, a F356W-dropout in the CEERS survey with F444W AB magnitude of ~27.68 and a sharp &gt;3 mag flux drop between 3.5-4.5 μm, undetected below 3.5 μm. We combine JWST/NIRCam, MIRI, and NIRSpec/MSA data with HST/ACS and WFC3 observations to perform a spectro-photometric analysis of Capotauro using multiple SED-fitting codes. Our setup tests z≥15 as well as z&lt;10 dusty, Balmer-break or strong-line galaxy solutions, and the possibility of Capotauro being a Milky Way sub-stellar object. Among extragalactic options, our analysis favors interpreting the sharp drop as a Lyman break at z~32, consistent with the epoch of formation of the first stars and black holes, with only ~0.5&percnt; of the posterior volume at z&lt;25. Lower-redshift solutions struggle to reproduce the extreme break, suggesting that if Capotauro lies at z&lt;10, it must show a non-standard combination of strong dust attenuation and/or Balmer breaks, making it a peculiar interloper. Alternatively, its properties match a very cold (Y2-Y3 type) brown dwarf or a free-floating exoplanet with a record-breaking combination of low temperature and large distance (T_eff&lt;300 K, d≳130 pc, up to ~2 kpc). While current data cannot determine its nature, Capotauro emerges as a remarkably unique object in all plausible scenarios, and a compelling target for follow-up.

### 231) [2509.00153](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00153v2): Quasar Radiative Feedback May Suppress Galaxy Growth on Intergalactic Scales at z = 6.3

<p>
We present observational evidence that intense ionizing radiation from a luminous quasar suppresses nebular emission in nearby galaxies on intergalactic scales at z=6.3. Using JWST/NIRCam grism spectroscopy from the SAPPHIRES and EIGER programs, we identify a moderate but statistically significant decline in [O sciii] &lambda;5008 luminosity relative to the UV continuum (L_5008/L_1500) among galaxies within ~ 7 comoving Mpc (cMpc) of the quasar J0100+2802, the most UV-luminous quasar known at this epoch (M_1450=-29.26). While L_1500 remains roughly constant with transverse distance, L_5008 increases significantly, suggesting suppression of very recent star formation toward the quasar. The effect persists after controlling for completeness, local density, and UV luminosity, and correlates with the projected photoionization-rate profile Γ_qso. A weaker but directionally consistent suppression in L_5008/L_1500 is also observed along the line of sight. The transverse suppression radius (~ 7 cMpc) implies a recent radiative episode with a cumulative duration ~ 3.1 Myr, shorter than required for thermal photoheating to dominate and thus more naturally explained by rapid H<sub>2</sub> photodissociation and related radiative processes. Environmental effects alone appear insufficient to explain the signal. Our results provide direct, geometry-based constraints on large-scale quasar radiative feedback and recent quasar lifetimes.

### 232) [2508.14155](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14155v2): Little Red Dots and their Progenitors from Direct Collapse Black Holes

<p> Junehyoung Jeon, Boyuan Liu, Volker Bromm, Seiji Fujimoto, Anthony J. Taylor, Vasily Kokorev, Rebecca L. Larson, John Chisholm, Steven L. Finkelstein, Dale D. Kocevski </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered a new population of objects, the Little Red Dots (LRDs), characterized by V-shaped spectra indicative of strong breaks around the Balmer limit and compact morphology that gave them their name. A popular explanation is that they are a sub-population of active galactic nuclei/supermassive black holes (AGN/SMBHs) predominantly found in the high-redshift Universe (z≳3). Similarly, direct collapse black holes (DCBHs), theorized to form from collapsing massive, extremely metal-poor gas clouds, have been invoked to explain high-redshift quasars, the most massive AGN sub-population. Here, we employ the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH to produce a population of DCBHs and compare them against observed LRD demographics and properties. Specifically, we compare the DCBH-seeded SMBH population against the standard stellar-remnant seeds and find that DCBH models agree better with observed LRD population statistics and host halo properties. Furthermore, for the most extreme and earliest LRD detections, interpreted to be systems with an AGN but little stellar component, DCBHs are able to reproduce the observed spectral shape and properties under multiple scenarios - high dust attenuation or AGN surrounded by dense gas - that have been proposed to explain the unique shape of LRD spectra. Even when super-Eddington accretion, invoked previously to explain the nature of LRDs, is enforced on stellar remnant seeds, the spectral characteristics of extreme LRDs cannot be reproduced. We emphasize the importance of gas-metallicity observations as an additional dimension besides the widely used SMBH-stellar mass ratios to further constrain the progenitors of LRDs.

We present the second data release of the Systematic Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES), focusing on JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution spectroscopy of galaxies across cosmic time. This release includes spectroscopic observations of 166 galaxies spanning 0 &lt; z &lt; 7.5, sampling star-forming galaxies, quiescent systems, and active galactic nuclei (AGN), with an emphasis on galaxies at cosmic noon (z ~ 1-3). We describe the target selection strategy, the observational setup with the G140M/F100LP and G235M/F170LP gratings, and the data calibration process. The final data products include the reduced spectra, redshift catalog, emission-line catalogs produced with ttGELATO for emission-line galaxies and ttpPXF fits for quiescent systems, and ancillary spectral energy distribution (SED) fit results derived from multi-band photometry. The SMILES NIRSpec dataset enables investigations of obscured AGN, multi-phase outflows, ionizing properties, and the role of environment in galaxy evolution.

### 234) [2508.08768](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08768v2): Impact of Resonance, Raman, and Thomson Scattering on Hydrogen Line Formation in Little Red Dots

<p> Seok-Jun Chang, Max Gronke, Jorryt Matthee, Charlotte Mason </p>
<p>
Little Red Dots (LRDs) are compact sources at z&gt;5 discovered through JWST spectroscopy. Their spectra exhibit broad Balmer emission lines (≳1000~km~s<sup>-1</sup>), alongside absorption features and a pronounced Balmer break &ndash; evidence for a dense, neutral hydrogen medium with the n=2 state. When interpreted as arising from AGN broad-line regions, inferred black hole masses from local scaling relations exceed expectations given their stellar masses, challenging models of early black hole-galaxy co-evolution. However, radiative transfer effects in dense media may also impact the formation of hydrogen emission lines. We model three scattering processes shaping hydrogen line profiles: resonance scattering by hydrogen in the n=2 state, Raman scattering of UV radiation by ground-state hydrogen, and Thomson scattering by free electrons. Using 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations with multi-branching resonance transitions, we examine their imprint on line shapes and ratios. Resonance scattering produces strong deviations from Case B flux ratios, clear differences between Hα and Hβ, and encodes gas kinematics in line profiles but cannot broaden Hβ due to conversion to Paα. While Raman scattering can yield broad wings, scattering of UV continuum is disfavored given the absence of strong FWHM variations across transitions. Raman scattering of higher Lyman-series emission can produce Hα/Hβ wing width ratios of ≳1.28, agreeing with observations. Thomson scattering can reproduce the observed ≳1000~km  s<sup>-1</sup> wings under plausible conditions, e.g., T_e ~ 10^4  K and N_e~10^24~cm<sup>2</sup> &ndash; and lead to black hole mass overestimates by factors ≳10. Our results provide a framework for interpreting hydrogen lines in LRDs and similar systems.

<p>
Spatially resolved gas-phase metallicity maps are a crucial element in understanding the chemical evolution of galaxies. We present spatially resolved metallicity maps obtained from NIRISS/WFSS observations. This is the first such work presenting multiple individual galaxies. We investigate the source of ionisation, metallicity and its relation to star-formation in a spatially-resolved sense for a sample of eight galaxies &ndash; four from JWST-PASSAGE and four from GLASS-JWST ERS. All but one galaxy are in the redshift range 1.9 ≤ z ≤ 2, the outlier being at z = 3.1. Our sample covers a range of 8.0 &lt; logM &lt; 9.5 in stellar mass, 0.2 &lt; log(SFR/\M<sub>&odot;</sub>pyr) &lt; 1.1 in star-formation rate (SFR) and 7.8 &lt; logOH &lt; 9.0 in global metallicity. As a solution to the challenge of SF-AGN demarcation in absence of resolved \halpha, we present a new SF-demarcation line in the itOHNO parameter space based on MAPPINGS v5.1 publicly available \hii region model grids. We present the mass-metallicity gradient relation for our sample, which showed no clear trend with stellar mass, perhaps hinting at the fact that the high-z galaxies have not yet started their accretion dominated phase. By interpreting the correlation between spatially resolved metallicity and SFR maps as a proxy for effective timescales of metal-transport in galaxies, we find a weak trend such that this timescale increases with stellar mass, implying a more effective feedback in lower mass galaxies.

We present a photometric analysis of globular clusters (GCs) in the massive galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1-2403 (z = 0.397) using deep JWST/NIRCam imaging from the PEARLS program. PSF photometry was performed in the short wavelength filters F090W, F115W, F150W, and F200W, yielding a catalog of approximately 3 x 10^3 unresolved, point-like sources consistent with a GC population. Artificial star tests indicate 80% completeness at F200W = 30.36 mag. The color-magnitude diagrams show a narrow GC sequence well reproduced by PARSEC single-stellar-population models spanning ages of 5-9 Gyr and metallicities from [M/H] = -2.0 to +0.2, consistent with evolved GC systems at this redshift. The globular cluster luminosity function (GCLF) follows a log-normal form truncated by incompleteness at the faint end. The brightest sources extend slightly beyond the locus of classical GCs, suggesting a small number of UCD-like systems or stripped nuclei, while the bulk of the population exhibits the luminosities and colors expected for mature globular clusters at z ~ 0.4.

<p>
Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed a puzzling population of optically red and compact galaxies with peculiar "V"-shaped spectra at high redshift, known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). Until now, most spectroscopically confirmed LRDs are found at z&gt;4 and it has been speculated that LRDs are tracing the early stages of black hole evolution. We report an independent rediscovery of a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN), SDSS J102530.29+140207.3, at z=0.1, which shows spectral features matching those of LRDs seen in the early Universe, including the V-shaped spectrum, broad Balmer lines (with widths of 1000-2000 km/s), and deep Balmer absorption. We present a new GTC observation of this LRD, which reveals an optical continuum similar to those of G-to-K giant stars including an unambiguous G-band absorption originating from the CH molecule. In addition, this local LRD shows a series of absorption lines potentially related to low-ionization ions or atoms but are deeper than what is observed in empirical stellar templates. We further identify a series of [FeII] emission lines indicative of low-ionization gas, which we find also present in a JWST-selected LRD at z=2.26. We find small but statistically significant variability in the Hα of SDSS J102530.29+140207.3 consistent with previous findings. Finally, we report new observations with NuSTAR. We confirm the extreme X-ray weakness of this LRD, which might imply Compton-thick gas obscuration with N_H&gt;10^24~cm<sup>2</sup>. All evidence suggests SDSS J102530.29+140207.3 has a complex gaseous environment and the strong ionic, atomic, and molecular absorptions are hard to explain with typical stellar and AGN models.

<p>
The relation between the masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies encodes information on their mode of growth, especially at the earliest epochs. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has opened such investigations by detecting the host galaxies of AGN and more luminous quasars within the first billion years of the universe (z &gt; 6). Here, we evaluate the relation between the mass of SMBHs and the total stellar mass of their host galaxies using a sample of nine quasars at 6.18 &lt; z &lt; 6.4 from the Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) survey with NIRCam and NIRSpec observations. We find that the observed location of these quasars in the SMBH-galaxy mass plane (log M_BH/M<sub>&odot;</sub> ~ 8-9; log M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub> ~ 9.5-11) is consistent with a non-evolving intrinsic mass relation with dispersion (0.80_-0.28^+0.23 dex) higher than the local value (~0.3-0.4 dex) of their more massive descendants. Our analysis is based on a forward model of systematics and includes a consideration of the impact of selection effects and measurement uncertainties with an assumption on the slope of the mass relation. While degeneracies between parameters persist, the best-fit solution has a reasonable AGN fraction (2.3%) of galaxies at z ~ 6 with an actively growing UV-unobscured black hole. In particular, models with a substantially higher normalisation in M_BH would require an unrealistically low intrinsic dispersion (~0.22 dex). Consequently, our results predict a large population of AGNs at lower black hole masses, as are now just starting to be discovered in focused efforts with JWST.

### 239) [2507.22888](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22888v4): On the origins of oxygen: ALMA and JWST characterise the multi-phase, metal-enriched, star-bursting medium within a 'normal' z &gt; 11 galaxy

The unexpectedly high abundance of galaxies at z &gt; 11 revealed by JWST has sparked a debate on the nature of early galaxies and the physical mechanisms regulating their formation. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has begun to provide vital insights on their gas and dust content, but so far only for extreme 'blue monsters'. Here we present new, deep ALMA observations of JADES-GS-z11-0, a more typical (sub-L^*) z &gt; 11 galaxy that bridges the discovery space of JWST and the Hubble Space Telescope. These data confirm the presence of the [O III] 88 μm line at 4.5σ significance, precisely at the redshift of several faint emission lines previously seen with JWST/NIRSpec, while the underlying dust continuum remains undetected (F_ν&lt; 9.0   μJy), implying an obscured star formation rate (SFR) of SFR_IR ≲ 6   M<sub>&odot;</sub>   yr^-1 and dust mass of M_dust ≲ 1.0 × 10^6   M<sub>&odot;</sub> (all 3σ). The accurate ALMA redshift of z_[O III] = 11.1221 ± 0.0006 (≳ \! 5× refined over NIRSpec) helps confirm that redshifts measured purely from the Lyman-α break, even spectroscopically, should properly take into account the effects of potential damped Lyman-α absorption (DLA) systems to avoid systematic overestimates of up to Δz ≈ 0.5. The [O III] 88 μm luminosity of L_[O III] = (1.1 ± 0.3) × 10^8   L<sub>&odot;</sub>, meanwhile, agrees well with the scaling relation for local metal-poor dwarfs given the SFR measured by NIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI. The spatially resolved MIRI and ALMA emission also underscores that JADES-GS-z11-0 is likely to consist of two low-mass components that are undergoing strong bursts of star formation yet are already pre-enriched in oxygen (~20-30% solar), only 400 Myr after the Big Bang.

### 240) [2507.22812](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22812v2): Biased Domain Walls and the Origin of Early Massive Structures

<p> Clara Winckler, Pedro P. Avelino, Lara Sousa </p>
<p>
Discrete symmetry-breaking phase transitions in the early universe may have caused the formation of networks of sheet-like topological defects, usually referred to as domain walls, which separate regions that have settled into different vacuum states. Field theory simulations predict the successive collapse of increasingly larger domains, which could potentially leave observable imprints in present-day large-scale structures. We use a non-parametric analytical model to provide an estimate of the final decay energy of these walls and their associated collapse rate, as a function of redshift. The energy released by collapsing walls can act as a seed for density perturbations in the background matter field, influencing structure formation. We estimate the dependence of the current mass of the resulting non-linear objects on the collapse redshift and wall tension, showing that domain walls can contribute to the formation of objects as massive as present-day galaxy clusters. Still, we confirm that the contribution of standard domain walls to structure formation is subdominant. In contrast, biased domain walls - originating in models with an approximate (or biased) discrete symmetry breaking - generally face much less stringent constraints on their tension, which allows for significantly higher collapse energies. Based on our analysis, we are able to show that the collapse of such biased wall networks can provide a significant contribution to structure formation, and, in particular, a mass excess at z ≳ 7 as suggested by JWST data.

### 241) [2507.19651](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19651v2): Cosmological observational tests in the JWST Era. I: angular size - redshift

<p> A. A. Raikov, V. V. Tsymbal, N. Yu. Lovyagin </p>
<p>
This study is devoted to the cosmological "angular size - redshift" test. An analysis is performed of the angular and linear sizes of galaxies from the new ASTRODEEP-JWST catalogue, which contains over 500,000 objects at high redshifts (up to ~20 photometrically determined and up to ~14 spectroscopically determined). For the calculations, 6 860 galaxies with reliably determined spectroscopic redshifts and 319,771 galaxies with known photometric redshifts were used. The linear sizes of galaxies were computed within the framework of two cosmological models - the standard (ΛCDM) model and one of the static models (the so-called "tired light" model). We have shown that within the framework of the ΛCDM model, a significant evolution of the linear sizes of galaxies is observed, with the rate of the evolution closely matching the rate of the cosmic expansion. In contrast, in the static model, the characteristic linear sizes of galaxies exhibit almost no evolution with increasing z.

Zanella, A. Zitrin </p>
<p>
We present JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy of the Cosmic Gems arc, strongly magnified by the galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0615-5746. Six-hour integration using NIRSpec prism spectroscopy (resolution R≃ 30-300), covering the spectral range 0.8-5.3~μm, reveals a pronounced Lyα-continuum break at λ≃ 1.3~μm, as well as weak optical Hβ and [OIII]&lambda;4959 emission lines at z=9.625±0.002, located in the reddest part of the spectrum (λ&gt; 5.1~μm). No additional ultraviolet or optical emission lines are reliably detected. A weak Balmer break is measured alongside a very blue ultraviolet slope (β≤-2.5, F_λ ~ λ^β). Spectral fitting with \tt Bagpipes suggests that the Cosmic Gems galaxy is in a post-starburst phase, making it the highest-redshift system currently observed in a mini-quenched state. Spatially resolved spectroscopy at tens of parsecs shows relatively uniform features across subcomponents of the arc. These findings align well with the physical properties previously derived from JWST/NIRCam photometry of the stellar clusters, now corroborated by spectroscopic evidence. In particular, five observed star clusters exhibit ages of 7-30~Myr. An updated lens model constrains the intrinsic sizes and masses of these clusters, confirming they are extremely compact and denser than typical star clusters in local star-forming galaxies. Additionally, four compact stellar systems consistent with star clusters (≲10 pc) are identified along the extended tail of the arc. A sub-parsec line-emitting HII region straddling the critical line, lacking a NIRCam counterpart, is also serendipitously detected.

<p>
The combination of the z=0-13.5 cosmic star formation history and active galactic nuclei (AGN) luminosity history as inferred by the James Webb Space Telescope is connected to the cosmic spectral energy distribution (CSED) to explore the sources of reionisation. We compute the redshift evolution of the corresponding cosmic ionising photon emissivity, the neutral fraction and the cosmic microwave background optical depth. We use the generative SED modelling code ProSpect to bracket the ionising emissivity between escape fractions of f<sub>esc</sub> = 1 - 100&percnt; for both the stars and AGN. Stars alone could have achieved reionisation by z≈ 6 with f<sub>esc</sub> ≳ 30&percnt; for solar metallicity (Z=0.02) stars or f<sub>esc</sub> ≳ 10&percnt; for metal-poor (Z=10^-4) stars. On the other hand, AGN by themselves would have struggled to produce sufficiently many ionising photons even with f<sub>esc</sub> = 100&percnt;. A hybrid model containing both stars and AGN is explored where we find best fit (median± 1σ) f<sub>esc</sub>= 12&percnt; (14^+9_-7&percnt;) for the stars and f<sub>esc</sub>= 63&percnt; (60^+28_-32&percnt;) for the AGN, maintained at all redshifts. In essence, the joint growth of stellar mass and supermassive black holes produces neither more nor fewer ionising photons than needed to reionise ≳ 99&percnt; of the intergalactic medium by z≈ 6.

### 244) [2507.15436](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15436v2): Semi-empirical Framework of Supermassive Black Hole Evolution: Highlighting a possible tension between Demographics and Gravitational Wave Background

<p> Andrea Lapi, Francesco Shankar, Michele Bosi, Daniel Roberts, Hao Fu, Karthik M. Varadarajan, Lumen Boco </p>
<p>
The evolution of the supermassive Black Hole (BH) population across cosmic times remains a central unresolved issue in modern astrophysics, due to the many noticeable uncertainties in the involved physical processes that span a huge range of spatial, temporal and energy scales. Here we tackle the problem via a semi-empirical approach with minimal assumptions and data-driven inputs. This is based on a continuity plus Smoluchowski equation framework that allows to unitarily describe the two primary modes of BH growth: gas accretion and binary mergers. Key quantities related to the latter processes are incorporated through educated parameterizations, and then constrained in a Bayesian setup from joint observational estimates of the local BH mass function, of the large-scale BH clustering, and of the nano-Hz stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background measured from Pulsar Timimg Array (PTA) experiments. We find that the BH accretion-related parameters are strongly dependent on the local BH mass function determination: higher normalizations and flatter high-mass slopes in the latter imply lower radiative efficiencies and mean Eddington ratios with a stronger redshift evolution. Additionally, the binary BH merger rate is estimated to be a fraction ≲ 10^-1 of the galaxy merger rate derived from galaxy pairs counts by ttJWST, and constrained not to exceed the latter at ≳ 2σ. Relatedly, we highlight hints of a possible tension between current constraints on BH demographics and the interpretation of the nano-Hz GW background as predominantly caused by binary BH mergers. Specifically, we bound the latter's contribution to ≲ 30-50&percnt; at ~ 3σ, suggesting that additional astrophysical/cosmological sources are needed to explain the residual part of the signal measured by PTA experiments.

### 245) [2507.12618](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12618v3): Supermassive Stars Match the Spectral Signatures of JWST's Little Red Dots

<p> Devesh Nandal, Abraham Loeb </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled a population of enigmatic, compact sources at high redshift known as "Little Red Dots'' (LRDs), whose physical nature remains a subject of intense debate. Concurrently, the rapid assembly of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) requires the formation of heavy seeds, for which supermassive stars (SMSs) are leading theoretical progenitors. In this work, we perform the first quantitative test of the hypothesis that LRDs are the direct observational manifestation of these primordial SMSs. We present a novel, first-principles pipeline generating synthetic spectra for a non-rotating, metal-free SMS up to 10^6   M<sub>&odot;</sub>. We establish that its luminosity (L_λ≈ 1.7 × 10^44   erg   s<sup>-1</sup>   μm^-1 at 4050 Å) provides a decisive constraint, matching prominent LRDs. Our model self-consistently reproduces their defining spectral features: the V-shaped Balmer break morphology is shown to be an intrinsic photospheric effect, while the complex line phenomenology, strong Hβ in emission with other Balmer lines in absorption arises from non-LTE effects in a single stellar atmosphere. With wind and macroturbulent broadening, we match LRD spectra at z=7.76 and z=3.55, including the Hβ width of MoM-BH*-1 to within 4&percnt;. We predict a luminosity-dependent observability window, ~10^4 yr for the most luminous systems and 10^5&ndash;10^6 yr if L_λ(4050 Å) is lower by 1&ndash;2 dex. These results provide a self-consistent alternative to multi-component obscured AGN scenarios and suggest JWST may be witnessing luminous stages of SMBH progenitors before collapse.

<p>
JWST observations have revealed a population of high-redshift "little red dots" (LRDs) that challenge conventional AGN models. We report the discovery of three local LRDs at z = 0.1-0.2, initially selected from the SDSS database, with follow-up optical/near-IR spectroscopy and photometry. They exhibit properties fully consistent with those of high-redshift LRDs, including broad hydrogen and helium emission lines, compact morphologies, V-shaped UV-optical SED, declining near-IR continua, and no significant variability. Two sources were targeted but not detected in X-rays with statistical significance. All three sources show blue-shifted He I absorption, while two exhibit Hα and Na D absorption lines. We detect full Balmer and Paschen line series in all three objects, along with abundant narrow [Fe II] emission in two. The emission line analyses suggest narrow lines originate from AGN-powered, metal-poor regions with minimal dust; broad lines come from inner regions with exceptionally high density or atypical dust properties; and [Fe II] emission arises from dense gas between broad and narrow-line regions. One of our objects, J1025+1402 (nicknamed The~Egg), shows extremely high equivalent width Na D, K I, and Ca II triplet absorption lines, along with other potential low-ionization absorption features, suggesting the presence of a cool (~5000 K), metal-enriched gas envelope. The optical/near-IR continua of these LRDs are also consistent with theoretical models featuring an atmosphere around black holes. The WISE-detected IR emission is consistent with weak dust emission of T ~ 10^2-10^3 K. We propose a conceptual model consisting of a largely thermalized cool-gas envelope surrounding the central black hole and an extended emission line region with high-density outflowing gas to explain the observed properties of these local LRDs.

### 247) [2507.09085](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09085v2): Little Red Dots As Late-stage Quasi-stars

<p> Mitchell C. Begelman, Jason Dexter </p>
<p>
We argue that the "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) discovered with the James Webb Space Telescope are quasi-stars in their late stages of evolution. Quasi-stars are hypothetical objects predicted to form following the core collapse of supermassive stars, and consist of black holes accreting from massive envelopes at a super-Eddington rate. We show that models of late-stage quasi-stars, with black hole masses exceeding ~ 10&percnt; of the total, predict thermal and radiative properties that are insensitive to both black hole and envelope mass, and spectrally resemble LRDs. Specifically, we show that they are likely to exhibit reddish colors, a strong Balmer break, and possess conditions favorable to the production of Balmer lines that are broadened by electron scattering. Their huge electron column densities suppress any X-rays. Late-stage quasi-stars, with black hole masses ≳ 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, should dominate the overall quasi-star population. Their short predicted lifetimes (tens of Myr), coupled with the high observed comoving density of LRDs, suggest that most or all supermassive black holes go through a quasi-star/LRD phase during their formation and growth.

<p>
One of JWST's most remarkable discoveries is a population of compact red galaxies known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Their existence raises many questions about their nature, origin, and evolution. These galaxies show a steep decline in number density-nearly two orders of magnitude-from z=6 to z=3. In this study, we explore their potential evolution by identifying candidate descendants in CEERS, assuming a single evolutionary path: the development of a blue star-forming outskirt around the red compact core. Our color-magnitude selection identifies galaxies as red as LRDs at z&lt;4, surrounded by young, blue stellar outskirts. Morphological parameters were derived from single Sérsic profile fits; physical properties were obtained from SED fitting using a stellar-only model. These "post-LRD" candidates show LRD-like features with M<sub>&ast;</sub> ~ 10^10  M<sub>&odot;</sub> , central densities ( Σ<sub>&ast;</sub> ~ 10^11  M<sub>&odot;</sub>  kpc^-2 ), compact sizes, and red rest-frame colors, but with an added extended component. Their number density at z = 3 ± 0.5 ( ~ 10^-4.15   Mpc^-3 ) matches that of LRDs at 5 &lt; z &lt; 7 , supporting a possible evolutionary link. We observe a redshift-dependent increase in outskirts mass fraction and galaxy size-from ~ 250 pc at z = 5 to ~ 600 pc at z = 3 -suggesting global stellar growth. Meanwhile, the core remains red and compact, but the V-shaped SED fades as the outskirts grow. These findings support an evolutionary scenario in which LRDs gradually acquire an extended stellar component over cosmic time by cold accretion. This may explain the apparent decline in their observed number density at lower redshift.

We present a sample of z<sub>phot</sub>~10-16 galaxies by exploiting one of the richest JWST NIRCam imaging data, taken in the CANUCS survey in Cycle 1 and the Technicolor (TEC) survey in Cycle 2. The combination of the CANUCS+TEC provides multi-epoch, deep NIRCam images in all medium bands (MBs) and broad bands (BBs) onboard NIRCam (22 filters in total), over ~23 arcmin<sup>2</sup> in three independent lines of sight. We select high-z galaxy candidates based on photometric redshifts, and obtain eight candidates at z~10-16, including a very robust candidate at z~15.4. The ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function (LF) from our sample is consistent with previous JWST studies showing a scatter of ~0.6 dex across the literature, marking the significance of the field-to-field variance in interpreting galaxy abundance measurements at z&gt;10. We find that the UV LF moderately evolves at z&gt;10, and the LF normalization and the luminosity density decline by a factor of ~7 from z~11 to z~15, indicating less steep evolution than z&lt;11. We highlight the importance of MB filters, not only to minimize the contamination by low-z interlopers but also to maximize the completeness. In particular, faint and less blue galaxies could be missed when the sample is built solely on BB data. The contamination and incompleteness of BB-only selected samples can bias our views of earliest galaxy evolution at z&gt;10, including the UV LF by ~0.6 dex, the size-magnitude relation by ~0.6 dex, and the UV slope-magnitude relation by Δβ_UV~-0.3.

We present a sample of 53 galaxy spectra at z<sub>spec</sub> ~ 5-12 from the JWST CEERS and RUBIES surveys, combining NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy with NIRCam photometry. We aim to use these data to establish best practices for measuring the UV spectral slope (β) in the era of JWST. We adopt power-law fits to the rest-frame UV continuum from the spectroscopic data as our fiducial, or `true', β values, and compare them to photometric estimates derived through four methods: (1) photometric power-law fitting, (2) power-law fitting to an SED model fitted to the photometry, (3) single-color fitting near the Lyman break, and (4) single-color fitting at fixed rest-frame wavelengths. We find that photometric power-law fitting most closely recovers the spectroscopic slopes, with minimal bias and scatter. SED fitting performs moderately well, and can be preferable in cases of low signal-to-noise where photometric power-law fitting may become unreliable. Single-color estimates, while commonly used in past studies, show the most significant deviations and are not recommended when more than a single color is available. Our results highlight the limitations and strengths of each approach and provide practical guidance for measuring β from photometry when spectra are unavailable or are of insufficient quality.

Massive stars at cosmological distances can be individually detected during transient microlensing events, when gravitational lensing magnifications may exceed ~1000. Nine such sources were identified in JWST NIRCam imaging of a single galaxy at redshift z=0.94 known as the "Warhol arc,'' which is mirror-imaged by the galaxy cluster MACSJ0416.1-2403. Here we present the discovery of two coincident and well-characterized microlensing events at the same location followed by a third event observed in a single filter approximately 18 months later. The events can be explained by microlensing of a binary star system consisting of a red supergiant (T ~ 4000 K) and a B-type (T ~ 13,000 K) companion star. The timescale of the coincident microlensing events constrains the estimated projected source-plane size to tens of AU. The most likely binary configurations consistent with the observational constraints on the temperature and luminosity of each star are stars with initial masses M1=23.6+5.3-4.3 Msol and an initial mass ratio between the two stars close to unity. A kinematic model that reproduces the observed light curve in all filters gives a relatively small transverse velocity of 50 km/s. This requires the dominant velocity component of several hundreds of km/s to be roughly parallel to the microcaustic. An alternative possibility would be that the three microlensing events correspond to unrelated stars crossing distinct microcaustics, but this would imply a highly elevated rate of events at their common position, even though no underlying knot is present at the location.

Spatially resolved multi-wavelength analysis is essential to study galaxy formation and evolution. A UV-bright galaxy COS-2987030247 at z = 6.81 is one of the Rosetta Stones in the epoch of reionization for which JWST NIRSpec Integral Field Spectroscopy, NIRCam imaging, and ALMA data are available thanks to the RIOJA program. We identified the rest-frame optical emission lines from the ionized hydrogen, oxygen, and neon gas. The \OIII 5008Å line emission and the NIRCam images show a complex kinematical and morphological structure where two bright main and three faint clumps are identified in a 10 kpc extent. The system is not classified as a purely rotation-dominated disk. The multiple clumps are instead consistent with a merger-related origin, including either distinct galaxies in interaction or star-forming clumps formed through tidal gas compression during a merger. The spatially resolved emission line fluxes show that dust attenuation, metal enrichment, and ionization parameter are preferentially enhanced in the star formation peaks. Our SED fitting suggests that the main clumps are in a moderately dust-attenuated star forming phase (A_V = 0.2&ndash;0.3 and SFR(Hα) ~ 10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1) with almost zero escape fraction of ionizing photons. In contrast, the sub-clumps are dust-free and lying on or below the main sequence of star-forming galaxies. These sub-clumps may work as a perturber that triggers the clumpy starburst in the surrounding gas through the merger event.

Light reprocessed by dust grains emitting in the infrared allows the study of the physics at play in dusty, embedded regions, where ultraviolet and optical wavelengths are attenuated. Infrared telescopes such as JWST have made it possible to study the earliest feedback phases, when stars are shielded by cocoons of gas and dust. This phase is crucial for unravelling the effects of feedback from young stars, leading to their emergence and the dispersal of their host molecular clouds. Here we show that the transition from the embedded to the exposed phase of star formation is short (&lt; 4 Myr) and sometimes almost absent (&lt; 1 Myr), across a sample of 37 nearby star-forming galaxies, covering a wide range of morphologies from massive barred spirals to irregular dwarfs. The short duration of the dust-clearing timescales suggests a predominant role of pre-supernova feedback mechanisms in revealing newborn stars, confirming previous results on smaller samples and allowing, for the first time, a statistical analysis of their dependencies. We find that the timescales associated with mid-infrared emission at 21 μm, tracing a dust-embedded feedback phase, are controlled by a complex interplay between giant molecular cloud properties (masses and velocity dispersions) and galaxy morphology. We report relatively longer durations of the embedded phase of star formation in barred spiral galaxies, while this phase is significantly reduced in low-mass irregular dwarf galaxies. We discuss tentative trends with gas-phase metallicity, which may favor faster cloud dispersal at low metallicities.

JWST has revealed a population of "dormant'' galaxies at z&gt;5 that have recently halted their star formation and are characterized by weak emission lines and significant Balmer breaks. Until now, only four such galaxies have been reported at z&gt;5, three with low stellar masses, M_*&lt;10^9M<sub>&odot;</sub> (so-called mini-quenched galaxies), and one massive quiescent galaxy with M_*=10^10.2M<sub>&odot;</sub>; no such galaxy had been reported at intermediate masses. Here, we present a systematic search for dormant galaxies at 5&lt;z&lt;7.4 that halted star formation at least 10 Myr before the time of observation. To do this, we made use of all the publicly available NIRSpec prism data in the DAWN JWST Archive (DJA) and selected galaxies with low Hα equivalent widths (EW_0&lt;50Å) and strong Balmer breaks (F_ν,4200/F_ν,3500&gt;1.4). We find 14 dormant galaxies with stellar masses ranging from 10^7.6-10^10.5, revealing an intermediate-mass population. By construction, these 14 sources are located about 1 dex below the star-forming main sequence. Their star formation histories suggest that they halted star formation between 10 and 25 Myr before the time of observation which, according to models, is comparable with the timescales of internally regulated bursts driving a "breathing'' mode of star formation. Our results show that ~1&percnt; of the galaxies in the DJA are in a dormant phase of their star formation histories, and they span a wide stellar mass range. These galaxies can be empirically selected using only their spectral features in NIRSpec prism data.

<p>
Chemically homogeneously evolving stars have been proposed to account for several exotic phenomena, including gravitational-wave emissions and gamma-ray bursts. Here we study whether these stars can explain the metal-poor dwarf galaxy I Zwicky 18. We apply our synthetic spectral models from Paper II to (i) establish a classification sequence for these hot stars, (ii) predict the photonionizing flux and the strength of emission lines from a IZw18-like stellar population, and (iii) compare our predictions to available observations of this galaxy. Adding two new models computed with PoWR, we report (i) these stars to follow a unique sequence of classes: O-&gt;WN-&gt;WO (i.e. without ever being WC). From our population synthesis with standard assumptions, we predict that (ii) the source of the UV C-IV and other emission bumps is a couple dozen WO-type Wolf-Rayet stars (not WC as previously assumed) which are the result of chem. hom. evolution, while these, combined with the rest of the O-star population, account for the He-II ionizing flux and spectral hardness. Contrasting our results against published optical and UV data and accounting for different aperture sizes and spatial regions probed by the observations, we find that (iii) our models are highly consistent with them. Since our "massive Pop II stars" might just as well exist in early star-forming regions, our findings have implications for upcoming JWST surveys; and given that our results apply for binary populations too as long as the same fraction (10%) of the systems evolves chem. homogeneously, we conclude that the stellar progenitors of gravitational waves may very well exist today in IZw18.

We combine F115W and F277W images collected with the Near Infrared Camera of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with multi-band, multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of Omega Centauri to investigate its multiple stellar populations and internal kinematics. Our study focuses on a region spanning ~0.9 to ~2.3 half-light radii from the cluster center, largely unexplored by HST and JWST. Using chromosome maps, we identify the principal populations along the upper main sequence and among M-dwarfs, distinguishing lower-stream (LS) stars, chemically akin to first-generation globular cluster stars with similar metallicities, and upper-stream (US) stars, enriched in helium and nitrogen but oxygen-poor. Both streams also host subpopulations with varying metallicities. We find radially anisotropic motions, with US stars exhibiting significantly stronger anisotropy than LS stars. Subdividing the US into extreme and intermediate light-element populations reveals a gradient in anisotropy, with intermediate stars lying between the LS and extreme US populations. However, metal-rich and metal-poor stars within each stream show moderate kinematic differences. The LS stars show higher angular momentum and dispersion compared to US stars, and also exhibit stronger systemic rotation and tangential proper-motion skewness, further highlighting their kinematic divergence. Finally, leveraging a mass range of ~0.15 - 0.7 solar masses, we detect a low degree of energy equipartition for all cluster stars, which decreases with radial distance from the cluster center.

<p>
[Abridged] We analyse the dark matter (DM) halo properties of 127 0.3&lt;z&lt;1.5 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) down to low stellar masses (8&lt;log(Mstar/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;11), using data from the MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field Survey and photometry from HST and JWST. We employ a 3D forward modelling approach to analyse the morpho-kinematics of our sample, enabling measurement of individual rotation curves out to 2-3 times the effective radius. We perform a disk-halo decomposition with a 3D parametric model that includes stellar, gas, and DM components, with pressure support corrections. We validate our methodology on mock data cubes generated from idealised disk simulations. We select the best-fitting DM model among six density profiles, including the Navarro-Frenk-White and the generalised alpha-beta-gamma profile of Di Cintio et al. (2014, DC14). Our Bayesian analysis shows that DC14 performs as well as or better than the other profiles in &gt;80% of the sample. We find that the kinematically inferred stellar masses agree with values from SED fitting. We find that 89% of galaxies have DM fractions &gt;50%. For 66% of SFGs, we infer a DM inner slope, gamma &lt; 0.5, indicating cored DM profiles, but no correlation is found between gamma and star formation rate of the sample. The stellar- and concentration-mass relations agree with theoretical expectations, but with larger scatter. We confirm the anticorrelation between halo scale radius and DM density. The halo scale radii and DM surface densities increase with Mstar, while DM densities stay constant. We find tentative evidence of an evolution of the DM density with z, which suggests that the DM halos of intermediate-z systems are denser than those of local galaxies. In contrast, the halo scale radii are z-invariant.

<p>
As part of the N2CLS Survey, we have identified a remarkable overdensity of eight bright dusty star-forming galaxies at z~5.2 in the GOODS-N field. Three of these galaxies, N2GN_1_01, 06, and 23 (known as GN10, HDF850.1, and S3, respectively), had previously been spectroscopically confirmed as members of the exceptional large-scale structure at z~5.1-5.3, which is notably elongated along the line of sight, spanning 30 cMpc. We present the spectroscopic confirmation of N2GN_1_13 at z<sub>spec</sub>=5.182, a massive dusty star-forming galaxy identified through targeted NOEMA observations, and N2GN_1_61 at z<sub>spec</sub>=5.201, revealed using JWST/FRESCO data. In addition to these five spectroscopically confirmed members, we identify three further candidates with photometric redshifts consistent with the overdense structure. These galaxies are massive (with a median stellar mass of 9x 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) and highly obscured (with a median A_V of 3.3), caught in a short-lived yet extreme starburst phase at z~5.2. Their high SFRs (with a median of 590 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1), efficient baryon to stellar mass conversion (ε<sub>&sext;</sub>&gt;20%), substantial gas reservoir and dust content, suggest rapid evolution and imminent quenching. Six of these galaxies reside in overdense filaments; the remaining two may trace new distinct structures which will have to be spectroscopically confirmed. These few dusty galaxies dominate the star formation within the overdensity, contributing more than the numerous H_α emitters, and surpassing the cosmic average star formation rate density for this epoch. Their properties suggest an accelerated evolution that current models and simulations have difficulty reproducing.

<p>
We report the discovery of COSMOS2020-635829 as a candidate jellyfish galaxy undergoing ram pressure stripping in a (proto)cluster at z &gt; 1. High-resolution imaging from the James Webb Space Telescope reveals a symmetric stellar disk coupled to a unilateral tail of star-forming knots to the south. Using Gemini GMOS IFU observations, we show that these extra-planar continuum sources are embedded within an ionized gas tail that is kinematically connected to the disk of COSMOS2020-635829. If confirmed, this represents the highest-redshift discovery of a ram pressure stripped ionized gas tail. The tail sources are characterized by extremely young stellar populations (≲ 100 Myr), have stellar masses of ~10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, and star formation rates of 0.1&ndash;1 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1. This work shows that ram pressure stripping can potentially perturb group and cluster galaxies at z &gt; 1 and may contribute to environmental quenching even near Cosmic Noon.

<p> Francesco D'Eramo, Alessandro Lenoci, Ariane Dekker </p>
<p>
The suppression of cosmological structure at small scales is a key signature of dark matter (DM) produced via freeze-in in the low-mass regime. We present a comprehensive analysis of its impact, incorporating recent constraints from Milky Way satellite counts, strong gravitational lensing with JWST data, and the Lyman-α forest. We adopt a general strategy to translate existing warm dark matter (WDM) bounds into lower mass limits for a broad class of DM candidates characterized by quasi-thermal phase space distributions. The benefits of this approach include computational efficiency and the ability to explore a wide range of models. We derive model-independent bounds for DM produced via two-body decays, scatterings, and three-body decays, and apply the framework to concrete scenarios such as the Higgs portal, sterile neutrinos, axion-like particles, and the dark photon portal. Results from specific models confirm the validity of the model-independent analysis.

We present 21 transients from our three-epoch, four-band NIRCam observations covering 14.16 arcmin<sup>2</sup> in the Spitzer IRAC Dark Field (IDF), taken by the JWST Prime Extragalactic Areas for Reionization and Lensing Science program with a time cadence of ~6 months. A separate Hubble Space Telescope program provided Advanced Camera for Surveys optical imaging contemporaneous with the second and third epochs of the NIRCam observations. The NIRSpec spectroscopy on three transients confirmed a Type Ia supernova at z=1.63 and the host galaxies of the other two at z=2.64 and 1.90, respectively. Combining these with the photometric redshifts (z_ph) of the host galaxies in the rest of the sample, we find that the transients are in either a "mid-z" group at z&gt;1.6 with M_V &lt; -16.0 mag or a "low-z" group at z &lt; 0.4 with M_H &gt; -14.0 mag. The mid-z transients are consistent with supernovae. In contrast, the low-z transients' luminosities fall in the range of the so-called "gap transients" between supernovae and novae. However, this latter conclusion is only tentative due to possible catastrophic failures in z_ph that could bias them to low-z. Conversely, if they are indeed at z &lt; 0.4, it would be worth studying similar transients in the future. Our work further demonstrates the power of NIRCam in transient science and also shows that it would be more fruitful to carry out a long-term monitoring program with more passbands, a higher cadence and prompt follw-up spectroscopy. Being in the continuous viewing zone of the JWST, the IDF is an ideal field for this purpose.

### 262) [2506.08116](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08116v2): The properties of primordially-seeded black holes and their hosts in the first billion years: implications for JWST

<p> Pratika Dayal, Roberto maiolino </p>
<p>
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have opened a tantalising new window onto possible black holes as early as redshifts of z ~ 10.4. These show a number of puzzling properties including unexpectedly massive black holes in place by z ~ 10 and inexplicably high black hole-to-stellar mass ratios of M_BH/M_*≥ 0.1. These pose a serious challenge for "astrophysical" seeding and growth models that we aim to explain with "cosmological" primordial black holes (PBHs) in this work. We present PHANES, an analytic framework that follows the evolution of dark matter halos, and their baryons in the first billion years, seeded by a population of PBHs with seed masses between 10^0.5-10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. PBH seeded models yield a black hole mass function that extends between 10^1.25-11.25 ~(10^0.75-7.25)M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z ~ 5 (15) for the different models considered in this work. Interestingly, PBH-seeded models (with spin s=0 or -1) naturally result in extremely high values of M_BH/M_*≥ 0.25 at z ~ 5-15. For a typical stellar mass of M_* =10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, we find an average value of M_BH/M_* ~ 0.4~ (1.6) for s=0~(-1) at z=5, providing a smoking gun for PBH-seeded models. Another particularity of PBH-seeded models is their ability of producing systems with high black hole-to-stellar mass ratios that are extremely metal poor (Z ≤ 10^-2~Z<sub>&odot;</sub>). Yielding a PBH-to-dark matter fraction ≤ 10^-9 and a stellar mass function that lies four orders of magnitude below observations, our model is in accord with all current cosmological and astrophysical bounds.

### 263) [2506.04350](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04350v2): JWST Insights into Narrow-line Little Red Dots

<p> Zijian Zhang, Linhua Jiang, Weiyang Liu, Luis C. Ho, Kohei Inayoshi </p>
<p>
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a population of red and compact objects with a unique V-shape SED at z ≥ 4 known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Most of the LRDs with existing spectral observations exhibit broad Balmer lines and are thus likely to host active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here we present a study of LRDs with no broad H-alpha component. Our sample consists of five LRDs at z~5 with H-alpha line widths of about 250 km/s. They are selected from 32 LRDs that have NIRSpec high- or medium-resolution grating spectra covering H-alpha. During our construction of the sample, we find that approximately 20 percent of the LRD candidates previously selected do not show red continuum emission but resemble the V-shape spectra due to strong line emission. Compared to normal star-forming galaxies, narrow-line LRDs tend to have relatively higher H-alpha line widths and luminosities. If these LRDs are dominated by galaxies, our SED modeling suggests that they are dusty, compact star-forming galaxies with high stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs). Alternatively, if their SEDs are produced by AGNs, the inferred central black hole masses (MBH) are in the range of 10^5 to 10^6 solar masses, placing them at the low-mass end of the AGN population. They may represent an early stage of super-Eddington growth, where the black holes have yet to accumulate significant masses. With large measurement uncertainties, these black holes appear slightly overmassive relative to the local MBH-Mstar relation, but consistent or undermassive with respect to the MBH-sigma and MBH-Mdyn relations. We further find that nearly half of the high-redshift broad-line AGNs exhibit V-shape SEDs. (abridged)

### 264) [2506.03245](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03245v2): The Pandora project. II: how non-thermal physics drives bursty star formation and temperate mass-loaded outflows in dwarf galaxies

<p>
Dwarf galaxies provide powerful laboratories for studying galaxy formation physics. Their early assembly, shallow gravitational potentials, and bursty, clustered star formation histories make them especially sensitive to the processes that regulate baryons through multi-phase outflows. Using high-resolution, cosmological zoom-in simulations of a dwarf galaxy from itthe Pandora suite, we explore the impact of stellar radiation, magnetic fields, and cosmic ray feedback on star formation, outflows, and metal retention. We find that our purely hydrodynamical model without non-thermal physics - in which supernova feedback is boosted to reproduce realistic stellar mass assembly - drives violent, overly enriched outflows that suppress the metal content of the host galaxy. Including radiation reduces the clustering of star formation and weakens feedback. However, the additional incorporation of cosmic rays produces fast, mass-loaded, multi-phase outflows consisting of both ionized and neutral gas components, in better agreement with observations. These outflows, which entrain a denser, more temperate ISM, exhibit broad metallicity distributions while preserving metals within the galaxy. Furthermore, the star formation history becomes more bursty, in agreement with recent JWST findings. These results highlight the essential role of non-thermal physics in galaxy evolution and the need to incorporate it in future galaxy formation models.

### 265) [2506.03130](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03130v2): AGNBoost: A Machine Learning Approach to AGN Identification with JWST/NIRCam+MIRI Colors and Photometry

Trump, Nor Pirzkal, Alexander de la Vega, Edgar Perez Vidal, L. Y. Aaron Yung </p>
<p>
We present AGNBoost, a machine learning framework utilizing XGBoostLSS to identify AGN and estimate redshifts from JWST NIRCam and MIRI photometry. AGNBoost constructs 66 input features from 7 NIRCam and 4 MIRI bands to predict the fraction of mid-IR 3&ndash;30 μm emission attributable to an AGN power law (frac_AGN) and photometric redshift. Each model is trained on 10^6 simulated galaxies from CIGALE. Models are tested on mock CIGALE galaxies, an independent set of empirically-derived templates, and 748 observations from the JWST MIRI EGS Galaxy and AGN (MEGA) survey. On idealized noise-free mock CIGALE galaxies, AGNBoost achieves 15&percnt; outlier fractions of 1.63&percnt; (frac_AGN) and 0.15&percnt; (redshift), with σ_RMSE = 0.045 for frac_AGN and σ_NMAD = 0.004 for redshift. When realistic photometric uncertainties are introduced, performance remains robust with median predictions on the 1:1 relation, though outlier fractions increase to 4.38&percnt; and 3.35&percnt;, respectively. On the independent template set, AGNBoost identifies 92.6&percnt; of AGN candidates with frac_AGN &gt; 0.3 and 100&percnt; with frac_AGN &gt; 0.5, demonstrating generalization beyond the training distribution. On MEGA galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, AGNBoost achieves σ_NMAD = 0.056 and 19.79&percnt; outliers. AGNBoost frac_AGN estimates broadly agree with CIGALE fitting (σ_RMSE = 0.178, 11.96&percnt; outliers). The flexible framework allows straightforward incorporation of additional photometric bands and re-training for other variables. AGNBoost's computational efficiency makes it well-suited for wide-sky surveys requiring rapid AGN identification and redshift estimation.

Williams, Kenneth C. Wong </p>
<p>
We present cosmological constraints from 8 strongly lensed quasars (hereafter, the TDCOSMO-2025 sample). Building on previous work, our analysis incorporated new deflector stellar velocity dispersions measured from spectra obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Keck Telescopes, and the Very Large Telescope (VLT), utilizing improved methods. We used integrated JWST stellar kinematics for 5 lenses, VLT-MUSE for 2, and resolved kinematics from Keck and JWST for RXJ1131-1231. We also considered two samples of non-time-delay lenses: 11 from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) sample with Keck-KCWI resolved kinematics; and 4 from the Strong Lenses in the Legacy Survey (SL2S) sample. We improved our analysis of line-of-sight effects, the surface brightness profile of the lens galaxies, and orbital anisotropy, and corrected for projection effects in the dynamics. Our uncertainties are maximally conservative by accounting for the mass-sheet degeneracy in the deflectors' mass density profiles. The analysis was blinded to prevent experimenter bias. Our primary result is based on the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, in combination with Ω_m constraints from the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae (SN) dataset. In the flat Λ cold dark matter (CDM), we find H_0=71.6^+3.9_-3.3 km s<sup>-1</sup> Mpc^-1. The SLACS and SL2S samples are in excellent agreement with the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, improving the precision on H_0 in flat ΛCDM to 4.6%. Using the Dark Energy Survey SN Year-5 dataset (DES-SN5YR) or DESI-DR2 baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) likelihoods instead of Pantheon+ yields very similar results. We also present constraints in the open ΛCDM, wCDM, w_0w_aCDM, and w_φCDM cosmologies. The TDCOSMO H_0 inference is robust and consistent across all presented cosmological models, and our cosmological constraints in them agree with those from the BAO and SN.

### 267) [2505.22600](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22600v2): Dust Budget Crisis in Little Red Dots

<p> Kejian Chen, Zhengrong Li, Kohei Inayoshi, Luis C. Ho </p>
<p>
Little red dots (LRDs), a population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) recently identified by JWST, are characterized by their compact morphology and red optical continuum emission, which is often interpreted as evidence for significant dust extinction of A_V ≳ 3 mag. However, the dust-reddened AGN scenario is increasingly challenged by their faint near-to-far infrared emission and a potential "dust budget crisis" in cases when the host galaxy is either undetectably low-mass or absent. In this study, we re-evaluate the dust extinction level in LRDs by modeling the UV-to-infrared spectra for various extinction laws and a broad range of dusty distribution parameters. Comparing the predicted infrared fluxes with observational data from the JWST MIRI, Herschel, and ALMA, our analysis finds that the visual extinction is tightly and consistently constrained to A_V ≲ 1.0-1.5 mag for A2744-45924, RUBIES-BLAGN-1, and stacked SEDs from a large sample of LRDs under the SMC extinction law, with slightly weaker constraints for those with gray extinction in the UV range. The revised A_V values yield radiative efficiencies of ~ 10&percnt; for the LRD population, easing the tension with the Sołtan argument for the bulk AGN population at lower redshifts. Moreover, this moderate extinction (or dust-free) scenario, with reprocessed emission spectra testable by future far-infrared observatories, provides a paradigm shift in understanding their natures, environments, and evolutionary pathways of massive black holes in the early universe.

<p> Patrick LaChance, Rupert A. C. Croft, Tiziana Di Matteo, Yihao Zhou, Fabio Pacucci, Yueying Ni, Nianyi Chen, Simeon Bird </p>
<p>
We present simulated counterparts of the "Little Red Dot'' (LRD) galaxies observed with JWST, using the large cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, ASTRID. We create mock observations of the galaxies (5 ≤ z ≤ 8) in ASTRID, and find seventeen which fit the color and size criteria of LRDs. These LRDs are galaxies with high stellar masses (log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 9.7), and massive black holes (log(M_BH/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≥ 6.8). The host galaxies are dense, with stellar half mass radii (325 pc ≤ r_half,* ≤ 620 pc), and dust attenuation in the F444W band above 1.25. Their star formation has been recently quenched. They host relatively bright AGN that are dust-obscured and contribute significantly to the rest-frame optical red slope and have relatively low luminosity in the rest-frame ultraviolet, where the host galaxy's stars are more dominant. These LRDs are in an evolutionary phase of miniquenching that is the result of AGN feedback from their massive black holes. The LRDs in ASTRID are bright with F444W magnitudes of 23.5-25.5. The less massive and fainter galaxies in ASTRID lack the dust concentration necessary to produce the red slope of an LRD, though this could be an effect of limited resolution. Most of the highest Eddington black holes are not LRDs due to insufficient dust attenuation from their host galaxies, which are also experiencing relatively high star formation rates. This results in their spectra being too flat, despite their highly accreting black holes.

### 269) [2505.12867](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12867v2): The Dichotomy in the Nuclear and Host Galaxy Properties of High-redshift Quasars

<p> Ruancun Li, Luis C. Ho, Chang-Hao Chen </p>
<p>
The early growth of high-redshift quasars and their host galaxies raises critical questions about their cosmic evolution. We exploit the angular resolution and sensitivity of NIRCam to investigate the host galaxies of 31 quasars at 4≲ z≲7 drawn from multiple JWST surveys. Using a new multi-band forward-modeling code (scGalfitS) that incorporates physically motivated priors, we securely detect and quantify the host emission in 30 objects, while simultaneously characterizing the nuclear spectral energy distribution. The host galaxies of high-redshift quasars are ~ 0.3~dex more compact than star-forming galaxies of comparable mass. A striking dichotomy emerges: luminous "blue'' quasars (L_5100≳10^45 erg s<sup>-1</sup>) reside in bulge-dominated galaxies (n ≈ 5) and exhibit a narrow range of ultraviolet nuclear slopes (median β_UV ≈ -1.4), while fainter "red'' quasars inhabit disk-like hosts (n≈ 1) and display a broad range of slopes (β_UV≈-2 to 4). These two populations differ markedly in their black hole-to-stellar mass ratios, with high-luminosity quasars showing M_BH/M<sub>&ast;</sub> = 1.2&percnt; compared to 4.7&percnt; for lower luminosity sources, placing them collectively ~0.6~dex above the local M_BH-M<sub>&ast;</sub> relation. This offset likely reflects rapid black hole growth in early gas-rich environments, where feedback from the active galactic nucleus becomes effective only after substantial gas depletion. Our findings suggest that the observed dichotomy, whether due to intrinsic spectral differences or dust extinction, fundamentally shapes the coevolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies in the early Universe.

### 270) [2505.12505](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12505v2): Connecting JWST discovered N/O-enhanced galaxies to globular clusters: Evidence from chemical imprints

<p> Xihan Ji, Vasily Belokurov, Roberto Maiolino, Stephanie Monty, Yuki Isobe, Andrey Kravtsov, William McClymont, Hannah Übler </p>
<p>
Recent JWST observations have revealed a growing population of galaxies at z&gt;4 with elevated nitrogen-to-oxygen ratios. These "N/O-enhanced" galaxies (NOEGs) exhibit near- to super-solar N/O at sub-solar O/H, clearly deviating from the well-established scaling relation between N/O and O/H observed in local galaxies. The origin of this abundance anomaly is unclear. Interestingly, local globular clusters also exhibit anomalous light-element abundances, whose origin remains debated. In this work, we compare the chemical abundance patterns of 22 known NOEGs at 0≲ z≲ 12 &ndash; primarily discovered with JWST &ndash; to those observed in local globular clusters. We find similarities in the abundances of C, N, O, Fe, and He between the two populations. The similar abundance patterns support the scenario in which globular cluster stars formed within proto-cluster environments &ndash; similar to those traced by NOEGs &ndash; that were self-enriched. Indeed, the enhancement in N/O in early galaxies appears to be only found in dense stellar environments with Σ<sub>&sext;</sub>≳ 10^2.5~M<sub>&odot;</sub>~pc^-2, as expected for the progenitors of globular clusters in the Milky Way, and similar to those of star clusters identified in strongly lensed high-redshift galaxies. Furthermore, we find a tentative positive correlation between N/O ratios and stellar mass among NOEGs. The apparent high occurrence rate of NOEGs at high redshift is consistent with the picture of cluster-dominated star formation during the early stages of galaxy evolution. Measuring chemical abundances across diverse stellar environments in high-redshift galaxies will be crucial for elucidating the connection between NOEGs and globular clusters.

### 271) [2505.12397](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12397v3): Unveiling the Ionized and Neutral ISM at z &gt; 10 : The Origin of [O III] /[C II] Ratios from a Sub-parsec Resolution Radiative Transfer Simulation

<p> Yurina Nakazato, Kazuyuki Sugimura, Akio K. Inoue, Massimo Ricotti </p>
<p>
Recent multi-wavelength observations by JWST and ALMA are unveiling both ionized and neutral ISM components in high-redshift (z&gt;6) galaxies. In this work, we investigate the origin of rest-frame far-infrared [OIII]88 μm and [CII]158 μm emission by performing zoom-in cosmological simulations of dwarf-galaxy progenitors at z=9-13. Our simulations incorporate on-the-fly radiative transfer at sub-pc (~ 0.1 pc) resolution, allowing us to resolve the multi-phase ISM. We compute emission lines on a cell-by-cell basis, taking into account local temperature, density, metallicity, radiation field strength, column density, and spectral hardness of radiation bins. We find that [OIII] predominantly arises from centrally located ionizing bubbles with temperatures of ~ (1-5)× 10^4 K and high ionization parameters of log U<sub>ion</sub> ≃ -1.5. In contrast, [CII] is produced in the surrounding dense neutral regions at ~ 5× 10^3 K, which are heated by strong FUV radiation (G/G_0 ~ 10^3-5) from the central stellar clusters. This spatial arrangement leads to large local variations in [OIII]/[CII], ranging from ~ 100 to 0.01. Our galaxy reproduces the global ratio [OIII]/[CII]~5-30, consistent with recent ALMA detections at z&gt;6 without invoking enhanced O/C abundance ratios. We further derive that [OIII]/[CII] linearly scales with the mass and density ratios of ionized to neutral gas, M_HII/M_HI and n_HII/n_HI and show that the [OIII]/[CII] ratio typically changes from 5.7 to 0.3 from high-z to low-z. For future synergies of JWST and ALMA, we derived M_HII/M_HI for observed z &gt;6 galaxies using Hβ and [CII] and show the validity of our scaling relations.

### 272) [2505.07935](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07935v3): Amaryllis: a digital twin of the earliest galaxies in the Universe

<p> Mahsa Kohandel, Andrea Pallottini, Andrea Ferrara </p>
<p>
Synergies between JWST and ALMA are unveiling a population of bright, super-early (z&gt;10) galaxies, including systems like GS-z14-0 (z=14.2) and GHZ2 (z=12.3) with extreme FIR line ratios ([OIII] 88 um / [CII] 158 um &gt;3) that challenge galaxy formation models. To address this, we identify a synthetic analog of these sources, "Amaryllis", within the SERRA zoom-in simulations, and track its evolution from z=16 to z=7. During this period, Amaryllis grows from log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ~ 7.4 to 10.3, linking super-early progenitors to the massive galaxy population at the end of reionization. At z ~ 11.3, Amaryllis closely matches the observed properties of GS-z14-0, including M<sub>&sext;</sub>, SFR, and the luminosity of FIR ([OIII] 88 um) and UV (e.g. CIII] 1908) lines. We find that high [OIII]/[CII] ratios appear during short, merger-driven starburst episodes, when low metallicity (Z ~ 0.1 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) and high ionization conditions (U<sub>ion</sub> ~ 0.3) push the ISM far from equilibrium. These extreme FIR line ratios are thus transient and linked to major mergers that ignite strong ionized gas outflows. Strikingly, despite this dynamical activity, Amaryllis develops a rotation-supported gaseous disk (V/σ~ 4-6) by z ~ 11, while stars remain dispersion-dominated. This coexistence of ordered gas rotation and merger-driven disturbances occurs within a massive yet typical ΛCDM halo, enabling disk formation even at cosmic dawn.

We analyse the formation and growth of a very massive star (VMS) through successive stellar collisions and investigate the subsequent formation of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the core of a dense star cluster. Methods. We use both direct itN-body and Monte Carlo simulations, incorporating updated stellar evolution prescriptions (SSE/BSE) tailored to massive stars and VMSs. These include revised treatments of stellar radii, rejuvenation, and mass loss during collisions. While the prescriptions represent reasonable extrapolations into the VMS regime, the internal structure and thermal state of VMSs formed through stellar collisions remain uncertain, and future work may require further refinement. Results. We find that runaway stellar collisions in the cluster core produce a VMS exceeding 5 × 10^4~M<sub>&odot;</sub> within 5 Myr, which subsequently collapses into an IMBH. Conclusions. Our model suggests that dense stellar environments may enable the formation of very massive stars and massive black hole seeds through runaway stellar collisions. These results provide a potential pathway for early black hole growth in star clusters and offer theoretical context for interpreting recent JWST observations of young, compact clusters at high redshift.

<p>
We report on Chandra X-ray observations of four narrow-line quasar candidates at z~6, selected from the SHELLQs project, based on the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam survey. These objects are characterised by narrow (FWHM&lt;310 km/s), luminous (&gt;1e44 erg/s) Lya and faint UV continuum (M_1450 = -22 - -21), prompting us to examine whether they are obscured luminous AGN at the epoch of reionization. However, none of these objects were detected by Chandra, giving an upper limit to their rest-frame 2-10 keV luminosity (Lx) of 2e44 erg/s (2 sigma), assuming a spectral slope Gamma=2. Subsequent rest-frame optical spectroscopy of these objects by the JWST-NIRSpec, presented in a companion paper, show weak broad Balmer emission at the base of narrow cores. With the scaling relation for low-redshift AGN, the observed strong [OIII]5007 flux of these sources would predict Lx to be around 1e45 erg/s, which is well above the Chandra upper limits. These optical spectra and X-ray quietness are reminiscent of JWST-selected broad-line AGN. We attribute the weak broad Balmer emission to the broad-line regions hidden partially by optically-thick obscuring matter which also hides the optical and X-ray continuum emission from the accretion disc. Compton-thick obscuration, which would strongly suppress X-ray emission, could be due to a dense inter-stellar medium that is often present in galaxies at high redshifts. Alternatively, the same effect could be obtained from an inflated disc at the innermost radii in a supercritical accretion flow, when the disc is viewed at inclined angles.

<p>
The unprecedented sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a surprisingly abundant population of mildly obscured, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the epoch of reionization (EoR). However, the link between these objects and classical unobscured quasars remains a mystery. Here we report the discovery of obscured quasars hosted by the most luminous galaxies at z &gt; 6, possibly bridging the gap between the two AGN populations. The 13 objects presented here were originally selected from a rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) imaging survey over &gt;1000 deg2, and were known to have luminous (&gt;10^43 erg/s) narrow Ly-alpha emission. With JWST/NIRSpec follow-up observations, we found that 7 out of 11 objects with narrow Ly-alpha exhibit a broad component in H I Balmer lines and He I lines, but not in [O III] and other forbidden lines. Mild dust obscuration (0 &lt; Av &lt; 3) is inferred from the Balmer decrements. The estimated intrinsic luminosities suggest that our broad line (BL) objects are the long-sought UV-obscured counterparts of luminous quasars in the EoR. They host supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses 10^(7.8-9.1) M<sub>&odot;</sub>, undergoing sub-Eddington to Eddington accretion. Most of the BL objects are spatially unresolved, and are close to "little red dots" with their blue rest-UV and red rest-optical colors. We estimate the AGN number density among similarly luminous Ly-alpha emitters to be larger than 2 x 10^(-8) /Mpc3. This density is comparable to that of classical quasars with similar continuum luminosities, suggesting that a substantial fraction of active SMBHs are obscured in the EoR and have been overlooked in past rest-UV surveys.

<p>
We study the large-scale environments and clustering properties of 28 low-luminosity AGNs at z=3.9-6 in the GOODS-N field. Our sample, identified from the JWST NIRCam Imaging and WFSS data in CONGRESS and FRESCO surveys with either broad Hα emission lines or V-shape continua, are compared to 782 Hα emitters (HAEs) selected from the same data. These AGNs are located in diverse large-scale environments and do not preferentially reside in denser environments compared to HAEs. Their overdensity field, δ, averaged over (15 h^-1cMpc)^3, ranges from -0.56 to 10.56, and shows no clear correlation with broad-line luminosity, black hole (BH) masses, or the AGN fraction. It suggests that &gt; 10 cMpc structures do not significantly influence BH growth. We measure the two-point cross-correlation function of AGNs with HAEs, finding a comparable amplitude to that of the HAE auto-correlation. This indicates similar bias parameters and host dark matter halo masses for AGNs and HAEs. The correlation length of field AGNs is 4.26 h^-1cMpc, and 7.66 h^-1cMpc at 3.9 &lt; z &lt; 5 and 5 &lt; z &lt; 6, respectively. We infer a median host dark matter halo mass of log (M_h/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≈ 11.0-11.2 and host stellar masses of log (M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≈ 8.4-8.6 by comparing with the UniverseMachine simulation. Our clustering analysis suggests that low-luminosity AGNs at high redshift reside in normal star-forming galaxies with overmassive BHs. They represent an intrinsically distinct population from luminous quasars and could be a common phase in galaxy evolution.

<p>
We present a spectroscopic search for broad Hα emitters at z≈3.7-6.5 in the GOODS-N field, utilizing JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopy from FRESCO and CONGRESS, complemented by JADES imaging. We identify 19 broad Hα emitters with FWHM&gt;1000 km/s at z≈4-5.5, including 9 new sources. The broad Hα luminosity function (LF) derived from our sample is consistent with those of other JWST-selected broad-line AGN reported in the literature. The black hole masses and AGN bolometric luminosities, inferred from the broad Hα components, indicate that most sources are accreting at ~10% of the Eddington limit. We derive their host stellar masses via SED fitting and find higher M_BH/M_* ratios relative to the local M_BH-M_* relations, consistent with previous studies. We find that 42% of the sample do not satisfy the widely-used color selection criteria for Little Red Dots (LRDs), with the majority of these sources lacking the characteristic steep rest-optical red slope, indicating that the LRD selection is highly incomplete when selecting AGN galaxies. A comparison of the average SEDs between our sample and LRDs selected in the same field reveals that the steep red slopes observed in some LRDs are likely due to line-boosting effects as previously suggested. Furthermore, we find that 68% of color-selected LRDs with Hα detections in the NIRCam/Grism spectra do not exhibit broad-line features. While the limited sensitivity of the grism spectra may hinder the detection of broad-line components in faint sources, our findings still highlight the enigmatic nature of the LRD population.

<p>
The evolution of dust in core-collapse supernovae (SNe), in general, is poorly constrained owing to a lack of infrared observations after a few years from explosion. Most theories of dust formation in SNe heavily rely only on SN 1987A. In the last two years, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled us to probe the dust evolution in decades-old SNe, such as SN 2004et, SN 2005ip, and SN 1980K. In this paper, we present two decades of dust evolution in SN 2005af, combining early-time infrared observations with Spitzer Space Telescope and recent detections by JWST. We have used a chemical kinetic model of dust synthesis in SN ejecta to develop a template of dust evolution in SN 2005af. Moreover, using this approach, for the first time, we have separately quantified the dust formed in the pre-explosion wind that survived after the explosion, and the dust formed in the metal-rich SN ejecta post-explosion. We report that in SN 2005af, predominantly carbon-rich dust formed in the ejecta, with a total mass of at least 0.02 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. In the circumstellar medium, the surviving oxygen-rich dust amounts to about 0.003-0.006 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, yielding a total dust mass of at least 0.025 M<sub>&odot;</sub>.

### 279) [2504.14682](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14682v3): Extreme Neutral Outflow in a non-AGN Quiescent Galaxy at z~1.3

<p>
We report the discovery of a substantial sodium doublet (Na D λλ5890, 5896Å)-traced neutral outflow in the quiescent galaxy JADES-GS-206183 at z=1.317. Its JWST/NIRSpec-MSA spectrum shows a deep, blueshifted Na D absorption, revealing a neutral outflow with v_out=828^+79_-49 km s<sup>-1</sup> and a mass outflow rate of log(M&#775;_out/M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1)=2.40^+0.11_-0.16. This outflow rate exceeds that of any neutral outflows identified beyond z~1 by the same line and is comparable with those in local galaxies with intensive star formation or luminous AGN. JADES-GS-206183 is also a peculiar quiescent galaxy with a spiral+bar morphology, high dust attenuation (A_V=2.27±0.23 mag). Paschen α (Paα) emission from the FRESCO NIRCam grism confirms its low star formation rate (SFR_Paα=10.78± 0.55 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1), placing it 0.5 dex below the main-sequence (log(sSFR/yr^-1)=-10.2). Despite the systematics introduced by different star formation history (SFH) priors, the SED modeling, combining HST-to-NIRCam photometry with the VLT/MUSE spectrum, suggests that JADES-GS-206183 experienced an older episode of star formation 0.5-2 Gyr ago and a possible rejuvenation within recent ~10 Myr. Moreover, rest-frame optical lines indicate that the current AGN activity of JADES-GS-206183, if present, is also weak. Even though we tentatively detect a broad component of the Hα line, it likely traces an ionized outflow rather than an AGN. The results demonstrate that the Na D outflow in JADES-GS-206183 is highly unlikely to be driven by current star formation or nuclear activity. Instead, it may represent a long-lasting fossil outflow from past AGN activity, potentially co-triggered with the early phase of rejuvenation.

### 280) [2504.14592](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14592v2): The fate of the progenitors of luminous red novae: Infrared detection of LRNe years after the outburst

<p> A. Reguitti, A. Pastorello, G. Valerin </p>
<p>
We present late-time optical and infrared (IR) observations of a sample of nine extragalactic luminous red novae (LRNe) discovered in the past three decades. In all of these cases, the LRN survivors fade below the pre-outburst luminosity of the progenitors in the optical region. However, they remain visible in the near-IR (NIR) and bright in the mid-IR (MIR) domains for years. We recover AT 1997bs in Spitzer images from 2004, and a residual source is visible in HST and JWST NIR images 27 years after the outburst. The spectral energy distribution (SED) of AT 1997bs is consistent with that of an orange giant star with a photospheric temperature of 3750-4250 K and a radius of 120-150 R<sub>&odot;</sub>, without a significant circumstellar dust attenuation. Similarly, the SED of AT 2019zhd after three years is compatible with a red supergiant star with T_ph=3100±100 K and R=350±50 R<sub>&odot;</sub>. Another LRN, AT 2011kp, is detected by JWST 12.5 years after the outburst. Its SED, with two excesses at 1.8 and 7.7 μm, can be explained by a cold (T~450 K) dusty shell composed of amorphous carbon surrounding a cold expanded source, plus emission from the Paα line. We constructed the [3.6]-[4.5] colour curves extending up to more than 7 years for six LRNe, which show a similar evolution: The MIR colour is ~-0.5 mag before the optical maximum light, it becomes bluer after around one year, and then it gradually turns to redder colours before reaching ~+1.0 mag after 7 years. We also estimated the masses and the temperatures of newly formed dust years after the LRN onset. We find that LRNe produce dust masses of the order of (1-5)x10^-4 (and up to 2x10^-3) M<sub>&odot;</sub> between 7 and 13 years after the outbursts. Finally, we find that the remnants of LRNe detected years or decades after the merger are expanded and cool objects, similar to red supergiant stars.

<p>
2MASS J04381486+2611399 (or J0438) is one of the few young brown dwarfs (BD) with a highly inclined (i\!~\!70&deg;) disk. Here we report results from JWST-MIRI MRS, HST-ACS and ALMA Band 7 observations. Despite its late spectral type (M7.25), the spectrum of J0438 resembles those of inner disks around earlier-type stars (K1-M5, T Tauri stars), with a volatile reservoir lacking hydrocarbons (except for acetylene, C_2H<sub>2</sub>) and dominated by water. Other identified species are H<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, HCN, [Ar^+], and [Ne^+]. The dominance of water over hydrocarbons is driven by multiple factors such as disk dynamics, young disk age, low accretion rate and possible inner disk clearing. J0438 appears highly dynamic, showing a seesaw-like variability and extended emission in H<sub>2</sub>     S(1), S(3), S(5), [Ne^+] and CO (J=3-2). Interestingly, the CO emission reaches up to 400 au from the brown dwarf, suggesting ongoing infalling/outflowing activity impacting the disk chemistry. These observations underscore the combined power of MIRI, HST and ALMA in characterizing the chemical diversity and dynamics of brown dwarf disks.

We report the discovery of 13 broad-line AGNs at z = 5 - 8 from the first 10% data of the JWST Cycle 3 Treasury Program COSMOS-3D. These AGNs are identified by their broad Hα or Hβ emission lines through the NIRCam grism wide-field slitless spectroscopy. One object at z = 7.646 with broad Hβ emission has an F444W magnitude of 23.6 mag, making it one of the brightest z &gt; 7.5 broad-line AGNs yet known. Among the 13 AGNs, 10 objects have reddened optical continua with slopes β_opt&gt;0. The remaining three objects have their overall SEDs that resemble those of UV-luminous quasars at similar redshifts, but their β_opt, though negative, are not as blue as those of unobscured quasars. We also obtain MIRI photometry at 7.7-18 μm for two AGNs and place strong constraints on their rest-frame near-IR SED. We find no significant variability in the rest-frame UV by comparing the COSMOS-3D and COSMOS-Web F115W images taken apart by 60 days in the rest-frame. We compute the Hα luminosity functions (LFs) for the broad Hα emitters at z ≈ 5-6 and find a potential redshift evolution when compared with that of the z ≈ 4-5 sample. We also derive the Hβ LF at z~8 for AGNs and galaxies by combining our sample with those from the literature. The broad Hβ emitters in this work suggest a number density two orders of magnitude higher than that predicted by the quasar LF based on rest-frame UV-selected samples. As a preview, our work showcases the ability of the COSMOS-3D grism survey to provide a complete view of the properties, growth, and evolution of bright broad-line AGNs at z&gt;5.

We study the luminosity function (LF) and clustering properties of 888 Hα emitters (HAEs) at 3.75 &lt; z &lt; 6 in the GOODS-N field. The sample, built from JWST CONGRESS and FRESCO NIRCam grism surveys using a novel redshift assignment algorithm, spans ~62 arcmin<sup>2</sup> and reaches L_Hα ~ 10^41.2 erg s<sup>-1</sup>. We identify two prominent filamentary protoclusters at z ≈ 4.41 and z ≈ 5.19, hosting 98 and 144 HAEs, respectively. The observed Hα LFs show similar shallow faint-end slopes for both protocluster and field galaxies at z=3.75-5, and for the protocluster at z=5-6 (α≈ 1.2 to -1.3). In contrast, the field LF at z=5-6 is much steeper (α=-1.87_-0.23^+0.30), suggesting that protocluster galaxies at z &gt; 5 are more evolved, resembling those at z=3.75-5. The observed star formation rate density from Hα, integrated down to 0.45 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1, is 0.050^+0.002_-0.003 and 0.046^+0.006_-0.004 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1 Mpc^-3 at z=3.75-5 and z=5-6, with protoclusters contributing ~25% and 55%, respectively. This implies that a large fraction of star formation at z &gt; 4 occurs in protoclusters. We conduct the first star-formation-rate-limited 3D clustering analysis at z &gt; 4. We find the filamentary protocluster geometry flattens the power-law shape of the HAE auto-correlation functions, with slopes much shallower than typically assumed. The auto-correlation function of field HAEs have correlation lengths of r_0 = 4.61^+1.00_-0.68 h^-1 Mpc at z ≈ 4-5 and r_0 = 6.23^+1.68_-1.13 h^-1 Mpc at z=5-6. Comparing the observed correlation functions with the UniverseMachine simulation, we infer the dark matter (sub-)halo masses of HAEs to be log (M_h/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=11.0-11.2 at z≈ 4-6, with a scatter of 0.4 dex.

### 284) [2504.04683](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04683v2): Probing the Cosmic Reionization History with JWST: Gunn-Peterson and Lyα Damping Wing Absorption at 4.5 &lt; z &lt; 13

<p>
We present a statistical analysis of Lyα absorption using 581 galaxies at z=4.5&ndash;13 observed with multiple JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy programs, including JADES, UNCOVER, CEERS, and GO/DDT. We carefully construct composite spectra binned by redshift with homogeneous UV properties (UV magnitudes, UV slopes, and Lyα equivalent widths) and identify significant Lyα forest signals in galaxies at z~5&ndash;6, which diminish toward higher redshifts. We also find UV continuum breaks at rest-frame 1216 Å that soften beyond z≳6, confirming the effects of cosmic reionization through a self-consistent transition from Gunn-Peterson to Lyα damping wing absorption in galaxies. Fair comparisons of composite spectra with matched UV magnitudes and slopes across redshift reveal that UV-faint galaxies clearly show stronger Lyα absorption than UV-bright galaxies towards high redshift, providing insights into the topological evolution of reionization. We estimate Lyα transmission at the Gunn-Peterson trough and Lyα damping wing absorption by comparing the galaxy spectra to low-z (z~2-5) galaxy templates that include galactic and circumgalactic absorption and Lyα emission. Using these measurements together with reionization simulations, we derive volume average neutral hydrogen fractions of &langle; x_HI &rangle; = 0.00^+0.12_-0.00, 0.25^+0.10_-0.20, 0.65^+0.27_-0.35, 1.00^+0.00_-0.20, and 1.00^+0.00_-0.40 at z~5, 6, 7, 9, and 10, respectively. These values broadly align with a reionization history characterized by a rapid transition around z~7&ndash;8, consistent with Lyα emitter observations. While the physical driver of this rapid reionization remains unclear, it may involve the emergence of hidden AGN populations and/or the onset of Lyman-continuum escape from galaxies.

### 285) [2503.23202](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23202v2): Using Wavelet Decomposition to Determine the Dimension of Structures from Projected Images

<p> Svitlana Mayboroda, David N Spergel </p>
<p>
Mesoscale structures can often be described as fractional dimensional across a wide range of scales. We consider a γ dimensional measure embedded in an N dimensional space and discuss how to determine its dimension, both in N dimensions and projected into D dimensions. It is a highly non-trivial problem to decode the original geometry from lower dimensional projection of a high-dimensional measure. The projections are space-feeling, the popular box-counting techniques do not apply, and the Fourier methods are contaminated by aliasing effects. In the present paper we demonstrate that under the "Copernican hypothesis'' that we are not observing objects from a special direction, projection in a wavelet basis is remarkably simple: the wavelet power spectrum of a projected γ dimensional measure is P_j &prop; 2^-jγ. This holds regardless of the embedded dimension, N, and the projected dimension, D. This approach could have potentially broad applications in data sciences where a typically sparse matrix encodes lower dimensional information embedded in an extremely high dimensional field and often measured in projection to a low dimensional space. Here, we apply this method to JWST and Chandra observations of the nearby supernova Cas A. We find that the emissions can be represented by projections of mesoscale substructures with fractal dimensions varying from γ= 1.7 for the warm CO layer observed by JWST, up to γ= 2.5 for the hot X-ray emitting gas layer in the supernova remnant. The resulting power law indicates that the emission is coming from a fractal dimensional mesoscale structure likely produced by magneto-hydrodynamical instabilities in the expanding supernova shell.

### 286) [2503.12019](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12019v3): Multi-copy Axion Transfer Function and Observational Implications of Effective de Broglie Scales

<p> Jiashuo Zhang, Tom Broadhurst, Jeremy Lim, Paloma Morilla, Sung Kei Li </p>
<p>
Ultra-light axions are viable fuzzy/wave-like dark matter (ψDM) candidates generically predicted by the String Axiverse paradigm with multiple particle copies, whereas most of the discussions/constraints on ψDM from astronomical observations to date are based on the assumption of a single particle copy. Here, we aim to complete this gap by exploring the generic multi-axion scenario motivated in the String Axiverse context, and investigate its astronomical implications in both the linear and nonlinear regimes. In the linear regime, with linear density perturbation analysis, we provide a simplified prescription for obtaining multi-copy axion transfer functions and also identify an "equivalence" among all axion copies owing to the mutual coupling to the gravitational potential. As a result of this 'equivalence', we argue the suppression to LSS is governed by an effective mass m_eff^-2=\sum_i w_i m_i^-2, with \ w_i\ being fractional contributions of different copies to the full cosmic dark matter density. In non-linear regime within galaxy halos, we show that similar notions of effective mass, with expressions provided, to govern the collective wave interference and hence determine the net stellar heating rates and the substructure-induced spread of JWST transients near critical curves. Distinctive to the multi-copy scenario, the effective mass within galaxy halos is generically anticipated to be radially decreasing following the stronger concentration of heavier copies to the galactic center. Such a spatial variation leads to radially increasing spreading scales for micro-lensed transients at different radial positions, a signature that may be tested with future JWST lensing observations.

Pirzkal, G. Yang </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revolutionizing our understanding of the Universe by unveiling faint, near-infrared dropouts previously beyond our reach, ranging from exceptionally dusty sources to galaxies up to redshift z ~ 14. In this paper, we identify F200W-dropout objects in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey which are absent from existing catalogs. Our selection method can effectively identify obscured low-mass (log M_* ≤ 9) objects at z ≤ 6, massive dust-rich sources up to z ~ 12, and ultra-high-redshift (z &gt; 15) candidates. Primarily relying on NIRCam photometry from the latest CEERS data release and supplementing with Mid-Infrared/(sub-)mm data when available, our analysis pipeline combines multiple SED-fitting codes, star formation histories, and CosMix - a novel tool for astronomical stacking. Our work highlights three 2&lt;z&lt;3 dusty dwarf galaxies which have larger masses compared to the typical dusty dwarfs previously identified in CEERS. Additionally, we reveal five faint sources with significant probability of lying above z&gt;15, with best-fit masses compatible with ΛCDM and a standard baryons-to-star conversion efficiency. Their bi-modal redshift probability distributions suggest they could also be z&lt;1.5 dwarf galaxies with extreme dust extinction. We also identify a strong line emitter galaxy at z ~ 5 mimicking the near-infrared emission of a z ~ 13 galaxy. Our sample holds promising candidates for future follow-ups. Confirming ultra high-redshift galaxies or lower-z dusty dwarfs will offer valuable insights into early galaxy formation, evolution with their central black holes and the nature of dark matter, and/or cosmic dust production mechanisms in low-mass galaxies, and will help us to understand degeneracies and contamination in high-z object searches.

### 288) [2501.18559](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18559v2): Variability of the UV luminosity function with SPICE

<p> Arghyadeep Basu, Aniket Bhagwat, Benedetta Ciardi, Tiago Costa </p>
<p>
We investigate the variability of the UV luminosity function (UVLF) at z &gt; 5 using the SPICE suite of cosmological, radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, which include three distinct supernova (SN) feedback models: bursty-sn, smooth-sn, and hyper-sn. The bursty-sn model, driven by intense and episodic SN explosions, produces the highest fluctuations in the star formation rate (SFR). Conversely, the smooth-sn model, characterized by gentler SN feedback, results in minimal SFR variability. The hyper-sn model, featuring a more realistic prescription that incorporates hypernova (HN) explosions, exhibits intermediate variability, closely aligning with the smooth-sn trend at lower redshifts. These fluctuations in SFR significantly affect the M_UV - M_halo relation, a proxy for UVLF variability. Among the models, bursty-sn produces the highest UVLF variability, with a maximum value of 2.5. In contrast, the smooth-sn and hyper-sn models show substantially lower variability, with maximum values of 1.3 and 1.5, respectively. However, in all cases, UVLF variability strongly correlates with host halo mass, with lower-mass halos showing greater variability due to more effective SN feedback in their shallower gravitational wells. The bursty-sn model, though, results in higher amplitudes. Variability decreases in lower mass haloes with decreasing redshift for all feedback models. This study underscores the critical role of SN feedback in shaping the UVLF, and highlights the mass and redshift dependence of its variability, suggesting that UVLF variability may alleviate the bright galaxy tension observed by JWST at high redshifts.

Stellar feedback is an essential step in the baryon cycle of galaxies, but it remains unconstrained beyond Cosmic Noon. We study the ionized gas kinematics, dynamical mass and gas-flow properties of a sample of 16 sub-L^&sext; star-forming galaxies at 4≤ z≤7.6, using high-resolution JWST/NIRSpec observations. The emission lines are resolved, with velocity dispersions (σ_gas ~(km~s<sup>-1</sup>)≃38-96) comparable to more massive galaxies at Cosmic Noon. From σ_gas and the galaxy size (r_e=400-960~pc), we estimate the dynamical mass to be log M_dyn/M<sub>&odot;</sub>=9.25-10.25. Stellar-to-dynamical mass ratios are low (log M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M_dyn\in[-0.5,-2]) and decrease with increasing SFR surface density (Σ_SFR). We estimate the gas surface densities assuming a star-formation law, but the gas masses do not balance the baryon-to-dynamical mass ratios, which would require a decrease in the star-formation efficiency. We find evidence of ionized outflows in five out of the sixteen galaxies, based on the need of broad components to reproduce the emission-line wings. We only observe outflows from galaxies undergoing recent bursts of star formation SFR_10/SFR_100≥1, with elevated Σ_SFR and low M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M_dyn. This links high gas surface densities to increased outflow incidence and lower M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M_dyn. With moderate outflow velocities (v_flow ~(km~s<sup>-1</sup>)=150-250) and mass outflow rates (M&#775;_flow/M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1=0.2-5), these high-redshift galaxies appear more efficient at removing baryons than low-redshift galaxies with similar M<sub>&sext;</sub>, showing mass loading-factors of M&#775;_flow/SFR=0.04-0.4. For their given dynamical mass, the outflow velocities exceed the escape velocities, meaning that they may eventually enrich the Circumgalactic Medium.

In recent years, observations with the JWST have started to map out the rapid metal enrichment of the early Universe, while (sub)millimeter observations have simultaneously begun to reveal the ubiquity of dust beyond z≳6. However, the pathways that led to the assembly of early dust reservoirs remain poorly quantified, and require pushing our understanding of key scaling relations between dust, gas and metals into the early Universe. We investigate the dust build-up in twelve 6.5 ≲ z ≲ 7.7 galaxies drawn from the REBELS survey that benefit from (i) JWST/NIRSpec strong-line metallicity measurements, (ii) ALMA [CII]-based redshifts and gas masses, and (iii) dust masses from single- or multi-band ALMA continuum observations. Combining these measurements, we investigate the dust-to-gas (DtG), dust-to-metal (DtM), and dust-to-stellar mass (DtS) ratios of our sample as a function of metallicity. While our analysis is limited by systematic uncertainties related to the [CII]-to-H<sub>2</sub> conversion factor and dust temperature, we explore a wide range of possible values, and carefully assess their impact on our results. Under a fiducial set of assumptions, we find an average log(DtG) = -3.02 ± 0.23, only slightly below that of local metal-rich galaxies. On the other hand, at fixed metallicity our average log(DtS) = -2.15 ± 0.42 is significantly larger than that of low-redshift galaxies. Finally, through a comparison to various theoretical models of high-redshift dust production, we find that assembling the dust reservoirs in massive galaxies at z≈7 likely requires the combination of rapid supernova enrichment and efficient ISM dust growth.

### 291) [2412.07598](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07598v4): Radiation-driven dusty outflows from early galaxies

<p> Yurina Nakazato, Andrea Ferrara </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered an overabundance of UV-bright (M_UV ≲ -20), massive galaxies at z ≳ 10 in comparison to pre-JWST theoretical predictions. Among the proposed interpretations, such excess has been explained by negligible dust attenuation conditions following radiation-driven outflows launched by young stars when a galaxy goes through a super-Eddington phase. Dust opacity decreases the classical Eddington luminosity by a (boost) factor A, thus favoring the driving of outflows by stellar radiation in compact, initially dusty galaxies. Here, we compute A as a function of the galaxy stellar mass, gas fraction, galaxy size, and metallicity (a total of 8 parameters). We find that the main dependence is on metallicity and, for the fiducial model, A ~ 1800(Z/Z<sub>&odot;</sub>)/(1+N_H/10^23.5  cm<sup>2</sup>). We apply such results to 20 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at z ≳ 10 and evaluate their modified Eddington ratio. We predict that three galaxies are in the outflow phase. Their outflows have relatively low velocities (60 -100  km s<sup>-1</sup>), implying that they are unlikely to escape from the system. For the remaining 17 galaxies that are not currently in the outflow phase, we calculate the past evolution of the modified Eddington ratio from their star formation history. We find that 15 of them experienced an outflow phase prior to observation during which they effectively displaced their dust to larger radii. Thus, dusty outflows driven by stellar radiation appear to contribute to the observed bright UV galaxies at z &gt; 10.

### 292) [2410.01437](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01437v3): AGN &ndash; host galaxy photometric decomposition using a fast, accurate and precise deep learning approach

<p> Berta Margalef-Bentabol, Lingyu Wang, Antonio La Marca, Vicente Rodriguez-Gomez </p>
<p>
Identifying active galactic nuclei (AGN) is extremely important for understanding galaxy evolution and its connection with the assembly of supermassive black holes (SMBH). With the advent of deep and high angular resolution imaging surveys such as those conducted with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), it is now possible to identify galaxies with a central point source out to the very early Universe. In this study, we develop a fast, accurate and precise method to identify galaxies which host AGNs and recover the intrinsic AGN contribution to the observed total light (f_AGN). We trained a deep learning (DL) based method Zoobot to estimate the fractional contribution of a central point source to the total light. Our training sample comprises realistic mock JWST images of simulated galaxies from the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We injected different amounts of the real JWST point spread function (PSF) models to represent galaxies with different levels of f_AGN. We analyse the performance of our method and compare it with results obtained from the traditional light profile fitting tool GALFIT. We find excellent performance of our DL method in recovering the injected AGN fraction f_AGN, both in terms of precision and accuracy. The mean difference between the predicted and true injected f_AGN is -0.002 and the overall root mean square error (RMSE) is 0.013. The relative absolute error (RAE) is 0.076 and the outlier (defined as predictions with RAE &gt;20%) fraction is 6.5%. In comparison, using GALFIT on the same dataset, we achieve a mean difference of -0.02, RMSE of 0.12, RAE of 0.19 and outlier fraction of 19%. We applied our trained DL model to real JWST observations and found that 33% of X-ray-selected AGN and 15% of MIR-selected AGN are also identified as AGN using a cut at f_AGN &gt; 0.1.

<p> Georgios Panagiotis Nikopoulos, Pratika Dayal </p>
<p>
Recent observations by the James Webb Telescope (JWST) have unveiled numerous galaxy candidates between z ~ 9 - 16.5, hinting at an over-abundance of sources at the bright-end of the UV Luminosity Function (UV LF) at z ≳ 11. Complementarily, the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA) has started yielding dust mass estimates at z ~ 5 - 7. In this work, we develop an analytic formalism baselined against the latest ALMA results, jointly exploring the impact of bursty star formation and its associated dust enrichment, on the visibility of early galaxies, while also modelling sources scattered off the main sequence of star formation. We incorporate dust production in type II Supernovae, dust destruction, ejection, growth and sputtering. Our key results are: (i) explaining the UV LF at z ~ 5 - 13 requires an average star formation efficiency that evolves as f_*(z) = 10^0.13z-3.5, with a number of observations exceeding this main sequence by a factor of 10. (ii) The dust enrichment of early systems is driven by dust production in SNII ejecta, while growth and sputtering impact the dust mass by 60&percnt; and 40&percnt; respectively at z ~ 7. (iii) galaxies at z ≳ 9 can retain significant dust, reaching average dust-to-stellar mass ratios of 0.19&percnt; (0.14&percnt;) at z ~ 9 (z ~ 11). Dust attenuation decreases with redshift as dust becomes more dispersed within halos. (iv) observations by ALMA at z ~ 5 and 7 are not representative of the average population that makes up the UV LF.

<p> Danial Langeroodi, Jens Hjorth </p>
<p>
We introduce genesis-metallicity, a gas-phase metallicity measurement python software employing the direct and strong-line methods depending on the available oxygen lines. The non-parametric strong-line estimator is calibrated based on a kernel density estimate in the 4-dimensional space of O2 = [O II]λλ3727,29/Hβ; O3 = [O III]λ5007/Hβ; Hβ equivalent width EW(Hβ); and gas-phase metallicity 12 + log(O/H). We use a calibration sample of 1510 galaxies at 0 &lt; z &lt; 10 with direct-method metallicity measurements, compiled from the JWST/NIRSpec and ground-based observations. In particular, we report 122 new NIRSpec direct-method metallicity measurements at z &gt; 1. We show that the O2, O3, and EW(Hβ) measurements are sufficient for a gas-phase metallicity estimate that is more accurate than 0.09 dex. Our calibration is universal, meaning that its accuracy does not depend on the target redshift. Furthermore, the direct-method module employs a non-parametric T_e(O II) electron temperature estimator based on a kernel density estimate in the 5-dimensional space of O2, O3, EW(Hβ), T_e(O III), and T_e(O II). This T_e(O II) estimator is calibrated based on 1004 spectra with detections of both [O III]λ4363 and [O II]λλ7320,30, notably reporting 20 new NIRSpec detections of the [O II]λλ7320,30 doublet. We make genesis-metallicity and its calibration data publicly available and commit to keeping both up-to-date in light of the incoming data.

Recent JWST observations of very early galaxies, at z ≳ 10, have led to claims that tension exists between the sizes and luminosities of high-redshift galaxies and what is predicted by standard ΛCDM models. Here we use the adaptive mesh refinement code ttEnzo and the N-body smoothed particle hydrodynamics code ttSWIFT to compare (semi-)analytic halo mass functions against the results of direct N-body models at high redshift. In particular, our goal is to investigate the variance between standard halo mass functions derived from (semi-)analytic formulations and N-body calculations and to determine what role any discrepancy may play in driving tensions between observations and theory. We find that the difference between direct N-body calculations and (semi-) analytic halo mass function fits is less than a factor of 2 (at z ~ 10) within the mass range of galaxies currently being observed by JWST, and is therefore not a dominant source of error when comparing theory and observation at high redshift.

We present new results on the rest-frame UV luminosity function (UVLF) and stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratio of bright (M_UV≲-20 mag) spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at z=7-9 derived from the BoRG-JWST survey, a unique data set of NIRSpec prism follow up of HST-selected sources from random-pointing imaging. By selecting galaxies from over 200 independent sight lines, the survey minimizes cosmic variance ensuring a statistically robust sample of the bright-galaxy population during the epoch of reionization. The data is used to constrain, for the first time, the bright end of the UVLF at z=7-9 from spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies over eight independent fields. We find that the bright end of the UVLF is higher than found using imaging over JWST legacy fields, suggesting the latter may be significantly affected by cosmic variance, and thus reducing the tension with recent findings from JWST at z&gt;10 and comparable to models invoking little dust attenuation and bursty star formation. Additionally, we use the galaxies' JWST spectra to infer their stellar masses and M/L ratios relative to other HST and JWST studies. We show that the stellar mass scales almost linearly with UV luminosity (M_* &prop; L_UV^0.85±0.12), albeit with large (~0.5 dex) intrinsic scatter, consistent with stochastic bursts of star formation in early galaxy formation.

### 297) [2407.19481](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19481v2): What can we learn about Reionization astrophysical parameters using Gaussian Process Regression?

<p> Purba Mukherjee, Antara Dey, Supratik Pal </p>
<p>
Reionization is one of the least understood processes in the evolution history of the Universe, mostly because of the numerous astrophysical processes occurring simultaneously about which we do not have a very clear idea so far. In this article, we use the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) method to learn the reionization history and infer the astrophysical parameters. We reconstruct the UV luminosity density function using the HFF and early JWST data. From the reconstructed history of reionization, the global differential brightness temperature fluctuation during this epoch has been computed. We perform MCMC analysis of the global 21-cm signal using the instrumental specifications of SARAS, in combination with Lyman-α ionization fraction data, Planck optical depth measurements and UV luminosity data. Our analysis reveals that GPR can help infer the astrophysical parameters in a model-agnostic way than conventional methods. Additionally, we analyze the 21-cm power spectrum using the reconstructed history of reionization and demonstrate how the future 21-cm mission SKA, in combination with Planck and Lyman-α forest data, improves the bounds on the reionization astrophysical parameters by doing a joint MCMC analysis for the astrophysical parameters plus 6 cosmological parameters for ΛCDM model. The results make the GPR-based reconstruction technique a robust learning process and the inferences on the astrophysical parameters obtained therefrom are quite reliable that can be used for future analysis.

### 298) [2406.11188](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11188v2): Characterizing Dust Extinction and Spatially Resolved Paschen-α Emission within 97 Galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;1.6 with JWST NIRCam Slitless Spectroscopy

<p> Zhaoran Liu, Takahiro Morishita, Tadayuki Kodama </p>

We present results on the Paschen-α (Paα) emitting galaxies observed as part of the JWST FRESCO survey in the GOODS-North and GOODS-South fields. Utilizing the JWST NIRCam wide field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS), we analyze emission line fluxes, star formation rates (SFRs), and spatially resolved flux distributions of 97 Paα emitters at 1&lt;z&lt;1.6. To assess dust extinction within our sample, we combine Paα fluxes with archival Hα data taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3 G141 grism. Our analysis reveals a significant correlation between dust extinction and galaxy stellar mass, where more massive galaxies exhibit greater dust extinction. We employ two-dimensional Paα and F444W mapping to trace the distributions of star formation and stellar mass, respectively. Our observations indicate that lower mass galaxies are almost dust free in Paα and exhibit smaller sizes both in star formation and underlying stellar continuum. In contrast, galaxies with a stellar mass greater than 10^9.5M<sub>&odot;</sub> display diverse dust extinction and star formation patterns. This variation suggests that the structures and properties of massive galaxies evolve through different phases, which involve, e.g., star formation in massive clumps, compaction, and inside-out quenching. This study demonstrates the capabilities of JWST WFSS in conducting systematic investigations of emission line galaxies and highlights the pivotal role of Paα in advancing our understanding of dust extinction and obscured star formation in the early universe.

### 299) [2405.18930](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18930v3): A short review on joint weak and strong cluster lens-mass reconstruction

<p> Ben David Normann, Kenny Solevåg-Hoti, Hans Georg Schaathun </p>
<p>
The distinction between weak and strong lensing is somewhat arbitrary, and both regimes are manifestations of the same physical phenomenon: gravity bending the path of light. Nevertheless, these two regimes have to a large extent been treated separately, since they require different approaches. This review traces the development of methods combining weak-lensing and strong-lensing data for joint lens-mass reconstruction, with a particular emphasis on cluster lenses, where both effects occur. We conclude that so-called inverse methods have been successful in merging the two regimes insofar data analysis is concerned. However, a number of improvements seem to be in place. First, not many studies include weak lensing data beyond shear. In light of the unprecedented quality of the data of JWST and future surveys, this is a clear point of improvement. Especially so since flexion terms have proven useful in determining sub-structures. Second, considering the amount of data available, and the complexity of non-parametric lenses, automating the processes of lens-mass reconstruction would be beneficial. Towards this end, invoking machine learning seems like a promising way forward.

<p>
We present an overview of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), an ambitious program of infrared imaging and spectroscopy in the GOODS-S and GOODS-N deep fields, designed to study galaxy evolution from high redshift to cosmic noon. JADES uses about 770 hours of Cycle 1 guaranteed time largely from the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) instrument teams. In GOODS-S, in and around the Hubble Ultra Deep Field and Chandra Deep Field South, JADES produces a deep imaging region of ~42 arcmin<sup>2</sup> with over 100 hrs of exposure time spread over 9 NIRCam filters, including two medium-band filters. This is extended at medium depth in GOODS-S and GOODS-N with NIRCam imaging of ~167 arcmin<sup>2</sup>, averaging 25 hrs of exposure over 8-10 filters. In both fields, we conduct extensive NIRSpec multi-object spectroscopy, including 2 deep pointings of 55 hrs exposure time, 14 medium pointings of ~12 hrs, and 15 shallower pointings of ~4 hrs, targeting over 5000 HST and JWST-detected faint sources with 5 low, medium, and high-resolution dispersers covering 0.6-5.3 um. Finally, JADES extends redward via coordinated parallels with the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), featuring ~10 arcmin<sup>2</sup> with 43 hours of exposure at 7.7 um and thrice that area with 1.4-6.8 hours of exposure at 12.8 um and 15 um. For nearly 30 years, the GOODS-S and GOODS-N fields have been developed as the premier deep fields on the sky; JADES is now providing a compelling start on the JWST legacy in these fields.
