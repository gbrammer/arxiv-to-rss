### 1) [2504.17254](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17254v1): Efficient simulation of discrete galaxy populations and associated radiation fields during the first billion years

<p> James E. Davies, Andrei Mesinger, Steven Murray </p>
<p>
Understanding the epochs of cosmic dawn and reionisation requires us to leverage multi-wavelength and multi-tracer observations, with each dataset providing a complimentary piece of the puzzle. To interpret such data, we update the public simulation code, 21cmFASTv4, to include a discrete source model based on stochastic sampling of conditional mass functions and semi-empirical galaxy relations. We demonstrate that our new galaxy model, which parametrizes the means and scatters of well-established scaling relations, is flexible enough to characterize very different predictions from hydrodynamic cosmological simulations of high-redshift galaxies. Combining a discrete galaxy population with approximate, efficient radiative transfer allows us to self-consistently forward-model galaxy surveys, line intensity maps (LIMs), and observations of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Not only does each observable probe different scales and physical processes, but cross-correlation will maximise the information gained from each measurement by probing the galaxy-IGM connection at high-redshift. We find that a stochastic source field produces significant shot-noise in 21cm and LIM power spectra. Scatter in galaxy properties can be constrained using UV luminosity functions and/or 21cm power spectra, especially if astrophysical scatter is higher than expected (as might be needed to explain recent JWST observations). Our modelling pipeline is both flexible and computationally efficient, facilitating high-dimensional, multi-tracer, field-level Bayesian inference of cosmology and astrophysics during the first billion years.

### 2) [2504.17208](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17208v1): Kolmogorov analysis of JWST deep survey galaxies

<p> N. Galikyan, A. A. Kocharyan, V. G. Gurzadyan </p>
<p>
JWST galaxy deep spectral surveys provide a unique opportunity to trace a broad range of evolutionary features of galaxies and the intergalactic medium given the huge distance the photons are propagating. We have analyzed the spectral data of JWST galaxies up to a redshift of around 7 using the Kolmogorov technique, which is an efficient tool for testing the tiny comparative randomness properties of cumulative signals, that is, for distinguishing the contributions of regular and stochastic sub-signals. Our aim is to determine if certain identical spectral features of galaxies have undergone any distortions or systematic evolution across a broad range of redshifts. Our results indicate a change in the spectral properties of the sample galaxies at around z ≃ 2.7 at over a 99% confidence level.

<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discovered 79 transients out to z~4.8 through the JADES Transient Survey (JTS), but the JTS did not find any z&gt;5 transients. Here, we present the first photometric evidence of a z&gt;5 transient/variable source with JWST. The source, AT 2023adya, resides in a z<sub>spec</sub>=5.274 galaxy in GOODS-N, which dimmed from m_F356W=26.05±0.02 mag to 26.24±0.02 mag in the rest-frame optical over approximately two rest-frame months, producing a clear residual signal in the difference image (m_F356W=28.01±0.17 mag; SN_var=6.09) at the galaxy center. Shorter-wavelength bands (F090W/F115W) show no rest-frame ultraviolet brightness change. Based on its rest-frame V-band absolute magnitude of M_V=-18.48 mag, AT 2023adya could be any core-collapse supernova (SN) subtype or an SN Ia. However, due to low SN Ia rates at high redshift, the SN Ia scenario is unlikely. Alternatively, AT 2023adya may be a variable active galactic nucleus (AGN). However, the JWST NIRCam/Grism spectrum shows no broad H&alpha; emission line (FWHM=130±26 km s<sup>-1</sup>), disfavoring the variable AGN scenario. It is also unlikely that AT 2023adya is a tidal disruption event (TDE) because the TDE models matching the observed brightness changes have low event rates. Although it is not possible to determine AT 2023adya's nature based on the two-epoch single-band photometry alone, this discovery indicates that JWST can push the frontier of transient/variable science past z=5 and towards the epoch of reionization.

### 4) [2504.15381](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15381v1): Traversing the Star-Forming Main Sequence with Molecular Gas Stacks of z~1.6 Cluster Galaxies

<p>
The cluster environment has been shown to affect the molecular gas content of cluster members, yet a complete understanding of this often subtle effect has been hindered due to a lack of detections over the full parameter space of galaxy star formation rates and stellar masses. Here we stack CO(2-1) spectra of z~1.6 cluster galaxies to explore the average molecular gas fractions of galaxies both at lower mass (log(M/solar mass)~9.6) and further below the Star Forming Main Sequence (SFMS; DeltaMS~ -0.9) than other literature studies; this translates to a 3sigma gas mass limit of ~7x10^9 solar masses for stacked galaxies below the SFMS. We divide our sample of 54 z~1.6 cluster galaxies, derived from the Spitzer Adaptation of the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey, into 9 groupings, for which we recover detections in 8. The average gas content of the full cluster galaxy population is similar to coeval field galaxies matched in stellar mass and star formation rate. However, when further split by CO-undetected and CO-detected, we find that galaxies below the SFMS have statistically different gas fractions from the field scaling relations, spanning deficiencies to enhancements from 2sigma below to 3sigma above the expected field gas fractions, respectively. These differences between z=1.6 cluster and field galaxies below the SFMS are likely due to environmental processes, though further investigation of spatially-resolved properties and more robust field scaling relation calibration in this parameter space are required.

### 5) [2504.15357](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15357v1): ALMA reveals bright circumgalactic emission and a biconical outflow in z~6.4 quasar PSOJ183+05

<p> Manuela Bischetti, Chiara Feruglio, Stefano Carniani, Valentina D'Odorico, Francesco Salvestrini, Fabrizio Fiore </p>
<p>
Understanding gas flows between galaxies and their surrounding circum-galactic medium (CGM) is crucial to unveil the mechanisms regulating galaxy evolution, especially in the early Universe. However, observations of the CGM around massive galaxies at z&gt;6 remain limited, particularly in the cold gas phase. In this work, we present multi-configuration ALMA observations of [CII]&lambda;158,&mu;m and millimetre continuum emission in the z~6.4 quasar PSOJ183+05, to trace the cold CGM and investigate the presence of outflows. We find clumpy [CII] emission, tracing gas up to a ~6 kpc radius, consistent with the interface region between the interstellar medium (ISM) and CGM. The [CII] kinematics shows a rotating disk and a high-velocity, biconical outflow extending up to 5 kpc. The inferred mass outflow rate is ~930 MSun/yr, among the highest at z&gt;6, and comparable to the star-formation rate. These findings suggest that quasar-driven outflows can rapidly transfer energy and momentum to the CGM, without immediately quenching star formation in the host galaxy ISM. This supports a delayed feedback scenario, in which outflows reshape CGM conditions and regulate future gas accretion over longer timescales. Combining high-resolution and sensitive ALMA data with observations from JWST and MUSE will be crucial to map the CGM across its different phases and build a comprehensive picture of the baryon cycle in the first massive galaxies.

### 6) [2504.15346](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15346v1): Big, Dusty Galaxies in Blue Jay: Insights into the Relationship Between Morphology and Dust Attenuation at Cosmic Noon

<p>
The dust attenuation of galaxies is highly diverse and closely linked to stellar population properties and the star dust geometry, yet its relationship to galaxy morphology remains poorly understood. We present a study of 141 galaxies (9&lt;log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;11.5) at 1.7&lt;z&lt;3.5 from the Blue Jay survey combining deep JWST/NIRCam imaging and R~1000 JWST/NIRSpec spectra. Using ttProspector to perform a joint analysis of these data with non-parametric star-formation histories and a two-component dust model with flexible attenuation laws, we constrain stellar and nebular properties. We find that the shape and strength of the attenuation law vary systematically with optical dust attenuation (A_V), stellar mass, and star formation rate (SFR). A_V correlates strongly with stellar mass for starbursts, star-forming galaxies and quiescent galaxies. The inclusion of morphological information tightens these correlations: attenuation correlates more strongly with stellar mass and SFR surface densities than with the global quantities. The Balmer decrement-derived nebular attenuation for 67 of these galaxies shows consistent trends with the stellar continuum attenuation. We detect a wavelength-dependent size gradient: massive galaxies (M<sub>&sext;</sub>≳ 10^10~M<sub>&odot;</sub>) appear ~30&percnt; larger in the rest-optical than in the rest-NIR, driven by central dust attenuation that flattens optical light profiles. Lower-mass systems exhibit more diverse size ratios, consistent with either inside-out growth or central starbursts. These results demonstrate that dust attenuation significantly alters observed galaxy structure and highlight the necessity of flexible attenuation models for accurate physical and morphological inference at cosmic noon.

### 7) [2504.15255](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15255v1): Population Models for Star Formation Timescales in Early Galaxies: The First Step Towards Solving Outshining in Star Formation History Inference

<p>
JWST have revealed temporarily-quenched and ultraviolet-luminous galaxies in the early universe, suggesting enhanced star formation stochasticity. Verifying this hypothesis is critical, yet challenging; outshining, wherein light from young stars dominates the spectral energy distribution, represents perhaps the greatest challenge in inferring the formation histories of unresolved galaxies. In this paper, we take a simple model of burstiness and show that state-of-the-art inference methods with flexible star formation histories (SFHs) and neutral priors, while recovering average star formation rates (SFRs; ~0.1 dex median offset), fail to recover the complexities of fluctuations on tens of Myr timescales, and typically underestimate masses in bursty systems (~0.15 dex). Surprisingly, detailed SFH recovery is still sensitive to priors even when data quality is optimal, e.g., including high signal-to-noise (20~pixel^-1) spectroscopy with wide coverage (rest-frame 0.12-1.06~&mu;m). Crucially, however, refitting the same data with a prior correctly encoding the bursty expectation eliminates these biases: median offsets in mass and SFRs decrease to ~ 0.04 dex and ~ 0.05 dex, respectively. Under the assumption that current population burstiness predicts past SFH, the solution to outshining in modeling statistical samples is empirically measuring recent galaxy SFHs with population modeling. A prototype is H&alpha;/UV: while helpful, it is insufficient to constrain the expected complex burstiness. To this end, we introduce a more complete, quantitative population-level approach and demonstrate that it promises to recover the typical amplitude, timescale, and slope of the recent SFH to high accuracy. This approach thus has the strong potential to solve outshining using observations from JWST.

### 8) [2504.14682](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14682v1): Extreme Neutral Outflow in an Inactive Quenching Galaxy at z~1.3

<p>
We have discovered a substantial sodium doublet (Na D &lambda;&lambda;5890, 5896&#8491;)-traced neutral outflow in a quenching galaxy JADES-GS-206183 at z=1.317 in GOODS-S field. Its JWST NIRSpec/MSA spectrum shows a significantly blueshifted and deep Na D absorption, revealing a neutral outflow with a velocity of v_out=828^+79_-49 km s<sup>-1</sup> and a mass outflow rate of log(M&#775;_out/M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1)=2.40^+0.11_-0.16. The mass outflow rate of this outflow is higher than any of the neutral outflows identified previously beyond z~1 by the same line diagnostic and is comparable with those in local galaxies with extremely strong star formation activities or luminous AGN. Nonetheless, the best-fit SED modeling of JADES-GS-206183, based on its multi-band photometry from HST/ACS to JWST/NIRCam, suggests that the host galaxy now is quenched, and the Paschen &alpha; (Pa&alpha;) emission in the FRESCO NIRCam grism spectrum confirms its current low star formation rate (10.78± 0.55 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1). More surprisingly, optical line ratio diagnostics indicate that the current AGN activity of JADES-GS-206183, if present, is weak. Even though we tentatively detect a broad component of the H&alpha; line, it is more likely tracing the ionized outflow than an AGN. The results demonstrate that the Na D outflow in JADES-GS-206183 is highly unlikely to be driven by current star formation or nuclear activity. Instead, we propose that the outflow that we are witnessing in JADES-GS-206183 may be a long-lasting fossil outflow, powered by previous AGN activity that has recently shut down.

### 9) [2504.14592](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14592v1): The fate of the progenitors of Luminous Red Novae: Infrared detection of LRNe years after the outburst

<p> A. Reguitti, A. Pastorello, G. Valerin </p>
<p>
We present late-time optical and infrared (IR) observations of a sample of nine extragalactic Luminous Red Novae (LRNe) discovered in the last three decades. In all these cases, the LRN survivors fade below the pre-outburst luminosity of the progenitors in the optical region. Instead, they remain visible in the near-IR (NIR), and bright in the mid-IR (MIR) domains for years. We recover AT 1997bs in Spitzer images from 2004, and a residual source is visible in HST and JWST NIR images 27 years after the outburst. Its spectral energy distribution (SED) is consistent with that of a red supergiant star with a photospheric temperature of 3200 K and a radius of 220 R<sub>&odot;</sub>, without a significant circumstellar dust attenuation, as the source is not detected at 4.5 &mu;m. Another LRN, AT 2011kp, is detected by JWST 12.5 years after the outburst. From its SED, we find evidence for three black-body components: a warm/hot stellar component, a colder component from cool dust at 425 K, emitting between 3 and 6 &mu;m, and a third even colder component responsible for the excess at 8 &mu;m, possibly due to an IR echo. We construct the [3.6]-[4.5] colour curves extending up to +7 years for six LRNe, which show a similar evolution: the MIR colour is ~0 before the optical maximum light, it becomes bluer (~-0.5 mag) at around +1 year, then it gradually turns to redder colours (~+0.5 mag) in the following years, before reaching [3.6]-[4.5]~+1.5 mag 7 years after the outburst. Finally, we also estimate the masses and the temperatures of newly-formed dust years after the LRN onset for different chemical compositions (silicates or graphite) and grain sizes (0.1 or 1.0 &mu;m). We find that LRNe produce dust masses of the order of (0.1-30)×10^-6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> between 3.6 and 13 years after the outbursts, with temperatures in the range from 350 to 770 K.

### 10) [2504.13664](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13664v1): Clump-fed black hole growth in the first billion years of the universe

<p> Manish Kataria, Kanak Saha, Bruce Elmegreen </p>
<p>
Understanding how supermassive black holes (SMBHs) form in the early universe is one of the most challenging problems in astrophysics. Their high abundance in the first billion years, as observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, hints towards black hole seeds that accrete mass rapidly. The origin of this accreted mass is not known. Here, we consider a billion solar mass clumpy galaxy at z=5.48 with a 30 million solar mass black hole in the center. We show that the clumps should migrate to the central region because of torques from dynamical friction with the halo, funneling in at least 14 solar masses per year. This is fast enough to grow the observed SMBH, with only 1% of the accreted mass getting in and the rest going to a bulge. Clump-fed accretion could explain most young SMBHs because young galaxies are highly irregular with massive star-forming clumps.

Robertson, Marko Shuntov, Matthew R. Siebert, Sune Toft, Thomas Wevers, Yossef Zenati </p>
<p>
The rates and properties of tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide valuable insights into their host galaxy central stellar densities and the demographics of their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). TDEs have been observed only at low redshifts (z ≲ 1), due to the difficulty in conducting deep time-domain surveys. In this work, we present the discovery of a high-redshift TDE candidate, HZTDE-1, in the COSMOS-Web survey with JWST's NIRCam, using a novel selection technique based on color and morphology. We first outline a methodology for identifying high-z TDEs in deep infrared imaging surveys, leveraging their unique spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and morphologies of these transients. We apply this technique to COSMOS-Web in filters F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W, and identify HZTDE-1, a transient point source relative to archival UltraVISTA infrared observations. If we assume it is a TDE, we estimate its photometric redshift to be z=5.02^+1.32_-1.11. HZTDE-1 cannot be explained by reasonable supernova or AGN models. However, we cannot rule out a superluminous supernova at z≳3. If confirmed with follow-up observations, HZTDE-1 would represent the highest-redshift TDE discovery to date, and would suggest an enhancement of the TDE rate in the high-redshift universe. Our method, which can be applied to future deep surveys with JWST and Roman, offers a pathway to identify TDEs at z&gt;4 and probe black hole demographics at early cosmic times.

Aims: This paper investigates the coevolution of metals and dust for 173 galaxies at 4.0&lt;z&lt;11.4 observed with JWST/NIRSpec in the CEERS project. We focus on galaxies with extremely low dust attenuation to understand the physical mechanisms at play. Methods: We developed a new version of the ttCIGALE code that integrates spectroscopic and photometric data. By statistically comparing observations with modeled spectra, we derive physical parameters to constrain these mechanisms. Results: Our analysis reveals a population of 49 extremely low dust attenuation galaxies (GELDAs), consistent with A_FUV = 0.0 within 2&sigma; and M<sub>&sext;</sub> &lt; 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. The stacked spectrum of GELDAs shows a very blue UV slope &beta;_FUV = -2.451 ± 0.066 and a Balmer decrement H&alpha;/H&beta; = 2.932 ± 0.660, consistent with no dust and Case B recombination with minimal underlying absorption. Notably, GELDAs are more prevalent at z &gt; 8.8 (83.3&percnt;) than at lower redshifts (26.3&percnt;), suggesting they could dominate in the early Universe. Using a far-infrared dust spectrum from the ALPINE sample, we study M_dust vs. M<sub>&sext;</sub> trends. These exhibit upper and lower sequences connected by transitional galaxies. Our comparison with models indicates a critical transition around M<sub>&sext;</sub> ≈ 10^8.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, from dust dominated by stellar sources (SNe and AGB stars) to dust growth via gas accretion. This corresponds to a metallicity of 12 + log_10(O/H) = 7.60 (Z/Z<sub>&odot;</sub> ≈ 0.1), aligning with the point where ISM dust growth matches stellar dust production. The sample has a high gas fraction (f_gas ≳ 0.9), with no significant gas expulsion, and high surface gas densities. This leads to low star formation efficiencies compared to sub-millimeter galaxies. GELDAs may help explain the observed excess of bright galaxies at z ≳ 9.

We present the first results from the CAPERS survey, utilizing PRISM observations with the JWST/NIRSpec MSA in the PRIMER-UDS field. With just 14 % of the total planned data volume, we spectroscopically confirm two new bright galaxies (M_UV~ -20.4) at redshifts z = 10.562±0.034 and z = 11.013±0.028. We examine their physical properties, morphologies, and star formation histories, finding evidence for recent bursting star formation in at least one galaxy thanks to the detection of strong (EW_0~70 A) H&gamma; emission. Combining our findings with previous studies of similarly bright objects at high-z, we further assess the role of stochastic star formation processes in shaping early galaxy populations. Our analysis finds that the majority of bright (M_UV≲ -20) spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at z&gt;10 were likely observed during a starburst episode, characterized by a median SFR_10/SFR_100~2, although with substantial scatter. Our work also finds tentative evidence that z&gt;10 galaxies are more preferentially in a bursting phase than similarly bright z~6 galaxies. We finally discuss the prospects of deeper spectroscopic observations of a statistically significant number of bright galaxies to quantify the true impact of bursting star formation on the evolution of the bright end of the ultraviolet luminosity function at these early epochs.

Approximately half of all disc galaxies exhibit appreciable warps in both their stellar and HI discs. The typical warp amplitude is small (a few degrees), and only becomes noticeable at the periphery of the galaxy disc. As a result, warps remain a relatively poorly studied phenomenon. In this study, we investigate a large sample of distant edge-on galaxies (approximately 1,000 objects) in order to examine the frequency and characteristics of stellar disc warps up to a redshift of z ~ 2. For the selected galaxies, we utilize HST data from the Cosmic Evolution Survey field and JWST observations from the Cosmic Dawn Center Archive. We measured the properties of disc warps and investigate their evolution as a function of redshift. Our results indicate a potential evolution in the observed frequency of strong S-shaped warps (with an amplitude greater than 4&deg;) in stellar discs as a function of redshift. At z ≈ 2, the frequency of strong warps reaches approximately 50%, while at z ≈ 0, this fraction decreases to around 10-15%. We attribute the observed evolution in the occurrence of strong warps to the changing frequency of galaxy interactions and mergers. If galaxy interactions represent one of the primary mechanisms responsible for the formation of warps, then the prevalence of vertical disc deformations should increase in tandem with the rising interaction and merger rate.

### 15) [2504.12378](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12378v1): Unveiling the trends between dust attenuation and galaxy properties at z ~ 2-12 with JWST

<p>
A variety of dust attenuation/extinction curves have been observed in high-redshift galaxies, with mixed results regarding their correlations with global galaxy properties. These variations are likely driven by factors such as intrinsic dust properties, total dust content, and the dust-star geometry. In this work, we explore how the shape of dust attenuation curves-quantified by the UV-optical slope (S) and UV bump strength (B)-correlates with galaxy properties. Our goal is to identify the key physical mechanisms shaping attenuation curves through cosmic time. We build on arXiv:2402.05996, analyzing 173 dusty galaxies at z ~ 2-11.5, with attenuation curves inferred via SED fitting of JWST data using a modified version of BAGPIPES (arXiv:2304.11178). We investigate trends between S, B, and properties inferred from SED fitting: AV, SFR, stellar mass (M<sub>&sext;</sub>), specific SFR (sSFR), mass-weighted stellar age (a*), ionization parameter (U), and metallicity (Z). For a subset, we also consider oxygen abundance (12 + log(O/H)), derived via Te-based methods. We find that lower AV galaxies tend to have steeper slopes and stronger UV bumps, consistent with radiative transfer predictions involving dust geometry and content. S also correlates with a* and sSFR, suggesting that strong radiation fields in young, bursty galaxies may destroy small grains, flattening the slope. B correlates with 12 + log(O/H), possibly due to metallicity-driven dust composition changes. Overall, attenuation curve shapes appear most strongly linked to: (1) redshift (dust evolution), (2) AV (RT effects), (3) a* or sSFR (radiation field), and (4) oxygen abundance (dust composition). Disentangling these effects requires spatially resolved data and theoretical models including dust evolution.

### 16) [2504.11898](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11898v1): Anharmonic infrared spectra of cationic pyrene and superhydrogenated derivatives

<p> Zeyuan Tang, Frederik G. Doktor, Rijutha Jaganathan, Julianna Palotás, Jos Oomens, Liv Hornekær, Bjørk Hammer </p>
<p>
Studying the anharmonicity in the infrared (IR) spectra of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at elevated temperatures is important to understand vibrational features and chemical properties of interstellar dust, especially in the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) era. We take pyrene as an example PAH and investigate how different degrees of superhydrogenation affects the applicability of the harmonic approximation and the role of temperature in IR spectra of PAHs. This is achieved by comparing theoretical IR spectra generated by classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and experimental IR spectra obtained via gas-phase action spectroscopy which utilizes the Infrared Multiple Photon Dissociation (IRMPD). All simulations are accelerated by a machine learning interatomic potential, in order to reach first principle accuracies while keeping low computational costs. We have found that the harmonic approximation with empirical scaling factors is able to reproduce experimental band profile of pristine and partially superhydrogenated pyrene cations. However, a MD-based anharmonic treatment is mandatory in the case of fully superhydrogenated pyrene cation for matching theory and experiment. In addition, band shifts and broadenings as the temperature increases are investigated in detail. Those findings may aid in the interpretation of JWST observations on the variations in band positions and widths of interstellar dust.

### 17) [2504.11595](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11595v1): Dark Matter Genesis

<p> Jeremy Mould </p>
<p>
Recent discoveries of primordial black hole (PBH) candidates by means of high cadence microlensing open the way to a physical understanding of the formation of dark matter as a chapter in the thermal history of the Universe. Two complementary sites of PBH formation are considered, inflation and the early Universe at TeV to MeV energies. In the latter case the Friedman equation, together with the measurement of the mass of the PBH, reveal the threshold energy, the mass spectrum and the likely end point of this epoch. Some of the many recent exoplanet detections may conceivably have been detections of PBHs. When the Universe cools to MeV temperatures, larger mass PBH would form similarly, reaching the supermassive regime. The discovery of numerous supermassive black holes (SMBH) at high redshift with JWST fulfils this expectation. We corroborate the idea that Planck mass relics could be an important component of dark matter, and find that these are formed by PBH with initial mass less than approximately 6 x 10^-16 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and cosmic temperature above 10^9 GeV. Although in some mass ranges PBH can only make up a modest fraction of &Omega;matter, it is possible that all astrophysical dark matter, as distinct from axions and WIMPs, is of PBH origin.

### 18) [2504.11566](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11566v1): Tracking the assembly of supermassive black holes: a comparison of diverse models across cosmic time

<p>
Galaxies grow alongside their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs), linked through fueling and feedback. However, the origins and details of this co-evolution remain unclear and differ significantly amongst modeling frameworks. Using a suite of semi-analytic models (SAMs), we trace SMBH mass assembly across M_BH ~ 10^6-10, M<sub>&odot;</sub>. We find significant discrepancies between observations and physics-based models of the local black hole mass function (BHMF), likely due to differences in the underlying stellar mass function and the scaling relations therefrom used to infer the BHMF. However, most physics-based models agree at z ~ 1-4 and align reasonably well with broad-line AGN BHMF from JWST observations at z=4-5. Most physics-based models reproduce the bolometric AGN luminosity evolution, except \sc Dark Sage, which predicts an excess deviating from models and observations. Interestingly, this pronounced "knee' in the bolometric AGN luminosity function predicted by \sc Dark Sage around L_bol ~ 10^46   erg   s<sup>-1</sup> is consistent with the inferred luminosity of "Little Red Dots'' at z=5-6, assuming that their entire emission originates from AGN activity. We analyze black hole mass build-up and accretion histories in \sc Dark Sage, which, unlike other models, allows for super-Eddington accretion. We report that on average, SMBHs in \sc Dark Sage primarily grow through secular disk instabilities and merger-driven cold gas accretion, while black hole mergers contribute 60&percnt; of the total mass budget only for the most massive SMBHs by z=0.

### 19) [2504.11531](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11531v1): Oxyster: A Circumgalactic Low-ionization Oxygen Nebula next to a Starburst Galaxy at z~1

<p> Pengjun Lu, Mingyu Li, Dalya Baron, Minghao Yue, Song Huang, Zheng Cai </p>
<p>
Extended emission line nebulae around galaxies or active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide a unique window to investigate the galactic ecosystem through the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Using Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam narrow-band imaging and spectroscopic follow-up, we serendipitously discover "Oxyster" - a large ionized nebula next to an interacting starburst galaxy at z=0.924. The nebula is traced by extended [OII]3726,3729 (~ 30 kpc) and [OIII]5007 (~ 20 kpc) emission lines. On the nebula luminosity-size plane, Oxyster surpasses the extended narrow-line regions around low-z AGNs, resembling a higher-z analog of "Hanny's Voorwerp". However, its uniformly low [OIII]/[OII] ratio (O32) sets it apart from typical AGN light echoes. For the host galaxy, HST and JWST images reveal a disturbed red disk galaxy with a single blue spiral "arm". Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting suggests the 2-6× 10^10 ~M<sub>&odot;</sub> host galaxy sits above the star-forming main sequence with an ongoing starburst, especially in the "arm", and have &lt;5&percnt; luminosity contribution from AGN, consistent with X-ray non-detection and radio continuum. Standard photoionization and shock models struggle to explain simultaneously Oxyster's emission line luminosities, low O32 ratio, and the non-detection of H&beta; line. A plausible explanation could involve the combination of a recent (&lt;10^8 yrs) starburst and a low-luminosity AGN (L_bol ~ 1×10^42 erg/s). While Oxyster's nature awaits future investigation, its discovery highlights the potential of ground-based narrow-band imaging to uncover extended emission line nebulae around non-AGN systems, opening new avenues for studying the CGM of normal galaxies in the early Universe.

<p>
2MASS J04381486+2611399 (or J0438) is one of the few young brown dwarfs (BD) with a highly inclined (i\!~\!70&deg;) disk. Here we report results from JWST-MIRI MRS, HST-ACS and ALMA Band 7 observations. Despite its late spectral type (M7.25), the spectrum of J0438 resembles those of inner disks around earlier-type stars (K1-M5, T Tauri stars), with a volatile reservoir lacking hydrocarbons (except for acetylene, C_2H<sub>2</sub>) and dominated by water. Other identified species are H<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, HCN, [Ar^+], and [Ne^+]. The dominance of water over hydrocarbons is driven by multiple factors such as disk dynamics, young disk age, low accretion rate and possible inner disk clearing. J0438 appears highly dynamic, showing a seesaw-like variability and extended emission in H<sub>2</sub>     S(1), S(3), S(5), [Ne^+] and CO (J=3-2). Interestingly, the CO emission reaches up to 400 au from the brown dwarf, suggesting ongoing infalling/outflowing activity impacting the disk chemistry. These observations underscore the combined power of JWST, HST and ALMA in characterizing the chemical diversity and dynamics of brown dwarf disks.

### 21) [2504.10731](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10731v1): Unveiling faint X-ray AGN populations in the NewAthena era: Insights from cosmological simulations

<p> Nuno Covas, Israel Matute, Stergios Amarantidis, José Afonso, Giorgio Lanzuisi, Andrea Comastri, Stefano Marchesi, Ciro Pappalardo, Rodrigo Carvajal, Polychronis Papaderos </p>
<p>
Recent observations expanded our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, yet key challenges persist in the X-ray regime, crucial for studying Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). These limitations drive the development of next-generation observatories such as ESA's NewAthena. Now in phase B (preliminary design), the mission requires extensive testing to ensure compliance with its scientific goals, particularly given the uncertainties surrounding high redshift AGN. This work leverages the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation to build an X-ray AGN mock catalogue and assess the performance of NewAthena's WFI. We created a Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH) light cone, spanning 10 deg2, with corrections to account for the limited resolution of the simulation and X-ray properties derived in post-processing. The resulting catalogue reveals a 5* overabundance of faint AGN compared to current X-ray constraints, an inconsistency potentially resolved by invoking a higher Compton-thick (CTK) fraction and intrinsic X-ray weakness, as suggested by recent JWST findings. An end-to-end survey simulation using SIXTE predicts 250000 AGN detections, including 20,000 at z &gt; 3 and 35 in the Epoch of Reionization (z &gt; 6); notably, only AGN with LX &gt; 43.5 erg/s are detectable at z &gt; 6. The analysis also forecasts a significant population of detectable CTK AGN, even beyond z &gt; 4. These findings suggest X-ray observations will, for the first time, probe a significant AGN population in the EoR, offering new insights into SMBH growth. They also provide key input for refining NewAthena's mission design and optimizing its survey strategy.

### 22) [2504.10581](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10581v1): Massive Black Hole Seed Formation in Strong X-ray Environments at High Redshift

<p> Kazutaka Kimura, Kohei Inayoshi, Kazuyuki Omukai </p>
<p>
Direct collapse of pristine gas in early galaxies is a promissing pathway for forming supermassive black holes (BHs) powering active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at the epoch of reionization (EoR). This seeding mechanism requires suppression of molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) cooling during primordial star formation via intense far-ultraviolet radiation from nearby starburst galaxies clustered in overdense regions. However, non-detection of 21 cm signals from the EoR reported by the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) experiment suggests that such galaxies may also emit X-rays more efficiently than in the local universe, promoting H<sub>2</sub> production and thereby potentially quenching massive BH seed formation. In this study, we examine the thermal and chemical evolution of collapsing gas in dark matter halos using a semi-analytic model incorporating observationally calibrated X-ray intensities. We find that strong X-ray irradiation, as suggested by HERA, significantly suppresses direct collapse and leads most halos to experience H<sub>2</sub> cooling. Nevertheless, massive BH seeds with M_BH ≳ 10^4~M<sub>&odot;</sub> still form by z≃ 15, particularly in regions with baryonic streaming motion, and their abundance reaches ~ 10^-4~Mpc^-3 sufficient to explain the SMBHs identified by JWST spectroscopy at 3&lt;z&lt;6. While the formation of highly overmassive BHs with masses comparable to their host galaxies is prohibited by X-ray ionization, our model predicts that BH-to-stellar mass ratios of ≃ 0.01-0.1 were already established at seeding.

### 23) [2504.10572](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10572v1): The Structure and Formation Histories of Low-Mass Quiescent Galaxies in the Abell 2744 Cluster Environment

Suess, Bingjie Wang </p>
<p>
Low-mass quiescent galaxies are thought to predominantly reside in overdense regions, as environmental effects are often invoked to explain their shutdown of star formation. These longer-timescale quenching mechanisms - such as interactions with hot gas in the intracluster medium and dynamical encounters with other cluster galaxies - leave imprints on galaxy morphologies, emphasizing the importance of quantifying the structures of low-mass quiescent galaxies in galaxy clusters at z&lt;0.5. Using spectrophotometric data from the UNCOVER and MegaScience programs, we present the first measurement of the quiescent size-mass relation between 7&lt;log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;10 using JWST imaging, based on a sample of 1100 galaxies in the z=0.308 Abell 2744 galaxy cluster. The resulting size-mass relation is systematically larger and flatter than samples of dwarf galaxies in less-rich environments (low-mass clusters and groups), and has a higher scatter than similar-redshift field samples. Both "progenitor bias," where larger, diskier low-mass galaxies enter the cluster at later epochs, and a general expansion of galaxy structure from dynamical interactions could be at play. This evolutionary framework is further supported by the tentative evidence that older low-mass quiescent galaxies in the cluster are more spheroidal. The star-formation histories derived for our cluster sample imply their formation and quenching occurs relatively late, at z&lt;1.5. In this scenario, the progenitor population would have disky axis-ratio distributions at cosmic noon, in agreement with recent observations. While this leaves ample time for dynamical interactions to maintain quiescence and drive the observed subsequent morphological evolution post-quenching, the data disfavors an onset of quenching due to the environment.

### 24) [2504.09725](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09725v1): Rapid and Late Cosmic Reionization Driven by Massive Galaxies: a Joint Analysis of Constraints from 21-cm, Lyman Line & CMB Data Sets

<p>
Observations of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) have the potential to answer long-standing questions of astrophysical interest regarding the nature of the first luminous sources and their effects on the intergalactic medium (IGM). We present astrophysical constraints from a Neural Density Estimation-Accelerated Bayesian joint analysis of constraints deriving from Cosmic Microwave Background power spectrum measurements from Planck and SPT, IGM neutral fraction measurements from Lyman-line-based data sets and 21-cm power spectrum upper limits from HERA, LOFAR and the MWA. In the context of the model employed, the data is found to be consistent with galaxies forming from predominantly atomic-cooled hydrogen gas in dark matter halos, with masses M_min ≳ 2.6 × 10^9~M<sub>&odot;</sub> ((1+z)/10)^\frac1 2 at 95% credibility (V_c ≳ 50~km~s<sup>-1</sup>) being the dominant galactic population driving reionization. These galaxies reionize the neutral hydrogen in the IGM over a narrow redshift interval (&Delta; z_re &lt; 1.8 at 95% credibility), with the midpoint of reionization (when the sky-averaged IGM neutral fraction is 50%) constrained to z_50 = 7.16^+0.15_-0.12. Given the parameter posteriors from our joint analysis, we find that the posterior predictive distribution of the global 21-cm signal is reduced in amplitude and shifted to lower redshifts relative to the model prior. We caution, however, that our inferences are model-dependent. Future work incorporating updated, mass-dependent star formation efficiencies in atomic cooling halos, informed by the latest UV luminosity function constraints from the James Webb Space Telescope, promises to refine these inferences further and enhance our understanding of cosmic reionization.

Distance ladders which calibrate the luminosity of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) currently provide the strongest constraints on the local value of H0. Recent studies from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) show good consistency between measurements of SNe Ia host distances. These are calibrated to NGC 4258 using different primary distance indicators (Cepheids, Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB), J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch, and Miras). However, some sub-samples of calibrated SNe Ia employed to measure H0 yield noteworthy differences due to small sample statistics but also due to differences in sample selection. This issue is particularly important for TRGB-derived calibrations owing to the smaller volume they reach compared to Cepheids, reducing sample size and enhancing the size of statistical fluctuations. To mitigate this issue, we compile the largest and complete (as currently available) sample of HST or JWST measurements of the TRGB in the hosts of normal SNe Ia for a total of N=35, 50% larger than the previous largest. Most are present in the literature, and we compile multiple measures when available. We also add 5 SNe Ia hosts from the HST archive not previously published. The full sample together with the Pantheon+ SN catalog gives H0=72.1-73.3 +/- 1.8 km/s/Mpc (depending on methodology), in good agreement with the value of 72.5 +/- 1.5 km/s/Mpc from HST Cepheids in hosts of 42 SNe Ia calibrated by the same anchor, NGC 4258. We trace the difference in the result of H0=70.4 +/- 1.9 km/s/Mpc from Freedman et al. 2025 to 11 hosts not selected for that CCHP compilation (of N=24) which alone yield H0=74.1 km/s/Mpc, 2&sigma; higher than the selected sample. A smaller increase of 0.6 km/s/Mpc comes from a commonly employed correction for peculiar velocities.

### 26) [2504.08879](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08879v1): Is Earendel a Star?: Investigating the Sunrise Arc Using JWST Strong and Weak Gravitational Lensing Analyses

<p> Zachary P. Scofield, M. James Jee, Sangjun Cha, Hyosun Park </p>
<p>
The galaxy cluster WHL J013719.8-08284 at z = 0.566 exhibits a strong-lensing feature known as the Sunrise Arc, which hosts the candidate star Earendel at z ≈ 6.2, the most distant star candidate observed to date. If this object is a star, or a system of a few stars, its apparent magnitude implies both extreme gravitational lensing magnification and unusually high luminosity. This study revisits Earendel's magnification, which, in previous literature, exhibits significant uncertainty across various lens models (2&mu; = 4,000-35,000). We present an improved cluster mass reconstruction and a tighter constraint on Earendel's magnification using a joint strong- and weak-lensing analysis with JWST data. Our strong-lensing mass model, incorporating newly identified multiple-image systems from JWST imaging data and modifying the existing multiple-image assignment scheme, produces a root-mean-square (RMS) lens-plane scatter of less than 0.''3. Additionally, our weak-lensing catalog achieves a source density of ~ 100 galaxies arcmin^-2, providing constraints on the mass profile beyond the strong-lensing regime. In our best-fit model, we estimate the magnification of Earendel to be &mu; = 43-67, significantly lower than previously proposed and thus calling into question its classification as a star.

We present 0.7-3.3 pc resolution mid-infrared (MIR) JWST images at 7.7 &mu;m (F770W) and 21 &mu;m (F2100W) covering the main star-forming regions of two of the closest star-forming low-metallicity dwarf galaxies, NGC6822 and Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM). The images of NGC6822 reveal filaments, edge-brightened bubbles, diffuse emission, and a plethora of point sources. By contrast, most of the MIR emission in WLM is point-like, with a small amount of extended emission. Compared to solar metallicity galaxies, the ratio of 7.7 &mu;m intensity (I_&nu;^F770W), tracing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), to 21 &mu;m intensity (I_&nu;^F2100W), tracing small, warm dust grain emission, is suppressed in these low-metallicity dwarfs. Using ALMA CO(2-1) observations, we find that detected CO intensity versus I_&nu;^F770W at ~2 pc resolution in dwarfs follows a similar relationship to that at solar metallicity and lower resolution, while the CO versus I_&nu;^F2100W relationship in dwarfs lies significantly below that derived from solar metallicity galaxies at lower resolution, suggesting more pronounced destruction of CO molecules at low metallicity. Finally, adding in Local Group L-Band Survey VLA 21 cm HI observations, we find that I_&nu;^F2100W and I_&nu;^F770W vs. total gas ratios are suppressed in NGC6822 and WLM compared to solar metallicity galaxies. In agreement with dust models, the level of suppression appears to be at least partly accounted for by the reduced galaxy-averaged dust-to-gas and PAH-to-dust mass ratios in the dwarfs. Remaining differences are likely due to spatial variations in dust model parameters, which should be an exciting direction for future work in local dwarf galaxies.

Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is crucial for regulating galaxy evolution. Motivated by observations of broad absorption line winds from rapidly accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs), we introduce the Mistral AGN feedback model, implemented in the Arepo code. Mistral comes in two versions: continuous radial (Mistral-continuous) and stochastic bipolar momentum deposition (Mistral-stochastic). Using the framework of the IllustrisTNG simulations, we explore the effect of Mistral on BH and galaxy properties, through an idealized Milky Way-mass galaxy and cosmological zoom simulations run down to z=2. Unlike standard thermal AGN feedback prescriptions, Mistral generates galaxy-scale winds that mimic outflows driven by BH accretion. Mistral-continuous produces short-lived galactic fountains, and is inefficient at regulating the growth of massive galaxies at z=2. In contrast, Mistral-stochastic efficiently suppresses star formation in massive galaxies, and reproduces the empirical stellar-to-halo mass and (z=0) BH-stellar mass relations. By supporting large-scale (&gt;50 kpc) outflows while simultaneously preventing gas inflows, Mistral-stochastic additionally regulates the cold and hot gas fractions at both galaxy and halo scales. Mistral-stochastic therefore works self-consistently across the halo mass range explored ≤ft(10^12-3×10^13 M<sub>&odot;</sub>), without adopting a SMBH-mass dependent AGN feedback scheme such as the one used in IllustrisTNG. Our model is a promising tool for predicting the impact of radiatively efficient AGN winds on galaxy evolution, and interpreting the growing population of high-redshift galaxies and quasars observed by JWST. This work is part of the "Learning the Universe" collaboration, which aims to infer the physical processes governing the evolution of the Universe.

We report the discovery of 13 broad-line AGNs at z = 5 - 8 from the first 10% data of the JWST Cycle 3 Treasury Program COSMOS-3D. These AGNs are identified by their broad H&alpha; or H&beta; emission lines through the NIRCam grism wide-field slitless spectroscopy. One object at z = 7.646 with broad H&beta; emission has an F444W magnitude of 23.6 mag, making it one of the brightest z &gt; 7.5 broad-line AGNs yet known. Among the 13 AGNs, 10 objects have reddened optical continua with slopes &beta;_opt&gt;0. The remaining three objects have their overall SEDs that resemble those of UV-luminous quasars at similar redshifts, but their &beta;_opt, though negative, are not as blue as those of unobscured quasars. We also obtain MIRI photometry at 7.7-18 &mu;m for two AGNs and place strong constraints on their rest-frame near-IR SED. We find no significant variability in the rest-frame UV by comparing the COSMOS-3D and COSMOS-Web F115W images taken apart by 60 days in the rest-frame. We compute the H&alpha; luminosity functions (LFs) for the broad H&alpha; emitters at z ≈ 5-6 and find a potential redshift evolution when compared with that of the z ≈ 4-5 sample. We also derive the H&beta; LF at z~8 for AGNs and galaxies by combining our sample with those from the literature. The broad H&beta; emitters in this work suggest a number density two orders of magnitude higher than that predicted by the quasar LF based on rest-frame UV-selected samples. As a preview, our work showcases the ability of the COSMOS-3D grism survey to provide a complete view of the properties, growth, and evolution of bright broad-line AGNs at z&gt;5.

### 30) [2504.08032](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08032v1): Counting Little Red Dots at z&lt;4 with Ground-based Surveys and Spectroscopic Follow-up

<p>
Little red dots (LRDs) are a population of red, compact objects discovered by JWST at z&gt;4. At 4&lt;z&lt;8, they are roughly 100 times more abundant than UV-selected quasars. However, their number density is uncertain at z&lt;4 due to the small sky coverage and limited blue wavelength coverage of JWST. We present our ground-based search for LRDs at 2≲ z≲4, combining ultra-deep Hyper Suprime-Cam photometry and various (near-)infrared surveys within a total area of ~3.1 deg<sup>2</sup>. We find that for LRDs with M_5500&lt;-22.5, their number density declines from ~10^-4.5 cMpc^-3 at z&gt;4 to ~10^-5.3 cMpc^-3 at 2.7&lt;z&lt;3.7 and ~10^-5.7 cMpc^-3 at 1.7&lt;z&lt;2.7. We also present the Magellan/FIRE spectrum of our first followed-up candidate, DEEP23-z2LRD1 at z<sub>spec</sub>=2.26, as a proof of concept for our sample selection. Similar to high-redshift LRDs, the spectrum of DEEP23-z2LRD1 exhibits broad H&alpha; emission with FWHM≈2400 km s<sup>-1</sup> and with nearly symmetric narrow H&alpha; absorption. Additionally, DEEP23-z2LRD1 has extremely narrow [OIII] lines with FWHM≈140 km s<sup>-1</sup>, suggesting the presence of an accreting black hole in a low-mass host galaxy. Limited by the angular resolution of ground-based surveys, we emphasize that spectroscopic follow-ups are required to characterize the contamination fraction of this sample and pin down LRD number density at z&lt;4.

### 31) [2504.08028](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08028v1): The Luminosity Function and Clustering of Hα Emitting Galaxies at z≈4-6 from a Complete NIRCam Grism Redshift Survey

Willmer, Chris Willott, Junyu Zhang, Yongda Zhu </p>
<p>
We study the luminosity function (LF) and clustering properties of 888 H&alpha; emitters (HAEs) at 3.75 &lt; z &lt; 6 in the GOODS-N field. The sample, built from JWST CONGRESS and FRESCO NIRCam grism surveys using a novel redshift assignment algorithm, spans ~62 arcmin<sup>2</sup> and reaches L_H&alpha; ~ 10^41.2 erg s<sup>-1</sup>. We identify two prominent filamentary protoclusters at z ≈ 4.41 and z ≈ 5.19, hosting 98 and 144 HAEs, respectively. The observed H&alpha; LFs show similar shallow faint-end slopes for both protocluster and field galaxies at z=3.75-5, and for the protocluster at z=5-6 (&alpha;≈ 1.2 to -1.3). In contrast, the field LF at z=5-6 is much steeper (&alpha;=-1.87_-0.23^+0.30), suggesting that protocluster galaxies at z &gt; 5 are more evolved, resembling those at z=3.75-5. The observed star formation rate density from H&alpha;, integrated down to 0.45 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1, is 0.050^+0.002_-0.003 and 0.046^+0.006_-0.004 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1 Mpc^-3 at z=3.75-5 and z=5-6, with protoclusters contributing ~25% and 55%, respectively. This implies that a large fraction of star formation at z &gt; 4 occurs in protoclusters. We conduct the first star-formation-rate-limited 3D clustering analysis at z &gt; 4. We find the filamentary protocluster geometry flattens the power-law shape of the HAE auto-correlation functions, with slopes much shallower than typically assumed. The auto-correlation function of field HAEs have correlation lengths of r_0 = 4.61^+1.00_-0.68 h^-1 Mpc at z ≈ 4-5 and r_0 = 6.23^+1.68_-1.13 h^-1 Mpc at z=5-6. Comparing the observed correlation functions with the UniverseMachine simulation, we infer the dark matter (sub-)halo masses of HAEs to be log (M_h/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=11.0-11.2 at z≈ 4-6, with a scatter of 0.4 dex.

### 32) [2504.07890](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07890v1): Stupendously Large Primordial Black Holes from the QCD axion

<p> Miguel Faria, Ricardo Z. Ferreira, Fabrizio Rompineve </p>
<p>
The inflationary diffusion of (pseudo-)scalar fields with discrete symmetries can seed the formation of a gas of closed domain walls after inflation, when the distance between degenerate minima in field space is not too far from the inflationary Hubble scale. Primordial black holes (PBHs) can then be formed once sufficiently heavy domain walls re-enter the Hubble sphere. In this scenario, inflation determines a distinctive PBH mass distribution that is rather flat and can thus lead to a sizable total abundance of PBHs, while avoiding some of the downsides of PBH formation from critical collapse. We show that generic QCD axion models, with decay constant close to the inflationary Hubble scale, can yield up to 1&percnt; of the dark matter (DM) today in the form of PBHs, while being compatible with isocurvature constraints from Cosmic Microwave Background observations. This occurs for values of axion decay constants around f_a≃ 10^8~GeV, that is the region targeted by axion helioscopes and partially constrained by astrophysical observations. The resulting PBHs have itstupendously large masses, above 10^11M<sub>&odot;</sub>, and their existence can be probed by Large Scale Structure observations. Larger PBH abundances can be generated by axion-like particles. Alternatively, in scenarios where isocurvature constraints can be relaxed, we find that the totality of the DM can be produced by the QCD axion misalignment mechanism, accompanied by a  O(10^-3) DM fraction in PBHs of masses (10^5-10^6)~M<sub>&odot;</sub>. These can act as seeds for the formation of massive black holes at large redshifts, as suggested by recent JWST observations.

<p> Christopher Rooney, Bo Peng, Amit Vishwas, Gordon Stacey, Thomas Nikola, Cody Lamarche, Catie Ball, Carl Ferkinhoff, Drew Brisbin, Steven Hailey-Dunsheath </p>
<p>
We present spatially resolved Alma Band-9 observations of the [CII] 158 &mu;m fine structure line from an optically selected quasar, SDSS J100038.01+020822.4 (J1000), at z=1.8275. By utilizing [OI] 63 &mu;m line observations from Herschel/PACS and constructing a detailed dust SED using Herschel and Spitzer archival imaging data, we show that the [CII] line emission is well explained by a photodissociation region (PDR) model, in which the emission arises from the surfaces of molecular clouds exposed to far-UV radiation fields ~ 5\cdot10^3 times the local interstellar radiation field (G_0). We find a factor of 30 variation in spatially resolved [CII]/Far-IR continuum across the source which is explained by the reduced fraction of cooling via [CII] line emission at such high far-UV field strengths. By matching derived PDR parameters to the observed far-IR line and continuum intensities we derive cloud size-scales and find that typical cloud radii in J1000 are ~3.5 pc perhaps indicating an ISM that is highly fractured due to intense star formation activity. We model the galaxy dynamically and find that the [CII] emission is contained within a compact, dynamically cold disk with v/&sigma;=6.2, consistent with cosmological simulations. We also report the discovery of a companion galaxy to j1000 confirmed by the detection of [CII] and use recently obtained JWST/NirCAM imaging of the system to argue for J1000 being an interacting system. With total stellar mass ~ 1.5 × 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and main-component dynamical mass ≳ 10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, the J1000 system is a progenitor to the most massive galaxies seen in the local Universe.

<p>
We present the HST ACS G800L grism spectroscopy observation of the faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates in the COSMOS field at redshift of 6 selected by the point-source morphology and the photometry drop-off at 8000&#8491;. Among the sample of 7 objects, only one is detected by multiple bands, and has similar shape of spectral energy distribution as the so-called "little red dots'' JWST selected AGN candidates, but our object is 3 magnitude brighter than the JWST sample. We draw the upper limit of the AGN luminosity function &Phi;=1.1× 10^-7Mpc^3 mag^-1 for M_UV=-21 at redshift of 6. The rest of the sample shows inconsistent flux density when comparing magnitudes of HST ACS F814W to the Subaru i-band and z-band magnitudes combined. The HST ACS G800L grism observation shows that this inconsistency cannot be created from an emission line. Therefore, we speculate that these objects are transients with the light curve decay timescale at most 6 years in observed frame.

<p>
We measure galaxy sizes from 2 &lt; z &lt; 10 using COSMOS-Web, the largest-area JWST imaging survey to date, covering ~0.54 deg<sup>2</sup>. We analyze the rest-frame optical (~5000A) size evolution and its scaling relation with stellar mass (R_e&prop; M_*^&alpha;) for star-forming and quiescent galaxies. For star-forming galaxies, the slope &alpha; remains approximately 0.20 at 2 &lt; z &lt; 8, showing no significant evolution over this redshift range. At higher redshifts, the slopes are -0.13 ± 0.15 and 0.37 ± 0.36 for 8 &lt; z &lt; 9 and 9 &lt; z &lt; 10, respectively. At fixed galaxy mass, the size evolution for star-forming galaxies follows R_e &prop; (1+z)^-&beta;, with &beta; = 1.21 ± 0.05. For quiescent galaxies, the slope is steeper &alpha;~ 0.5-0.8 at 2 &lt; z &lt; 5, and &beta;=0.81±0.26. We find that the size-mass relation is consistent between UV and optical at z &lt; 8 for star-forming galaxies. However, we observe a decrease in the slope from UV to optical at z &gt; 8, with a tentative negative slope in the optical at 8 &lt; z &lt; 9, suggesting a complex interplay between intrinsic galaxy properties and observational effects such as dust attenuation. We discuss the ratio between galaxies' half-light radius, and underlying halos' virial radius, R_vir, and find the median value of R_e/R_vir=2.7&percnt;. The star formation rate surface density evolves as log&Sigma;_SFR = (0.20±0.08) z+(-0.65±0.51), and the &Sigma;_SFR-M_* relation remains flat at 2&lt;z&lt;10. Lastly, we identify a threshold in stellar mass surface density log&Sigma;_e~9.5-10  M<sub>&odot;</sub>/kpc<sup>2</sup> marking the transition to compact, quenched galaxies from extended, star-forming progenitors. In summary, our findings show that the extensive COSMOS-Web dataset at z &gt; 3 provides new insights into galaxy size and related properties in the rest-frame optical.

<p>
Highly magnified stars (&mu; &gt; 100) are now outinely identified as transient events at cosmological distances thanks to microlensing by intra-cluster stars near the critical curves of galaxy clusters. Using the  James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in combination with the  Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we outline here an analytical framework that is applied to the Warhol arc (at z=0.94) in the MACS 0416 galaxy cluster (at z=0.396) where over a dozen microlensed stars have been detected to date. This method is general and can be applied to other lensed arcs. Within this lensed galaxy we fit the spatially resolved SED spanned by eight JWST-NIRCam filters combined with three ACS filters, for accurate lensed star predictions in 2D. With this tool we can generate 2D maps of microlensed stars for well resolved arcs in general, including dependence on wavelength and limiting apparent magnitude, for comparison with with planned cadenced campaigns for JWST and Hubble, for constraining directly the IMF and the level of dark matter substructure.

### 37) [2504.06788](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06788v1): FOREVER22: Insights into star formation and clustering properties of protoclusters from simulations and JWST

<p> Kana Morokuma-Matsui, Hidenobu Yajima, Makito Abe </p>
<p>
Using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with radiative transfer, we investigate star formation and overdensity (&delta;) in Coma-type cluster progenitors from z=14 to 6. Our simulations reproduce observed M_star-SFR relations and &delta; at these redshifts. We find: (1) protocluster (PC) and mean-density field (MF) galaxies show similar M_star-SFR relations, with PC galaxies extending to higher M_star and SFR. (2) UV-bright PC galaxies (M_UV≲ -20~mag) have &gt;2 mag higher UV attenuation and shallower UV slopes than MF galaxies. (3) &delta; increases with redshift, depending on observational parameters (e.g., &delta;~50 at z=14 to &delta;~3 at z=6 for a search volume of ~3000~cMpc^3 and a limiting magnitude of M_UV=-17~mag). These results indicate that enhanced star formation in PCs is driven by massive galaxy overdensity, not anomalously high specific SFR. While simulated &delta; agrees with observed PC candidates (potential Coma progenitors), some MF galaxies show comparable &delta;. We propose a robust PC identification method using both &delta; and M_star of the most massive member. Critical M_star thresholds for Coma progenitors are estimated (10^7.1 to 10^10.2 M<sub>&odot;</sub> from z=14 to 6). Comparison with JWST observations suggests GS-z14-0 and GS-z14-1, the current highest redshift holders, are likely progenitors of Coma-type clusters.

### 38) [2504.06701](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06701v1): A multi-scale view of the magnetic field morphology in the hot molecular core G31.41+0.31

<p>
Multiscale studies of the morphology and strength of the magnetic field are crucial to properly unveil its role and relative importance in high-mass star and cluster formation. G31.41+0.31 (G31) is a hub-filament system that hosts a high-mass protocluster embedded in a hot molecular core (HMC). G31 is one of the few sources showing a clear hourglass morphology of the magnetic field on scales between 1000 au and a few 100 au in previous interferometric observations. This strongly suggests a field-regulated collapse. To complete the study of the magnetic field properties in this high-mass star-forming region, we carried out observations with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope 850 &mu;m of the polarized dust emission. These observations had a spatial resolution of ~0.2 pc at 3.75 kpc. The aim was to study the magnetic field in the whole cloud and to compare the magnetic field orientation toward the HMC from ~50,000 au to ~260 au scales. The large-scale (~5 pc) orientation of the magnetic field toward the position of the HMC is consistent with that observed at the core (~4,000 au) and circumstellar (~260 au) scales. The self-similarity of the magnetic field orientation at these different scales might arise from the brightest sources in the protocluster, whose collapse is dragging the magnetic field. These sources dominate the gravitational potential and the collapse in the HMC. The cloud-scale magnetic field strength of the G31 hub-filament system, which we estimated using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, is in the range 0.04&ndash;0.09 mG. The magnetic field orientation in the star-forming region shows a bimodal distribution, and it changes from an NW&ndash;SE direction in the north to an E&ndash;W direction in the south [abridged abstract].

<p>
Environmental quenching &ndash; where interactions with other galaxies and/or the intra-cluster medium (ICM) suppress star formation in low-mass galaxies &ndash; has long been proposed as the primary driver to establish the red sequence for low-mass galaxies within clusters at low redshift (z&lt;1). However, we still do not know whether these environmental quenching mechanisms are also active at higher redshifts in proto-cluster environments that have yet to fully virialize. In large part, this regime has remained unexplored due to observational limitations; however, the James Webb Space Telescope has recently opened a new window into the role of environmental quenching on low-mass (log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;9.5) galaxies at cosmic noon (2 &lt; z &lt; 3). Here, we use data from the JWST UNCOVER and MegaScience programs to directly probe the role of environmental quenching on low-mass galaxies in a newly-discovered z≈ 2.6 overdensity. Leveraging the deep imaging and R ~ 15 spectrophotometry enabled by these JWST/NIRCam data, we analyze the stellar populations and inferred star formation histories (SFHs) of 20 low-mass (8.5&lt;log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≤9.0) quiescent galaxies in the overdense environment and compare to a similar sample of 18 such galaxies in the field. The SFHs of quiescent galaxies in the proto-cluster and field across the entire probed stellar mass regime (8.5&lt;log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)≤11.0) are indistinguishable, demonstrating that the environment at cosmic noon is not yet accelerating quenching compared to the field. This is consistent with expectations that proto-clusters at z&gt;2 have yet to virialize and develop a dense enough environment to efficiently quench low-mass galaxies.

### 40) [2504.06252](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06252v2): A systematic method to identify runaways from star clusters produced from single-binary interactions: A case study of M67

One hypothesis for runaway stars (RSs) is that they are ejected from star clusters with high velocities relative to the cluster center-of-mass motion. There are two competing mechanisms for their production: supernova-based ejections in binaries, where one companion explodes, leaves no remnant, and launches the other companion at the instantaneous orbital velocity, and the disintegration of triples (or higher-order multiples), which produces a recoiled runaway binary (RB) and an RS. We search for RS candidates using data from the Gaia DR3 survey with a focus on triple disintegration since in this case the product is always a binary and a single star that should be moving in opposite directions. We created a systematic methodology to look for candidate RS-RB runaway pairs produced from the disintegration of bound three-body systems formed from single-binary interactions based on momentum conservation and causality. The method we use is general and can be applied to any cluster with a 5D kinematic data set. We used our criteria to search for these pairs in a 150 pc circular field of view surrounding the open cluster M67, which we used as a benchmark cluster to test the robustness of our method. Our results reveal only one RS-RB pair that is consistent with all of our selection criteria out of an initial sample of 10^8 pairs.

<p>
Photodissociation Regions (PDRs) are key to understanding the feedback processes that shape interstellar matter in galaxies. One important type of PDR is the interface between HII regions and molecular clouds, where far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation from massive stars heats gas and dissociates molecules. Photochemical models predict that the C/CO transition occurs deeper in the PDR compared to the H/H2 transition in low-metallicity environments, increasing the extent of CO-dark H2 gas. This prediction has been difficult to test outside the Milky Way due to the lack of high spatial resolution observations tracing H2 and CO. This study examines a low-metallicity PDR in the N13 region of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) where we spatially resolve the ionization front, the H2 dissociation front, and the C/CO transition using 12CO J=2-1, 3-2 and [CI] (1-0) observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-mm Array (ALMA) and near-infrared spectroscopy of H2 vibrational lines from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Our analysis shows that the separation between the H/H2 and C/CO boundaries is approximately 0.043 +- 0.013(stat.) +- 0.0036(syst.) pc (equivalent to 0."146 +- 0."042 (stat.) +- 0."012 (syst.) at the SMC's distance of 62 kpc), defining the spatial extent of the CO-dark H2 region. Compared to our plane-parallel PDR models, we find that a constant pressure model matches the observed structure better than a constant density one. Overall, we find that the PDR model does well at predicting the extent of the CO-dark H2 layer in N13. This study represents the first resolved benchmark for low metallicity PDRs.

We designed customized Lyman-break color selection techniques to identify galaxy candidates in the redshift ranges 15 ≤ z ≤ 20 and 20 ≤ z ≤ 28. The selection was performed on the ASTRODEEP-JWST multi-band catalogs of the CEERS, Abell-2744, JADES, NGDEEP, and PRIMER survey fields, covering a total area of ~0.2 sq. deg. We identify nine candidates at 15 ≤ z ≤ 20, while no objects are found based on the z≳20 color selection criteria. Despite exhibiting a &gt;1.5 mag break, all the objects display multimodal redshift probability distributions across different SED-fitting codes and methodologies. The alternative solutions correspond to poorly understood populations of low-mass quiescent or dusty galaxies at z~3-7. This conclusion is supported by the analysis of a NIRSpec spectrum recently acquired by the CAPERS program for one interloper object, which is confirmed to be a dusty (E(B-V)=0.8 mag) starburst galaxy at z=6.56. We measured the UV luminosity function under different assumptions on the contamination level within our sample. We find that if even a fraction of the candidates is indeed at z≳15, the resulting UV LF points to a very mild evolution compared to estimates at z&lt;15, implying a significant tension with existing theoretical models. In particular, confirming our bright (M_UV&lt;-21) candidates would require substantial revisions to the theoretical framework. In turn, if all these candidates will be confirmed to be interlopers, we conclude that future surveys may need ten times wider areas to select M_UV≲-20 galaxies at z&gt;15. Observations in the F150W and F200W filters at depths comparable to those in the NIRCam LW bands are also required to mitigate contamination from rare red objects at z≲8.

<p>
Specifically selected to leverage the unique ultraviolet capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope, the Hubble Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) is a Director's Discretionary program of approximately 1000 orbits - the largest ever executed - that produced a UV spectroscopic library of O and B stars in nearby low metallicity galaxies and accreting low mass stars in the Milky Way. Observations from ULLYSES combined with archival spectra uniformly sample the fundamental astrophysical parameter space for each mass regime, including spectral type, luminosity class, and metallicity for massive stars, and the mass, age, and disk accretion rate for low-mass stars. The ULLYSES spectral library of massive stars will be critical to characterize how massive stars evolve at different metallicities; to advance our understanding of the production of ionizing photons, and thus of galaxy evolution and the re-ionization of the Universe; and to provide the templates necessary for the synthesis of integrated stellar populations. The massive star spectra are also transforming our understanding of the interstellar and circumgalactic media of low metallicity galaxies. On the low-mass end, UV spectra of T Tauri stars contain a plethora of diagnostics of accretion, winds, and the warm disk surface. These diagnostics are crucial for evaluating disk evolution and provide important input to assess atmospheric escape of planets and to interpret powerful probes of disk chemistry, as observed with ALMA and JWST. In this paper we motivate the design of the program, describe the observing strategy and target selection, and present initial results.

<p>
Power spectra (PS) of high-resolution images of M51 (NGC 5194) taken with the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope have been examined for evidence of disk thickness in the form of a change in slope between large scales, which map two-dimensional correlated structures, and small scales, which map three-dimensional correlated structures. Such a slope change is observed here in H-alpha, and possibly Pa-alpha, using average PS of azimuthal intensity scans that avoid bright peaks. The physical scale of the slope change occurs at ~120 pc and ~170 pc for these two transitions, respectively. A radial dependence in the shape of the H-alpha PS also suggests that the length scale drops from ~180 pc at 5 kpc, to ~90 pc at 2 kpc, to ~25 pc in the central ~kpc. We interpret these lengths as comparable to the thicknesses of the star-forming disk traced by HII regions. The corresponding emission measure is ~100 times larger than what is expected from the diffuse ionized gas. PS of JWST Mid-IR Instrument (MIRI) images in 8 passbands have more gradual changes in slope, making it difficult to determine a specific value of the thickness for this emission.

<p>
The spatial resolution and sensitivity of JWST's NIRCam instrument has revolutionised our ability to probe the internal structure of early galaxies. By leveraging deep medium-band imaging in the Jades Origins Field, we assemble comprehensive spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using 19 photometric bands for over 200 high-redshift galaxies (z ≥ 4.5). We present an analysis of this sample with particular emphasis on investigating the "outshining" phenomenon, which can bias the inferred stellar populations by masking the presence of evolved stellar populations (≥ 100 Myr) with the light of bright, young O and B-type stars. We address this problem by performing spatially-resolved SED-fitting of both binned and full pixel-by-pixel photometry, which we compare to the traditional integrated approach. We find evidence for systematic underestimation of stellar mass in low-mass galaxies (≤ 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) with bursty star formation, which can exceed a factor of 10 in individual cases, but on average is typically a factor of 1.25-2.5, depending on the binning methodology and SFH model used. The observed mass offset correlates with burstiness (SFR_10  Myr/SFR_100  Myr) and sSFR, such that galaxies with recently rising SFHs have larger mass offsets. The integrated SFH models which produce the most consistent stellar masses are the double power-law and non-parametric `continuity' models, although no integrated model fully reproduces all resolved SFHs. We apply an outshining correction factor to the Stellar Mass Function at z=7, finding little impact within the uncertainties. We conclude that outshining can be important in individual low-mass galaxies, but the overall impact is limited and should be considered alongside other systematic SED fitting effects.

### 46) [2504.04683](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04683v1): Probing the Cosmic Reionization History with JWST: Gunn-Peterson and Lyα Damping Wing Absorption at 4.5 &lt; z &lt; 13

We present a statistical analysis of Ly&alpha; absorption using 581 galaxies at z=4.5-13 observed with multiple JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy programs, including JADES, UNCOVER, CEERS, and GO/DDT. We carefully construct composite spectra binned by redshift with homogeneous UV properties (UV magnitudes, UV slopes, and Ly&alpha; equivalent widths) and identify significant Ly&alpha; forest signals in galaxies at z~5-6, which diminish toward higher redshifts. We also find UV continuum breaks at rest-frame 1216&#8491; that soften beyond z≳6, confirming the effects of cosmic reionization through a self-consistent transition from Gunn-Peterson to Ly&alpha; damping wing absorption in galaxies. Fair comparisons of composite spectra with matched UV magnitudes and slopes across redshift reveal that UV-faint galaxies clearly show stronger Ly&alpha; absorption than UV-bright galaxies towards high redshift, providing insights into the topological evolution of reionization. We estimate Ly&alpha; transmission at the Gunn-Peterson trough and Ly&alpha; damping wing absorption by comparing the galaxy spectra to low-z (z~2-5) galaxy templates that include galactic and circumgalactic absorption and Ly&alpha; emission. Using these measurements together with reionization simulations, we derive volume average neutral hydrogen fractions of &langle; x_HI &rangle; = 0.00^+0.12_-0.00, 0.25^+0.10_-0.20, 0.65^+0.27_-0.35, 1.00^+0.00_-0.20, and 1.00^+0.00_-0.40 at z~5, 6, 7, 9, and 10, respectively. These values align with a reionization history characterized by a rapid transition around z~7-8, consistent with Ly&alpha; emitter observations. While the physical driver of this rapid reionization remains unclear, it may involve the emergence of hidden AGN populations and/or the onset of Lyman-continuum escape from galaxies.

### 47) [2504.03839](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03839v1): MARTA: Temperature-temperature relationships and strong-line metallicity calibrations from multiple auroral lines detections at cosmic noon

<p>
We present the first results from MARTA (Measuring Abundances at high Redshift with the T_e Approach), a programme leveraging ultra-deep, medium-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy to probe the interstellar medium (ISM) of star-forming galaxies at z ~ 2 - 3. We report detections of one or more auroral lines, including [O III]&lambda;4363, [O II]&lambda;&lambda;7320,7330, [S II] &lambda;4068, and [S III] &lambda;6312 for 16 galaxies in the sample, providing measurements of multiple ionic temperatures. We tested the validity of the T[O II]-T[O III] relation at high redshift considering a total sample of 21 objects including literature data, and obtained a shallower slope than in the low-z literature. However, such a slope is consistent with low-redshift data when ultra-low metallicity objects are considered. We assessed the correlation of the T[O II]-T[O III] relationship and its scatter on different physical parameters, finding a mild correlation with the ionisation parameter and radiation field hardness, while no significant correlation with gas density. The location of high-redshift data is also consistent with the low-z literature in the T[O II]-T[S II], and T[S III]-T[O III] relations, although this conclusion is limited with low-number statistics. Finally, we leveraged our sample together with a comprehensive compilation of galaxies with [O III]&lambda;4363 detections from the literature to recalibrate classical strong-line diagnostics at high redshift. MARTA represents a key addition in this space because it provides direct metallicities at moderately high oxygen abundances (12+log(O/H) ~8.0-8.4).

Rowland, Mauro Stefanon, Yuma Sugahara, Joris Witstok, Paul P. van der Werf </p>
<p>
We present results of new observations of [OI]145um and [NII]205um emission lines from four star-forming galaxies at redshifts between z=6.58 and 7.68 that have previous detections of \Ciium and dust continua. Using ALMA, we successfully detect [OI]145um emission from all targets at &gt;4 &sigma; significance. However, [NII]205um emission is undetected in all galaxies (SNR &lt;3.5 &sigma;) except for a tentative detection from A1689-zD1. From the observed high [CII]/[NII] emission line ratios (≳20 - 80), we find that most of the [CII]158um emission arise from neutral gas regions (3 &sigma; lower limits of ≳ 74 - 96&percnt;). From [OI]145um, [CII]158um lines, and infrared luminosities, we estimate the neutral gas densities of n_H=10^3.5 - 10^6 cm^-3 and the far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation strengths of G_0~10^2.5-10^3. While the neutral gas densities are similar to those of high-redshift starburst galaxies, the FUV strengths are lower compared to both local and high-redshift starbursts. Finally, we estimate atomic hydrogen masses using [OI]145um emission lines and the oxygen abundances measured from recent JWST observations. We find gas mass ratios of f_gas~0.3 - 0.8, which are similar to earlier studies using [CII]158um. Starting from this pilot observation, future large [OI]145um emission line surveys will provide us with currently little-known neutral gas properties of star-forming galaxies in the early Universe.

<p>
We present the discovery, and initial lensing analysis, of a high-redshift galaxy-galaxy lensing system within the JWST-PEARLS/HST-TREASUREHUNT North Ecliptic Pole Time Domain Field (designated NEPJ172238.9+655143.1). The lensing geometry shears a z=3.6±0.1 star-forming galaxy into a near-Einstein ring with a radius of 0\farcs92, consisting of 4 primary images, around a foreground massive elliptical galaxy at z=1.258±0.005. The system is fortuitously located within the NIRISS F200W footprint of the PEARLS survey, enabling spectroscopic identification of the 8500A TiO band in the foreground galaxy and allowing tight constraints to be placed on the redshift of the background galaxy based on its continuum detection and lack of strong emission lines. We calculate magnification factors of 2.6&lt;&mu;&lt;8.4 for the four images and a total lensing mass of (4.08 ± 0.07)×10^11M<sub>&odot;</sub>. SED fitting of the foreground elliptical galaxy within the Einstein radius reveals a stellar mass of ~1.26×10^11M<sub>&odot;</sub>, providing a mass/light ratio of 3.24. Employing simple scaling relations and assumptions, an NFW dark matter halo is found to provide the correct remaining mass within 0.12^+0.21_-0.09dex. However, if a bottom-heavy IMF for elliptical galaxies is employed, stellar mass estimations increase and can account for the majority of the lensing mass (up to ~83&percnt;), reducing the need for dark matter. This system further demonstrates the new discovery space that the combined wavelength coverage, sensitivity and resolution of JWST now enables.

<p>
The depth and coverage of the first years of JWST observations have revealed low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) across a wide redshift range, shedding light on black hole (BH) assembly and feedback. We present our spectroscopic sample of 34 Type 1 AGN obtained from JADES survey data and spanning 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 9. Our sample of AGN probes a BH mass range of 10^6-9~M<sub>&odot;</sub> at bolometric luminosities down to 10^43~erg~s<sup>-1</sup>, implying generally sub-Eddington ratios of &lt;0.5L_Edd. Most of these AGN are hosted in low mass (M<sub>&sext;</sub>~10^8~M<sub>&odot;</sub>) galaxies and are overmassive relative to the local M_BH-M<sub>&sext;</sub> relation, while remaining consistent with the local M_BH-&sigma;_* relation. The wide redshift range provided by our sample allows us to trace the emergence of local M_BH-M_* scaling relation across the cosmic epoch. Additionally, we explore the capability of narrow-line diagnostics in identifying Type 2 AGN and find that a significant fraction of our AGN would be missed by them due to low metallicity or lack of high energy ionizing photons (potentially due to dust absorption, dense gas blanketing the broad and narrow line regions, or intrinsically soft ionizing spectra). We explore the UV luminosity function of AGN and their hosts and find that it is subject to significant cosmic variance and is also dependent on the AGN bolometric luminosity. Finally, we show that the electron and Balmer scattering scenarios recently proposed to explain the broad components of the Balmer lines are untenable on multiple grounds. There is no evidence that the black hole masses have been overestimated by orders of magnitude as proposed in those scenarios.

### 51) [2504.03384](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03384v1): Capturing Small-Scale Reionization Physics: A Sub-Grid Model for Photon Sinks with SCRIPT

<p> Tirthankar Roy Choudhury, Anirban Chakraborty </p>
<p>
The epoch of reionization represents a major phase transition in cosmic history, during which the first luminous sources ionized the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, the small-scale physics governing ionizing photon sinks - particularly the interplay between recombinations, photon propagation, and self-shielded regions - remains poorly understood. Accurately modeling these processes requires a framework that self-consistently links ionizing emissivity, the clumping factor, mean free path, and photoionization rate. In this work, we extend the photon-conserving semi-numerical framework, SCRIPT, by introducing a self-consistent sub-grid model that dynamically connects these quantities to the underlying density field, enabling a more realistic treatment of inhomogeneous recombinations and photon sinks. We validate our model against a comprehensive set of observational constraints, including the UV luminosity function from HST and JWST, CMB optical depth from Planck, and Lyman-&alpha; forest measurements of the IGM temperature, photoionization rate, and mean free path. Our fiducial model also successfully reproduces Lyman-&alpha; opacity fluctuations, reinforcing its ability to capture large-scale inhomogeneities in the reionization process. Notably, we demonstrate that traditionally independent parameters, such as the clumping factor and mean free path, are strongly correlated, with implications for the timing, morphology, and thermal evolution of reionization. Looking ahead, we will extend this framework to include machine learning-based parameter inference. With upcoming 21cm experiments poised to provide unprecedented insights, SCRIPT offers a powerful computational tool for interpreting high-redshift observations and refining our understanding of the last major phase transition in the universe.

### 52) [2504.03367](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03367v1): Infrared bubble recognition in the Milky Way and beyond using deep learning

<p>
We propose a deep learning model that can detect Spitzer bubbles accurately using two-wavelength near-infrared data acquired by the Spitzer Space Telescope and JWST. The model is based on the Single Shot MultiBox Detector as an object detection model, trained and validated using Spitzer bubbles identified by the Milky Way Project (MWP-Bubble). We found that using only MWP-Bubbles with clear structures, along with normalization and data augmentation, significantly improved performance. To reduce the dataset bias, we also use the data without bubbles in the dataset selected by combining two techniques: negative sampling and clustering. The model was optimized by hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian optimization. Applying this model to a test region of the Galactic plane resulted in a 98 &percnt; detection rate for MWP-Bubbles with 8 &mu; m emission clearly encompassing 24 &mu; m emission. Additionally, we applied the model to a broader area of 1&deg; ≤ |l| ≤ 65&deg;, |b| ≤ 1&deg;, including both training and validation regions, and the model detected 3,006 bubbles, of which 1,413 were newly detected. We also attempted to detect bubbles in the high-mass star-forming region Cygnus X, as well as in the external galaxies Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and NGC 628. The model successfully detected Spitzer bubbles in these external galaxies, though it also detected Mira-type variable stars and other compact sources that can be difficult to distinguish from Spitzer bubbles. The detection process takes only a few hours, demonstrating the efficiency in detecting bubble structures. Furthermore, the method used for detecting Spitzer bubbles was applied to detect shell-like structures observable only in the 8 &mu; m emission band, leading to the detection of 469 shell-like structures in the LMC and 143 in NGC 628.

<p>
We present various properties of two bright extended Ly&alpha; objects, Himiko and CR7, at z=6.6 thoroughly investigated with JWST/NIRCam photometry, NIRSpec-IFU spectroscopy, and ALMA data, uncovering their physical origins. Himiko (CR7) shows at least five (four) clumps with small separations of 2.4&ndash;7.3 kpc and velocity offsets of &Delta; v&lt;220~km~s<sup>-1</sup> in the [OIII]&lambda;&lambda;4959,5007 line maps, three of which exhibit stellar components with comparable stellar masses ranging in log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=8.4&ndash;9.0 (8.3&ndash;8.8), indicative of major merger systems that are consistent with our numerical simulations. The [CII]158&mu;m and Ly&alpha; lines are found in the middle of two clumps (the brightest clump) in Himiko (CR7), suggesting that the distribution of neutral gas does not always coincide with that of ionized gas or stars in merging processes. We find that some of the clumps have broad [OIII] components (250&ndash;400~km~s<sup>-1</sup>) in Himiko and CR7, likely tracing outflow and tidal features, while the central clump in Himiko presents a broad H&alpha; (~1000~km~s<sup>-1</sup>) line explained by an AGN with a low mass black hole of M_BH=10^6.6~M<sub>&odot;</sub>, which contribute to the extended and bright nature of Himiko and CR7. We find low metallicities of 12+log(O/H)=7.9&ndash;8.1 in Himiko and CR7 based on auroral [OIII]&lambda;4363 and strong lines that are consistent with no 1-mm continuum detection corresponding to the dust mass limits of M_dust≲ 9× 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Himiko and CR7 are metal- and dust-poor blue merger systems with stellar and dust masses ≳2 orders of magnitude smaller than the massive dust-rich merger systems represented by submillimeter galaxies.

<p> Romain A. Meyer, Guido Roberts-Borsani, Pascal Oesch, Richard S. Ellis </p>
<p>
We present the first characterization of the Gunn-Peterson trough in high-redshift galaxies using public JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy. This enables us to derive the first galaxy-based IGM opacity measurements at the end of reionisation. Using galaxy spectra has several advantages over quasar spectra: it enables measurements of the IGM opacity in any extragalactic field over a continuous redshift range 4≲ z≲ 7, as well as measurements of the intrinsic Lyman-&beta; opacity. Our novel constraints are in good agreement with state-of-the-art ground-based quasar Lyman-&alpha; forest observations, and will become competitive as the number of JWST z&gt;5 galaxy spectra rapidly increases. We also provide the first constraints on the uncontaminated Lyman-&beta; opacity at 5&lt;z&lt;6. Finally, we demonstrate the power of JWST to connect the ionisation state of the IGM to the sources of reionisation in a single extragalactic field. We show that a previously reported galaxy overdensity and an excess of Lyman-&alpha; emitters detected with JWST in GOODS-South at z=5.8-5.9 coincides with an anomalously low IGM opacity to Lyman-&alpha; at this redshift. The local photo-ionisation rate excess can be fully accounted for by the cumulative ionising output of M_UV≲ -10 galaxies in the overdensity, provided they have log_10&langle;  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  f<sub>esc</sub> /  [erg^-1 Hz]&rangle; = 24.7 (or equivalently log_10 &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  /  [erg^-1 Hz]=25.4 and f<sub>esc</sub>=20&percnt;). Overall, this breakthrough offers a new way to connect the galaxy large-scale structure to the state of the IGM, potentially enabling us to precisely identify the sources of reionisation.

<p>
Deuteration of hydrocarbon material, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), has been proposed to account for the low gas-phase abundances of D in the interstellar medium. JWST spectra of four star-forming regions in M51 show an emission feature, with central wavelength ~4.647&mu;m and FWHM 0.0265&mu;m, corresponding to the C-D stretching mode in aliphatic hydrocarbons. The emitting aliphatic material is estimated to have (D/H)_aliph≈ 0.17±0.02 &ndash; a factor ~10^4 enrichment relative to the overall interstellar medium (ISM). On ~50 pc scales, deuteration levels toward four H II regions in M51 are 2-3 times higher than in the Orion Bar photodissociation region (PDR), with implications for the processes responsible for the formation and evolution of hydrocarbon nanoparticles, including PAHs. The deuteration of the aliphatic material is found to anticorrelate with helium ionization in the associated H II, suggesting that harsh FUV radiation may act to lower the deuteration of aliphatics in PDRs near massive stars. No evidence is found for deuteration of aromatic material, with (D/H)_arom ≲ 0.016: deuteration of the aliphatic material exceeds that of the aromatic material by at least a factor 10. The observed levels of deuteration may account for the depletion of D observed in the Galactic interstellar medium. If so, the 4.65&mu;m feature may be detectable in absorption.

Takeuchi, Hideki Umehata, Feige Wang, Wei Leong Tee </p>
<p>
Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) regulate the evolution of their host galaxies through powerful outflows and multi-phase feedback. This process plays a crucial role in shaping SMBH-galaxy co-evolution across cosmic time, but direct evidence linking nuclear winds to large-scale cold gas outflows, particularly in high-redshift quasars, has remained elusive. Here we present statistical evidence of a connection between nuclear winds and large-scale cold gas outflows in quasars at z ~ 5.5. Using stacked [C II] 158 &mu;m emission profiles from ALMA observations, which trace galactic-scale neutral gas, we compare broad absorption line (BAL) quasars &ndash; tracing parsec- to sub-kiloparsec-scale nuclear winds &ndash; with non-BAL quasars. The BAL stack reveals a significant (S/N=4.45) broad component in the [C II] emission, indicating high-velocity neutral gas outflows with a velocity offset of &Delta; v_b = -2.1 × 10^2   km s<sup>-1</sup> and a full width at half maximum of 1.18 × 10^3   km s<sup>-1</sup>, while the non-BAL stack shows no such feature. We estimate that a few percent up to one-quarter of the BAL wind energy is transferred to neutral gas on kiloparsec scales. These findings provide direct observational evidence that nuclear winds couple with galactic-scale neutral gas flows, supporting multi-phase AGN feedback models. This mechanism may contribute to explaining the diversity of M_BH/M_* ratios observed in some luminous AGN recently observed by JWST, compared to the Magorrian relation.

Context: Dust grains are key components of the interstellar medium and play a central role in star formation, acting as catalysts for chemical reactions and as building blocks of planets. Extinction curves are essential for characterizing dust properties, but mid-infrared (MIR) extinction remains less constrained in protostellar environments. Gas-phase line ratios from embedded protostellar jets provide a spatially resolved method for probing extinction through protostellar envelopes, complementing background starlight approaches. Aims: We aim to derive MIR extinction curves along sightlines toward a protostellar jet embedded in an envelope and assess whether they differ from those in dense molecular clouds. Methods: We analyze JWST NIRSpec IFU and MIRI MRS observations of four positions along the blue-shifted TMC1A jet. We extract observed [Fe II] line intensities and model intrinsic ratios using the Cloudy spectral synthesis code across a range of electron densities and temperatures. By comparing observed near-IR (NIR) and MIR line ratios to Cloudy predictions, we infer the relative extinction between NIR and MIR wavelengths. Results: Electron densities (ne) derived from NIR [Fe II] lines range from ~5 x 10^4 to ~5 x 10^3 cm^-3 at scales &lt;~350 AU. MIR extinction values show stronger reddening than the empirical dark cloud curve from McClure (2009) at similar ne and temperatures (~10^3 to 10^4 K). If MIR emission arises from cooler, lower-density gas, extinction curves remain consistent with background starlight measurements. Conclusions: This method enables spatially resolved MIR extinction curves in embedded protostellar systems. Results suggest either a change in dust size distribution (e.g., from grain growth) or that MIR emission originates from cooler, less dense regions than NIR emission. (Abstract shortened for arXiv.

We present a comprehensive analysis of the MIRI Extremely Red Object Virgil, a Lyman-&alpha; emitter at z<sub>spec</sub> = 6.6379 ± 0.0035 with the photometric properties of a Little Red Dot. Leveraging new JWST/MIRI imaging from the MIDIS and PAHSPECS programs, we confirm Virgil's extraordinary nature among galaxies in JADES/GOODS-South, exhibiting a strikingly red NIRCam-to-MIRI color (F444W - F1500W = 2.84±0.04 mag). Deep NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy from the OASIS program offers key insights into the host galaxy, revealing properties of an average star-forming galaxy during Cosmic Reionization, such as a subsolar metallicity, low-to-moderate dust content, and a relatively high ionization parameter and electron temperature. By estimating the star formation rate of Virgil from UV and H&alpha;, we find evidence that the galaxy is either entering or fading out of a bursty episode. Although line-ratio diagnostics employed at high-z would classify Virgil as an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), this classification becomes ambiguous once redshift evolution is considered. Nonetheless, Virgil occupies the same parameter space as recently confirmed AGNs at similar redshifts. The new deep MIRI data at 15 &mu;m reinforce the AGN nature of Virgil, as inferred from multiple spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes. Virgil's rising infrared SED and UV excess resemble those of Dust-Obscured Galaxies (DOGs) studied with Spitzer at Cosmic Noon, particularly blue-excess HotDOGs. Our results highlight the need for a multi-wavelength approach incorporating MIRI to uncover such extreme sources at z≳6 and to shed light on the interplay between galaxy evolution and early black hole growth during Cosmic Reionization.

The standard model of cosmology has provided a good phenomenological description of a wide range of observations both at astrophysical and cosmological scales for several decades. This concordance model is constructed by a universal cosmological constant and supported by a matter sector described by the standard model of particle physics and a cold dark matter contribution, as well as very early-time inflationary physics, and underpinned by gravitation through general relativity. There have always been open questions about the soundness of the foundations of the standard model. However, recent years have shown that there may also be questions from the observational sector with the emergence of differences between certain cosmological probes. In this White Paper, we identify the key objectives that need to be addressed over the coming decade together with the core science projects that aim to meet these challenges. These discordances primarily rest on the divergence in the measurement of core cosmological parameters with varying levels of statistical confidence. These possible statistical tensions may be partially accounted for by systematics in various measurements or cosmological probes but there is also a growing indication of potential new physics beyond the standard model. After reviewing the principal probes used in the measurement of cosmological parameters, as well as potential systematics, we discuss the most promising array of potential new physics that may be observable in upcoming surveys. We also discuss the growing set of novel data analysis approaches that go beyond traditional methods to test physical models. [Abridged]

### 60) [2504.01595](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01595v1): JWST MIRI reveals the diversity of nuclear mid-infrared spectra of nearby type-2 quasars

<p>
Type-2 quasars (QSO2s) are active galactic nuclei (AGN) seen through a significant amount of dust and gas that obscures the central supermassive black hole and the broad line region. Here we present new mid-infrared spectra of the central kiloparsec of five optically-selected QSO2s at redshift z~0.1 obtained with JWST/MIRI/MRS. These QSO2s belong to the QSOFEED sample and they have log Lbol=45.5-46.0 erg/s, global SFRs that place them above the main sequence, and practically identical optical spectral shape and [OIII] luminosity, but their nuclear mid-infrared spectra exhibit an unexpected diversity of both continua and features. They show: 1) 9.7 micron silicate features going from emission (strength of S9.7=0.5) to relatively strong absorption (S9.7=-1.0) and 18 and 23 micron silicates either in emission or flat. In addition, two of the QSO2s show absorption bands of CO, H2O, and aliphatic grains, indicating different levels of nuclear obscuration across the sample. 2) [NeV]/[NeII] ratios ranging from 0.1 to 2.1 and [NeIII]/[NeII] from 1.0 to 3.5, indicating different coronal line and ionizing continuum strengths. 3) Warm molecular gas masses of 1-4x10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and warm-to-cold gas mass ratios of 1-2%, with molecular gas excitation likely due to jet-induced shocks in J1430+1339, and to UV heating and/or turbulence in J1509+0434. 4) PAH emission features with equivalent widths ranging from &lt;0.002 to 0.075 micron, from which we measure a larger contribution from neutral molecules (PAH 11.3/6.2=1.3-3.4) and SFRs&lt;3-7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr. This unprecedented dataset allowed us to start exploring the role of various AGN and galaxy properties including ionizing continuum, obscuration, electron density, and jet-ISM interactions on some of the spectral differences listed above, but larger samples are now required to fully understand the diversity of QSO2s' nuclear mid-infrared spectra.

### 61) [2504.01456](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01456v1): Multiscale exploration of SMACS J0723.3&ndash;7327's intracluster light and past dynamical history

<p> Amaël Ellien </p>
<p>
In this work an analysis of the intracluster light (ICL) in the galaxy cluster SMACS J0723.3-7327 (hereafter, SMACS J0723) using JWST/NIRCam deep imaging in six filters (F090W to F444W) is presented. The images were processed for low surface brightness (LSB) science, with additional correction for instrumental scattering in the short-wavelength channels, and analysed using wavelet-based decomposition. The ICL, brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), and satellite galaxies were extracted and modelled, with 2D maps for each component. ICL and ICL+BCG fractions, computed across all filters within a 400 kpc radius, exhibit a flat trend with wavelength, averaging 28% and 34%, respectively. Flux ratios between the BCG and the next brightest members (M_12, M_13 and M_14) also display minimal wavelength dependence. These results indicate that SMACS J0723 is a dynamically evolved cluster with a dominant BCG and well-developed ICL. Five prominent ICL substructures are analysed, contributing to 10-12% of the total ICL+BCG flux budget, slightly exceeding simulation predictions. Their short dynamical timescales suggest an instantaneous ICL injection rate of several 10^3 L<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1, consistent with active dynamical assembly. These findings support a scenario where SMACS J0723's ICL growth is currently driven by galaxy mergers involving the BCG and other bright satellites, rather than by the accretion of pre-processed ICL from a recent cluster merger. However, extrapolating the current injection rate to the cluster's lifetime indicates that additional mechanisms are required to match the growth observed in other clusters over cosmic times.

### 62) [2504.01327](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01327v1): Multi-wavelength properties of z≳ 6 LISA detectable events

<p> Srija Chakraborty, Simona Gallerani, Fabio Di Mascia, Tommaso Zana, Milena Valentini, Stefano Carniani, Fabio Vito, Maulik Bhatt </p>
<p>
We investigate the intrinsic and observational properties of z≳ 6 galaxies hosting coalescing massive black holes (MBHs) that gives rise to gravitational waves (GWs) detectable with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We adopt a zoom-in cosmological hydrodynamical simulation of galaxy formation and black hole (BH) co-evolution, zoomed-in on a M_h ~ 10^12~M<sub>&odot;</sub> dark matter halo at z = 6, which hosts a fast accreting super-massive black hole (SMBH) and a star-forming galaxy. Following the SMBH formation backward in time, we identify the merging events that concurred to its formation and we pick up the ones that are detectable with LISA. Among these LISA detectable events (LDEs), we select those that, based on their intrinsic properties are expected to be bright in one or more electromagnetic (EM) bands. We post-process these events with dust radiative transfer calculations to make predictions about their spectral energy distributions and continuum maps in the JWST to ALMA wavelength range. We compare the spectra arising from galaxies hosting the merging MBHs with those arising from AGN powered by single accreting BHs. We find that it will be impossible to identify an LDE from the continuum SEDs because of the absence of specific imprints from the merging MBHs. We also compute the profile of the H_&alpha; line arising from LDEs, considering the contribution from their star-forming regions and the accreting MBHs. We find that the presence of two accreting MBHs would be difficult to infer even if both MBHs accrete at super-Eddington rates. We conclude that the combined detection of GW and EM signals from z≳ 6 MBHs is challenging not only because of the poor sky-localization provided by LISA, but also because the loudest GW emitters are not massive enough to leave significant signatures in the emission lines arising from the broad line region.

### 63) [2504.01303](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01303v1): Unveiling the properties of the first galaxies with JWST and ALMA

<p> Maria Emilia De Rossi, Volker Bromm </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is challenging our understanding of the nature of the very first galaxies in the Universe, having discovered a surprising abundance of very massive galaxies in early cosmic epochs. By applying a model of primeval dust, we estimate the far-infrared (FIR)-continuum luminosities for galaxies of different masses at redshifts z≳7. In particular, we predict observed fluxes for different available bands (3-10) of the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-mm Array (ALMA), considering typical conservative values expected for the properties of first galaxies (e.g., gas-phase metallicities, dust-to-metal ratio, star formation efficiency). As expected, FIR fluxes increase with stellar mass for all ALMA bands, but with a steeper slope for bands 9 and 10. Encouragingly, first galaxies are affected by a strong negative-K correction, in such a way that sources with similar properties are brighter in bands 3-8 at higher redshifts. Such behavior is stronger for bands 6-7. Although the trends for bands 9-10 are not clear, the highest fluxes for such bands are reached towards extreme z≳ 15. Counterintuitively, our results suggest that JWST sources with similar masses and dust properties would be more easily detectable with ALMA if they are located at higher z.

We investigate the capabilities of the mid-infrared instrument (MIRI) of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to advance our knowledge of AGN dust using the spectral fitting technique on an AGN collection of 21 nearby (z&lt;0.05) AGN (7 type-1 and 14 type-2) observations obtained with the medium resolution spectroscopy (MRS) mode. This collection includes publicly available AGN and data from the collaboration of Galactic Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS). We developed a tool named MRSPSFisol that decomposes MRS cubes into point-like and extended contributions. We found statistically good fits for 12 targets with current AGN dust models. The model that provides good fits (chi2/dof&lt;2) for these 12 targets assumes a combination of clumpy and smooth distribution of dust in a flare-disk geometry where the dust grain size is a free parameter. Still, two and one AGN statistically prefer the disk+wind and the classical clumpy torus model, respectively. However, the currently available models fail to reproduce 40% of the targets, likely due to the extreme silicate features not well reproduced by the models and signatures of water-ice and aliphatic hydrocarbon absorption features in most targets. New models exploring, for instance, new chemistry, are needed to explain the complexity of AGN dust continuum emission observed by JWST.

We present deep JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging of Ion1, a previously confirmed Lyman Continuum (LyC)-emitting galaxy at z<sub>spec</sub>=3.794. Together with existing HST imaging, these new observations from the JADES program enable a joint analysis of Ion1's LyC, rest-frame UV, stellar, and dust emission with unprecedented detail. We report the first detection of dust emission at rest-frame ~3 &mu;m in a high-redshift LyC-emitting galaxy using MIRI/F1500W. Our analysis suggests a porous distribution of dust in Ion1, with regions exhibiting evidence of dust deficit coinciding both with LyC-emitting regions and with the peak of H&alpha; emission. Furthermore, multi-band NIRCam imaging reveals a strong FUV-to-optical color gradient, where LyC-emitting regions appear significantly bluer than the rest of Ion1. Spatially resolved SED fitting confirms that this color gradient is primarily driven by spatially varying dust attenuation. Together, these findings suggest that Ion1's LyC emission originates from a compact star-forming complex near its stellar-light centroid, where stellar feedback carves out low HI column density channels, facilitating LyC escape. However, only a fraction of these LyC photons - specifically those along sightlines with minimal HI obscuration - ultimately escape and reach observers. This work underscores the critical role of dust and neutral gas geometry in shaping LyC escape in galaxies at high redshifts. Anisotropic LyC escape may be a common feature in the early Universe, which must be properly incorporated to constrain the Epoch of Reionization.

### 66) [2504.01070](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01070v1): Formation and Environmental Context of Giant Bulgeless Disk Galaxies in the Early Universe: Insights from Cosmological Simulations

<p> Fangzhou Jiang, Jinning Liang, Bingcheng Jin, Zeyu Gao, Weichen Wang, Sebastiano Cantalupo, Xuejian Shen, Luis C. Ho, Yingjie Peng, Jing Wang </p>
<p>
Giant bulgeless disk galaxies, theoretically expected to be rare in the early Universe, have been confirmed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to exist as early as 2 billion years after the Big Bang. These morphologically extreme systems offer valuable insights into the physics of disk formation and the interplay between galaxies and their dark-matter halos. Using cosmological simulations, we identify analogs of such galaxies with stellar masses around 10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and half-light radii up to 6 kpc at z ~ 3 and characterize the factors that contribute to their formation. These galaxies form in young cosmic knots, populating host halos of high spin, low concentration, and spherical shapes. They feature dynamically coherent circum-galactic medium, as well as gas-rich, coherent mergers, which preserve their disk morphology and drive their large sizes. Interestingly, all the simulated giant disks harbor a compact, aligned inner disk, marginally resolvable in JWST images with a S\'ersic index near unity. These findings highlight the environmental and structural conditions necessary for forming and sustaining giant bulgeless disks and provide a theoretical framework for interpreting JWST observations of extreme disk morphologies in the early Universe.

### 67) [2504.01060](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01060v1): A power spectral study of PHANGS galaxies with JWST MIRI: On the spatial scales of dust and PAHs

<p> Charlie Lind-Thomsen, Albert Sneppen, Charles L. Steinhardt </p>
<p>
The interstellar medium (ISM) consists of a diversity of structures across a range of spatial scales, intimately tied to galactic evolution. In this work, Fourier analysis is used to characterize the spatial structures of dust and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the ISM of PHANGS-JWST galaxies, observed in the four photometric mid-infrared (MIR) filters from F770W to F2100W (i.e., 7.7 to 21&mu;m)). We quantify the abundance of structure on different spatial scales using the power-law slope, &alpha;, of the spatial power spectra. The distribution of &alpha; across all length scales differs significantly between filters, with steeper slopes for PAH-dominated filters (&alpha;_F770W = 2.19^+0.16_-0.15, &alpha;_F1130W = 1.88^+0.25_-0.37) and shallower for the dust-continuum (&alpha;_F1000W = 1.48^+0.33_-0.47, &alpha;_F2100W = 0.94^+0.23_-0.28). The distribution of &alpha; across galaxies is narrower for PAH-dominated than for thermal dust-dominated bands, highlighting that PAHs trace photo-dissociation regions dominated by similar physical processes, whereas dust structures are an integrated property over the diverse evolutionary histories of their host galaxies. Unlike dust structures, PAH-sensitive bands display a break in the power spectrum: below a characteristic scale, &ell;_0=160pc^+110pc_-50pc, PAH structures are suppressed.

We release a spectroscopic redshift catalogue of sources in the Abell 2744 cluster field, derived from JWST/NIRISS observations taken as part of the GLASS-JWST Early Release Science programme. We describe the data reduction, contamination modelling and source detection, as well as the data quality assessment, redshift determination and validation. The catalogue consists of 354 secure and 134 tentative redshifts, of which 245 are new spectroscopic redshifts, spanning a range 0.1 ≤ z ≤ 8.2. These include 17 galaxies at the cluster redshift, one galaxy at z ≈ 8, and a triply-imaged galaxy at z = 2.653 ± 0.002. Comparing against galaxies with existing spectroscopic redshifts z<sub>spec</sub>, we find a small offset of &Delta; z = (z<sub>spec</sub> - z_NIRISS )/(1 + z<sub>spec</sub> ) = (1.3 ± 1.6) × 10^-3. We also release a forced extraction tool "pygrife" and a visualisation tool "pygcg" to the community, to aid with the reduction and classification of grism data. This catalogue will enable future studies of the spatially-resolved properties of galaxies throughout cosmic noon, including dust attenuation and star formation. As the first exploitation of the catalogue, we discuss the spectroscopic confirmation of multiple image systems, and the identification of multiple overdensities at 1 &lt; z &lt; 2.7.

### 69) [2504.00075](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00075v1): Massive Black Holes Seeded by Dark Matter &ndash; Implications for Little Red Dots and Gravitational Wave Signatures

<p> Tingwei Shen, Xuejian Shen, Huangyu Xiao, Mark Vogelsberger, Fangzhou Jiang </p>
<p>
Observations of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshifts challenge standard seeding scenarios. We examine a dissipative self-interacting dark matter (dSIDM) model in which gravothermal collapse leads to the formation of massive BH seeds ab initio. We utilize a semi-analytical framework to predict properties of the dSIDM-seeded SMBH population. Billion solar mass quasars are reproduced along with low-mass faint active galactic nuclei (known as little red dots) with SMBH-to-galaxy stellar mass ratios consistent with recent James Webb Space Telescope observations. To match the abundance of the observed bright quasars, a percent-level duty-cycle is suggested, implying a large population of dormant SMBHs. The gravitational wave (GW) signals from mergers of these massive SMBHs can be detected by LISA while remaining within the NANOGrav constraints on the GW background. These results provide testable signatures of DM-driven SMBH formation, offering a pathway to probe hidden-sector physics through SMBH and GW observables.

<p> Philippe André, Michael Mattern, Doris Arzoumanian, Yoshito Shimajiri, Annie Zavagno, Daisei Abe, Delphine Russeil </p>
<p>
Dense filaments are believed to be representative of the initial conditions of star formation in molecular clouds. We have used the MIRI instrument on JWST to image the massive filament NGC6334M at d~1.3 kpc with unprecedented resolution and dynamic range at 7.7 and 25.5 microns. Our observations reveal the fine structure of the filament in absorption against mid-infrared background emission. From the absorption data, we derive high-resolution column density maps and perform a detailed analysis of the filament structure. We find a median filament width of 0.12+/-0.02 pc at both wavelengths, resolved by almost two orders of magnitude by MIRI, and consistent with the typical half-power width of Herschel filaments in nearby (d&lt;0.5 kpc) clouds. The JWST data also reveal the presence of a quasi-periodic series of side filaments with a similar projected spacing of 0.125+/-0.015 pc. Combining our JWST results with Spitzer and APEX/Herschel data, we perform a study of cloud structure over four orders of magnitude in linear scale. A convergence test shows that our width estimates for NGC6334M are robust and reflect the presence of a true characteristic scale. While there is evidence of a Kolmogorov-like spectrum of small-scale fluctuations down the 1.6x10^-3 pc resolution of the JWST observations, we identify a break in the power spectrum of column density fluctuations at a scale ~0.1-0.4 pc comparable to the width of NGC6334M and its side filaments. This characteristic scale ~0.1pc has important implications for the origin of the star formation efficiency in dense gas and the IMF.

<p>
The Lyman-break technique has been used to successfully identify high-redshift candidates in broad-band photometric data in the rest-frame optical and NIR using the dropout technique. We pioneer the application of this technique to new wavelength regimes, and search for dropouts in combined ALMA and JWST data. We find a candidate that is undetected in NIRCam imaging including and blueward of the F444W filter, but clearly identified in ALMA band 3. Assuming this is a Lyman-break candidate, we measure a redshift in the range 40 &lt; z &lt; 21 380. This is the highest redshift galaxy candidate discovered to date, and is in significant tension with current and future predictions from cosmological simulations, with implications for galaxy evolution in the (very) early Universe.

### 72) [2503.23202](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23202v1): Using Wavelet Decomposition to Determine the Dimension of Structures from Projected Images

<p> Svitlana Mayboroda, David N Spergel </p>
<p>
Mesoscale structures can often be described as fractional dimensional across a wide range of scales. We consider a &gamma; dimensional measure embedded in an N dimensional space and discuss how to determine its dimension, both in N dimensions and projected into D dimensions. It is a highly non-trivial problem to decode the original geometry from lower dimensional projection of a high-dimensional measure. The projections are space-feeling, the popular box-counting techniques do not apply, and the Fourier methods are contaminated by aliasing effects. In the present paper we demonstrate that under the "Copernican hypothesis'' that we are not observing objects from a special direction, projection in a wavelet basis is remarkably simple: the wavelet power spectrum of a projected &gamma; dimensional measure is P_j &prop; 2^-j&gamma;. This holds regardless of the embedded dimension, N, and the projected dimension, D. This approach could have potentially broad applications in data sciences where a typically sparse matrix encodes lower dimensional information embedded in an extremely high dimensional field and often measured in projection to a low dimensional space. Here, we apply this method to JWST and Chandra observations of the nearby supernova Cas A. We find that the emissions can be represented by projections of mesoscale substructures with fractal dimensions varying from &gamma; = 1.7 for the warm CO layer observed by JWST, up to &gamma; = 2.5 for the hot X-ray emitting gas layer in the supernova remnant. The resulting power law indicates that the emission is coming from a fractal dimensional mesoscale structure likely produced by magneto-hydrodynamical instabilities in the expanding supernova shell.

### 73) [2503.22130](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22130v1): The Formation of Direct Collapse Black Holes at Cosmic Dawn and 21 cm Global Spectrum

<p> Meng Zhang, Bin Yue, Yidong Xu, Andrea Ferrara </p>
<p>
JWST reveals numerous high-z galaxies and Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs), suggesting that stars and SMBH seeds formation at z ≳ 10 may be more efficient than previously derived. One popular SMBH seed scenario is the Direct Collapse Black Holes (DCBHs) formed in pristine atomic-cooling halos irradiated by nearby galaxies. Therefore, the efficient star formation likely facilitates the formation of DCBH. We calculate the first critical k_H<sub>2</sub>-k_H^- curves for DCBH formation under the influence of X-ray radiation using the one-zone model. We then build the UV luminosity function consistent with JWST observations and incorporate it into the model that calculates the DCBH-triggering probability. We confirm that enhanced star formation promotes the DCBH formation. However, the DCBH abundance n_DCBH is significantly influenced by the X-ray radiation that is also related to star formation. Since the 21 cm global spectrum is also X-ray dependent, the 21 cm absorption depth &delta; T_b^trough at Cosmic Dawn encodes the DCBH abundance information. We provide a tentative trend in the n_DCBH - &delta; T^trough_b relation, which could be a useful guide. In our fiducial model, if &delta; T_b^trough≳ -100 mK, then the DCBH is rather rare; if -150~mK ≲ &delta; T_b^trough≲ -100 mK, n_DCBH ~ O(10^-2-10^-3) cMpc^-3 (comoving Mpc^-3), consistent with the HST/JWST observed SMBHs abundance at z≳ 6; if &delta; T_b^trough≲ -150 mK, n_DCBH can largely exceed O(10^-2) cMpc^-3. The 21 cm global spectrum observations will help to constrain the DCBH abundance.

<p>
We present the analysis of the multi-phase gas properties in the Seyfert II galaxy NGC 424, using spatially resolved spectroscopic data from JWST/MIRI, part of the Mid-InfraRed Activity of Circumnuclear Line Emission (MIRACLE) program, as well as VLT/MUSE and ALMA. We trace the properties of the multi-phase medium, from cold and warm molecular gas to hot ionised gas, using emission lines such as CO(2-1), H2 S(1), [OIII]5007, [NeIII]15, and [NeV]14. These lines reveal the intricate interplay between the different gas phases within the circumnuclear region, spanning approximately 1.4x1.4 kpc<sup>2</sup>, with a resolution of 10 pc. Exploiting the multi-wavelength and multi-scale observations of gas emission we model the galaxy disc rotation curve from scales of a few parsec up to 5 kpc from the nucleus and infer a dynamical mass of 1.09±0.08x10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> with a disc scale radius of 0.48±0.02 kpc. We detect a compact ionised outflow with velocities up to 10^3 km/s, traced by the [OIII], [NeIII], and [NeV] transitions, with no evidence of cold or warm molecular outflows. We suggest that the ionised outflow might be able to inject a significant amount of energy into the circumnuclear region, potentially hindering the formation of a molecular wind, as the molecular gas is observed to be denser and less diffuse. The combined multi-band observations also reveal, in all gas phases, a strong enhancement of the gas velocity dispersion directed along the galaxy minor axis, perpendicular to the high-velocity ionised outflow, and extending up to 1 kpc from the nucleus. Our findings suggest that the outflow might play a key role in such enhancement by injecting energy into the host disc and perturbing the ambient material.

<p> Bangzheng Sun, Haojing Yan </p>
<p>
We report an extremely tight, linear relation between H&alpha; and [O III] line fluxes in logarithm, discovered using a large sample of low and mid-resolution spectra (totaling 563) obtained by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec instrument in three widely separated extragalactic fields. While a certain correlation between H&alpha; and [O III] is expected for star forming galaxies, such a log-linear and tight (dispersion of ~0.1 dex) and trend is hard to explain because dust reddening would skew any intrinsic relation between the two. Furthermore, another surprising finding emerges from investigating the dust reddening properties of these galaxies. We find that the classic method of using the Balmer decrements under the standard Case B assumption does not work: a high fraction (~40&percnt;) of our objects have H&alpha;/H&beta; line ratios even smaller than the canonical Case B ratio of 2.86. Such a high fraction of non-Case B Balmer decrements is also present in other JWST and ground-based spectroscopic studies, but the universal applicability of the Case B assumption was not questioned until recently. The mysterious H&alpha;&ndash;[O III] correlation and the high fraction of non-Case B Balmer decrements, which may or may not be related, should be further investigated to put our spectral analysis onto a more solid footing.

### 76) [2503.21879](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21879v1): A rapid channel for the collisional formation and gravitational wave driven mergers of supermassive black hole seeds at high redshift

<p> Antti Rantala, Thorsten Naab </p>
<p>
Motivated by JWST observations of dense, clumpy and clustered high redshift star formation, we simulate the hierarchical assembly of nine M_cl=10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> star clusters using the BIFROST N-body code. Our low metallicity models (0.01Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) with post-Newtonian equations of motion for black holes include evolving populations of single, binary and triple stars. Massive stars grow by stellar collisions and collapse into intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) up to M<sub>&bull;</sub>~6200 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, stellar multiplicity boosting the IMBH masses by a factor of 2&ndash;3. The IMBHs tidally disrupt (TDE) ~50 stars in 10 Myr with peak TDE rates of \Gamma~10^-5 yr^-1 per cluster. These IMBHs are natural seeds for supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and the hierarchical assembly frequently leads to &gt;2 SMBH seeds per cluster and their rapid mergers (t&lt;10 Myr). We propose that a gravitational wave (GW) driven merger of IMBHs with 1000 M<sub>&odot;</sub> ≲ M<sub>&bull;</sub> ≲ 10000 M<sub>&odot;</sub> with comparable masses is a characteristic GW fingerprint of SMBH seed formation at redshifts z&gt;10, and IMBH formation in similar environments at lower redshifts. Massive star clusters provide a unique environment for the early Universe GW studies for the next-generation GW observatories including the Einstein Telescope and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.

We have not yet observed the epoch at which disc galaxies emerge in the Universe. While high-z measurements of large-scale features such as bars and spiral arms trace the evolution of disc galaxies, such methods cannot directly quantify featureless discs in the early Universe. Here we identify a substantial population of apparently featureless disc galaxies in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey by combining quantitative visual morphologies of ~ 7,000 galaxies from the Galaxy Zoo JWST CEERS project with a public catalogue of expert visual and parametric morphologies. While the highest-redshift featured disc we identify is at z<sub>phot</sub>=5.5, the highest-redshift featureless disc we identify is at z<sub>phot</sub>=7.4. The distribution of S\'ersic indices for these featureless systems suggests that they truly are dynamically cold: disc-dominated systems have existed since at least z~ 7.4. We place upper limits on the featureless disc fraction as a function of redshift, and show that up to 75&percnt; of discs are featureless at 3.0&lt;z&lt;7.4. This is a conservative limit assuming all galaxies in the sample truly lack features. With further consideration of redshift effects and observational constraints, we find the featureless disc fraction in CEERS imaging at these redshifts is more likely ~29-38&percnt;. We hypothesise that the apparent lack of features in a third of high-redshift discs is due to a higher gas fraction in the early Universe, which allows the discs to be resistant to buckling and instabilities.

### 78) [2503.21870](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21870v3): A High-Caliber View of the Bullet Cluster Through JWST Strong and Weak Lensing Analyses

<p>
The Bullet Cluster (1E 0657-56) is a key astrophysical laboratory for studying dark matter, galaxy cluster mergers, and shock propagation in extreme environments. Using new JWST imaging, we present the highest-resolution mass reconstruction to date, combining 146 strong lensing constraints from 37 systems with high-density (398 sources arcmin^-2) weak lensing data, without assuming that light traces mass. The main cluster's mass distribution is highly elongated (NW-SE) and consists of at least three subclumps aligned with the brightest cluster galaxies. The subcluster is more compact but elongated along the E-W direction, with a single dominant peak. We also detect a possible mass and ICL trail extending from the subcluster's eastern side toward the main cluster. Notably, these detailed features are closely traced by the intracluster light, with a modified Hausdorff distance of 19.80 ± 12.46 kpc. Together with multi-wavelength data, the complex mass distribution suggests that the merger history of the Bullet Cluster may be more complex than previous binary cluster merger scenarios.

Recent studies of gas kinematics at high redshift have reported disky systems which appear to challenge models of galaxy formation, but it is unclear whether they are representative of the underlying galaxy population. We present the first statistical sample of spatially resolved ionised gas kinematics at high redshift, comprised of 272 H&alpha; emitters in GOODS-S and GOODS-N at redshifts z≈3.9-6.5, observed with JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopy and imaging from JADES, FRESCO and CONGRESS. The sample probes two orders of magnitude in stellar mass (log (M<sub>&sext;</sub>[M<sub>&odot;</sub>])≈8-10) and star formation rate (SFR≈0.3-100\thinspace M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr), and is representative down to log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>[M<sub>&odot;</sub>])≈ 9. Using a novel inference tool, ttgeko, we model the grism data to measure morphological and kinematic properties of the ionised gas, as probed by H&alpha;. Our results are consistent with a decrease of the rotational support v/&sigma;_0 and increase of the velocity dispersion &sigma;_0 with redshift, with &sigma;_0≈100 km/s and v/&sigma;_0≈1-2 at z≈3.9-6.5. We study the relations between &sigma;_0, and v/&sigma;_0, and different star formation tracers and find a large scatter and diversity, with the strongest correlations between &sigma;_0 and SFR and SFR surface density. The fraction of rotationally supported systems (v/&sigma;_0&gt;1) slightly increases with cosmic time, from (36±6)&percnt; to (41±6)&percnt; from z~ 5.5 to z~ 4.5, for galaxies with masses 9&lt;log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>[M<sub>&odot;</sub>])&lt;10. Overall, disks do not dominate the turbulent high-redshift galaxy population in the mass range probed by this work. When placed in the context of studies up to cosmic noon, our results are consistent with a significant increase of disk-like systems with cosmic time.

How radial flows shape galaxy structure and evolution remains an open question. Internal drivers of such flows, such as bars and spiral arms, known to mediate gas flows in the local Universe, are now observable at high redshift thanks to JWST's unobscured view. We investigate the morphology of massive star-forming galaxies at 0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.3 and 2.0 &lt; z &lt; 2.5, epochs marking the peak and decline of cosmic star formation, both well-covered by kinematic surveys. Using JWST/NIRCam imaging, we visually classify 1,451 galaxies, identify non-axisymmetric features, count the number of spiral arms, analyze non-parametric morphological indicators and study the dynamical support of the sample covered by kinematics (10% of the sample) as measured via v/&sigma;. Disk galaxies dominate the sample (82%), with 48% exhibiting spiral structure and 11% hosting bars. Both fractions decline with redshift, consistent with previous studies. The proportion of two- and three-armed spirals remains largely unchanged across redshift, with roughly two-thirds showing two arms and one-third showing three arms in both bins. Notably, we find a higher incidence of three-armed spirals than reported in the local Universe, suggesting a mild evolution in spiral arm multiplicity. Non-parametric morphological metrics strongly correlate with stellar mass but show no significant redshift evolution. Finally, kinematic analysis reveals a strong correlation between disk morphology and rotational support, with most disks exhibiting v/&sigma; &gt; 3 and median values of v/&sigma; &gt; 7 for spirals and v/&sigma; &gt; 5 for barred galaxies. This study establishes a population-wide framework for linking galaxy morphology and dynamics at cosmic noon, providing a key reference for future studies on the role of detailed structural features in galaxy evolution.

### 81) [2503.21724](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21724v1): Ram-pressure stripping caught in action in a forming galaxy cluster 3 billion years after the Big Bang

Galaxy clusters in the local Universe are dominated by massive quiescent galaxies with old ages, formed at high redshifts. It is debated whether their quenching is driven by internal processes or environmental effects, which has been challenging due to the lack of observations during their peak formation epoch. Here we report clear evidence from ALMA of extended and elongated gas tails in nine galaxies in a forming cluster at z = 2.51. The distinct gas distribution compared to the stellar emission probed by JWST, which is rather isolated without signatures of mergers or interactions, provides evidence of ram-pressure stripping (RPS). This represents the most distant confirmed case of RPS, highlighting the critical role of environmental effects in gas removal at high redshifts, an often overlooked quenching pathway.

### 82) [2503.21706](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21706v1): Flashlights: Prospects for constraining the Initial Mass Function around cosmic noon with caustic-crossing events

<p> Ashish Kumar Meena, Sung Kei Li, Adi Zitrin, Patrick L. Kelly, Tom Broadhurst, Wenlei Chen, Jose M. Diego, Alexei V. Filippenko, Lukas J. Furtak, Liliya L. R. Williams </p>
<p>
The Flashlights program with the Hubble Space Telescope imaged the six Hubble Frontier Fields galaxy clusters in two epochs and detected twenty transients. These are primarily expected to be caustic-crossing events (CCEs) where bright stars in distant lensed galaxies, typically at redshift z≈1&ndash;3, get temporarily magnified close to cluster caustics. Since CCEs are generally biased toward more massive and luminous stars, they offer a unique route for probing the high end of the stellar mass function. We take advantage of the Flashlights event statistics to place preliminary constraints on the stellar initial mass function (IMF) around cosmic noon. The photometry (along with spectral information) of lensed arcs is used to infer their various stellar properties, and stellar synthesis models are used to evolve a recent stellar population in them. We estimate the microlens surface density near each arc and, together with existing lens models and simple formalism for CCEs, calculate the expected rate for a given IMF. We find that, on average, a Salpeter-like IMF (&alpha;=2.35) underpredicts the number of observed CCEs by a factor of ~0.7, and a top-heavy IMF (&alpha;=1.00) overpredicts by a factor of ~1.7, suggesting that the average IMF slope may lie somewhere in between. However, given the large uncertainties associated with estimating the stellar populations, these results are strongly model-dependent. Nevertheless, we introduce a useful framework for constraining the IMF using CCEs. Observations with JWST are already yielding many more CCEs and will soon enable more stringent constraints on the IMF at a range of redshifts.

### 83) [2503.21687](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21687v1): Exploiting synergies between JWST and cosmic 21-cm observations to uncover star formation in the early Universe

<p>
In the current era of JWST, we continue to uncover a wealth of information about the Universe deep into the Epoch of Reionization. In this work, we run a suite of simulations using the code 21cmSPACE, to explore the astrophysical properties of galaxies in the early Universe, and their impact on high-redshift observables. We use multi-wavelength observational data including the global 21-cm signal and power spectrum limits from SARAS~3 and HERA respectively, present-day diffuse X-ray and radio backgrounds, and UV luminosity functions (UVLFs) from HST and JWST in the range z=6-14.5 to derive our constraints. We constrain a flexible model of halo-mass and redshift dependent star-formation efficiency (SFE), defined as the gas fraction converted into stars, and find that it is best described by little to no redshift evolution at z≈6-10 and rapid evolution at z≈10-15. We derive Bayesian functional posterior distributions for the SFE across this redshift range, inferring that a halo of mass M_h=10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> has an efficiency of 2-3&percnt; at z≲10, 12&percnt; at z=12 and 26&percnt; at z=15. We also find, through synergy between SARAS~3 and UVLFs, that the minimum circular velocity for star-formation in halos is V_c = 16.9^+25.7_-9.5 km s<sup>-1</sup> or equivalently log_10(M_crit/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 8.29^+1.21_-1.08 at z=6. Alongside these star-formation constraints, we find the X-ray and radio efficiencies of early galaxies to be f_X = 0.5^+6.3_-0.3 and f_r ≲ 11.7 respectively, improving upon existing works that do not use UVLF data. Our results demonstrate the critical role of UVLFs in constraining the early Universe, and its synergies with 21-cm observations, alongside other multi-wavelength observational datasets.

<p>
We present the survey design and initial results from the Parallel Ionizing Emissivity (PIE) survey. PIE is a large HST survey designed to detect Lyman continuum (LyC) emitting galaxies at 3.1&lt;z&lt;3.5 and stack the images of galaxies at these redshifts in order to measure average LyC escape fractions as a function of galaxy properties. PIE has imaged 37 independent fields in three filters (F336W, F625W and F814W), of which 18 are observed with a fourth band (F475W) from the accompanying PIE+ program. We use photometric colors to select candidate Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) at 3.1&lt;z&lt;3.5, which can be followed-up using ground-based spectrographs to confirm their redshifts. Unlike previous surveys, our use of many independent fields allows us to remove any biases caused by correlated absorption in the IGM. In this paper, we describe the survey design, photometric measurements, and the use of mock galaxy samples to optimize our color selection. We find that a 3-filter selection allows us to select a galaxy sample of which ≈90&percnt; are LBGs and over 30&percnt; lie in the 3.1&lt;z&lt;3.5 range for which we can detect uncontaminated LyC emission in F336W. We also use mock IGM sightlines to measure the expected transmission of the IGM, which will allow us to determine escape fractions from our stacked galaxies. We find ≈1000 galaxies within our selection window, and predict that this includes ≈80 LyC-emitting galaxies and ≈350 that we can use in stacking. Finally, we present our first ground-based spectra, including a plausible LyC emitter at z=3.067.

### 85) [2503.20721](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20721v1): Imprints of Stellar Feedback on Magnetic Fields in the Iris Nebula NGC 7023

<p> Ekta Sharma, Kate Pattle, Di Li, Chang Won Lee, Maheswar Gopinathan, Tao-Chung Ching, Mehrnoosh Tahani, Shinyoung Kim </p>
<p>
We present 850 &mu;m polarized continuum observations carried out with the POL-2 polarimeter mounted on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) towards NGC 7023 located in the Cepheus Flare region. NGC 7023 is a reflection nebula powered by a Herbig Ae Be star HD 200775 and also identified as a hub in the hub-filament cloud, LDN 1172/1174. We detect submillimetre emission well towards the northern (identified as C1) and the eastern region of the reflection nebula. We investigated the polarization structure and the magnetic field (B-field) morphology, which is found to be curved and follows the clump morphology. The comparison of the B-field morphology at the clump scales (~0.02 pc) with that of the envelope (~0.5 pc) suggests that the field lines are not preserved from envelope to clump scales, implying that an external factor may be responsible for disturbing the B-field structure. We estimated a magnetic field strength of 179±50 &mu;G in the starless core, 121±34 &mu;G in the protostellar core with a class I source and 150±42 &mu;G in the protostellar core with a class II source using the N<sub>2</sub>H^+ (1-0) line observed with 13.7 m single dish radio telescope at Taeduk Radio Astronomy Observatory (TRAO). The stability analysis using these B-field strengths gives magnetically sub-critical values, while the magnetic, gravitational, and outflow kinetic energies are roughly balanced. We also suggest that the reordering of the magnetic field lines could be due to the interaction with the already evolved high-velocity outflow gas around the central star, which hints at the presence of outflow feedback.

<p>
We present a detailed 3D photoionization model of the planetary nebula NGC 3132, constrained by the latest observations. Using the MOCASSIN code, the model incorporates integrated and spatially resolved spectroscopy, velocity-resolved line profiles, emission line maps, and photometry, including recent high-quality data from MUSE (VLT) and JWST among others. Based on new data from the SAMFP instrument at SOAR, the three-dimensional density structure of the nebula was obtained by assuming homologous expansion of the surrounding nebular gas. The final fitted model successfully reproduces all key observational constraints available, particularly in terms of the detailed emission line integrated fluxes and ionization structures across different ionic stages. The results of the model show that the progenitor star had a mass of (2.7 ± 0.2)M<sub>&odot;</sub> and is surrounded by a He poor shell of dust and gas. The abundances of He, C, N, O, and S determined by the model show that the nebula has C/O=(2.02 ± 0.28) and N/O=(0.39 ± 0.38) consistent with the progenitor mass found.

[Abridged] SFGs are the dominant population in the faint radio sky, corresponding to flux densities at 1.4 GHz &lt; 0.1 mJy. A panchromatic approach is essential for selecting SFGs in the radio band and understanding star formation processes over cosmic time. Semi-empirical models are valuable tools to effectively study galaxy formation and evolution, relying on minimal assumptions and exploiting empirical relations between galaxy properties and enabling us to take full advantage of the recent progress in radio and optical/near-infrared (NIR) observations. In this paper, we develop the Semi-EMPirical model for Extragalactic Radio emission (SEMPER) to predict radio luminosity functions and number counts at 1.4 GHz and 150 MHz for SFGs. SEMPER is based on state-of-the-art empirical relations and combines the redshift-dependent galaxy stellar mass functions obtained from the recent COSMOS2020 catalogue, which exploits deep near-infrared observations, with up-to-date observed scaling relations, such as the galaxy main sequence and the mass-dependent far-infrared/radio correlation across cosmic time. Our luminosity functions are compared with recent observational determinations from several radio telescopes, along with previous semi-empirical models and simulations. Our semi-empirical model successfully reproduces the observed luminosity functions at 1.4 GHz and 150 MHz up to z~ 5 and the most recent number count statistics from radio observations in the LoTSS deep fields. Our model, based on galaxies selected in the NIR, naturally predicts the presence of radio-selected massive and/or dust-obscured galaxies already in place at high redshift (z≳3.5), as suggested by recent results from JWST. Our predictions offer an excellent benchmark for upcoming updates from JWST and future ultra-deep radio surveys planned with the SKA and its precursors.

### 88) [2503.20415](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20415v1): Massive black hole formation in Population III star clusters

<p> B. Reinoso, M. A. Latif, D. R. G. Schleicher </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that challenge existing black hole (BH) formation models. These newly observed BHs are overmassive compared to the host galaxies and have an unexpectedly high abundance. Their exact origin remains elusive. The primary goal of this work is to investigate the formation of massive BH seeds in dense Population III (Pop III) star clusters. Using a cosmological simulation of Pop III cluster formation, we present models for the assembly and subsequent evolution of these clusters. The models account for background gas potential, stellar collisions and associated mass loss, gas accretion, stellar growth, their initial mass function (IMF), and subsequent star formation. We conduct N-body simulations of these models over a span of 2 million years. Our results show that BHs of &gt; 400 M<sub>&odot;</sub> are formed in all cases, reaching up to ~ 5000 M<sub>&odot;</sub> under optimistic yet reasonable conditions and potentially exceeding 10^4 M<sub>&odot;</sub> provided that high accretion rates of 10^-3 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1 onto the stars can be sustained. We conclude that massive BHs can be formed in Pop III stellar clusters and are likely to remain within their host clusters. These BHs may experience further growth as they sink into the galaxy's potential well. This formation channel should be given further consideration in models of galaxy formation and BH demographics.

### 89) [2503.20147](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20147v1): Infrared Emission of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Molecules in Titan: Cyanonaphthalenes

<p> Li Zhou, Kaijun Li, Aigen Li, Zheng Zhou </p>
<p>
As the only moon in the solar system with a thick atmosphere, Titan is a compelling and enigmatic world containing a complex organic haze. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules are believed to play an essential role in the formation of Titan's aerosols and haze layers. The existence of PAHs in Titan's upper atmosphere has been revealed by the detection of the 3.28-micron emission band with Cassini's Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS). However, there is little knowledge about the identity, composition, size and abundance of PAH molecules in Titan's atmosphere. Due to its unprecedented sensitivity and spectral coverage and resolution, the advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) could possibly enable a full characterization of the chemical makeups of Titan's aerosols. In particular, with a much better spectral resolution than Cassini's VIMS, JWST's Near Infrared Spectrograph (and Mid Infrared Instrument) could enable the spectral bands to be better resolved, potentially providing crucial information about which PAHs are really present in Titan's upper atmosphere. To facilitate JWST to search for and identify Titan's PAH molecules, we are performing a systematic study of the photophysics of PAHs in Titan's upper atmosphere. As a pilot study, here we report the infrared emission spectra of vibrationally excited cyanonapthalenes and their ions which are composed of two fused benzene rings and one nitrile (-CN) group. The calculated emission spectra will help JWST to quantitatively determine or place an upper limit on the abundances of cyanonapthalenes in Titan's upper atmosphere.

<p>
Almost all globular clusters (GCs) contain multiple populations consisting of stars with varying helium and light-element abundances. These populations include first-population stars, which exhibit similar chemical compositions to halo-field stars with comparable [Fe/H], and second-population stars, characterized by enhanced He and N abundances along with reduced levels of O and C. Nowadays, one of the most intriguing open questions about GCs pertains to the formation and evolution of their multiple populations. Recent works based on N-body simulations of GCs show that the fractions and characteristics of binary stars can serve as dynamic indicators of the formation period of multiple-population in GCs and their subsequent dynamical evolution. Nevertheless, the incidence of binaries among multiple populations is still poorly studied. Moreover, the few available observational studies are focused only on the bright stars of a few GCs. In this work, we use deep images of the GC 47 Tucanae collected with the JWST and HST to investigate the incidence of binaries among multiple populations of M-dwarfs and bright main-sequence stars. To reach this objective, we use UV, optical, and near infrared filters to construct photometric diagrams that allow us to disentangle binary systems and multiple populations. Moreover, we compared these observations with a large sample of simulated binaries. In the cluster central regions, the incidence of binaries among first-population stars is only slightly higher than that of second-population stars. In contrast, in the external regions, the majority (&gt;85%) of the studied binaries are composed of first population stars. Results are consistent with the GC formation scenarios where the second-population stars originate in the cluster's central region, forming a compact and dense stellar group within a more extended system of first-population stars

<p>
We present the MIRI EGS Galaxy and AGN (MEGA) survey, a four band MIRI survey with 25 pointing in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) extragalactic field. Three of the pointings utilized only the three reddest bands (F1000W, F1500W, F2100W) while the remainder of the pointings also add a blue filter (F770W). MEGA builds upon the existing observations in the EGS field by providing MIRI imaging for 68.9% of CEERS NIRCam imaging, filling a cruciality gap in order to understand galaxy evolution by observing the obscured Universe. Here, we present the technical design, data reduction, photometric catalog creation, the first data release, and science drivers of the MEGA survey. Our data reduction starts with the standard JWST calibration pipeline, but adds additional warm pixel masking and custom background subtraction steps to improve the quality of the final science image. We estimate the image depth of the reduced mosaics and present new galaxy number counts in four MIRI bands.

### 92) [2503.19020](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19020v1): A Spectroscopic Survey of Metal-Poor OB Stars in Local Dwarf Galaxy NGC 3109

<p> Abby Mintz, O. Grace Telford, Evan N. Kirby, John Chisholm, Kristen B. W. McQuinn, Danielle Berg </p>
<p>
As JWST uncovers increasingly strong evidence that metal-poor, massive stars in early galaxies dominated reionization, observational constraints on the properties of such stars are more relevant than ever before. However, spectra of individual O- and B-type stars are rare at the relevant metallicities (≲ 0.2 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>), leaving models of stellar evolution and ionizing flux poorly constrained by data in this regime. We present new medium-resolution (R~ 4000) Keck/DEIMOS optical spectra of 17 OB stars in the local low-metallicity (0.12 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) dwarf galaxy NGC 3109. We assign spectral types to the stars and present new criteria for selecting O stars using optical and NUV photometry from Hubble Space Telescope imaging. We fit the spectra and photometry with grids of stellar atmosphere models to measure stellar temperatures, surface gravities, luminosities, radii, and masses. We find evidence of strong mass loss via radiation-driven stellar winds in two O stars, one of which is the hottest, youngest, and most massive star confirmed in the host galaxy to date. Though its spectrum does not meet conventional Wolf-Rayet spectral classification criteria, this metal-poor O If star produces strong He II 4686 emission and its evolutionary status is ambiguous. This work nearly doubles the number of OB stars with measured parameters in NGC 3109, including ten stars with no previously reported parameters, four with no published spectroscopy, and four binary candidates. This large sample of OB stellar parameters provides a new observational testbed to constrain the stellar astrophysics that drove cosmic reionization and influenced the evolution of the earliest galaxies.

### 93) [2503.18850](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18850v1): Beyond the first galaxies primordial black holes shine

<p> Antonio Matteri, Andrea Ferrara, Andrea Pallottini </p>
<p>
The presence of nine candidate galaxies at z=17 and z=25 discovered by the itJames Webb Space Telescope in relatively small sky areas, if confirmed, is virtually impossible to reconcile with current galaxy formation model predictions. We show here that the implied UV luminosity density can be produced by a population of primordial black holes (PBH) of mass M_PBH = 10^4-5   M<sub>&odot;</sub> residing in low-mass halos (M_h ≈ 10^7   M<sub>&odot;</sub>), and accreting at a moderate fraction of the Eddington luminosity, &lambda;_E ≃ 0.36. These sources precede the first significant episodes of cosmic star formation. At later times, as star formation is ignited, PBH emission becomes comparable or subdominant with respect to the galactic one. Such a PBH+galaxy scenario reconciles the evolution of the UV LF from z=25 to z=11. If ultra-early sources are purely powered by accretion, this strongly disfavours seed production mechanisms requiring the presence of stars (massive/Pop III stars or clusters) or their UV radiation (direct collapse BHs), leaving PBH as the only alternative solution available so far. Alternative explanations, such as isolated, large clusters (≈ 10^7   M<sub>&odot;</sub>) of massive (m<sub>&sext;</sub> =10^3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) of Pop III are marginally viable, but require extreme and unlikely conditions, that can be probed via UV/FIR emission lines or gravitational waves.

The PHANGS project is assembling a comprehensive, multi-wavelength dataset of nearby (~5-20 Mpc), massive star-forming galaxies to enable multi-phase, multi-scale investigations into the processes that drive star formation and galaxy evolution. To date, large survey programs have provided molecular gas (CO) cubes with ALMA, optical IFU spectroscopy with VLT/MUSE, high-resolution NUV&ndash;optical imaging in five broad-band filters with HST, and infrared imaging in NIRCAM+MIRI filters with JWST. Here, we present PHANGS-HST-Halpha, which has obtained high-resolution (~2-10 pc), narrow-band imaging in the F658N or F657N filters with the HST/WFC3 camera of the warm ionized gas in the first 19 nearby galaxies observed in common by all four of the PHANGS large programs. We summarize our data reduction process, with a detailed discussion of the production of flux-calibrated, Milky Way extinction corrected, continuum-subtracted Halpha maps. PHANGS-MUSE IFU spectroscopy data are used to background subtract the HST-Halpha maps, and to determine the [NII] correction factors for each galaxy. We describe our public data products and highlight a few key science cases enabled by the PHANGS-HST-Halpha observations.

### 95) [2503.18510](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18510v1): Brown dwarf number density in the JWST COSMOS-Web field

<p>
Brown dwarfs are failed stars with very low mass (13 to 75 M_J), and an effective temperature lower than 2500 K. Thus, they play a key role in understanding the gap in the mass function between stars and planets. However, due to their faint nature, previous searches are inevitably limited to the solar neighbourhood (20 pc). To improve our knowledge of the low mass part of the initial stellar mass function and the star formation history of the Milky Way, it is crucial to find more distant brown dwarfs. Using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) COSMOS-Web data, this study seeks to enhance our comprehension of the physical characteristics of brown dwarfs situated at a distance of kpc scale. The exceptional sensitivity of the JWST enables the detection of brown dwarfs that are up to 100 times more distant than those discovered in the earlier all-sky infrared surveys. The large area coverage of the JWST COSMOS-Web survey allows us to find more distant brown dwarfs than earlier JWST studies with smaller area coverages. To capture prominent water absorption features around 2.7 &mu;m, we apply two colour criteria, F115W-F277W+1&lt;F277W-F444W and F277W-F444W&gt;0.9. We then select point sources by CLASS_STAR, FLUX_RADIUS, and SPREAD_MODEL criteria. Faint sources are visually checked to exclude possibly extended sources. We conduct SED fitting and MCMC simulations to determine their physical properties and associated uncertainties. Our search reveals 25 T-dwarf and 2 Y-dwarf candidates, more than any previous JWST brown dwarf searches. They are located from 0.3 kpc to 4 kpc away from the Earth. The cumulative number count of our brown dwarf candidates is consistent with the prediction from a standard double exponential model. Three of our brown dwarf candidates were detected by HST, with transverse velocities 12±5 km s<sup>-1</sup>, 12±4 km s<sup>-1</sup>, and 17±6 km s<sup>-1</sup>.

### 96) [2503.18326](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18326v1): The properties of the obscuring material of an AGNs sample from mid-IR and X-ray simultaneous fitting

<p>
Over ten mid-infrared (mid-IR) and X-ray models are currently attempting to describe the nuclear obscuring material of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), but many questions remain unresolved. This study aims to determine the physical parameters of the obscuring material in nearby AGNs and explore their relationship with nuclear activity. We selected 24 nearby Seyfert AGNs with X-ray luminosities ranging from 10^41 to 10^44 erg/s, using NuSTAR and Spitzer spectra. Our team fitted the spectra using a simultaneous fitting technique. Then, we compared the resulting parameters with AGN properties, such as bolometric luminosity, accretion rate, and black hole mass. Our analysis shows that dust and gas share a similar structure in most AGNs. Approximately 70% of the sample favors a combination of the X-ray UXclumpy model with the Clumpy and two-phases models at IR wavelengths. We found that linking the half-opening angle and torus angular width parameters from X-ray and mid-IR models helps constrain other parameters and break degeneracies. The study reveals that Sy1 galaxies are characterized by low covering factors, half-opening angles, and column densities but high Eddington rates. In contrast, Sy2 galaxies display higher covering factors and column densities, with a broader range of half-opening angles. We also observed that the distribution of obscuring material is closer to the nucleus in intermediate-luminosity sources, while it is more extended in more luminous AGNs. Our findings reinforce the connection between the properties of gas-dust material within 10 pc and AGN activity. Applying this methodology to a larger sample and incorporating data from facilities such as JWST and XRISM will be crucial in further refining these results.

### 97) [2503.17921](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17921v2): Empirical SED Templates for Star Clusters Observed with HST and JWST: No Strong PAH or IR Dust Emission after Five Myr

<p>
JWST observations, when combined with HST data, promise to improve age estimates of star clusters in nearby spiral galaxies. However, feedback from young cluster stars pushes out the natal gas and dust, making cluster formation and evolution a challenge to model. Here, we use JWST + HST observations of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 628 to produce spectral energy distribution (SED) templates of compact star clusters spanning 275 nm through 21 &mu;m. These preliminary SEDs capture the cluster stars and associated gas and dust within radii of 0.12" to 0.67" (corresponding to 6 to 33 pc at the distance of NGC 628). One important finding is that the SEDs of 1, 2, 3, and 4 Myr clusters can be differentiated in the infrared. Another is that in 80-90% of the cases we study, the PAH and H_alpha emission track one another, with the dust responsible for the 3.3 &mu;m PAH emission largely removed by 4 Myr, consistent with pre-supernova stellar feedback acting quickly on the surrounding gas and dust. Nearly-embedded cluster candidates have infrared SEDs which are quite similar to optically visible 1 to 3 Myr clusters. In nearly all cases we find there is a young star cluster within a few tenths of an arcsec (10 - 30 pc) of the nearly embedded cluster, suggesting the formation of the cluster was triggered by its presence. The resulting age estimates from the empirical templates are compatible both with dynamical estimates based on CO superbubble expansion velocities, and the TODDLERS models which track spherical evolution of homogeneous gas clouds around young stellar clusters.

### 98) [2503.17585](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17585v1): How do Massive Primordial Black Holes Impact the Formation of the First Stars and Galaxies?

<p> Saiyang Zhang, Boyuan Liu, Volker Bromm, Junehyoung Jeon, Michael Boylan-Kolchin, Florian Kuhnel </p>
<p>
We investigate the impact of massive primordial black holes (PBHs; m_BH~ 10^6~M<sub>&odot;</sub>) on the star formation and first galaxy assembly process using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations from z = 1100 to z ~ 9. We find that PBH accretion is self-regulated by feedback, suppressing mass growth unless feedback is weak. PBHs accelerate structure formation by seeding dark matter halos and gravitationally attracting gas, but strong feedback can delay cooling and suppress star formation. In addition, the presence of baryon-dark matter streaming creates an offset between the PBH location and the peaks induced in gas density, promoting earlier and more efficient star formation compared to standard &Lambda;CDM. By z ~ 10, PBH-seeded galaxies form dense star clusters, with PBH-to-stellar mass ratios comparable to observed high-z AGN like UHZ-1. Our results support PBHs as viable SMBH seeds but do not exclude alternative scenarios. We emphasize that PBH-seeding provides a natural explanation for some of the newly-discovered overmassive SMBHs at high redshift, in particular those with extreme ratios of BH-to-dynamical (virial) mass that challenge standard formation channels. Future studies with ultra-deep JWST surveys, the Roman Space Telescope, and radio surveys with facilities such as SKA and HERA will be critical in distinguishing PBH-driven SMBH growth from other pathways.

We leverage JWST's superb resolution to derive strong lensing mass maps of 14 clusters, spanning a redshift range of z~0.25 - 1.06 and a mass range of M_500~2-12 × 10^14M<sub>&odot;</sub>, from the Strong LensIng and Cluster Evolution (SLICE) JWST program. These clusters represent a small subsample of the first clusters observed in the SLICE program that are chosen based on the detection of new multiple image constraints in the SLICE-JWST NIRCam/F150W2 and F322W2 imaging. These constraints include new lensed dusty galaxies and new substructures in previously identified lensed background galaxies. Four clusters have never been modeled before. For the remaining 10 clusters, we present updated models based on JWST and HST imaging and, where available, ground-based spectroscopy. We model the global mass profile for each cluster and report the mass enclosed within 200 and 500 kpc. We report the number of new systems identified in the JWST imaging, which in one cluster is as high as 19 new systems. The addition of new lensing systems and constraints from substructure clumps in lensed galaxies improves the ability of strong lensing models to accurately reproduce the interior mass distribution of each cluster. We also report the discovery of a candidate transient in a lensed image of the galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0516-5755. All lens models and their associated products are available for download at the Strong Lensing Cluster Atlas Data Base, which is hosted at Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille.

<p>
Understanding the coevolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies requires tracing their growth over time. Mass measurements of distant black holes have been limited to active nuclei and commonly rely on spatially unresolved observations, leading to large uncertainties. Accurate masses can be determined by resolving the kinematics of stars within the sphere of influence, which has heretofore been possible only in the local universe. Using JWST, we have measured the mass M<sub>&bull;</sub>=6.0^+2.1_-1.7×10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> of an inactive black hole in a gravitationally lensed quiescent galaxy at redshift z=1.95, along with detailed host properties. Comparisons to local galaxies suggest that the correlation between M<sub>&bull;</sub> and bulge mass has evolved substantially, whereas the correlation with stellar velocity dispersion may have been in place for 10 Gyr.

### 101) [2503.17327](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17327v1): Radio Spectral Energy Distribution of Low-z Metal Poor Extreme Starburst Galaxies: Novel insights on the escape of ionizing photons

<p> Omkar Bait, Daniel Schaerer, Yuri I. Izotov, Biny Sebastian </p>
<p>
Recent optical surveys have found a rare population of low-z (z ~ 0.01 - 0.06) extreme star-forming galaxies (xSFGs) that are the most metal-poor galaxies with strong emission lines, extremely high specific star-formation rate and low stellar mass. Using the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, it was found that xSFGs are strong Ly&alpha; emitters. Their Ly&alpha; properties indirectly suggest that they are also strong Ly continuum (LyC) leakers. This along with several other global properties makes them similar to the recently found z &gt; 6 reionization-era star-forming (SF) galaxies using the James Webb Space Telescope. Here we aim to study the radio spectral energy distribution (radio-SED) of 8 xSFGs to understand mechanisms behind the extreme nature of SF in these galaxies, particularly their high ionisation state and possible strong LyC leakage. We present new radio continuum (RC) observations using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at Band-5 (1060 - 1460 MHz) together with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at S- (2-4 GHz), C- (4-8 GHz), X- (8-12 GHz) and Ku- (12-18 GHz) bands and archival LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) survey data between 120-168 MHz for a few sources. The radio-SED of xSFGs is flat between 6-15 GHz and shows a strong evidence for a turnover at lower frequencies in the range of 2-10 GHz. They can be well described using a thermally dominated radio spectra with a free-free absorption component with a high emission measure. Thus the SF complexes in these galaxies are extremely young (pre-SNe stage; below ~ 5 Myrs) and the ISM is very dense suggesting a dominance of young massive star clusters. This can explain several extreme star-forming properties, along with the potential leakage of a significant amount of LyC photons in metal-poor extreme starburst galaxies. (abridged)

### 102) [2503.16600](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16600v1): A remarkable Ruby: Absorption in dense gas, rather than evolved stars, drives the extreme Balmer break of a Little Red Dot at z=3.5

<p>
The origin of the rest-optical emission of compact, red, high-redshift sources known as `little red dots' (LRDs) poses a major puzzle. If interpreted as starlight, it would imply that LRDs would constitute the densest stellar systems in the Universe. However, alternative models suggest active galactic nuclei (AGN) may instead power the rest-optical continuum. Here, we present JWST/NIRSpec, NIRCam and MIRI observations from the RUBIES and PRIMER programs of The Cliff: a bright LRD at z=3.55 with an exceptional Balmer break, twice as strong as that of any high-redshift source previously observed. The spectra also reveal broad Hydrogen (H&alpha; FWHM~1500km/s) and He I emission, but no significant metal lines. We demonstrate that massive evolved stellar populations cannot explain the observed spectrum, even when considering unusually steep and strong dust attenuation, or reasonable variations in the initial mass function. Moreover, the formally best-fit stellar mass and compact size (M_*~10^10.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, r_e~40 pc) would imply densities at which near-monthly stellar collisions might lead to significant X-ray emission. We argue that the Balmer break, emission lines, and H&alpha; absorption line are instead most plausibly explained by a `black hole star' (BH*) scenario, in which dense gas surrounds a powerful ionising source. In contrast to recently proposed BH* models of dust-reddened AGN, we show that spectral fits in the rest UV to near-infrared favour an intrinsically redder continuum over strong dust reddening. This may point to a super-Eddington accreting massive black hole or, possibly, the presence of (super)massive stars in a nuclear star cluster. The Cliff is the clearest evidence to date that at least some LRDs are not ultra-dense, massive galaxies, and are instead powered by a central ionising source embedded in dense, absorbing gas.

### 103) [2503.16595](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16595v3): JWST's little red dots: an emerging population of young, low-mass AGN cocooned in dense ionized gas

<p>
JWST has uncovered large numbers of compact galaxies at high redshift with broad hydrogen/helium lines. These include the enigmatic population known as "little red dots" (LRDs). Their nature is debated, but they are thought to be powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) or intense star formation. They exhibit unusual properties for SMBHs, such as black holes that are overmassive for their host galaxies and extremely weak X-ray and radio emission. Using the highest-quality JWST spectra, we show here that the lines are broadened by electron scattering with a narrow intrinsic line core. The data require high electron column densities and compact sizes (light days), which, when coupled with their high luminosities can only be explained by SMBH accretion. The narrow intrinsic cores of the lines imply upper limits on the black hole masses of 10^5-7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, two orders of magnitude lower than previous estimates. These are among the lowest mass SMBHs known at high redshift and suggest that this is a population of young, rapidly growing SMBHs. They are enshrouded in a dense cocoon of ionized gas, probably related to their youth, from which they are accreting close to the Eddington limit. Reprocessed nebular emission from the dense cocoon dominates the optical spectrum, explaining most LRD spectral characteristics and helping to suppress radio and X-ray emission.

### 104) [2503.15597](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15597v1): SAPPHIRES: A Galaxy Over-Density in the Heart of Cosmic Reionization at z=8.47

<p>
We report the discovery of a galaxy proto-cluster candidate (dubbed MACS0416-OD-z8p5) at a spectroscopic redshift of z~8.47, dating back to ~550Myr after the Big Bang. The observations are part of the JWST Cycle-3 treasury program, Slitless Areal Pure-Parallel HIgh-Redshift Emission Survey (SAPPHIRES) with NIRCam-grism. Using wide field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) obtained in the MACS0416 parallel field, we robustly confirm nine galaxies at z<sub>spec</sub>~8.47 via emission line detections of [OIII]5008A (with &gt;5 &sigma;) and tentatively confirm one additional galaxy (at ~3 &sigma;). This discovery represents the highest-redshift, spectroscopically confirmed galaxy over-density known to date, which is ~6&ndash;8 times more dense than the average volume density of galaxies at the same redshift. Furthermore, a galaxy hosting a low-mass active galactic nucleus ("Little-Red-Dot'') is found as a member, suggesting an early emergence of active, massive black holes and feedback between these black holes and their surrounding environments. We also discuss the spatial structures connecting the galaxy over-density to nearby massive star-forming galaxies (separated by ~ 5pMpc, including MACS0416-Y1 and MACS0416-JD. This finding of a massive dark matter halo hosting a galaxy over-density at z~8.5 is surprising given that our survey covered only a small, random field (16.5 arcmin<sup>2</sup>) as part of a pure parallel observation. The comparison with cosmological simulations shows that the likelihood of finding such a large-scale structure is &lt;5 &percnt; under the current galaxy formation scenario and the observed survey volume. Our results demonstrate the power of WFSS observations to build a complete line-emitter sample and suggest an important role for over-densities in enhancing galaxy formation by funneling large-scale gas supplies into small cosmological volumes.

We present the early data release (EDR) of SAPPHIRES, a JWST Cycle-3 Treasury imaging and spectroscopic survey using the powerful NIRCam wide-field slitless spectroscopic (WFSS) mode in pure parallel. SAPPHIRES will obtain NIRCam imaging and WFSS data in many cosmological deep fields totaling a telescope charged time of 709 hours (557-hour exposures). In this EDR, we present NIRCam imaging and WFSS data obtained in parallel to the Frontier Field galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1-2403, which are attached to primary observations JWST-GO-4750. With a total dual-channel exposure time of 47.2 hours, we obtain deep NIRCam imaging in 13 bands at 0.6&ndash;5.0 micron and deep WFSS at 3.1-5.0 micron through the F356W and F444W filters with grisms in orthogonal dispersion directions. We release reduced NIRCam images, photometric catalogs of 22107 sources and WFSS spectra of 1060 sources with confirmed redshifts (z≃0-8.5). Preliminary value-added catalogs including photometric redshifts, spectroscopic redshifts and physical properties (mass, star-formation rate, etc.) are also made available. We also characterize the data quality and demonstrate scientific applications, including (1) galaxy candidates at the redshift frontier (z≳10), (2) the ionized gas kinematics of a galaxy reconstructed from R~1500 grism spectra at orthogonal dispersion directions, (3) massive emission-line galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) around the Epoch of Reionization.

We report the discovery of a remarkably large and luminous line-emitting nebula extending on either side of the Balmer-break galaxy JADES-GS-518794 at z=5.89, detected with JADES JWST/NIRCam imaging in [O III]&lambda;&lambda;4959,5007 and H&alpha; and spectroscopically confirmed with NIRCam/WFSS thanks to the pure-parallel SAPPHIRES programme. The end-to-end velocity offset is &Delta; v=830±130 km s<sup>-1</sup>. Nebulae with such large size and high luminosity (25-pkpc diameter, L[O III] = 1.2× 10^10 L<sub>&odot;</sub>) are routinely observed around bright quasars, unlike JADES-GS-518794. With a stellar mass of 10^10.1 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, this galaxy is at the knee of the mass function at z=6. Its star-formation rate declined for some time (10-100 Myr prior to observation), followed by a recent (10 Myr) upturn. This system is part of a candidate large-scale galaxy overdensity, with an excess of Balmer-break galaxies compared to the field (3 &sigma;). We discuss the possible origin of this nebula as material from a merger or gas expelled by an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The symmetry of the nebula, its bubble-like morphology, kinematics, high luminosity, and the extremely high equivalent width of [OIII] together favour the AGN interpretation. Intriguingly, there may be a physical connection between the presence of such a large, luminous nebula and the possible metamorphosis of the central galaxy towards quenching.

We present a sample of six F200W and three F277W dropout sources identified as 16&lt;z&lt;25 galaxy candidates based on the deepest JWST/NIRCam data to date, provided by the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) and the Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public survey (NGDEEP), reaching 5&sigma; depths of ~31.5 mag (AB) at ≥2 &mu;m. We estimate ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions and densities at z~17 and z~25. We find that the number density of galaxies with absolute magnitudes -19&lt;M_UV&lt;-18 (AB) at z~17 (z~25) is a factor of 4 (25) smaller than at z~12; a similar evolution is observed for the luminosity density. Compared to state-of-the-art galaxy simulations, we find the need for an enhanced UV-photon production at z=17-25 in M_DM=10^8.5-9.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> dark matter halos, maybe provided by an increase in the star formation efficiency at early times and/or by intense bursts fed by very low metallicity or primordial gas. There are few robust theoretical predictions for the evolution of galaxies above z~20 in the literature, however, the continuing rapid drop in the halo mass function suggests more rapid evolution than we observe if photon production efficiencies remained constant. Our z&gt;16 galaxy candidates present mass-weighted ages around 30 Myr, and attenuations A(V)&lt;0.1 mag. Their average stellar mass is M_\bigstar~10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, implying a star formation efficiency (stellar-to-baryon mass fraction) around 10%. We find three galaxies with very blue UV spectral slopes (&beta;~-3) compatible with low metallicity or Pop III and young (≲10 Myr) stars and/or high escape fractions of ionizing photons, the rest presenting slopes &beta;~-2.5 similar to z=10-12 samples.

Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have revealed a population of sources with a compact morphology and a `v-shaped' continuum, namely blue at rest-frame &lambda;&lt;4000A and red at longer wavelengths. The nature of these sources, called `little red dots' (LRDs), is still debated, since it is unclear if they host active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their number seems to drastically drop at z&lt;4. We utilise the 63 deg<sup>2</sup> covered by the quick Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) to extend the search for LRDs to brighter magnitudes and to lower z than what has been possible with JWST to have a broader view of the evolution of this peculiar galaxy population. The selection is done by fitting the available photometric data (Euclid, Spitzer/IRAC, and ground-based griz data) with two power laws, to retrieve the rest-frame optical and UV slopes consistently over a large redshift range (i.e, z&lt;7.6). We exclude extended objects and possible line emitters, and perform a visual inspection to remove imaging artefacts. The final selection includes 3341 LRD candidates from z=0.33 to z=3.6, with 29 detected in IRAC. Their rest-frame UV luminosity function, in contrast with previous JWST studies, shows that the number density of LRD candidates increases from high-z down to z=1.5-2.5 and decreases at even lower z. Less evolution is apparent focusing on the subsample of more robust LRD candidates having IRAC detections, which is affected by low statistics and limited by the IRAC resolution. The comparison with previous quasar UV luminosity functions shows that LRDs are not the dominant AGN population at z&lt;4. Follow-up studies of these LRD candidates are key to confirm their nature, probe their physical properties and check for their compatibility with JWST sources, since the different spatial resolution and wavelength coverage of Euclid and JWST could select different samples of compact sources.

Our understanding of cosmic star-formation at z&gt;3 used to largely rely on rest-frame UV observations. However, these observations overlook dusty and massive sources, resulting in an incomplete census of early star-forming galaxies. Recently, infrared data from Spitzer and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed a hidden population at z~3-6 with extreme red colours. Taking advantage of the overlap between imaging in the Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs), covering ~ 60 deg<sup>2</sup>, and ancillary Spitzer observations, we identified 27000 extremely red objects with H_E-IRAC2&gt;2.25 (dubbed HIEROs) down to a 10&sigma; completeness magnitude limit of IRAC2 = 22.5 AB. After a visual inspection to discard artefacts and objects with troubling photometry, we ended up with a final sample of 3900 candidates. We retrieved the physical parameter estimates for these objects from the SED-fitting tool CIGALE. Our results confirm that HIERO galaxies may populate the high-mass end of the stellar mass function at z&gt;3, with some reaching extreme stellar masses (M_*&gt;10^11M<sub>&odot;</sub>) and exhibiting high dust attenuation (A_V&gt;3). However, we consider stellar mass estimates unreliable for z&gt;3.5, favouring a lower-z solution. The challenges faced by SED-fitting tools in characterising these objects highlight the need for further studies, incorporating shorter-wavelength and spectroscopic data. Euclid spectra will help resolve degeneracies and better constrain the physical properties of the brightest galaxies. Given the extreme nature of this population, characterising these sources is crucial for understanding galaxy evolution. This work demonstrates Euclid's potential to provide statistical samples of rare, massive, dust-obscured galaxies at z&gt;3, which will be prime targets for JWST, ALMA, and ELT.

### 110) [2503.14703](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14703v1): The Emerging Black Hole Mass Function in the High-Redshift Universe

<p> Junehyoung Jeon, Boyuan Liu, Anthony J. Taylor, Vasily Kokorev, John Chisholm, Dale D. Kocevski, Steven L. Finkelstein, Volker Bromm </p>
<p>
Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have identified an abundant population of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) already in place during the first few hundred million years of cosmic history. Most of them appear overmassive relative to the stellar mass in their host systems, challenging models of early black hole seeding and growth. Multiple pathways exist to explain their formation, including heavy seeds formed from direct collapse/supermassive stars or sustained super-Eddington accretion onto light stellar remnant seeds. We use the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH to predict the emerging SMBH mass function under physically motivated models for both light and heavy seed formation, to be compared with upcoming ultra-deep JWST surveys. We find that both pathways can reproduce observations at z~5-6, but have distinct features at higher redshifts of z~10. Specifically, JWST observations have the potential to constrain the fraction of efficiently accreting (super-Eddington) SMBHs, as well as the existence and prevalence of heavy seeds, in particular through ultra-deep observations of blank fields and/or gravitational lensing surveys. Such observations will provide key insights to understand the process of SMBH formation and evolution during the emergence of the first galaxies. We further emphasize the great promise of possible SMBH detections at z≳ 15 with future JWST observations to break the degeneracy between light- and heavy-seed models.

### 111) [2503.14582](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14582v1): Shedding Infrared Light on QCD Axion and ALP Dark Matter with JWST

<p> Akash Kumar Saha, Subhadip Bouri, Anirban Das, Abhishek Dubey, Ranjan Laha </p>
<p>
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has opened up a new chapter in infrared astronomy. Besides the discovery and a deeper understanding of various astrophysical sources, JWST can also uncover the non-gravitational nature of dark matter (DM). If DM is QCD axion or an eV-scale Axion-like particle (ALP), it can decay into two photons in the infrared band. This will produce a distinct line signature in the spectroscopic observations made by JWST. Using the latest NIRSpec IFU spectroscopic observations from JWST, we put the strongest bound on the photon coupling for QCD axion/ ALP DM in the mass range between 0.47 and 2.55 eV. In particular, we are able to probe a new mass range for ALP DM between ~ 0.47 eV to 0.78 eV beyond what can be probed by globular cluster observations. We constrain well-motivated and UV complete models of QCD axion and ALP DM, including predictions from some models derived from string theory and/ or various Grand Unification scenarios. Future JWST observations of DM-rich systems with a better understanding of the astrophysical and instrumental backgrounds can thus enable us to potentially discover QCD axion and ALP DM.

### 112) [2503.14280](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14280v1): Constraints on the early Universe star formation efficiency from galaxy clustering and halo modeling of Hα and [O III] emitters

<p>
We develop a theoretical framework to provide observational constraints on the early Universe galaxy-halo connection by combining measurements of the UV luminosity function (UVLF) and galaxy clustering via the 2-point correlation function (2PCF). We implemented this framework in the FRESCO and CONGRESS JWST NIRCam/grism surveys by measuring the 2PCF of spectroscopically selected samples of H&alpha; and [OIII] emitters at 3.8&lt;z&lt;9 in 124 arcmin<sup>2</sup> in GOODS-N and GOODS-S. By fitting the 2PCF and UVLF at 3.8&lt;z&lt;9 we inferred that the H&alpha; and [OIII] samples at &langle; z &rangle; ~4.3, 5.4 and 7.3 reside in halos of masses of log(M_h/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 11.5, 11.2, 11.0 respectively, while their galaxy bias increases with redshift with values of b_g = 4.0, 5.0, 7.6. These halos do not represent extreme overdense environments at these epochs. We constrain the instantaneous star formation efficiency (SFE), defined as the ratio of the star formation rate over the baryonic accretion rate as a function of halo mass. The SFE rises with halo mass, peaks at ~20&percnt; at M_h ~ 3 × 10^11  M<sub>&odot;</sub>, and declines at higher halo masses. The SFE-M_h shows only a mild evolution with redshift with tentative indications that low mass halos decrease but the high mass halos increase in efficiency with redshift. The scatter in the M_UV-M_h relation, quantified by &sigma;_UV, implies stochasticity in the UV luminosities of ~ 0.7 mag, relatively constant with z. Extrapolating our model to z&gt;9 shows that a constant SFE-M_h fixed at z=8 cannot reproduce the observed UVLF and neither high maximum SFE nor high stochasticity alone can explain the high abundances of luminous galaxies seen by JWST. Extending the analysis of the UVLF and 2PCF to z&gt;9 measured from wider surveys will be crucial in breaking degeneracies.

<p>
Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) have long been considered to contribute significantly to the cosmic dust budget. New dust cools quickly and is therefore detectable at mid-infrared (mid-IR) wavelengths. However, before the era of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), direct observational evidence for dust condensation was found in only a handful of nearby CCSNe, and dust masses (~10^-2-10^-3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, generally limited to &lt;5 yr and to &gt;500K temperatures) have been 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller than either theoretical predictions or dust amounts found by far-IR/submm observations of Galactic SN remnants and in the very nearby SN 1987A. The combined angular resolution and mid-IR sensitivity of JWST finally allow us to reveal hidden cool (~100-200K) dust reservoirs in extragalactic SNe beyond SN 1987A. Our team received JWST/MIRI time for studying a larger sample of CCSNe to fill the currently existing gap in their dust formation histories. The first observed target of this program is the well-known Type IIb SN~1993J appeared in M81. We generated its spectral energy distribution (SED) from the current JWST/MIRI F770W, F1000W, F1500W, and F2100W fluxes. We fit single- and two-component silicate and carbonaceous dust models to the SED. We found that SN 1993J still contains a significant amount (~0.01 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) of dust ~30 yr after explosion. Comparing these results to those of the analysis of earlier Spitzer Space Telescope data, we see a similar amount of dust now that was detected ~15-20 yr ago, but at a lower temperature. We also find residual background emission near the SN site (after point-spread-function subtraction on the JWST/MIRI images) that may plausibly be attributed to an IR echo from more distant interstellar dust grains heated by the SN shock-breakout luminosity or ongoing star formation in the local environment.

<p>
We present a study of giant molecular cloud (GMC) properties in the Andromeda galaxy (M31) using CO(3-2) data from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) in selected regions across the disc and in the nuclear ring, and comparing them with CO(1-0) observations from the IRAM 30m telescope in the same regions. We find that GMCs in the centre of M31 generally exhibit larger velocity dispersions (&sigma;) and sizes (R) compared to those in the disc, while their average surface density (&Sigma;) and turbulent pressure (P_turb) are lower. This low turbulent pressure in the central region is primarily due to the low density of molecular gas. The estimated GMC properties depend on the choice of CO transitions. Compared to CO(1-0), CO(3-2) exhibits smaller velocity dispersion and equivalent radius but higher surface density. These differences highlight the distinct physical conditions probed by different molecular gas tracers. We estimate the virial parameter &alpha;_vir&prop; &sigma;^2 R/&Sigma; and find that most molecular clouds exhibit high values (&alpha;_vir ~ 4-6) for both CO transitions, indicating that they are unbound. Furthermore, clouds in the nuclear ring display even larger &alpha;_vir values of ≲ 100, suggesting that they may be highly dynamic, short-lived structures, although they could potentially achieve equilibrium under the external pressure exerted by the surrounding interstellar medium.

<p> Taylor J. Hoyt, In Sung Jang, Wendy L. Freedman, Barry F. Madore, Kayla A. Owens, Abigail J. Lee </p>
<p>
We present distances to ten supernova (SN) host galaxies determined via the red giant branch tip (TRGB) using JWST/NIRCAM and the F115W, F356W, and F444W bandpasses. Our analysis, including photometric catalog cleaning, adoption of disk light profiles, TRGB color slope estimation, and a novel technique for identifying the infrared TRGB, was conducted blinded. The new F115W TRGB distances agree well with our previously derived HST TRGB distances, differing by only 1 percent on average and 4 percent on a per-galaxy basis. The color-corrected F115W TRGB is therefore equally precise a method of distance measurement as, and offers unique advantages over, its color-insensitive, I-band counterpart. Using these distances, we update the absolute calibrations of eleven calibrator SNe, yielding 68.4 &lt; H0 &lt; 69.6 km/s/Mpc depending on which of four sets of SN magnitudes are used. We expand the sample of calibrator SNe to 24 by combining with HST TRGB distances. Doing so increases our H0 estimate based on the Carnegie Supernova Project II (CSP-II) by 0.8 km/s/Mpc (1.4 sigma) demonstrating that our JWST H0 based on 11 SNe is not significantly biased toward lower values. In contrast, the Pantheon+ calibration shifts higher by +2 km/s/Mpc (3.1 sigma), a significantly larger increase than seen in both the CSP and the Pantheon team's own SuperCal analysis. More JWST observations of the TRGB as well as independent analyses of low-redshift SNe are needed to continue unraveling the true nature of the Hubble Tension.

### 116) [2503.11762](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11762v1): ECHO21: Exploring the Cosmos with Hydrogen Observation

<p> Shikhar Mittal </p>
<p>
We introduce a python package called ECHO21 for generating global 21-cm signal from the dark ages through cosmic dawn to the end of reionization. Because of its analytical-prescription-based foundation, ECHO21 generates a single model in O(1) s. The code can generate a large set of signals, ideal for building emulators and performing astrophysical or cosmological inference from a given 21-cm dataset. The code is MPI parallel with reasonable scalability and thus, can be run on high-performance computers. We offer six astrophysical parameters that control the Lyman-&alpha; emissivity, X-ray emissivity, emissivity of ionizing photons, and star formation rate. A critical component of 21-cm modelling, but ignored by majority of public codes, that we include is the Ly&alpha; heating. For a certain range of astrophysical parameters, the Ly&alpha; heating could even dominate the X-ray heating. In addition to astrophysical parameters, in ECHO21 it is just as easy to vary the standard cosmological parameters which makes it possible to combine constraints from 21-cm observations and other cosmological probes. Further, we offer two models of star formation rate; a physically-motivated and an empirically-motivated. Since the latter is directly inferred by HST/JWST observations, it makes ECHO21 an appropriate tool to build synergies between 21-cm observations and galaxy surveys. With a number of 21-cm experiments soon to provide cosmic dawn 21-cm data, ECHO21 is a handy package for making quick but sufficiently realistic astrophysical inferences.

<p>
JWST spectroscopy has revealed a population of compact objects at redshifts z=2-9 with `v'-shaped spectral energy distributions, broad permitted lines, and, often, hydrogen Balmer absorption. Among these `Little Red Dots' (LRDs), Abell2744-QSO1 at z=7.04 has been confirmed to have time-variable equivalent width (EW) in its broad emission lines, confirming its AGN nature. We extend the analysis of NIRSpec/IFS data from the BlackTHUNDER survey to the H&alpha; line. The broad-line profile in Abell2744-QSO1 is manifestly non-Gaussian, requiring at least two Gaussian components with full width at half maximum FWHM=450±50 and 1800±100 km s<sup>-1</sup>. Crucially, we also detect a narrow-line Gaussian component, and strong H&alpha; absorption (EW relative to the continuum ≈ 30^+15_-9 A), confirming a connection between the strong Balmer break and line absorption. The absorber is at rest with respect to broad H&alpha;, suggesting that the gas cannot be interpreted as an inflow or outflow, forming instead a long-lived structure. Its velocity dispersion is &sigma;_abs = 100±10 km s<sup>-1</sup>, consistent with the value inferred from the analysis of the Balmer break. Based on H&alpha;, we infer a black hole mass of log(M_BH/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=6.3-6.7, 0.9-1.3 dex smaller than previous estimates based on H&beta;. The Eddington ratio is 0.7-1.6. Combining the high signal-to-noise ratio of the narrow H&alpha; line with the spectral resolution R=3,700 of the G395H grating, we infer a narrow-line dispersion &sigma;_n = 22^+5_-6 km s<sup>-1</sup>, which places a stringent constraint on the black-hole-to-dynamical-mass ratio of this system to be M_BH/M_dyn&gt;0.02-0.4. If M_BH is near the low-mass end of our estimates, the SMBH would be accreting at a super-Eddington rate. Alternatively, at the high-M_BH end, there would be minimal room for a host galaxy.

### 118) [2503.11753](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11753v1): First constraints on QCD axion dark matter using James Webb Space Telescope observations

<p> Elena Pinetti </p>
<p>
I present the first constraints on QCD axion dark matter using measurements from the James Webb Space Telescope. By utilizing publicly available MIRI and NIRSpec blank-sky observations, originally collected for sky subtraction purposes, I derive strong limits on the axion-photon coupling constant g_a &gamma; &gamma; in the mass range 0.1-4 eV. These constraints improve upon previous studies by more than two orders of magnitude for a range of masses. This analysis underscores the potential of blank-sky observations as a powerful tool for constraining dark matter models and demonstrates how astrophysical missions can be repurposed for particle physics research.

### 119) [2503.11457](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11457v1): Fe Abundances of Early Galaxies at z=9-12 Derived with Deep JWST Spectra

<p>
We derive Fe-abundance ratios of 6 galaxies at z=9-12 with -22&lt;M_UV&lt;-19 whose JWST/NIRSpec spectra achieve very high signal-to-noise ratios, SNR=40-230, at the rest-frame UV wavelength. We fit stellar synthesis model spectra to these JWST spectra, carefully masking out nebular emission, interstellar absorption, and non-iron stellar absorption lines, and obtain Fe-abundance ratios of [Fe/H]=-2-0 for 4 galaxies and upper limits of [Fe/H]~-1 for 2 galaxies. We compare these [Fe/H] values with the oxygen abundances of these galaxies (7.2&lt;12+log(O/H)&lt;7.9) in the same manner as previous studies of low-z galaxies, and derive oxygen-to-iron abundance ratios [O/Fe]. We find that majority of (4 out of 6) galaxies are consistent with iron-poor abundance ratios ([O/Fe]≳0) while that 2 out of 6 galaxies, GS-z11-0 and GN-z11, show Fe enhancements ([O/Fe]&lt;0), especially GS-z11-0 (z=11.12) with a Fe enhancement ([O/Fe]=-0.91_-0.42^+0.35) beyond the solar-abundance ratio at ~3&sigma;. Because, unlike GS-z11-0, GN-z11 (z=10.60) may be an AGN, we constrain [O/Fe] via FeII emission under the assumption of AGN and confirm that the Fe enhancement is consistent even in the case of AGN. While [O/Fe] values of the majority of the galaxies are explained by the chemical enrichment of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), the Fe enhancements of GS-z11-0 and GN-z11 are puzzling. We develop chemical evolution models, and find that the iron enhancements against oxygen in GS-z11-0 and GN-z11 can be explained by 1) pair-instability supernovae/bright hypernovae with little contribution of CCSNe or 2) Type-Ia supernovae with short delay time (~30-50 Myr) with a top-light initial mass function.

### 120) [2503.10958](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10958v1): Dot to dot: high-z little red dots in M_bh-M<sub>&sext;</sub> diagrams with galaxy-morphology-specific scaling relations and nuclear star clusters

<p> Alister W. Graham, Igor V. Chilingarian, Dieu D. Nguyen, Roberto Soria, Mark Durre, Duncan A. Forbes </p>
<p>
High-redshift little red dots (LRDs) detected with the James Webb Space Telescope are considered the cores of emerging galaxies. For the first time, we compare LRDs in M_bh-M<sub>&sext;</sub> diagrams with an array of z=0 galaxy-morphology-dependent scaling relations, along with the M_bh-M<sub>&sext;</sub>,nsc relation for nuclear star clusters. The M_bh-M<sub>&sext;</sub>,sph relations for spheroidal stellar systems are characterised by a nearly parallel set of quasi-quadratic (or steeper) distributions that are known to trace the `punctuated equilibrium' of galaxies, reflecting their stepwise growth in black hole mass and merger-built bulge/spheroid mass. We show that LRDs are not equivalent to nuclear star clusters, with the latter having higher M_bh/M<sub>&sext;</sub> ratios. However, the least massive LRDs exhibit similar M_bh and M<sub>&sext;</sub>,gal values as ultracompact dwarf (UCD) galaxies. We show that the LRDs span the M_bh-M<sub>&sext;</sub>,gal diagram from UCD galaxies to primaeval lenticular galaxies. In contrast, spiral galaxies and the subset of major-merger-built early-type galaxies define offset relations. Additionally, we observe that low-z galaxies with active galactic nuclei align with the steep black hole scaling relations for disc galaxies defined by primarily inactive galaxies with directly measured black hole masses. Collectively, this highlights the benefits of considering galaxy morphology, which reflects their accretion and merger history, to understand the coevolution of galaxies and their black holes.

### 121) [2503.10947](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10947v1): Near-infrared Spectral Properties of Type Ib/Ic Supernova Progenitors and Implications for JWST and NGRST Observations

<p> Moo-Keon Jung, Sung-Chul Yoon </p>
<p>
While about 20 Type II supernova progenitors have been identified using optical data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), direct detection of type Ib/Ic supernova (SN Ib/Ic) progenitors remains challenging due to their faint optical brightness and highly obscured environments. This study aims to investigate the detection limits and advantages of near-infrared (near-IR) observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (NGRST) for the detection of SN Ib/Ic progenitors. The spectral energy distributions of SN Ib/Ic progenitor models with various masses, chemical compositions, and mass-loss rates are calculated with the non-LTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN. We then assess the detectability of SN Ib/Ic progenitors using near-IR filters from the JWST and the NGRST, comparing the results to the capabilities of the HST. Our analysis indicates that near-IR observations significantly outperform the HST in detecting SN Ib/Ic progenitors when considering the effect of extinction. Near-IR magnitudes also provide better constraints on the mass-loss rates of progenitors because of the free-free emission from the wind matter. Additionally, near-IR magnitudes and color-color diagrams are effective in distinguishing SN Ib/Ic progenitors from possible companion and/or background objects. This study suggests that the JWST and the NGRST can play a crucial role in advancing our understanding of SN Ib/Ic progenitors by improving detectability and offering better constraints on progenitor properties. We emphasize that observations with exposure times exceeding 1 hour would be needed to detect typical SNe Ib/Ic progenitors at distances greater than 10 Mpc.

<p>
We re-analysed ALMA observations of the [OIII]&lambda;88&mu;m emission line in JADES-GS-z14.0, so far the most distant spectroscopically confirmed galaxy at z=14.18. Our analysis shows a tentative detection of a velocity gradient of [OIII]&lambda;88&mu;m using three independent tests: 1) construction of moment maps; 2) extraction of integrated spectra from a grid of apertures; and 3) spectro-astrometry in both the image and uv planes. We performed kinematical fitting using the KinMS code and estimated a dynamical mass of log_10(M_dyn/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)= 9.4^+0.8_-0.4, with the bulk of the uncertainties due to the degeneracy between dynamical mass and inclination. We measure an upper limit on the velocity dispersion (&sigma;_v) of &lt;40~ km/s~which results in an estimate of V_rot/&sigma;&gt; 2.5. This result, if confirmed with higher-resolution observations, would imply that kinematically cold discs are already in place at z~14. Comparison with mock observations from the SERRA cosmological simulations confirms that even low-resolution observations are capable of detecting a velocity gradient in z&gt;10 galaxies as compact as JADES-GS-z14.0. This work shows that deeper ALMA or JWST/NIRSpec IFS observations with high spatial resolution will be able to estimate an accurate dynamical mass for JADES-GS-z14.0, providing an upper limit to the stellar mass of this over-luminous galaxy.

<p> Avinash CK, Y. Divakara Mayya, Alessandro Bressan, Jairo A. Alzate Trujillo </p>
<p>
We use archival JWST/NIRCam images in the F115W, F150W, and F200W filters to measure the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) magnitudes across the disk of the late-type spiral galaxy NGC 628. In this exploratory study, we demonstrate how the metallicity-dependence of TRGB magnitudes in the near-infrared (NIR) filters can be exploited by making use of the theoretical isochrones to determine metallicities of the fossil 10 Gyr old population over kiloparsec scales without being affected by the age-metallicity-reddening degeneracy. We obtain a smooth metallicity gradient that decreases from Z=0.003 in the central regions to Z=0.002 in the external parts, with a typical error on Z of 0.0002. The extinction variation across the disk caused by the diffuse interstellar dust is spiky with a median value of A_V=0.12 mag. We propose that the large bubbles in the disks of galaxies offer dust-free lines of sight for measuring the TRGB magnitudes, and hence the distance to galaxies, to an accuracy that is as good as that of the halo populations. Using the Phantom Void, we obtain a TRGB distance modulus of 29.81±0.05(stat)±0.06(sys) mag for NGC 628, which agrees well with the most recent PNLF measurement of 29.89^+0.06_-0.09 for this galaxy.

<p> Yifan Zheng, Paulo Montero-Camacho, Zheng Cai, Yi Mao </p>
<p>
Cosmic reionization of HI leaves enduring relics in the post-reionization intergalactic medium, potentially influencing the Lyman-&alpha; (Ly&alpha;) forest down to redshifts as low as z ≈ 2, which is the so-called ''memory of reionization'' effect. Here, we re-analyze the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from Ly&alpha; absorption and quasar correlations using data from the extended Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) Data Release 16 (DR16), incorporating for the first time the memory of reionization in the Ly&alpha; forest. Three distinct scenarios of reionization timeline are considered in our analyses. We find that the recovered BAO parameters (&alpha;_\parallel, &alpha;_\perp) remain consistent with the original eBOSS DR16 analysis. However, models incorporating reionization relics provide a better fit to the data, with a tantalizing preference for early reionization, consistent with recent findings from the James Webb Space Telescope. Furthermore, the inclusion of reionization relics significantly impacts the non-BAO parameters. For instance, we report deviations of up to 3&sigma; in the Ly&alpha; redshift-space distortion parameter and ~7&sigma; in the linear Ly&alpha; bias for the late reionization scenario. Our findings suggest that the eBOSS Ly&alpha; data is more accurately described by models that incorporate a broadband enhancement to the Ly&alpha; forest power spectrum, highlighting the importance of accounting for reionization relics in cosmological analyses.

<p>
The strongly lensed Supernova (SN) Encore at a redshift of z = 1.949, discovered behind the galaxy cluster MACS J0138-2155 at z=0.336, provides a rare opportunity for time-delay cosmography and studies of the SN host galaxy, where previously another SN, called SN Requiem, had appeared. To enable these studies, we combine new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging, archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, and new Very Large Telescope (VLT) spectroscopic data to construct state-of-the-art lens mass models that are composed of cluster dark-matter (DM) halos and galaxies. We determine the photometric and structural parameters of the galaxies across six JWST and five HST filters. We use the color-magnitude and color-color relations of spectroscopically-confirmed cluster members to select additional cluster members, identifying a total of 84 galaxies belonging to the galaxy cluster. We construct seven different mass models using a variety of DM halo mass profiles, and explore both multi-plane and approximate single-plane lens models. As constraints, we use the observed positions of 23 multiple images from eight multiply lensed sources at four distinct spectroscopic redshifts. In addition, we use stellar velocity dispersion measurements to obtain priors on the galaxy mass distributions. We find that six of the seven models fit well to the observed image positions. Mass models with cored-isothermal DM profiles fit well to the observations, whereas the mass model with a Navarro-Frenk-White cluster DM profile has an image-position &chi;<sup>2</sup> value that is four times higher. We build our ultimate model by combining four multi-lens-plane mass models and predict the image positions and magnifications of SN Encore and SN Requiem. Our work lays the foundation for building state-of-the-art mass models of the cluster for future cosmological analysis and SN host galaxy studies.

### 126) [2503.09702](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09702v1): The Extinction Law in SN Ia Hosts from Background Galaxy Measurements: Toward a 1% Determination of H_0

<p> Yukei S. Murakami, Adam G. Riess, Henry C. Ferguson, Alexei V. Filippenko, Thomas G. Brink, WeiKang Zheng, Dan M. Scolnic </p>
<p>
In the most precise distance ladder determination of H_0, the observed near-infrared (NIR) fluxes of Cepheids are corrected for dust, assuming that the extinction law in large, star-forming spiral hosts of Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) is similar to the Milky Way's average value of R_V ≈ 3.1. Intriguingly, studies of SNe Ia often point to lower values for their hosts (R_V ~ 2). Ambiguities related to R_V may limit future efforts to measure H_0 beyond ~ 1&percnt; precision. To better resolve extragalactic extinction laws, we directly measure the wavelength-dependent absorption of background galaxies seen in HST and JWST images (0.5&ndash;2.7 &mu;m). We take the following steps: (i) subtract foreground stars to measure accurate photometry of background galaxies with a tool, ttSPHOT; (ii) measure their redshifts and spectroscopic features with Keck/DEIMOS; (iii) determine their intrinsic spectral energy distributions from the empirical templates which match the absorption lines and breaks in observed spectroscopic features, and (iv) measure R_V by fitting the extinction model to the difference between the template and the observed SEDs. The above steps are tested with artificial datasets to insure they accurately recover the input R_V. We apply this set of steps to a first case, NGC 5584, a SN Ia host and a calibrator of the Hubble constant. The estimated value of R_V for NGC 5584, R_V=3.59^+0.99_-0.62(stat)±0.19(syst), is consistent with the MW-like extinction law, and it is ≳ 3.5&sigma; away from R_V=2 as favored by SN Ia. If additional hosts show similar results, it would suggest that SN Ia extinction may not be solely due to mean interstellar dust. We are now undertaking a statistical study of 5-10 SH0ES hosts to determine the distribution of host extinction laws.

### 127) [2503.09697](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09697v1): WIggle Corrector Kit for NIRSpEc Data: WICKED

<p> Antoine Dumont, Nadine Neumayer, Anil C. Seth, Torsten Böker, Michael Eracleous, Kameron Goold, Jenny E. Greene, Kayhan Gültekin, Luis C. Ho, Jonelle L. Walsh, Nora Lützgendorf </p>
<p>
The point-spread function of the integral-field unit (IFU) mode of the JWST's NIRSpec is heavily under-sampled, creating resampling noise seen as low-frequency sinusoidal-like artifacts, or "wiggles". These artifacts in the data are not corrected in the JWST data pipeline, and significantly impact the science that can be achieved at a single-pixel level. We present WICKED (WIggle Corrector Kit for NIRSpEc Data), a tool designed to empirically remove wiggles. WICKED uses the Fast Fourier Transform to identify wiggle-affected spaxels across the data cube. Spectra are modeled with a mix of integrated aperture and annular templates, a power-law, and a second-degree polynomial. The method works across all medium- and high-resolution NIRSpec gratings: F070LP, F100LP, F170LP, and F290LP. WICKED can recover the true overall spectral shape up to a factor of 3.5x better compared to uncorrected spectra. It recovers the equivalent width of absorption lines within 5% of the true value-~3x better than uncorrected spectra and ~2x better than other methods. WICKED significantly improves kinematic measurements, recovering the line-of-sight velocity (LOSV) within 1% of the true value &ndash; more than 100x better than uncorrected spectra at S/N ~40. As a case study, we applied WICKED to G235H/F170LP IFU data of the elliptical galaxy NGC5128, finding good agreement with previous studies. In wiggle-affected regions, the uncorrected spectrum showed stellar LOSV and velocity dispersion differences compared to the WICKED-cleaned spectrum, of ~17x and ~36x larger than the estimated uncertainties, respectively. Wiggles in NIRSpec IFU data can introduce severe biases in spectral shape, line measurements, and kinematics to values larger than the typical uncertainties. WICKED provides a robust, user-friendly solution, enabling precise single-pixel studies and maximizing JWST's potential.

<p>
We present a new parametric strong lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster MACS J0138.0-2155 at z = 0.336, the first known to show two multiply-imaged supernova (SN) siblings, SN Requiem and SN Encore at z= 1.949. We exploit HST and JWST multiband imaging in synergy with new MUSE spectroscopy to develop an improved lens mass model. We include 84 cluster members (of which ~60% are spectroscopically confirmed) and two perturber galaxies along the line of sight. Our observables consist of 23 spectroscopically confirmed multiple images from 8 background sources, spanning a fairly wide redshift range, from 0.767 to 3.420. To accurately characterise the sub-halo mass component, we calibrate the Faber-Jackson scaling relation based on the stellar kinematics of 14 bright cluster galaxies. We build several lens models, with different cluster total mass parametrisations, to assess the statistical and systematic uncertainties on the predicted values of the position and magnification of the observed and future multiple images of SN Requiem and SN Encore. Our reference best-fit lens model reproduces the observed positions of the multiple images with a root-mean-square offset of 0".36, and the multiple image positions of the SNe and their host galaxy with a remarkable mean precision of only 0".05. We measure a projected total mass of M(&lt;60~ kpc) = 2.89_-0.03^+0.04 × 10^13 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, consistent with that independently derived from the Chandra X-ray analysis. We demonstrate the reliability of the new lens model by reconstructing the extended surface-brightness distribution of the multiple images of the host galaxy. The discrepancy between our model-predicted magnification values with those from previous studies, critical for understanding the intrinsic properties of the SNe and their host galaxy, underscores the need to combine cutting-edge observations with detailed lens modelling.

We compare forecasts for the abundance and properties of strong gravitational lenses in the COSMOS-Web survey, a 0.54 deg<sup>2</sup> survey of the COSMOS field using the NIRCam and MIRI instruments aboard JWST, with the first catalogue of strong lens candidates identified in the observed NIRCam data, COWLS. We modify the lenspop package to produce a forecast for strong lensing in COSMOS-Web. We add a new mock galaxy catalogue to use as the source population, as well as the COSMOS-Web survey specifications, including the transmission data for the four NIRCam filters used. We forecast 107 strong lenses can be detected in COSMOS-Web across all bands, assuming complete subtraction of the lens galaxy light. The majority of the lenses are forecast to have small Einstein radii (&theta;_E &lt; 1 arcsecond) and lie at redshifts between 0 &lt; z &lt;2, whilst the source redshift distribution peaks at z~ 3 and has a long tail extending up to z ~ 11, unambiguously showing that strong lensing in JWST can probe the entirety of the epoch of reionisation. We compare our forecast with the distributions of Einstein radii, lens photometric redshifts, and lens and source magnitudes in the observed lenses, finding that whilst the forecast and observed Einstein radii distributions match, the redshifts and magnitudes do not. The observed lens redshift distribution peaks at a slightly lower redshift than the forecast one, whilst the lens magnitudes are systematically brighter in the observed data than in the forecast. Assuming the validity of the lenspop forecast, this finding motivates further inspection of the COWLS data to search for the as-yet undiscovered population of faint, high-redshift lenses.

### 130) [2503.08779](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08779v1): Seeding Cores: A Pathway for Nuclear Star Clusters from Bound Star Clusters in the First Billion Years

<p> Fred Angelo Batan Garcia, Massimo Ricotti, Kazuyuki Sugimura </p>
<p>
We model the formation of star clusters in a dwarf galaxy progenitor during the first 700 Myr of cosmic history using a cosmological radiation-hydrodynamic simulation with a realistic sub-grid star formation efficiency (SFE) model, derived from AU-scale radiation-MHD simulations of molecular clouds with varying mass, density, and metallicity. Using this model for cloud-scale SFEs, the galaxy forms stars stochastically, assembling most of its 10^6~M<sub>&odot;</sub> in stars by redshift z=8 through two star-forming bursts (SFBs), each lasting ~10~Myr, separated by 80~Myr of quiescence. Clouds reach SFEs up to 80&percnt; during the first SFB, forming bound star clusters (densities ~10^2-4 ~M<sub>&odot;</sub>\:pc^-2, radii ≲ 3~pc) resembling those observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in strongly lensed galaxies. Star clusters follow a flat power-law mass function with slope \Gamma ~ -0.4. The most massive star clusters (10^4-5 ~M<sub>&odot;</sub>) grow through mergers and have metallicity spreads of 0.05 - 0.1 dex that roughly scale with mass. The second SFB forms loosely bound star clusters with higher metallicities: -1.95 &lt; log(Z/Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) &lt; -1.50 at lower SFEs (2 - 20&percnt;). At z ~ 8.7, a nuclear star cluster (NSC) is seeded, growing 83&percnt; of its mass ( 2.4 × 10^5 ~M<sub>&odot;</sub>, 20&percnt; of the galaxy's stellar mass) through mergers with pre-existing clusters and the rest through in-situ star formation. The early formation of NSCs has interesting implications for seeding supermassive black holes and the population of "little red dots" recently discovered by JWST at z ≳ 5.

### 131) [2503.08778](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08778v1): New constraints on the galactic ionizing efficiency and escape fraction at 2.5 &lt; z &lt; 6 based on quasar absorption spectra

<p> Christopher Cain, Anson D'Aloisio, Julian B. Munoz </p>
<p>
Measurements of the ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) can probe the sources of the extragalactic ionizing background. We provide new measurements of the ionizing emissivity of galaxies using measurements of the ionizing background and ionizing photon mean free path from high-redshift quasar spectra at 2.5 &lt; z &lt; 6. Unlike most prior works, we account for radiative-transfer effects and possible neutral islands from the tail of reionization at z &gt; 5. We combine our results with measurements of the UV luminosity function to constrain the average escaping ionizing efficiency of galaxies, &langle; f<sub>esc</sub>  &xi;<sub>ion</sub> &rangle;_L_UV. Assuming galaxies with M_UV &lt; -11 emit ionizing photons, we find log (&langle; f<sub>esc</sub>  &xi;<sub>ion</sub> &rangle;_L_UV/erg^-1Hz) = 24.47_-0.17^+0.09 and 24.75_-0.28^+0.15 at z=5 and 6, and 1&sigma; upper limits of 24.48 and 24.31 at z = 2.5 and 4, respectively. We also estimate the population-averaged f<sub>esc</sub> using measurements of intrinsic ionizing efficiency from JWST. We find &langle; f<sub>esc</sub> &rangle; = 0.126_-0.041^+0.034 and 0.224_-0.108^+0.098 at z=5 and 6, and 1&sigma; upper limits of f<sub>esc</sub>&lt; 0.138 and 0.096 at z=2.5 and 4, respectively, for M_UV &lt; -11. Our findings are consistent with prior measurements of f<sub>esc</sub> ≲ 10&percnt; at z ≤ 4, but indicate a factor of several increase between z = 4 and 6. The steepness of this evolution is sensitive to the highly uncertain mean free path and ionizing background intensity at z&gt;5. Lastly, we find 1.10^+0.21_-0.39 photons per H atom are emitted into the IGM between z=6 and =5.3. This is ≈ 4× more than needed to complete the last 20&percnt; of reionization absent recombinations, suggesting that reionization's end was likely absorption-dominated.

<p>
We present the COSMOS-Web Lens Survey (COWLS), a sample of over 100 strong lens candidates from the 0.54 deg<sup>2</sup> COSMOS-Web survey, discovered using exquisite James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging across four wavebands. Following two rounds of visual inspection, over 100 candidates were ranked as `high confidence' or `likely' by at least 50&percnt; of inspectors. The COWLS sample has several notable properties: (i) magnified source galaxies spanning redshifts z ~ 0.1 to z ~ 9, which therefore extend into the epoch of reionisation; (ii) the highest-redshift lens galaxies known, pushing galaxy density profile evolution studies beyond z ~ 2; (iii) all lenses are distributed within a contiguous 0.54 deg<sup>2</sup> region, allowing for joint strong and weak lensing analyses; and (iv) a subset exhibits lensed source emission ray-traced near the lens galaxy centers, enabling studies of supermassive black holes and dust absorption. A key innovation of our approach is the use of lens modelling to aid in identifying lenses that may otherwise be missed. This paper is accompanied by the first COWLS public release, providing JWST NIRCam imaging in four bands, lens models, pixelized source reconstructions and lens redshift estimates : https://github.com/Jammy2211/COWLS_COSMOS_Web_Lens_Survey

### 133) [2503.08687](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08687v1): JWST Spectroscopic View of a Rapidly Growing Dust-obscured Quasar at z ~ 4: Effect of Dust Extinction Correction on Black Hole Mass and Eddington Ratio Estimation

<p> Dohyeong Kim, Myungshin Im </p>
<p>
In the merger-driven galaxy evolution scenario, the central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in dust obscured galaxies grow rapidly. Interestingly, a recent work \citepsuh24 on a dust-obscured galaxy, LID-568 at z=3.965, has shown that its SMBH is growing extremely fast at about 40 times of the Eddington-limited accretion rate (i.e., super-Eddington accretion). However, the heavy dust extinction of the host galaxy could affect the result if not corrected properly. Here, we analyze James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec/IFU and MIRI spectra of LID-568. By measuring its bolometric luminosity (L_bol) and BH mass (M_BH) using an extinction-free estimator based on mid-infrared spectra, we obtain L_bol = 10^46.83±0.07 erg s<sup>-1</sup> and M_BH = 10^8.43±0.15 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. The measured Eddington ratio (&lambda;_Edd) is 1.97±0.88, consistent with the accretion rate at the Eddington limit; in other words, not in super-Eddington in a significant manner. This result underscores challenges and the importance of carefully considering dust extinction when analyzing the BH growth in dust-obscured quasars.

<p>
We use the deep NIRCam and MIRI imaging from the JWST PRIMER survey to study the properties of (sub)mm sources detected by ALMA in the centre of the COSMOS field, with the aim of better constraining the history of dust-enshrouded star formation. The wealth of ALMA data in this field enabled us to isolate a robust sample of 128 (sub)mm sources within the 175 sq. arcmin of the PRIMER COSMOS survey footprint, spanning two decades in (sub)mm flux density. The JWST imaging is deep/red enough to reveal secure galaxy counterparts for all of these sources. Moreover, 52% of the galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts, enabling us to refine the photo-zs for the remaining galaxies. Armed with this robust redshift information, we calculate the star-formation rates (SFR) and stellar masses of all 128 ALMA-detected galaxies, and place them in the context of other galaxies in the field. We find that the vast majority of star formation is dust-enshrouded in the ALMA-detected galaxies, with SFR ranging from ~1000 down to ~20 solar masses per year. We also find that virtually all (126/128) have high stellar masses, at all redshifts, with log(M/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &gt; 10. The unusually high quality of our sample enables us to make a robust estimate of the contribution of the ALMA-detected galaxies to cosmic star-formation rate density from z = 2 out to z = 7. Finally, to correct for the fact that the deep ALMA pointings cover &lt; 20% of the PRIMER COSMOS area, we use our knowledge of all other massive galaxies in the field to produce a completeness-corrected estimate of dust-enshrouded star-formation rate density over cosmic time. This confirms that UV-visible star formation dominates at z &gt; 4, but also indicates that dust-enshrouded star formation likely still made a significant contribution at higher redshifts: extrapolation of our results suggest a ~20% contribution at z = 8, and potentially still ~5% at z = 10.

### 135) [2503.07711](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07711v1): Where Have All the Little Red Dots Gone? Supermassive Black Hole Binary Dynamics and its Impact on Galaxy Properties

<p> Fazeel Mahmood Khan, Benjamin L. Davis, Andrea Valerio Macciò, Kelly Holley-Bockelmann </p>
<p>
Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations have revealed a peculiar class of galaxies at redshifts z ≳ 6, characterized by extremely high central stellar densities and overmassive central supermassive black holes (SMBHs), "little red dots" (LRDs). A critical question remains: If LRDs were common at high redshifts, how would they evolve into local elliptical galaxies with significantly lower central densities? To address this, we performed direct N-body simulations of LRD mergers, focusing on the coevolution of host galaxies and central SMBHs. We track the complete evolution of SMBH binaries into the three-body hardening and gravitational-wave (GW) emission phase. Our results demonstrate that during galaxy mergers, the central SMBHs can eject a substantial amount of mass from the galactic core via the three-body slingshot effect, leading to a decrease in central stellar surface density by an order of magnitude. Additionally, GW recoil can further contribute in making the galaxy centers less dense and more in alignment with low-redshift quiescent galaxies. This transformation occurs on a relatively short timescale of a few ~100 Myr, implying that LRDs can evolve into lower-redshift elliptical galaxies by z&lt;4. The timescales for our SMBH mergers vary between 100 Myr and 800 Myr, depending on the initial orbital parameters of the merging galaxies and the mass ratio of the SMBHs. Our findings provide a plausible mechanism for the transformation of LRDs into elliptical galaxies while highlighting the efficiency of SMBH mergers in such high-density environments, which plays a crucial role in SMBH growth.

### 136) [2503.07590](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07590v1): Probing Reionization-Era Galaxies with JWST UV Luminosity Functions and Large-Scale Clustering

<p> Anirban Chakraborty, Tirthankar Roy Choudhury </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has transformed our understanding of early galaxy formation, providing an unprecedented view of the first billion years of cosmic history. These observations offer a crucial opportunity to probe the interplay between galaxy formation and reionization, placing stringent constraints on theoretical models. In this work, we build upon our previously developed semi-analytical framework that self-consistently models the evolving UV luminosity function (UVLF) of galaxies and the global reionization history while incorporating the effects of radiative feedback. Comparing our predictions with JWST and HST data, we identify a fundamental tension: models that match the UVLF fail to reproduce the observed evolution of galaxy clustering (bias) with redshift, and vice versa. To resolve this, we introduce a mass-dependent duty cycle linked to star formation duration. This duty cycle approaches unity at z &gt; 11, requiring either enhanced UV radiation production or increased star formation efficiency to match the JWST UVLFs, while declining towards lower redshifts (5 &lt; z ≤ 9) to remain consistent with the bias measurements. Reconciling theory with observations requires that the characteristic star formation timescale increases from ≈ 80 Myr at z ≈ 6 to ≈ 120 Myr at z ≈ 8. Finally, our extended model, assuming a halo mass-independent escape fraction of ≈ 12&percnt;, produces a reionization history consistent with current constraints. These findings underscore the importance of jointly constraining high-redshift galaxy models using both UVLF and bias statistics to accurately interpret JWST data and refine our understanding of early cosmic evolution.

<p>
The spatial correlation between galaxies and the Ly&alpha; forest provides insights into how galaxies reionized the Universe. Here, we present initial results on the spatial cross-correlation between [OIII] emitters and Ly&alpha; forest at 5.4&lt;z&lt;6.5 from the JWST ASPIRE NIRCam/F356W Grism Spectroscopic Survey in z&gt;6.5 QSO fields. Using data from five QSO fields, we find 2&sigma; evidence for excess Ly&alpha; forest transmission at ~20-40 cMpc around [OIII] emitters at z=5.86, indicating that [OIII] emitters reside within a highly ionized IGM. At smaller scales, the Ly&alpha; forest is preferentially absorbed, suggesting gas overdensities around [OIII] emitters. Comparing with models including THESAN simulations, we interpret the observed cross-correlation as evidence for significant large-scale fluctuations of the IGM and the late end of reionization at z&lt;6, characterized by ionized bubbles over 50 cMpc around [OIII] emitters. The required UV background necessitates an unseen population of faint galaxies around the [OIII] emitters. Furthermore, we find that the number of observed [OIII] emitters near individual transmission spikes is insufficient to sustain reionization in their surroundings, even assuming all [OIII] emitters harbour AGN with 100 % LyC escape fractions. Despite broad agreement, a careful analysis of ASPIRE and THESAN, using the observed host halo mass from the clustering of [OIII] emitters, suggests that the simulations underpredict the observed excess IGM transmission around [OIII] emitters, challenging our model of reionization. Potential solutions include larger ionized bubbles at z&lt;6, more enhanced large-scale UV background or temperature fluctuations of the IGM, and possibly a patchy early onset of reionization at z&gt;10. Current observational errors are dominated by cosmic variance, meaning future analyses of more QSO fields from JWST will improve the results.

<p> Hao-Hao Li, Xin-zhe Zhang, Taotao Qiu, Jun-Qing Xia </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has observed massive galaxies at high redshifts, which implies an earlier epoch of reionization (EoR) compared with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) results. In this paper, based on ttPlanck 2020 (NPIPE release), ttACT DR4 and ttSPT-3G data, if assumed a Harrison-Zel'dovich (HZ) primordial power spectrum in the standard cosmological model, we discover that the redshift or optical depth of reionization is larger than the case of a power-law (PL) primordial power spectrum. In HZ- &Lambda; CDM model, the redshift of reionization is z_reio = 9.11 ± 0.61 , which is consistent with the JWST result that z_reio ≈ 8.9 . Moreover, the cosmological tensions, i.e. Hubble (H_0) tension and S_8 tension are alleviated in HZ- &Lambda; CDM case. The Hubble constant is H_0 = 70.38 ± 0.35   km/s/Mpc and the structure growth parameter is S_8 = 0.7645± 0.0094 in HZ- &Lambda; CDM model. We also consider two extensions of &Lambda; CDM, including &Lambda; CDM + A_L and &Lambda; CDM + &Omega;_k models. But the extensions of &Lambda; CDM with a HZ spectrum meet more serious CMB anomalies, i.e. lensing anomaly and spatial curvature anomaly as compared with the extensions of &Lambda; CDM with a PL spectrum. We discuss that these two CMB anomalies may come from the degeneracy of cosmological parameters.

### 139) [2503.05691](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05691v1): Reionization and the Hubble Constant: Correlations in the Cosmic Microwave Background

<p> Itamar J. Allali, Praniti Singh, JiJi Fan, Lingfeng Li </p>
<p>
Recently, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has found early galaxies producing photons from more efficient ionization than previously assumed. This may suggest a reionization process with a larger reionization optical depth, &tau;_reio, in some mild disagreement with that inferred from measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB). Intriguingly, the CMB would prefer larger values of &tau;_reio, more consistent with the recent JWST hint, if the large-scale measurements (i.e. &ell; &lt;30) of E-mode polarization are removed. In addition, &tau;_reio has an indirect correlation with today's Hubble constant H_0 in &Lambda;CDM. Motivated by these interesting observations, we investigate and reveal the underlying mechanism for this correlation, using the CMB dataset without the low-&ell; polarization data as a proxy for a potential cosmology with a larger &tau;_reio. We further explore how this correlation may impact the Hubble tension between early and late universe measurements of H_0, in &Lambda;CDM as well as two proposals to alleviate the Hubble tension: the dark radiation (DR) and early dark energy (EDE) models. We find that the Hubble tension gets further reduced mildly for almost all cases due to the larger &tau;_reio and its positive correlation with H_0, with either the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data before those from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) or the DESI data.

### 140) [2503.05537](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05537v1): Little Red Dots as the Very First Activity of Black Hole Growth

<p> Kohei Inayoshi </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope has detected massive black holes (BHs) with masses of ~ 10^6-8~M<sub>&odot;</sub> within the first billion years of the universe. One of the remarkable findings is the identification of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs), a unique class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with distinct characteristics representing a key phase in the formation and growth of early BHs. Here, we analyze the occurrence rate of LRDs, which emerge around redshifts z ~ 6-8 and sharply decline at z &lt; 4. We find that this trend follows a log-normal distribution, commonly observed in phenomena driven by stochastic and random factors. We propose a hypothesis that the first one or two AGN events associated with newly-formed seed BHs are observed as LRDs and their unique features fade in the subsequent episodes. This naturally explains the cosmic evolution of AGN abundance over 0 &lt; z &lt; 5, which follows &prop; (1+z)^-5/2 due to the cumulative effect of recurring AGN activity. The unique characteristics of LRDs are likely linked to the dense gas environments around the seed BHs, which create strong absorption features in the broad-line emission and enable super-Eddington accretion bursts, ultimately yielding the observed overmassive nature of BHs compared to the local relationship.

We acquired 450 &mu;m and 850 &mu;m dust continuum polarization observations toward the inner region of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) as part of the B-Fields In Star-Forming Region Observations (BISTRO) survey using the POL-2 polarimeter on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. These observations encompassed three dense structures: the 20 km s<sup>-1</sup> cloud (20MC), 50 km s<sup>-1</sup> cloud (50MC), and circumnuclear disk (CND). Our aim is to investigate the magnetic field morphology and strength in the inner region of the CMZ using polarized dust continuum and the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. The magnetic field morphology is highly ordered in all three dense regions. The plane-of-sky magnetic field strengths are ~1 mG for the 20MC and the 50MC, and ~2 mG for the CND. We compare the energy contributions of turbulence, gravity, and thermal motion with that of the magnetic field using the plasma &beta;, mass-to-flux ratio, and Alfv\'en Mach number. The outcomes reveal the magnetic field stands out as the predominant factor within the inner region of the CMZ. The dominance of the magnetic field may explain the low star-forming rate in the CMZ. We further investigate the dust grain alignment efficiency by exploring the relationship between polarization fraction and total intensity. The results suggest that dust grains are well aligned with the magnetic fields.

### 142) [2503.05120](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05120v2): Computing Anharmonic Infrared Spectra of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Using Machine-Learning Molecular Dynamics

<p> Xinghong Mai, Zhao Wang, Lijun Pan, Johannes Schorghuber, Peter Kovacs, Jesus Carrete, Georg K. H. Madsen </p>
<p>
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are key contributors to interstellar aromatic infrared (IR) bands. However, current spectral databases for IR emission analysis are limited by the omission of vibrational anharmonicity and temperature effects, primarily because of the high computational cost of conventional quantum chemical calculations (QCCs). In this work, we present a machine learning-based molecular dynamics (MLMD) approach that efficiently computes anharmonic IR spectra while incorporating temperature effects. MLMD achieves predictive accuracy comparable to that of QCCs but with significantly reduced computational cost, scaling linearly with the number of atoms in the system. We applied MLMD to calculate the anharmonic spectra of 1704 PAHs in the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database with up to 216 carbon atoms, demonstrating its capability for high-throughput spectral calculations of large molecular systems. Our results highlight MLMD's potential to enable the development of extensive molecular spectral datasets, enhancing data-driven analyses of astronomical IR spectra, particularly in anticipation of upcoming data from the James Webb Space Telescope.

### 143) [2503.04894](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04894v2): The THESAN-ZOOM project: central starbursts and inside-out quenching govern galaxy sizes in the early Universe

<p>
We explore the evolution of galaxy sizes at high redshift (3 &lt; z &lt; 13) using the high-resolution THESAN-ZOOM radiation-hydrodynamics simulations, focusing on the mass range of 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> &lt; M<sub>&ast;</sub> &lt; 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Our analysis reveals that galaxy size growth is tightly coupled to bursty star formation. Galaxies above the star-forming main sequence experience rapid central compaction during starbursts, followed by inside-out quenching and spatially extended star formation that leads to expansion, causing oscillatory behavior around the size-mass relation. Notably, we find a positive intrinsic size-mass relation at high redshift, consistent with observations but in tension with large-volume simulations. We attribute this discrepancy to the bursty star formation captured by our multi-phase interstellar medium framework, but missing from simulations using the effective equation-of-state approach with hydrodynamically decoupled feedback. We also find that the normalization of the size-mass relation follows a double power law as a function of redshift, with a break at z≈6, because the majority of galaxies at z &gt; 6 show rising star-formation histories, and therefore are in a compaction phase. We demonstrate that H&alpha; emission is systematically extended relative to the UV continuum by a median factor of 1.7, consistent with recent JWST studies. However, in contrast to previous interpretations that link extended H&alpha; sizes to inside-out growth, we find that Lyman-continuum (LyC) emission is spatially disconnected from H&alpha;. Instead, a simple Str\"omgren sphere argument reproduces observed trends, suggesting that extreme LyC production during central starbursts is the primary driver of extended nebular emission.

### 144) [2503.04032](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04032v1): Circumgalactic Enrichment by a Multi-Galaxy Merger at Redshift 6.7

<p> Weida Hu, Casey Papovich, Lu Shen, Zixuan Peng, L. Y. Aaron Yung, Brian C. Lemaux, Justin Spilker, Justin Cole </p>
<p>
Recent JWST observations have uncovered high-redshift galaxies characterized by multiple star-forming clumps, many of which appear to be undergoing mergers. Such mergers are powerful drivers of galaxy evolution, triggering intense star formation that accelerates the formation of massive quiescent galaxies. Mergers can also expel and redistribute the metal-enriched gas from galaxies into their circum-galactic medium (CGM), regulating the chemical component of their environments and creating channels of ionized gas through which ionizing radiation escapes. Here, we report a merger of at least five galaxies, dubbed JWST's Quintet (JQ), at redshift 6.7, discovered in the JWST GOODS-South field. This system resides in a small area ~4.5''×4.5'' (24.6×24.6 pkpc<sup>2</sup>), containing over 17 galaxy-size clumps with a total stellar mass of 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. The JQ system has a total star formation rate of 240-270 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1, placing it ~1 dex above the median star formation rate-mass main sequence at this epoch. The high mass and star formation rate of the JQ galaxies are sufficient to produce massive, inactive galaxies identified at later times, by redshift 4, suggesting this may be a progenitor event for such systems. We detect a large \foiii+H&beta; emitting gaseous halo surrounding and connecting four galaxies in the JQ, consistent with the interaction between them. This indicates that the CGM of JQ is already enriched by the heavy elements generated from the galaxies through merger-induced tidal stripping or galactic outflows. Our findings offer a plausible evolutionary pathway for the formation of massive quiescent galaxies observed at lower redshifts and provide direct evidence for the metal enrichment of their environments through galaxy mergers, just 800 Myr after the Big Bang.

### 145) [2503.03870](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03870v1): The Convergence of Heavy and Light Seeds to Overmassive Black Holes at Cosmic Dawn

<p> Haojie Hu, Kohei Inayoshi, Zoltan Haiman, Luis C. Ho, Ken Ohsuga </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at redshifts of z≳ 4-7, many of which host accreting massive black holes (BHs) with BH-to-galaxy mass (M_BH/M<sub>&sext;</sub>) ratios exceeding the local values by more than an order of magnitude. The origin of these overmassive BHs remains unclear but requires potential contributions from heavy seeds and/or episodes of super-Eddington accretion. We present a growth model coupled with dark matter halo assembly to explore the evolution of the M_BH/M<sub>&sext;</sub> ratio under different seeding and feedback scenarios. Given the gas inflow rates in protogalaxies, BHs grow episodically at moderate super-Eddington rates and the mass ratio increases early on, despite significant mass loss through feedback. Regardless of seeding mechanisms, the mass ratio converges to a universal value ~ 0.1-0.3, set by the balance between gas feeding and star formation efficiency in the nucleus. This behavior defines an attractor in the M_BH-M<sub>&sext;</sub> diagram, where overmassive BHs grow more slowly than their hosts, while undermassive seeds experience rapid growth before aligning with the attractor. We derive an analytical expression for the universal mass ratio, linking it to feedback strength and halo growth. The convergence of evolutionary tracks erases seeding information from the mass ratio by z~ 4-6. Detecting BHs with ~ 10^5-6~M<sub>&odot;</sub> at higher redshifts that deviate from convergence trend would provide key diagnostics of their birth conditions.

<p>
We measure H&alpha; luminosity functions (LFs) at redshifts z ~ 4.5 and 6.3 using the JWST MAGNIF (Medium-band Astrophysics with the Grism of NIRCam In Frontier fields) survey. MAGNIF obtained NIRCam grism spectra with the F360M and F480M filters in four Frontier Fields. We identify 248 H&alpha; emitters based on the grism spectra and photometric redshifts from combined HST and JWST imaging data. The numbers of the H&alpha; emitters show a large field-to-field variation, highlighting the necessity of multiple fields to mitigate cosmic variance. We calculate both observed and dust-corrected H&alpha; LFs in the two redshift bins. Thanks to the gravitational lensing, the measured H&alpha; LFs span three orders of magnitude in luminosity, and the faint-end luminosity reaches L_H&alpha; ~ 10^40.3 erg s<sup>-1</sup> at z ~ 4.5 and 10^41.5 erg s<sup>-1</sup> at z ~ 6.3, corresponding to star-formation rates (SFRs) of ~ 0.1 and 1.7 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1. We conclude no or weak redshift evolution of the faint-end slope of H&alpha; LF across z≃0.4-6.3, and the comparison with the faint-end slopes of UV LF indicates stochastic star formation history among low-mass H&alpha; emitters. The derived cosmic SFR densities are 0.058^+0.008_-0.006  M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1 Mpc^-3 at z ~ 4.5 and 0.025^+0.009_-0.007  M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1 Mpc^-3 at z ~ 6.3. These are approximately 2.2 times higher than previous estimates based on dust-corrected UV LFs, but consistent with recent measurements from infrared surveys. We discuss uncertainties in the H&alpha; LF measurements, including those propagate from the lens models, cosmic variance, and AGN contribution.

<p>
The metallicity of galaxies, and its variation with galactocentric radius, provides key insights into the formation histories of galaxies and the physical processes driving their evolution. In this work, we analyze the radial metallicity gradients of star forming galaxies in the EAGLE, Illustris, IllustrisTNG, and SIMBA cosmological simulations across a broad mass (10^8.0M<sub>&odot;</sub>≤ M<sub>&sext;</sub> ≲10^12.0M<sub>&odot;</sub>) and redshift (0≤ z≤8) range. We find that all simulations predict strong negative (i.e., radially decreasing) metallicity gradients at early cosmic times, likely due to their similar treatments of relatively smooth stellar feedback allowing for sustained inside-out growth. The strongest redshift evolution occurs in galaxies with stellar masses of 10^10.0-10^11.0M<sub>&odot;</sub>, while galaxies with stellar masses &lt; 10^10M<sub>&odot;</sub> and &gt;10^11M<sub>&odot;</sub> exhibit weaker redshift evolution. Our results of negative gradients at high-redshift contrast with the many positive and flat gradients in the 1&lt;z&lt;4 observational literature. At z&gt;6, the negative gradients observed with JWST and ALMA are flatter than those in simulations, albeit with closer agreement than at lower redshift. Overall, we suggest that these smooth stellar feedback galaxy simulations may not sufficiently mix their metal content, and that either stronger stellar feedback or additional subgrid turbulent metal diffusion models may be required to better reproduce observed metallicity gradients.

### 148) [2503.03806](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03806v1): The THESAN-ZOOM project: Population III star formation continues until the end of reionization

<p> Oliver Zier, Rahul Kannan, Aaron Smith, Ewald Puchwein, Mark Vogelsberger, Josh Borrow, Enrico Garaldi, Laura Keating, William McClymont, Xuejian Shen, Lars Hernquist </p>
<p>
Population III (Pop III) stars are the first stars in the Universe, forming from pristine, metal-free gas and marking the end of the cosmic dark ages. Their formation rate is expected to sharply decline after redshift z ≈ 15 due to metal enrichment from previous generations of stars. In this paper, we analyze 14 zoom-in simulations from the THESAN-ZOOM project, which evolves different haloes from the THESAN-1 cosmological box down to redshift z=3. The high mass resolution of up to 142 M<sub>&odot;</sub> per cell in the gas phase combined with a multiphase model of the interstellar medium (ISM), radiative transfer including Lyman-Werner radiation, dust physics, and a non-equilibrium chemistry network that tracks molecular hydrogen, allows for a realistic but still approximate description of Pop III star formation in pristine gas. Our results show that Pop III stars continue to form in low-mass haloes ranging from 10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> to 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> until the end of reionization at around z=5. At this stage, photoevaporation suppresses further star formation in these minihaloes, which subsequently merge into larger central haloes. Hence, the remnants of Pop III stars primarily reside in the satellite galaxies of larger haloes at lower redshifts. While direct detection of Pop III stars remains elusive, these results hint that lingering primordial star formation could leave observable imprints or indirectly affect the properties of high-redshift galaxies. Explicit Pop III feedback and specialized initial mass function modelling within the THESAN-ZOOM framework would further help interpreting emerging constraints from the James Webb Space Telescope.

<p> Yang Sun, George H. Rieke, Jianwei Lyu, Meredith A. Stone, Zhiyuan Ji, Pierluigi Rinaldi, Christopher N. A. Willmer, Yongda Zhu </p>
<p>
The ratio between the stellar mass of a galaxy, M_*, and that of its central supermassive black hole (SMBH), M<sub>&bull;</sub>, the "Magorrian'' relationship, traces their coevolution. JWST observations have suggested significant evolution in M<sub>&bull;</sub>/M_* relative to local scaling relationships both in low-mass galaxies and in quasars at z ≥ 4. We test this possibility by (1) determining the preferred M<sub>&bull;</sub>/M_* scaling relation among those proposed locally; and (2) providing uniform host galaxy stellar mass estimates. These steps reduce the prominence of the reported evolution. We then apply Monte Carlo simulations to account for observational biases. We still find a significant increase over the local scaling relation in M<sub>&bull;</sub>/M_* for z ≥ 4 SMBHs in very low-mass galaxies (log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)&lt;10). However, similarly high values of M<sub>&bull;</sub>/M_* are also found in low mass galaxies at z ~ 0.5 to 3 that may be common at cosmic noon. Nonetheless, galaxies with similar behavior are rare locally and not accounted for in the local scaling relations. In contrast, z ~ 6 quasars can have M<sub>&bull;</sub>/M_* well above the local relation value, but they can be explained as extreme cases still within the scaling relation for their higher mass host galaxies. Black holes in some of them and in the low-mass systems may be undergoing very high accretion episodes that result in high M<sub>&bull;</sub>/M_* but that will be followed by quiescent periods when growth of the host drives the systems toward more typical M<sub>&bull;</sub>/M_* values.

The cosmic star formation history (CSFH) and cosmic active galactic nuclei (AGN) luminosity history (CAGNH) are self consistently presented at z = 5.5-13.5. This is achieved by analyzing galaxies detected by the James Webb Space Telescope from ≈ 400   arcmin<sup>2</sup> fields from the PEARLS, CEERS, NGDEEP, JADES and PRIMER surveys. In particular, the combination of spectral energy distribution fitting codes, EAZY and ProSpect, are employed to estimate the photometric redshifts and astrophysical quantities of 3947 distant galaxies, from which we compute the stellar mass, star formation rate and AGN luminosity distribution functions in four redshift bins. Integrating the distribution functions, we find that the CAGNH tentatively rises by ≈ 2.2 dex over z = 5.5-13.5 compared to ≈ 1.8 dex for the CSFH, indicating that the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) tends to outpace the assembly of stellar mass. We connect our results of the CSFH and CAGNH at z=5.5-13.5 to that from z= 0-5 to determine the summary of ≳ 13 Gyr of star formation and AGN activity, from the very onset of galaxy formation to the present day.

We present subarcsecond-resolution ALMA mosaics of the Orion Bar PDR in [CI] 609um, C2H (4-3), and C18O (3-2) emission lines complemented by JWST images of H2 and aromatic infrared band (AIB) emission. The rim of the Bar shows very corrugated structures made of small-scale H2 dissociation fronts (DFs). The [CI] 609 um emission peaks very close (~0.002 pc) to the main H2-emitting DFs, suggesting the presence of gas density gradients. These DFs are also bright and remarkably similar in C2H emission, which traces "hydrocarbon radical peaks" characterized by very high C2H abundances, reaching up to several x10^-7. The high abundance of C2H and of related hydrocarbon radicals, such as CH3, CH2, and CH, can be attributed to gas-phase reactions driven by elevated temperatures, the presence of C+ and C, and the reactivity of FUV-pumped H2. The hydrocarbon radical peaks roughly coincide with maxima of the 3.4/3.3 um AIB intensity ratio, a proxy for the aliphatic-to-aromatic content of PAHs. This implies that the conditions triggering the formation of simple hydrocarbons also favor the formation (and survival) of PAHs with aliphatic side groups, potentially via the contribution of bottom-up processes in which abundant hydrocarbon radicals react in situ with PAHs. Ahead of the DFs, in the atomic PDR zone (where [H]&gt;&gt;[H2]), the AIB emission is the brightest, but small PAHs and carbonaceous grains undergo photo-processing due to the stronger FUV field. Our detection of trace amounts of C2H in this zone may result from the photoerosion of these species. This study provides a spatially resolved view of the chemical stratification of key carbon carriers in a PDR. Overall, both bottom-up and top-down processes appear to link simple hydrocarbon molecules with PAHs in molecular clouds; however, the exact chemical pathways and their relative contributions remain to be quantified.

While molecular outflows have been studied in details with radio interferometry, observations of the hotter gas in protostellar outflows at a comparable physical scale is often challenging. Combined with ALMA, JWST allows us to investigate the cold and hot gas with unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity. We present a detailed comparison between the gas distributions probed with ALMA and JWST in the primary outflow of IRAS 15398-3359. At 2000 au scale, the southwestern outflow shows four shell structures in 5&ndash;10 micron continuum, whereas the submillimeter H<sub>2</sub>CO emission traces two of the four shells closest to the protostar. Submillimeter emission from CS, CCH, c-C_3H<sub>2</sub>, and CH_3OH shows the same two shells, and the ^12CO emission covers most of the outflow region. SO and SiO only trace a condensation at the edge of the shell closest to the protostar. None of these lines observed with ALMA show the outermost shell. At 500 au scale, we find hot H<sub>2</sub> gas inside the outflow cavity with JWST. The derived temperature of H<sub>2</sub> is 1147±198 K within a 0\farcs5 aperture at the protostar. The foreground mass column density of dust is (1.4&ndash;2.0)×10^-3 g\cdotcm<sup>2</sup> (A_v = 47&ndash;66 mag) in the outflow, using the dust model from Weingartner & Draine (2001). We also find an 8&deg; difference between the directions toward the [Fe II] knot and the outermost shell in the MIRI image, which may be interpreted as the precession of the [Fe II] jet. The dynamical timescale of the [Fe II] knot is 10 yrs, suggesting a current event.

<p>
There is vast evidence from observations of multiple stellar populations (MPs) in globular clusters (GCs). To explore the issue theoretically, this work considers two subsolar metallicities, two ages, and two initial abundance patterns: a first population of standard &alpha;-enhanced metal mixture stars and a second stellar population displaying C-N and Na-O anticorrelations chemical abundance patterns, along with an enhanced helium fraction. Analysing the predictions for these extreme compositions, we provide insights into the observability of not-resolved MPs into individual stars of GCs. We use colours and spectrophotometric indices measurable with modern facilities (e.g. Euclid, LSST, DES, JWST).

### 154) [2503.02527](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02527v1): Identification of high-redshift X-ray active galactic nuclei in the 4XMM-DR11 serendipitous catalogue using DES data: Comparative analysis with optically-selected QSOs

<p>
X-rays provide a robust method in identifying AGN. However, in the high-redshift Universe, their space density is relatively low, and, in combination with the small areas covered by X-ray surveys, the selected AGN are poorly sampled. Deep optical/infrared data are essential for locating counterparts and determining redshifts. In this work, we leverage the XMM-Newton 4XMM-DR11 serendipitous catalogue alongside the extensive optical Dark Energy Survey and the near-infrared VISTA Hemisphere Survey (VHS) to select one of the largest high-z X-ray AGN samples to date. Our analysis focuses on the overlapping area of these surveys, covering about 185 deg<sup>2</sup>. In addition, we aspire to compare the properties of the X-ray AGN with the optically-selected QSOs. For sources without spectroscopic data (80%), we estimated the photometric redshifts using both SED fitting and machine-learning algorithms. Among the 65,000 X-ray sources in the 4XMM-DES-VHS area, we ended up with 833 z&gt;3.5 AGN (11% having spec-z information) with high reliability and a fraction of outliers &eta;&lt;10%. The sample completeness is 90%, driven by the depth of DES data. Only 10% of the X-ray selected AGN are also optical QSOs and vice versa. Our findings indicate an observed absorbed fraction (log N_H~[cm<sup>2</sup>] ≥ 23) of 20-40% for the X-ray AGN, significantly higher than that of optical QSOs. X-ray AGN exhibit fainter observed optical magnitudes and brighter mid-IR magnitudes than optical QSOs. Their median rest-frame SED shapes differ notably with optical QSOs being dominated by AGN emission in the UV-optical wavelengths. While the median SEDs of X-ray AGN suggest extinction in the UV-optical range, individual sources exhibit a wide range of spectral shapes, indicating significant diversity within the population. This analysis supports that X-ray and optically-selected AGN represent distinct and complementary populations.

### 155) [2503.02204](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02204v1): Deuterated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in the Interstellar Medium: Constraints from the Orion Bar as Observed by the James Webb Space Telescope

<p> Xuejuan Yang, Aigen Li </p>
<p>
The gas-phase abundances of deuterium (D) in the local interstellar medium (ISM) exhibit considerable regional variations. Particularly, in some regions the gas-phase D abundances are substantially lower than the primordial D abundance generated in the Big Bang, after subtracting the astration reduction caused by the Galactic chemical evolution. Deuterated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules have been suggested as a potential reservoir of the D atoms missing from the gas-phase. Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope's Near Infrared Spectrograph have revealed the widespread of deuterated PAHs in the Orion Bar through their aliphatic C&ndash;D emission at 4.65 &mu; m and possibly aromatic C&ndash;D emission at 4.4 &mu; m as well. To examine the viability of deuterated PAHs as the D reservoir, we model the infrared (IR) emission spectra of small PAH molecules containing various aromatic and aliphatic D atoms in the Orion Bar. We find that small deuterated PAHs exhibit a noticeable emission band at 4.4 or 4.65 &mu; m even if they contain only one aromatic or aliphatic D atom. We derive N_D,ali/N_H≈3.4&percnt;, the deuteration degree of PAHs measured as the number of aliphatic D atoms (relative to H), from the observed intensity ratios of the 4.65 &mu; m band to the 3.3 &mu; m aromatic C&ndash;H band. The deuteration degree for aromatically-deuterated PAHs is less certain as C&ndash;N stretch also contributes to the observed emission around 4.4 &mu; m. If we attribute it exclusively to aromatic C&ndash;D, we derive an upper limit of ≈14&percnt; on the deuteration degree, which is capable of accounting for an appreciable fraction of the missing D budget.

<p>
We report the discovery of an intriguing, low-mass galaxy-scale strong-lens system in the SMACS J0723.3-7327 galaxy cluster. By modeling James Webb Space Telescope imaging and Very Large Telescope Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer spectroscopic data, we find that the lens is cluster member galaxy at z=0.397 with an Einstein radius of 0&prime;&prime;.424 ± 0&prime;&prime;.012, stellar mass of M_* = (3.3 ± 0.8) × 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, half-light radius of ~ 1 kpc, and central stellar velocity dispersion of 140 ± 6 km s<sup>-1</sup>. This lens galaxy is one of the few strong lens galaxies known to date that have stellar mass as low as M_* ~ 10^10.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, offering an exceptional opportunity to peek into the population of low-mass galaxies that has largely remained unexplored in the context of strong-lensing studies. This strong lens system can also assist in assessing the systematic uncertainty in the lens modeling of cluster member galaxies.

### 157) [2503.02059](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02059v1): A confirmed deficit of hot and cold dust emission in the most luminous Little Red Dots

<p>
Luminous broad H&alpha; emission and red rest-optical SEDs are the hallmark of compact Little Red Dots (LRDs), implying highly attenuated dusty starbursts and/or obscured active galactic nuclei. However, the lack of observed FIR emission has proved difficult to reconcile with the implied attenuated luminosity in these models. Here, we utilize deep new ALMA imaging, new and existing JWST/MIRI imaging, and archival Spitzer/Herschel imaging of two of the rest-optically brightest LRDs (z=3.1 and z=4.47) to place the strongest constraints on the IR luminosity in LRDs to date. The detections at &lambda;_rest=1-4  &mu;m imply flat slopes in the rest-IR, ruling out a contribution from hot (T≳500 K) dust. Similarly, FIR non-detections rule out any appreciable cold (T≲75 K) dust component. Assuming energy balance, these observations are inconsistent with the typical FIR dust emission of dusty starbursts and quasar torii, which usually show a mixture of cold and hot dust. Additionally, our [C_II] non-detections rule out typical dusty starbursts. We compute empirical maximum IR SEDs and find that both LRDs must have log(L_IR/L<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≲ 12.2 at the 3&sigma; level. These limits are in tension with the predictions of rest-optical spectrophotometric fits, be they galaxy only, AGN only, or composite. It is unlikely that LRDs are highly dust-reddened intrinsically blue sources with a dust temperature distribution that conspires to avoid current observing facilities. Rather, we favor an intrinsically redder LRD SED model that alleviates the need for strong dust attenuation.

<p>
Outflows are a key element in the baryon cycle of galaxies, and their properties provide a fundamental test for our models of how star formation quenches in galaxies. Here we report the detection of outflowing gas in two recently quenched, massive (M<sub>&sext;</sub>~10^10.2M<sub>&odot;</sub>) galaxies at z=4.106 (NS_274) and z=7.276 (RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7) observed with JWST/NIRSpec. The outflows are traced by blue-shifted MgII absorption lines, and in the case of the z=4.1 system, also by FeII and NaI features. The spectra of the two sources are similar to those of local post-starburst galaxies, showing deep Balmer features and minimal star formation on 10 Myr timescales as traced by the lack of bright emission lines, also suggesting the absence of a strong and radiatively efficient AGN. The galaxies' SFHs are consistent with an abrupt quenching of star formation, which continued at rates of ~15 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr averaged over 100 Myr timescales. Dedicated millimeter observations of NS_274 constrain its dust obscured SFR to &lt;12 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr. Under simple geometrical assumptions, we derive mass loading factors ≲1 and ~50 for the z=4.1 and z=7.3 systems, respectively, and similarly different energies carried by the outflows. Supernovae feedback can account for the mass and energy of the outflow in NS_274. However, the low mass loading factor and average gas velocity suggest that the observed outflow is unlikely to be the reason behind its quenching. SF-related processes seem to be insufficient to explain the extreme mass outflow rate of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7, which would require an additional ejective mechanism such as an undetected AGN. Finally, the average outflow velocities per unit M<sub>&sext;</sub>, SFR, or its surface area are consistent with those of lower-redshift post-starburst galaxies, suggesting that outflows in rapidly quenched galaxies might occur similarly across cosmic time.

### 159) [2503.01968](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01968v1): Can primordial black holes explain the overabundance of bright super-early galaxies?

<p> Antonio Matteri, Andrea Pallottini, Andrea Ferrara </p>
<p>
JWST is detecting an excess of high-redshift (z≳ 10), bright galaxies challenging most theoretical predictions. To address this issue, we investigate the impact of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) on the halo mass function and UV luminosity function (LF) of super-early galaxies. We explore two key effects: (i) the enhancement of massive halos abundance due to the compact nature and spatial distribution of PBHs, and (ii) the luminosity boost, characterized by the Eddington ratio &lambda;_E, due to Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) powered by matter accretion onto PBHs. We build an effective model, calibrated using data at lower redshifts (z≈ 4-9), to derive the evolution of the LF including the additional PBH contribution. Via Bayesian analysis, we find that: (a) Although a small fraction (log f_PBH ≈ -5.42) of massive (log M_PBH / M<sub>&odot;</sub> ≈ 8.37), non-emitting (&lambda;_E=0) PBHs can explain the galaxy excess via the halo abundance enhancement, this solution is excluded by CMB &mu;-distortion constraints on monochromatic PBHs. (b) If PBHs power an AGN emitting at super-Eddington luminosity (&lambda;_E ≈ 10), the observed LF can be reproduced by a PBH population with characteristic mass log M_PBH / M<sub>&odot;</sub> ≈ 3.69 constituting a tiny (log f_PBH ≈ -8.16) fraction of the cosmic dark matter content. In the AGN scenario, about 75% of the observed galaxies with M_UV=-21 at z=11 should host a PBH-powered AGN and typically reside in low mass halos, M_h = 10^8-9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. These predictions can be tested with available and forthcoming JWST spectroscopic data. We note that our analysis considers a lognormal PBH mass function and compares its parameters with monochromatic limits on PBH abundance. Further work is required to relax such limitations.

<p>
Little Red Dots (LRDs) are compact, point-like sources characterized by their red color and broad Balmer lines, which have been debated to be either dominated by active galactic nuclei (AGN) or dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). Here we report two LRDs (ID9094 and ID2756) at z<sub>spec</sub>&gt;7, recently discovered in the JWST FRESCO GOODS-North field. Both satisfy the "v-shape" colors and compactness criteria for LRDs and are identified as Type-I AGN candidates based on their broad H&beta; emission lines (full width at half maximum: 2276±492 km/s for ID9094 and 1069±239 km/s for ID2756) and narrow [OI] lines (~ 300-400 km/s). To investigate their nature, we conduct deep NOEMA follow-up observations targeting the [CII] 158&mu; m emission line and the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We do not detect [CII] or 1.3 mm continuum emission for either source. Notably, in the scenario that the two LRDs were DSFGs, we would expect significant detections: &gt;16&sigma; for [CII] and &gt;3&sigma; for the 1.3 mm continuum of ID9094, and &gt;5&sigma; for [CII] of ID2756. Using the 3&sigma; upper limits of [CII] and 1.3 mm, we perform two analyses: (1) UV-to-FIR spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with and without AGN components, and (2) comparison of their properties with the L_[CII]-SFR_tot empirical relation. Both analyses indicate that LRDs favor the presence of AGN to explain their observed properties. Our results highlight the importance of far-infrared observations for studying LRDs, a regime that remains largely unexplored.

### 161) [2503.01949](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01949v1): The THESAN-ZOOM project: Star-formation efficiencies in high-redshift galaxies

<p> Xuejian Shen, Rahul Kannan, Ewald Puchwein, Aaron Smith, Mark Vogelsberger, Josh Borrow, Enrico Garaldi, Laura Keating, Oliver Zier, William McClymont, Sandro Tacchella, Zihao Wang, Lars Hernquist </p>
<p>
Recent JWST observations hint at unexpectedly intense cosmic star-formation in the early Universe, often attributed to enhanced star-formation efficiencies (SFEs). Here, we analyze the SFE in THESAN-ZOOM, a novel zoom-in radiation-hydrodynamic simulation campaign of high-redshift (z ≳ 3) galaxies employing a state-of-the-art galaxy formation model resolving the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM). The halo-scale SFE (&epsilon;<sup>&ast;</sup>_halo) - the fraction of baryons accreted by a halo that are converted to stars - follows a double power-law dependence on halo mass, with a mild redshift evolution above M_halo ≳ 10^9.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. The power-law slope is roughly 1/3 at large halo masses, consistent with expectations when gas outflows are momentum-driven. At lower masses, the slope is roughly 2/3 and is more aligned with the energy-driven outflow scenario. &epsilon;<sup>&ast;</sup>_halo is a factor of 2-3 larger than commonly assumed in empirical galaxy-formation models at M_halo ≲ 10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. On galactic (kpc) scales, the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation of neutral gas is universal in THESAN-ZOOM, following &Sigma;_SFR &prop; &Sigma;_gas^2, indicative of a turbulent energy balance in the ISM maintained by stellar feedback. The rise of &epsilon;<sup>&ast;</sup>_halo with halo mass can be traced primarily to increasing gas surface densities in massive galaxies, while the underlying KS relation and neutral, star-forming gas fraction remain unchanged. Although the increase in &epsilon;<sup>&ast;</sup>_halo with redshift is relatively modest, it is sufficient to explain the large observed number density of UV-bright galaxies at z ≳ 12. However, reproducing the brightest sources at M_UV ≲ -21 may require extrapolating the SFE beyond the halo mass range directly covered by THESAN-ZOOM.

<p>
We report the spectroscopic confirmation of a merging pair of massive quiescent galaxies at z=3.44. Using JWST observations, we confirm that the two galaxies lie at a projected separation of 4.5 kpc with a velocity offset of ~ 680  km  s<sup>-1</sup> (&delta;_z ~ 0.01). The pair resides in the core of a known rich overdensity of galaxies, dubbed the "Cosmic Vine". For both pair members, modeling of the Spectral Energy Distributions and faint rest-frame optical emission lines indicate high stellar masses (log(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)~10.9) and suppressed star formation (log(sSFR/yr^-1)&lt;-10), more than an order of magnitude below the level of the star formation main sequence at this redshift. We then explore the Illustris-TNG simulation and the GAEA and SHARK semi-analytical models to examine whether they produce a pair of massive quiescent galaxies akin to that of the Cosmic Vine. While all models produce close pairs of massive quiescent galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;4 with comparable separations and velocity offsets, their predicted number densities are 10-80 times lower than our observational constraint. This discrepancy cannot be fully explained by coarse time sampling in these models or the general challenge of forming early massive quiescent galaxies in simulations. Given that &gt;90&percnt; of simulated pairs in the models that we analyzed merge by z=0, our findings suggest that our observed pair will likely coalesce into a single massive galaxy. The merger, occurring in the dense core of a large-scale structure, might represent a critical event in the formation of a brightest cluster galaxy and the morphological transformation of high-redshift disky quiescent galaxies into early-type ellipticals.

We present a sample of 146 high-redshift (z&gt;7.5) galaxies from the CANUCS/Technicolor surveys, showcasing photometry in every wide- and medium-band NIRCam filter in addition to ancillary HST data sampling 0.4-5 &mu; m (22 JWST bands out of 29 bands total). Additionally, 48 (33&percnt;) galaxies in our sample meet criteria to be classified as extreme emission line galaxies, 15 (10&percnt;) of which are completely missed by typical dropout selections due to faint UV emission. By fitting the SEDs covering the rest-frame UV to optical at z &gt; 7.5, we investigate the dust obscuration properties, giving an unbiased view of dust buildup in high-redshift galaxies free from spectroscopic follow-up selection effects. Dust attenuation correlates with stellar mass, but more strongly with star formation rate. We find typical galaxies at z&gt;7.5 have ~ 25 &percnt; of their star formation obscured. However, since galaxies with higher star formation rates suffer more attenuation, ~ 50 &percnt; of the total star formation rate density at 7.5&lt;z&lt;9 is obscured. The obscured fraction drops to ~ 35 &percnt; in our 9&lt;z&lt;12 bin, possibly due to substantial dust grain growth in the interstellar medium not having time to occur. Extrapolating the decline in dust obscuration of galaxies to higher redshifts, we infer that dust obscuration should approach zero at z &gt; 15, implying that epoch as when dust first forms in bright galaxies.

### 164) [2503.01272](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01272v1): Investigating dusty Red Supergiant outflows in Westerlund 1 with 3D Hydrodynamic simulations

<p> C. J. K. Larkin, J. Mackey, T. J. Haworth, A. A. C. Sander </p>
<p>
Recent JWST observations towards Westerlund 1 revealed extensive nebular emission associated with the cluster. Given the age of the region and proximity of that material to massive stars it cannot be primordial star forming gas and the origin is uncertain. We aim to determine whether the nebular emission in Westerlund 1 could be due to ablation flows from Red Supergiant (RSG) stars embedded in the cluster wind driven by the Wolf-Rayet stars in the cluster core. We also aim to explore the efficiency of mass-loading for the RSG wind in this scenario. We use 3D hydrodynamic simulations with the scpion code to study the interaction between the cluster and RSG winds. We compare with the JWST observations by generating synthetic dust-emission maps. We find that the ablation flow morphology is consistent with the observations towards Westerlund 1, with clumps and instabilities. Synthetic observations at 11 &mu;m predict fluxes in the ablation flow of ~1000-6000 MJy ster^-1 which is consistent with the unsaturated components of the JWST F1130W observations in the vicinity of the red supergiants in the region. This good agreement is achieved without any consideration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which have a known 11.3 &mu;m feature that appears in the F1130W band. This suggests that the ablation flow is PAH depleted. Ablation of RSG winds can explain the observed nebulosity in Westerlund 1, at least in the vicinity of the RSGs. Further observations are encouraged to enable detailed studies of these interactions.

### 165) [2503.01172](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01172v1): Detection Prospects of Electromagnetic Signatures from OGLE-2011-BLG-0462

<p> Shigeo S. Kimura, Lena Murchikova, Kailash C. Sahu </p>
<p>
Stellar-mass isolated black holes (IsoBHs) wandering in interstellar medium (ISM) are expected to be abundant in our Galaxy. Recently, an IsoBH, OGLE-2011-BLG-0462, was unambiguously discovered using astrometric microlensing. We examine prospects for detecting electromagnetic signatures from an accretion flow surrounding the IsoBH. The accretion rate onto the IsoBH should be highly sub-Eddington, which leads to formation of a hot accretion flow. In this paper, we evaluate the detectability of electromagnetic signals from the hot accretion flows in two accretion states: magnetically arrested disk (MAD) and classical radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs). For the MAD scenario, we find that the optical, infrared, and X-ray signals can be detectable by the current best facilities, such as HST, JWST, and Chandra, if the IsoBH is in a warm neutral medium. In contrast, for the classical RIAF scenario, the optical and X-ray emissions are weaker than MAD scenario, leading to unobservable signals for a typical parameter set. Future follow-up observations of OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 will provide a good test for theories of accretion processes.

### 166) [2503.00998](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00998v1): Tentative detection of neutral gas in a Little Red Dot at z=4.46

<p>
JWST has revealed a population of broad-line active galactic nuclei at z&gt;4 with remarkably red colors, so-called "Little Red Dots." Ubiquitous Balmer breaks suggest that they harbor old stellar populations in massive, compact host galaxies. We present ALMA observations of three LRDs at z=3.10, 4.46, and 7.04, targeting molecular and neutral gas via CO(7-6) and [CI](2-1), respectively. We do not detect CO in any target, placing conservative limits on the host molecular gas mass ≲ 1-5×10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. We report the tentative (4.9&sigma;) detection of the [CI](2-1) line in A2744-45924 (z=4.46), one of the brightest known LRDs. The [CI] line is narrow (FWHM ~ 80 km s<sup>-1</sup>), implying a dynamical mass ≲ 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, adopting conservative limits for the galaxy size. The dynamical mass limit is significantly lower than expected from the local M_BH-M_dyn relation, and is an order of magnitude below the stellar mass derived from SED fitting, potentially supporting a non-stellar origin of the Balmer break. These results, while tentative, paint a picture of LRDs that is markedly different than typical high-z quasars, which live in massive, gas-rich, and actively star-forming host galaxies.

<p>
A unique galaxy at z = 2.2, zC406690, has a striking clumpy large-scale ring structure that persists from rest UV to near-infrared, yet has an ordered rotation and lies on the star-formation main sequence. We combine new JWST/NIRCam and ALMA band 4 observations, together with previous VLT/SINFONI integral field spectroscopy and HST imaging to re-examine its nature. The high-resolution H&alpha; kinematics are best fitted if the mass is distributed within a ring with total mass M_ring = 2 × 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and radius R_ring = 4.6 kpc, together with a central undetected mass component (e.g., a "bulge") with a dynamical mass of M_bulge = 8 × 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. We also consider a purely flux emitting ring superposed over a faint exponential disk, or a highly "cuspy" dark matter halo, both disfavored against a massive ring model. The low-resolution CO(4-3) line and 142GHz continuum emission imply a total molecular and dust gas masses of M_mol,gas = 7.1 × 10^10M<sub>&odot;</sub> and M_dust = 3 × 10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> over the entire galaxy, giving a dust-to-mass ratio of 0.7%. We estimate that roughly half the gas and dust mass lie inside the ring, and that ~ 10&percnt; of the total dust is in a foreground screen that attenuates the stellar light of the bulge in the rest-UV to near-infrared. Sensitive high-resolution ALMA observations will be essential to confirm this scenario and study the gas and dust distribution.

### 168) [2503.00155](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00155v1): Late-time growth weakly affects the significance of high-redshift massive galaxies

<p> Qianran Xia, Dragan Huterer, Nhat-Minh Nguyen </p>
<p>
Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed massive galaxies at very high redshift (z≃ 7-15). The question of whether the existence of such galaxies is expected in the corresponding JWST surveys has received a lot of attention, though the answer straddles areas of cosmology and complex astrophysical details of high-redshift galaxy formation. The growth rate of density fluctuations determines the amplitude of overdensities that collapse to form galaxies. Late-time modifications of growth, combined with measurements at both z~ 1 from large-scale structure and z~ 1000 from the cosmic microwave background, affect the predictions for the abundance of first galaxies in the universe. In this paper, we point out that the late-time growth rate of structure affects the statistical significance of high-redshift, high-mass objects very weakly. Consequently, if the existence and abundance of these objects are confirmed to be unexpected, the variations in the late-time growth history are unlikely to explain these anomalies.

<p>
The integral-field unit mode of the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec+IFU) mounted on the James Webb Space Telescope has now enabled kinematic studies of smaller and less massive compact stellar systems in which to search for central massive black holes (BHs) than ever before. We present here the first such detection using NIRSpec+IFU in its highest resolution (R~2700) mode. We report a 3&sigma; detection of a central black hole with mass  M_BH=2.2±1.1×10^6 M<sub>&odot;</sub> in UCD736 orbiting within the Virgo galaxy cluster based on Schwarzschild's modeling of the 1D kinematic profile. The presence of such a massive BH strongly argues against a globular cluster origin of this UCD, and rather suggests a tidally stripped formation route from a former ≳10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> dwarf galaxy host. Two other methods produce results consistent with Schwarzschild's modelling, but can only provide upper-limits on  M_BH. This represents the detection of a BH in the most compact (r_h≈15 pc) stellar system to date, with a  M_BH corresponding to ~9 percent of the system's stellar mass, roughly in line with previously reported UCD BH detections and comparable to the BH detected in the compact elliptical galaxy NGC4486B.

We present the first follow-up with JWST of radio-selected NIRfaint galaxies as part of the COSMOS-Web survey. By selecting galaxies detected at radio frequencies (S_3 GHz&gt;11.5 &mu;Jy; i.e. S/N&gt;5) and with faint counterparts at NIR wavelengths (F150W&gt;26.1 mag), we collect a sample of 127 likely dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). We estimate their physical properties through SED fitting, compute the first radio luminosity function for these types of sources, and their contribution to the total cosmic star formation rate density. Our analysis confirms that these sources represent a population of highly dust-obscured (&langle; A_v &rangle; ~3.5 mag), massive (&langle; M<sub>&sext;</sub> &rangle; ~10^10.8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) and star-forming galaxies (&langle; SFR &rangle;~300 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1) located at &langle; z &rangle;~3.6, representing the high-redshift tail of the full distribution of radio sources. Our results also indicate that these galaxies could dominate the bright end of the radio luminosity function and reach a total contribution to the cosmic star formation rate density equal to that estimated only considering NIR-bright sources at z~4.5. Finally, our analysis further confirms that the radio selection can be employed to collect statistically significant samples of DSFGs, representing a complementary alternative to the other selections based on JWST colors or detection at FIR/(sub)mm wavelengths.

<p> D. M. Williams, T. Treu, S. Birrer, A. J. Shajib, K. C. Wong, T. Morishita, T. Schmidt, M. Stiavelli </p>
<p>
Gravitational time delays offer unique, independent measurements of the Hubble constant, H_0. Precise measurements of H_0 stand as one of the most pressing challenges in modern cosmology, and to do so with time delays requires precise lens models. While much work has focused on streamlining the modeling process to keep pace with the erumpent discovery of strongly-lensed systems, a critical step toward reducing uncertainty in H_0 comes from increasing the precision of individual lens models themselves. In this work, we demonstrate that the unprecedented imaging capabilities of JWST make this goal attainable. We present the first lens model for time-delay cosmography derived from JWST data, applied to the quadruply-imaged quasar WFI2033&ndash;4723. While the primary source of systematic uncertainty in time-delay cosmography is currently the mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD), the sensitivity of models to this MSD varies on how the point spread function (PSF) errors are mitigated. As the PSF is also the primary source of uncertainty in lens modeling, we focus on a comparison of different PSF modeling methods. Within the context of power-law models, we recover results in agreement with previous Hubble Space Telescope (HST)-based models, but with better precision of key lensing parameters through implementation of new PSF modeling techniques. Despite the record-holding precision of this system's HST modeling, we achieve an additional 22% increase in precision of the Fermat potential difference, directly reducing uncertainties of cosmological inference. These results would produce a 3% (1&sigma; of the modeling error) shift of H_0 towards a higher value for this lens, keeping all else constant. This work substantiates the groundbreaking potential of JWST for time-delay cosmography and lays the groundwork for modeling systems previously too faint to provide meaningful constraints on H_0.

### 172) [2503.00102](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00102v1): The Physical Properties and Morphologies of Faint Dusty Star-forming Galaxies Identified with JWST

<p> Stephen J. McKay, Amy J. Barger, Lennox L. Cowie, Michael J. Nicandro Rosenthal </p>
<p>
We develop a sample of 234 dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) from the A2744 and GOODS-S fields using JWST/NIRCam-selected galaxies as priors for SCUBA-2 measurements. This provides a large number of galaxies both above an 850 &mu;m flux of 2 mJy (47 bright DSFGs) and below (187 faint DSFGs). It represents the largest sample of individually identified (i.e., not stacked) faint DSFGs to date. We identify a tight negative correlation between redshift and both F444W and F150W flux, suggesting that the observed NIR flux may be an effective way of selecting high-redshift DSFGs. We study the physical properties of the DSFGs through spectral energy distribution fitting and morphological analysis. Other than the lower star formation rates (SFRs) and total infrared luminosities in the faint DSFGs, the two populations have similar properties. The stellar masses do not appear to be strongly dependent on either the SFRs or the submillimeter flux. These results suggest that the faint DSFGs are drawn from the same population of galaxies as the bright DSFGs. We find a lower merger fraction (~21%) relative to previous HST-based studies.

### 173) [2502.21281](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21281v2): JWST/MIRI Study of the Enigmatic Mid-Infrared Rings in the Planetary Nebula NGC 1514

<p> Michael E. Ressler, Alba Aller, David Jones, Ryan M. Lau, Luis F. Miranda, Karen Willacy </p>
<p>
While NGC 1514 is an elliptical, but complex, planetary nebula at optical wavelengths, it was discovered to have a pair of infrared-bright, axisymmetric rings contained within its faint outer shell during the course of the WISE all-sky survey. We have obtained JWST mid-infrared imaging and spectroscopy of the nebula through the use of simultaneous observations with the MIRI Imager and Medium Resolution Spectrometer, selecting the F770W, F1280W, and F2550W filters to match each of the MRS's three grating positions. These observations show that the rings are clearly resolved and relatively distinct structures, with both filamentary and clumpy detail throughout. There is also cloud-like material that has a turbulent appearance in the interior of the rings, particularly at the longest wavelengths, and faint ejecta-like structures just outside the ring boundaries. Despite their brightness, the emission from the rings within the three imager passbands is shown to be dominated by thermal emission from very small grains, not line emission from atomic hydrogen or forbidden atomic lines, shocked molecular hydrogen, or PAHs. The doppler velocities derived from the two brightest emission lines in the rings, however, suggest that the material from which the rings were formed was ejected during an early period of very heavy mass loss from the PN progenitor, then shaped by asymmetrical fast winds from the central binary pair.

We present JWST NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy observations of the z=5.89 quasar NDWFS J1425+3254 from 0.6-5.3 microns, covering the rest-frame ultraviolet and optical at spectral resolution R~100. The quasar has a black hole mass of M_BH=(1.4\substack+3.1\\-1.0)×10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> and an Eddington ratio L_Bol/L_Edd=0.3\substack+0.6\\-0.2, as implied from the broad Balmer H&alpha; and H&beta; lines. We find that the quasar host has significant ongoing obscured star formation, as well as a quasar-driven outflow with velocity 6050\substack+460\\-630 km/s, possibly one of the most extreme outflows in the early Universe. The data also reveals that two companion galaxies are merging with the quasar host. The north-eastern companion galaxy is relatively old and very massive, with luminosity-weighted stellar age 65\substack+9\\-4 Myr, stellar mass (3.6\substack+0.6\\-0.3)×10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, and SFR &lt; (16.1±1.9) M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr. A bridge of gas connects this companion galaxy and the host, confirming their ongoing interaction. A second merger is occurring between the quasar host and a much younger companion galaxy to the south, with stellar age 6.7±1.8 Myr, stellar mass (1.9±0.4)×10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, and SFR &lt; (93\substack+17\\-16) M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr. There is also another galaxy in the field that is likely in the foreground at z=1.135, that could be gravitationally lensing the quasar with magnification 1&lt;&mu;&lt;2, and so &lt;0.75 mag. Overall, the system is a "train-wreck" merger of three galaxies, with star formation and extreme quasar activity that were likely triggered by these ongoing interactions.

### 175) [2502.20472](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20472v1): Simple molecules and complex chemistry in a protoplanetary disk: A JWST investigation of the highly inclined disk d216-0939

<p>
While the number of detected molecules, particularly complex organic molecules, in the solid-state in astrophysical environments is still rather limited, laboratory experiments and astrochemical models predict many potential candidates. Detection of molecules in protoplanetary disks provides a bridge between the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium and the chemistry of planets and their atmospheres. The excellent spectral sensitivity, broad wavelength coverage and high spatial resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allows for making progress in exploring chemical compositions of various astrophysical environments including planet-forming disks. They are a prerequisite for probing the disk content by means of sensitive absorption studies. In this paper, we present initial results of the JWST Cycle 1 GO program 1741 on d216-0939, a highly inclined TTauri disk located in the outskirts of the Orion Nebula Cluster. We utilise the NIRSpec and MIRI integral field unit spectrographs to cover its spectrum from 1.7 to 28~&mu;m. In the d216-0939 disk, we give assignments of the composition of silicate grains. We unambiguously detect solid-state features of H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, ^13CO<sub>2</sub>, CO, OCN^-, and tentatively OCS; species that had been detected recently also in other circumstellar disks. For the first time in disks, we provide unique detections of ices carrying NH_4^+ and the complex organic molecule ammonium carbamate (NH_4^+NH<sub>2</sub>COO^-). The latter detections speak for a very efficient NH_3 chemistry in the disk. We also show the very important role of scattering in the analysis of observational spectra of highly inclined disks.

### 176) [2502.20447](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20447v1): Detecting galaxy-21-cm cross-correlation during reionization

<p> Samuel Gagnon-Hartman, James Davies, Andrei Mesinger </p>
<p>
The cosmic 21-cm signal promises to revolutionize studies of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Radio interferometers are aiming for a preliminary, low signal-to-noise (S/N) detection of the 21-cm power spectrum. Cross-correlating 21-cm with galaxies will be especially useful in these efforts, providing both a sanity check for initial 21-cm detection claims and potentially increasing the S/N due to uncorrelated residual systematics. Here we self-consistently simulate large-scale (1 Gpc) galaxy and 21-cm fields, computing their cross-power spectra for various choices of instruments as well as survey properties. We use 1080h observations with SKA-low AA* and HERA-350 as our benchmark 21-cm observations. We create mock Lyman alpha narrow-band, slitless and slit spectroscopic surveys, using benchmarks from instruments such as Subaru HyperSupremeCam, Roman grism, VLT MOONS, ELT MOSAIC, and JWST NIRCam. We forecast the resulting S/N of the galaxy-21-cm cross power spectrum, varying the galaxy survey area, depth and level of 21-cm foreground contamination for each pair of instruments. We find that the highest S/N is achievable through slitless, wide-area spectroscopic surveys, with the proposed Roman HLS survey resulting in a 55&sigma; detection of the cross power with 21-cm as observed with SKA-low AA* for our fiducial model. Narrow-band dropout surveys are unlikely to result in a detectable cross-power, due to their poor redshift localization. Slit spectroscopy can provide a high S/N detection of the cross power for SKA-low AA* observations. Specifically, the planned MOONRISE survey with MOONS on the VLT can result in a 3&sigma; detection, while a survey of comparable observing time using MOSAIC on the ELT can result in a 4&sigma; detection. Our results can be used to guide survey strategies, facilitating the detection of the galaxy-21-cm cross power spectrum.

<p>
Mergers play important roles in galaxy evolution at and beyond Cosmic Noon (z~3). They are found to be a trigger of active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity and a process for growing stellar mass and black hole mass. High-z radio galaxies (HzRGs=type-2 radio-loud AGN) are among the most massive galaxies known, and reside in dense environments on scales of tens of kiloparsecs to Megaparsecs. We present the first search for kpc-scale companions in a sample of four z~3.5 HzRGs, with many supporting datasets, using matched 0.2" resolution ALMA and JWST/NIRSpec integral field unit data. We discover a total of ~12 companion systems within ≲18 kpc across all four HzRG fields using two independent detection methods: peculiar [OIII]4959,5007 kinematics offset from the main (systemic) ionized gas component and [CII]158&mu; m emitters. We examine the velocity fields of these companions and find evidence of disk rotation along with more complex motions. We estimate the dynamical masses of these nearby systems to be M_dyn~10^9-11 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, which may indicate a minor merger scenario. Our results indicate that these companions may be the trigger of the powerful radio-loud AGN. We discuss the roles of the discovered companion systems in galaxy evolution for these powerful jetted AGN and indicate that they may impede jet launch and deflect the jet.

### 178) [2502.20437](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20437v2): Introducing the THESAN-ZOOM project: radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of high-redshift galaxies with a multi-phase interstellar medium

<p>
We introduce the THESAN-ZOOM project, a comprehensive suite of high-resolution zoom-in simulations of 14 high-redshift (z&gt;3) galaxies selected from the THESAN simulation volume. This sample encompasses a diverse range of halo masses, with M_halo ≈ 10^8 - 10^13~M<sub>&odot;</sub> at z=3. At the highest-resolution, the simulations achieve a baryonic mass of 142~M<sub>&odot;</sub> and a gravitational softening length of 17~cpc. We employ a state-of-the-art multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) model that self-consistently includes stellar feedback, radiation fields, dust physics, and low-temperature cooling through a non-equilibrium thermochemical network. Our unique framework incorporates the impact of patchy reionization by adopting the large-scale radiation field topology from the parent THESAN simulation box rather than assuming a spatially uniform UV background. In total, THESAN-ZOOM comprises 60 simulations, including both fiducial runs and complementary variations designed to investigate the impact of numerical and physical parameters on galaxy properties. The fiducial simulation set reproduces a wealth of high-redshift observational data such as the stellar-to-halo-mass relation, the star-forming main sequence, the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, and the mass-metallicity relation. While our simulations slightly overestimate the abundance of low-mass and low-luminosity galaxies they agree well with observed stellar and UV luminosity functions at the higher mass end. Moreover, the star-formation rate density closely matches the observational estimates from z=3-14. These results indicate that the simulations effectively reproduce many of the essential characteristics of high-redshift galaxies, providing a realistic framework to interpret the exciting new observations from JWST.

### 179) [2502.19484](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19484v1): A Tentative Detection of Molecular Hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) Emission Lines at Cosmic Dawn

<p>
Using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), we tentatively detect two molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) fluorescent emission features in high-redshift galaxies at 2.3 and 3.1&sigma;. These features consist of many blended emission lines that result from the de-excitation cascade of H<sub>2</sub> molecules that have absorbed Lyman-Werner band photons. Our study targets galaxies at redshifts z ≥ 7 galaxies of the early Universe, as they host some of the most extreme conditions in terms of star formation, molecular gas content, and the possible presence of outflows driven by starbursts and active galactic nuclei. To enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of H<sub>2</sub> emission features in the rest-frame wavelength range of 155-191 nm, we stack JWST/NIRSpec spectra from z=7.0-13.4. These stacked spectra also exhibit atomic emission features, such as CIV emission with a P-Cygni profile, as well as CIII], OIII], and HeII. The presence of these features and the slightly blue-shifted fluorescent H<sub>2</sub> lines suggest active multiphase atomic and molecular outflows may be common at these redshifts. Our results suggest that it is possible to search for FUV fluorescent H<sub>2</sub> lines in high redshift galaxies using JWST, which would enable the characterization of interstellar radiation fields, densities, and temperatures in extreme photodissociation environments.

<p>
Lyman &alpha; (Ly&alpha;) emission is one of few observable features of galaxies that can trace the neutral hydrogen content in the Universe during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). To accomplish this we need an efficient way to survey for Ly&alpha; emitters (LAEs) at redshifts beyond 7, requiring unbiased emission-line observations that are both sufficiently deep and wide to cover enough volume to detect them. Here we present results from PASSAGE &ndash; a pure-parallel JWST/NIRISS slitless spectroscopic survey to detect Ly&alpha; emitters deep into the EoR, without the bias of photometric preselection. We identify four LAEs at 7.5≤ z≤9.5 in four surveyed pointings, and estimate the luminosity function (LF). We find that the LF does show a marked decrease compared to post-reionization measurements, but the change is a factor of ≲ 10, which is less than expected from theoretical calculations and simulations, as well as observational expectations from the pre-JWST literature. Modeling of the IGM and expected \lya profiles implies these galaxies reside in ionized bubbles of ≳ 2 physical Mpc. We also report that in the four fields we detect 3,1,0,0 LAEs, which could indicate strong field-to-field variation in the LAE distribution, consistent with a patchy HI distribution at z~8. We compare the recovered LAE number counts with expectations from simulations and discuss the potential implications for reionization and its morphology.

### 181) [2502.18781](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18781v1): The distribution of galaxy rotation in JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey

<p> Lior Shamir </p>
<p>
JWST provides a view of the Universe never seen before, and specifically fine details of galaxies in deep space. JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) is a deep field survey, providing unprecedentedly detailed view of galaxies in the early Universe. The field is also in relatively close proximity to the Galactic pole. Analysis of spiral galaxies by their direction of rotation in JADES shows that the number of galaxies in that field that rotate in the opposite direction relative to the Milky Way galaxy is ~50% higher than the number of galaxies that rotate in the same direction relative to the Milky Way. The analysis is done using a computer-aided quantitative method, but the difference is so extreme that it can be noticed and inspected even by the unaided human eye. These observations are in excellent agreement with deep fields taken at around the same footprint by HST and JWST. The reason for the difference may be related to the structure of the early Universe, but it can also be related to the physics of galaxy rotation and the internal structure of galaxies. In that case the observation can provide possible explanations to other puzzling anomalies such as the Ho tension and the observation of massive mature galaxies at very high redshifts.

### 182) [2502.18571](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18571v1): Dark Matter Substructure or Source Model Systematics? A Case Study of Cluster Lens Abell S1063

<p> Nino Ephremidze, Chandrika Chandrashekar, Atınç Çağan Şengül, Cora Dvorkin </p>
<p>
Mapping the small-scale structure of the universe through gravitational lensing is a promising tool for probing the particle nature of dark matter. Curved Arc Basis (CAB) has been proposed as a local lensing formalism in galaxy clusters, with the potential to detect low-mass dark matter substructure. In this work, we analyze the cluster lens Abell S1063 in search of dark matter substructure with the CAB formalism, using multi-band imaging data from JWST. We use two different source modeling methods: shapelets and pixel-based source reconstruction based on Delaunay triangulation. We find that source modeling systematics from shapelets result in a disagreement between Curved Arc Basis parameters measured from different filters. Source modeling with Delaunay significantly alleviates this systematic, as seen in the improvement in agreement across filters. We also find that inadequate complexity in source modeling can result in convincing spurious detections of dark matter substructure from strong gravitational lenses, as seen by our &Delta; BIC &gt; 20 measurement of a M ~ 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub> subhalo with shapelets, a spurious detection that is not reproduced with Delaunay source modeling. We demonstrate that multi-band analysis with different JWST filters is key for disentangling source and lens model systematics from dark matter substructure detections.

### 183) [2502.18565](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18565v1): Formation of filaments and feathers in disc galaxies: Is self-gravity enough?

<p> Raghav Arora, Christoph Federrath, Mark Krumholz, Robi Banerjee </p>
<p>
Context. Dense filaments/feathers are kpc-scale dusty features present in nearby main sequence galaxies. Distinct from the spiral arms, filaments constitute a major portion of dense gas concentration. They are expected to play an important role in star formation and are known to harbour star-forming regions and H II regions. Aims. We explore the origin of filaments/feathers in disc galaxies via global gravitational instability. Methods. We conduct a parameter study using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of isolated disc galaxies that are isothermal, self-gravitating and initialised in equilibrium. Our galaxies are uniquely characterised by two dimensionless parameters, the Toomre Q and the rotational Mach number, M_c = v_c/c_s (ratio of circular velocity to sound speed). We carry out simulations covering a wide range in both. Results. We find that galaxies with Q = 1 form filaments within a single rotation, while galaxies with Q ≥ 2 do not. These filaments are kpc long and are semi-regularly spaced along the azimuth. Their morphology, density contrast and formation timescale vary with M_c, with filament spacing and instability onset time both inversely proportional to M_c and the density contrast increasing with M_c. However, their growth rates in all Q = 1 galaxies are ~ 0.5~&Omega;, where &Omega; is the angular frequency. We compare the filament spacing in our simulations with the ones from JWST/MIRI and HST observations of nearby galaxies and find them in agreement. Conclusions. Our study suggests that self-gravity and rotation are sufficient to form filaments, even in the absence of spiral arms or magnetic fields. Their morphologies are primarily determined by M_c, which parametrises the importance of thermal versus rotational support.

### 184) [2502.18464](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18464v1): Unveiling the Aromatic and Aliphatic Universe at Redshifts z~0.2&ndash;0.5 with JWST/NIRCam

<p> Jianwei Lyu, Xuejuan Yang, Aigen Li, Fengwu Sun, George H. Rieke, Stacey Alberts, Irene Shivaei </p>
<p>
Utilizing deep NIRCam/WFSS data from JWST's FRESCO program, we spectroscopically survey the 3.3 &mu; m aromatic and 3.4 &mu; m aliphatic C&ndash;H stretching emission bands of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules in galaxies at redshifts z~0.2&ndash;0.5. Unlike pre-JWST studies, largely limited to infrared (IR)-bright galaxies (L_IR≳10^11~L<sub>&odot;</sub>) at z≲0.1, we probe 200 galaxies down to L_IR~10^8.5&ndash;10^10~L<sub>&odot;</sub> well beyond the local Universe. The 3.3 &mu; m emission is detected at ≥3-&sigma; in 88 out of 187 galaxies, correlating tightly with galaxy IR luminosity and star formation rate (SFR) and confirming the 3.3 &mu; m PAH as a viable SFR tracer. Despite a large scatter, the 3.3 &mu; m-to-IR luminosity ratio (L_3.3/L_IR) exhibits a strong metallicity dependence with a drop of L_3.3/L_IR by a factor of ≳10 at 12+log(O/H)~8.4&ndash;8.5 towards lower metallicities. The 3.4 &mu; m emission is detected in 37 out of 159 galaxies, with the 3.4 &mu; m-to-3.3 &mu; m luminosity ratio (L_3.4/L_3.3) spanning from ~0.05 to ~0.58 (median ~0.19), corresponding to PAH aliphatic fractions of ~0.78%&ndash;8.3% (median ~2.9%) in terms of fractional carbon atoms in aliphatic units. While L_3.4/L_3.3 does not depend significantly on redshift, stellar mass, metallicity, or galaxy morphology, it does decrease with various SFR tracers, suggesting that ultraviolet photons in active star-forming regions may strip aliphatic sidegroups from PAH molecules. Our study showcases the unique power of JWST's NIRCam/WFSS to systematically map PAH aromatic and aliphatic content in statistically significant, less-biased galaxy samples, providing critical insights into PAH chemistry and its connection to galaxy properties.

<p> Ryan A. Cooper, Karina I. Caputi, Edoardo Iani, Pierluigi Rinaldi, Guillaume Desprez, Rafael Navarro-Carrera </p>
<p>
We identify galaxies hosting ionised-gas high-velocity outflows from the complete sample of medium resolution (R1000) JWST/NIRSpec MSA spectroscopy taken as part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). From a total sample of 1087 [OIII]5007 emitters we identify 40 galaxies with a blue-side broadened [OIII]5007 line at z=2.5-9. Of these, 34 are strong outflow candidates whilst 6 sources have broadening potentially driven by rotating clumps. Our outflow candidate sample is mainly composed of star-forming galaxies, including ~65% starbursts, which span the stellar mass range log10(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=7.5-11.0. It also includes two candidate type-2 active galactic nuclei (AGN) and a 'little red dot' (LRD). We report a median outflow velocity of 531(+146)(-159) km/s and an overall incidence rate of 3.4%. These values are significantly higher and lower respectively than recent similar works, which we accredit to the limiting resolution of the R1000 spectroscopy and a stricter outflow selection criterion. We find no correlation between the outflow velocity and the galaxy stellar mass or star-formation rate. The median ratio between outflow velocity and escape velocity is 0.77(+0.36)(-0.32), indicating that most outflows cannot escape the galaxy gravitational potentials. We do find an anti-correlation between mass loading factor and stellar mass up to M<sub>&sext;</sub> ~(10^10)M<sub>&odot;</sub>, with most lowest stellar-mass M<sub>&sext;</sub>&lt;(10^9)M<sub>&odot;</sub> galaxies reaching values well above unity, as is the case for local starburst galaxies.

<p>
We report the first detections of [Ne V] 14.3 &mu;m and [Ne VI] 7.7 &mu;m at high confidence (S/N≥6) in the nuclear region of the nearby spiral galaxy M83. Emission line maps of these high ionization lines show several compact structures. Specifically, the [Ne VI] emission is located at 140 pc from the optical nucleus and appears as a point source of size ≲18 pc (FWHM =&lt;0.8"). We investigate the possible source of this extreme emission through comparison with photoionization models and ancillary data. We find that photoionization models of fast radiative shocks are able to reproduce the observed high excitation emission line fluxes only for the lowest preshock density available in the library, n =0.01 cm^-3. Additionally, tailored active galactic nuclei (AGN) photoionization models assuming a two-zone structure are compatible with the observed high ionization fluxes. Our simple AGN model shows that the emission at the location of the [Ne VI] source can be the result of a cloud being ionized by the radiation cone of an AGN. We stress, however, that to definitively confirm an AGN as the main source of the observed emission, more complex modeling accounting for different geometries is required. Previously known as a purely starburst system, these new findings of the nuclear region of M83 will require a reassessment of its nature and of objects similar to it, particularly now that we have access to the unparalleled infrared sensitivity and spatial resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has opened a window on many new puzzles in the early Universe, including a population of high-redshift star clusters with extremely high stellar surface density, suggesting unique star formation conditions in the Universe's early evolution. We study the formation and evolution of these first star clusters and galaxies using an AREPO cosmological simulation box designed to resolve the intricate environments of the smallest halos hosting Population III star clusters at z ≥ 12. Our approach, which prioritizes baryonic structure identification through a friends-of-friends algorithm, provides new insights into early star cluster formation and delivers predictions directly relevant to observations. We investigate the dynamical properties of these first star clusters and use numerical and analytical methods to understand the populations of virialized and non-virialized systems. Our findings indicate that high-z star clusters in a feedback-free regime can achieve extreme surface densities, consistent with the systems detected by JWST. These results imply that JWST may have the opportunity to uncover stellar systems at high redshift whose dynamical state preserves evidence of the hierarchical structure formation process.

### 188) [2503.09607](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09607v1): The lens mass in the Einstein ring JWST-ER1

<p> Fulvio Melia </p>
<p>
JWST has made several surprising discoveries, underscored by the `too early' appearance of well-formed galaxies and supermassive black holes. It recently also uncovered a compact galaxy (JWST-ER1g) associated with a complete Einstein ring (JWST-ER1r) at photometric redshift z_l=1.94^+0.13_-0.17, produced by a lensed galaxy at z_s=2.98^+0.42_-0.47. In two independent studies, this system (M_lens~ 6.5× 10^11M<sub>&odot;</sub>) has yielded different conclusions concerning whether or not it requires an unexpected contribution of mass from sources other than stars and fiducial dark matter. The different redshift inferred by these two analysis for the lensed galaxy appears to be the culprit. In this paper, we examine the impact of the background cosmology on our interpretation of the JWST data. We compare the measured characteristics of JWST-ER1 in flat-&Lambda;CDM with those emerging in the context of R_h=ct. We show that, unlike the latter model's mitigation of the tension created by JWST's other discoveries, neither cosmology is favored by this particular Einstein ring. The disparity is common to both models, leaving open the question of whether a new type of mass, or a modified initial mass function, may be present in this source.

### 189) [2502.16301](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16301v1): On unveiling Buried Nuclei with JWST: a technique for hunting the most obscured galaxy nuclei from local to high redshift

<p>
We analyze JWST NIRSpec+MIRI/MRS observations of the infrared (IR) Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) features in the central regions (~0.26'' at 6 micron; ~50-440 pc depending on the source) of local luminous IR galaxies. In this work, we examine the effect of nuclear obscuration on the PAH features of deeply obscured nuclei, predominantly found in local luminous IR galaxies, and we compare these nuclei with "normal'' star-forming regions. We extend previous work to include shorter wavelength PAH ratios now available with the NIRSpec+MIRI/MRS spectral range. We introduce a new diagnostic diagram for selecting deeply obscured nuclei based on the 3.3 and 6.2 micron PAH features and/or mid-IR continuum ratios at ~3 and 5 micron. We find that the PAH equivalent width (EW) ratio of the brightest PAH features at shorter wavelengths (at 3.3 and 6.2 micron) is impacted by nuclear obscuration. Although the sample of luminous IR galaxies used in this analysis is relatively small, we find that sources exhibiting a high silicate absorption feature cluster tightly in a specific region of the diagram, whereas star-forming regions experiencing lower extinction levels occupy a different area in the diagram. This demonstrates the potential of this technique to identify buried nuclei. To leverage the excellent sensitivity of the MIRI imager onboard JWST, we extend our method of identifying deeply obscured nuclei at higher redshifts using a selection of MIRI filters. Specifically, the combination of various MIRI JWST filters enables the identification of buried sources beyond the local Universe and up to z~3, where other commonly used obscuration tracers such as the 9.7 micron silicate band, are out of the spectral range of MRS. Our results pave the way for identifying distant deeply obscured nuclei with JWST.

### 190) [2502.15935](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15935v1): The TRGB-SBF Project. III. Refining the HST Surface Brightness Fluctuation Distance Scale Calibration with JWST

<p> Joseph B. Jensen, John P. Blakeslee, Michele Cantiello, Mikaela Cowles, Gagandeep S. Anand, R. Brent Tully, Ehsan Kourkchi, Gabriella Raimondo </p>
<p>
The TRGB-SBF Project team is developing an independent distance ladder using a geometrical calibration of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) method in elliptical galaxies that can in turn be used to set the surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) distance scale independent of Cepheid variables and Type Ia supernovae. In this paper, we use JWST TRGB distances calibrated using the megamaser galaxy NGC 4258 to determine a new Cepheid-independent SBF zero point for HST. This new calibration, along with improved optical color measurements from PanSTARRS and DECam, gives an updated value of the Hubble-Lemaitre constant H_0 = 73.8 ± 0.7 ± 2.3 km/s/Mpc that is virtually identical to the previously published result based on SBF distances calibrated using Cepheids (Blakeslee et al. 2021, arxiv:2101.02221). Future improvements in the geometrical calibration of TRGB and additions to the HST SBF survey will further reduce the random and systematic uncertainties on H_0 measured using the extensive HST WFC3/IR SBF dataset. JWST observations of the Coma cluster will soon establish a foundation for the SBF calibration that will extend to much larger distances than is possible with HST.

### 191) [2502.15569](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15569v1): The Evolution of Size and Merger Fraction of Submillimeter Galaxies across 1 &lt; z ≲ 6 as Observed by JWST

<p>
Precise tracking of the growth in galaxy size and the evolution of merger fractions with redshift is vital for understanding the formation history of submillimeter galaxies (SMGs). This study investigates these evolutions over a broad redshift range (1 &lt; z ≲ 6), using a sample of 222 SMGs with a median redshift of z = 2.61^+0.89_-0.82 identified by ALMA and JCMT, enhanced by the advanced imaging capabilities of the JWST/NIRCam and MIRI. We find significant evolution in effective radii (R_e) in rest-frame V-band (R_e &prop; (1 + z)^-0.87 ± 0.08) and near-infrared (NIR) band (R_e &prop; (1 + z)^-0.88 ± 0.11), with the NIR size evolution resembling that of massive star-forming galaxies at lower redshift. Visual inspections reveal a major merger fraction of 24.3 ± 3.7&percnt; and an interaction fraction of up to 48.4 ± 11.1&percnt;. The major merger fraction exhibits an increase from 14.7±9.1&percnt; at z = 1 to 26.6± 8.4&percnt; at z = 3, after which it remains approximately constant across the redshift range 3 &lt; z &lt; 6. In contrast, the interaction fraction remains relatively stable across the range 2 &lt; z &lt; 5. Our results indicate that late-stage major mergers are not the primary formation mechanism for SMGs at z&lt;3, while interactions appear to play a significant role across the broader redshift range of 1&lt;z&lt;6. Additionally, HST-based major merger identifications may overestimate the true fraction by a factor of 1.7 at z ~ 2. These findings highlight the varying roles of mergers and interactions in driving the formation of massive, dusty star-forming galaxies across different redshifts.

We reconstruct the SFHs of 7 massive (M<sub>&sext;</sub>≳ 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) early-type galaxies (ETGs) in the Virgo cluster by analysing their spatially resolved stellar population (SP), including their UV and H&alpha; emission. As part of the VESTIGE survey, we used H&alpha; images to select ETGs that show no signs of ongoing star formation. We combined VESTIGE with images from Astrosat/UVIT, GALEX and CFHT from the NGVS to analyse radial spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the FUV to the NIR. The UV emission in these galaxies is likely due to old, low mass stars in post main sequence (PMS) phases, the UV upturn. We fit the radial SEDs with novel SP models that include an old, hot stellar component of PMS stars with various temperatures and energetics. This way, we explore the main stellar parameters responsible for UV upturn stars irregardless of their evolutionary path. Standard models are not able to reproduce the galaxies' central FUV emission (SMA/R_eff≲1), while the new models well characterise it through PMS stars with temperatures T≳25000 K. All galaxies are old (mass-weighted ages ≳10 Gyr) and the most massive M49 and M87 are supersolar within SMA/R_eff≲0.2. Overall, we found flat age gradients (&nabla;Log(Age)~ -0.04 - 0 dex) and shallow metallicity gradients (&nabla;Log(Z)&lt;-0.2 dex), except for M87 (&nabla;Log(Z_M87)≃-0.45 dex). Our results show that these ETGs formed with timescales &tau;≲1500 Myr, having assembled between ~40-90&percnt; of their stellar mass at z~5. This is consistent with recent JWST observations of quiescent massive galaxies at high-z, which are likely the ancestors of the largest ETGs in the nearby Universe. The derived flat/shallow gradients indicate that major mergers might have contributed to the formation and evolution of these galaxies.

<p>
Cold and cool gas (T ≤ 10^4 K) in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and its interaction with galaxies remain poorly understood. Simulations predict that cold gas flows into galaxies through cosmic filaments, determining the disk formation and galaxy evolution. The cold gas accretion modes in the CGM and their dependence on dark matter halo mass and redshift remain puzzling. Resolving the kiloparsec-scale kinematics and dynamics of cold gas interacting with the disk, dust, and metals in different environments is particularly lacking at z &gt; 2. Here we report two disturbed cold gas structures traced by ultra-strong MgII absorbers (rest-frame equivalent width Wr &gt; 2 &#8491;) exhibiting high kinematic velocities (&gt; 500 km/s) and their environments at z ~ 4.9 and z ~ 2.6. Observations were conducted with VLT/MUSE, JWST/NIRCam, and ALMA to detect Lya and nebular emission lines, as well as dust continuum emission in the vicinity of these two absorbing gas structures. We identify two Lya emitters associated with a strong MgII absorber pair separated by ~1000 km/s at z~ 4.87. The pair exhibits relative differences in metallicity, dust content, and ionization states, suggesting internal metal and dust exchange within the ultra-large cold gas structure. For the strong MgII absorber at z = 2.5652, we detect a dusty star-forming galaxy at a projected distance of D = 38 kpc. This galaxy exhibits prominent HeI, [SIII], and Paschen&gamma; lines, along with significant dust continuum. It has a star formation rate of ~ 121 +/- 33 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr and likely harbors a rotating disk. These findings tentatively suggest that cold gas at high redshifts plays a critical role in driving disk formation and actively participates in the transfer of metals and dust within the overdense regions of the CGM.

### 194) [2502.14031](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14031v1): Modeling Galaxies in the Early Universe with Supernova Dust Attenuation

<p> Jed McKinney, Olivia Cooper, Caitlin M. Casey, Julian B. Munoz, Hollis Akins, Erini Lambrides, Arianna S. Long </p>
<p>
Supernova may be the dominant channel by which dust grains accumulate in galaxies during the first Gyr of cosmic time as formation channels important for lower redshift galaxies, e.g., AGB stars and grain growth, may not have had sufficient time to take over. Supernovae (SNe) produce fewer small grains, leading to a flatter attenuation law. In this work, we fit observations of 138 spectroscopically confirmed z&gt;6 galaxies adopting standard spectral energy distribution modeling assumptions and compare standard attenuation law prescriptions to that of supernova-produced dust alone. Compared to SMC dust, SNe attenuation yields up to 0.5 mag higher A_V, and 0.4 dex larger stellar masses. SNe dust attenuation also finds better fits to the rest-frame UV photometry with lower &chi;<sup>2</sup>_UV. This allows the observed UV luminosities taken from the models to be fainter by 0.2 dex on average. The systematically fainter rest-frame UV luminosities for fixed observed photometry could help resolve current tension between the ionizing photon production implied by JWST observations and the redshift evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction. Given these systematic effects and the physical constraint of cosmic time itself, pure supernova dust attenuation laws should be a standard consideration in fitting to the spectral energy distributions of z&gt;6 galaxies.

<p>
We measure radial stellar age gradients in the relatively isolated gas-rich dwarf irregular WLM, combining JWST NIRCam and NIRISS imaging with six archival Hubble fields over semi-major axis equivalent distances of 0≲R_SMA≲4 kpc (≲3R_hl). Fitting lifetime star formation histories (SFHs) to resolved color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), radial age gradients are quantified using &tau;_90 and &tau;_50, the lookback times to form 90&percnt; and 50&percnt; of the cumulative stellar mass. We find that globally, the outskirts of WLM are older on average, with (&delta;&tau;_90, &delta;&tau;_50)/&delta;R_SMA=(0.82^+0.10_-0.10, 1.60^+0.23_-0.22) Gyr/kpc (stat.), in good agreement with simulations. However, we also detect an azimuthal dependence of radial stellar age gradients, finding that stars on the leading edge of WLM (relative to its proper motion) are both younger and have a flatter age gradient compared to the trailing edge. This difference persists over 0.6≲R_SMA≲3.2 kpc (~0.5-2.5R_hl) and lookback times up to ~8 Gyr, and is robust to assumed stellar evolutionary model. Our results are consistent with star formation triggered by ram pressure stripping from a circumgalactic and/or intergalactic medium, suggested by recent HI observations. If confirmed, processes typifying dense environments, such as ram pressure stripping, may be more relevant to the evolution of isolated galaxies than previously thought.

### 196) [2502.12538](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12538v1): Bridging Theory and Observations: Insights into Star Formation Efficiency and Dust Attenuation in z &gt; 5 Galaxies

<p> Daisuke Toyouchi, Hidenobu Yajima, Andrea Ferrara, Kentaro Nagamine </p>
<p>
We investigate early galaxy evolution by modeling self-consistently their radially-resolved evolution of gas, stars, heavy elements, and dust content. Our model successfully reproduces various observed properties of JWST-identified galaxies at z &gt; 5, including sizes, stellar masses, star formation rates (SFR), metallicities, and dust-to-stellar mass ratios. We show that the star formation efficiency (SFE), f<sub>&ast;</sub> &equiv; SFR/(f_b M&#775;_h), is regulated by the global equilibrium between cosmological gas inflows, star formation, and gas outflows. Our model predicts f<sub>&ast;</sub> ≲ 20~&percnt; for galaxies with halo masses of M_h ~ 10^11-12  M<sub>&odot;</sub> down to z = 5, allowing them to reach intrinsic UV magnitudes of M_UV ≲ -22~mag; when dust attenuation is ignored, the predicted UV luminosity function (LF) at z ~ 12 agrees well with observations. However, our model also suggests that these galaxies would be heavily obscured by dust, with high optical depths at 1500~&#8491;~of &tau;_1500 ≳ 10, causing the dust-attenuated UV LF to fall significantly below the observed one. This discrepancy highlights the need for mechanisms that mitigate strong dust attenuation, such as dust evacuation from star-forming regions and/or preferential production of large dust grains. Further exploration of these processes is essential for understanding the early stages of galaxy evolution.

We present the magnetic field in the dense material of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way, traced in 850 &mu;m polarized dust emission as part of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) B-fields In STar-forming Region Observations (BISTRO) Survey. We observe a highly ordered magnetic field across the CMZ between Sgr B2 and Sgr C, which is strongly preferentially aligned with the orbital gas flows within the clouds of the CMZ. We find that the observed relative orientations are non-random at a &gt;99% confidence level and are consistent with models in which the magnetic field vectors are aligned within 30^o to the gas flows in 3D. The deviations from aligned magnetic fields are most prominent at positive Galactic longitudes, where the CMZ clouds are more massive, denser, and more actively forming stars. Our observed strongly preferentially parallel magnetic field morphology leads us to hypothesize that in the absence of star formation, the magnetic field in the CMZ is entrained in the orbital gas flows around Sgr A^*, while gravitational collapse and feedback in star-forming regions can locally reorder the field. This magnetic field behavior is similar to that observed in the CMZ of the nuclear starburst galaxy NGC 253. This suggests that despite its current low star formation rate, the CMZ of the Milky Way is analogous to those of more distant, actively star-forming, galaxies.

The Athena mission entered a redefinition phase in July 2022, driven by the imperative to reduce the mission cost at completion for the European Space Agency below an acceptable target, while maintaining the flagship nature of its science return. This notably called for a complete redesign of the X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) cryogenic architecture towards a simpler active cooling chain. Passive cooling via successive radiative panels at spacecraft level is now used to provide a 50 K thermal environment to an X-IFU owned cryostat. 4.5 K cooling is achieved via a single remote active cryocooler unit, while a multi-stage Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator ensures heat lift down to the 50 mK required by the detectors. Amidst these changes, the core concept of the readout chain remains robust, employing Transition Edge Sensor microcalorimeters and a SQUID-based Time-Division Multiplexing scheme. Noteworthy is the introduction of a slower pixel. This enables an increase in the multiplexing factor (from 34 to 48) without compromising the instrument energy resolution, hence keeping significant system margins to the new 4 eV resolution requirement. This allows reducing the number of channels by more than a factor two, and thus the resource demands on the system, while keeping a 4' field of view (compared to 5' before). In this article, we will give an overview of this new architecture, before detailing its anticipated performances. Finally, we will present the new X-IFU schedule, with its short term focus on demonstration activities towards a mission adoption in early 2027.

We present an analysis of the rest-frame optical spectra of 22 [OIII]&lambda;4363 detected galaxies in the redshift range 1.65 &lt; z &lt; 7.92 (with &langle; z &rangle; = 4.05) from JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution observations taken as part of the EXCELS survey. To supplement these high-redshift sources, we also consider a sample of 782 local [OIII]&lambda;4363 detected galaxies from the DESI Early Data Release. Our analysis demonstrates that many strong-line calibrations are biased in the early Universe due to the systematic evolution in ionization conditions with redshift. However, the recently introduced \widehatR calibration mostly removes the dependence on ionization state and can be considered a largely redshift-independent calibration. In a similar spirit, we introduce a new strong-line diagnostic, \widehatRNe, which can be used to robustly estimate metallicities when the [OIII]&lambda;5007 is redshifted out of the wavelength range of JWST/NIRSpec at z &gt; 9.5. We also show that strong-line diagnostics using the [NII]&lambda;6584 emission line are likely to be biased at high-redshift due to a moderate enhancement in the average N/O abundance ratios (at fixed O/H) in these sources. Finally, we discuss the location of our new [OIII]&lambda;4363 detected galaxies at z ≃ 4 on the mass-metallicity plane and investigate the redshift evolution of the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR). We find tentative evidence for an increasing deviation from the FMR at z &gt; 4 which might indicate fundamental differences in the baryon cycle at these redshifts. However, more data are required as our high-redshift constraints are still based on a relatively small sample of galaxies and the significance of the deviation is strongly dependent on the assumed form of the fundamental metallicity relation.

### 200) [2502.10282](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10282v1): The impact of medium-width bands on the selection, and subsequent luminosity function measurements, of high-z galaxies

New, ultra-deep medium-width photometric coverage with JWST's NIRCam instrument provides the potential for much improved photo-z reliability at high redshifts. In this study, we conduct a systematic analysis of the JADES Origins Field, which contains 14 broad- and medium-width near-infrared bands, to assess the benefits of medium band photometry on high-z sample completeness and contamination rates. Using imaging with depths of AB mag 29.8-30.35, we conduct an experiment to observe how high-z selections differ when images are artificially degraded or bands are removed. In parallel, the same experiments are conducted on simulated catalogues from the JAGUAR semi-analytic model to examine if the behaviour from observations can be replicated. We find sample completeness is high (80&percnt;+) and contamination low (&lt;4&percnt;) when in the 10&sigma;+ regime, even without the use of any medium-width bands. The addition of medium-width bands leads to notable increases in completeness (~10&percnt;) but multiple bands are required to improve contamination rates due to the small redshift ranges over which they probe strong emission lines. Incidents of Balmer-Lyman degeneracy increase in the 5-7&sigma; regime and this can be replicated in both simulated catalogues and degraded real data. We measure the faint-end of the UV LF at 8.5&lt;z&lt;13.5, finding high number densities that agree with previous JWST observations. Overall, medium bands are effective at increasing completeness and reducing contamination, but investment in achieving at least comparable depths in the blue (&lt;1.5&mu;m) as achieved in the red is also found to be key to fully reducing contamination from high-z samples.

### 201) [2502.10271](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10271v1): MICONIC: JWST Unveils Shocked Hot Core Chemistry in the Western Nucleus of Arp 220

<p>
We present full 3-28 micron JWST MIRI/MRS and NIRSpec/IFU spectra of the western nucleus of Arp 220, the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxy. This nucleus has long been suggested to possibly host an embedded Compton-thick AGN. Millimeter observations of the dust continuum suggest the presence of a distinct 20 pc core with a dust temperature of T_d ≳ 500~K, in addition to a 100 pc circumnuclear starburst disk. However, unambiguously identifying the nature of this core is challenging, due to the immense obscuration, the nuclear starburst activity, and the nearby eastern nucleus. With the JWST integral field spectrographs, we can, for the first time, separate the two nuclei across this full wavelength range, revealing a wealth of molecular absorption features towards the western nucleus. We analyse the rovibrational bands detected at 4-22 micron, deriving column densities and rotational temperatures for 10 distinct species. Optically thick features of C_2H<sub>2</sub>, HCN and HNC suggest that this molecular gas is hidden behind a curtain of cooler dust, and indicate that the column densities of C_2H<sub>2</sub> and HCN are an order of magnitude higher than previously derived from Spitzer observations. We identify a warm HCN component with rotational temperature T_rot = 330~K, which we associate with radiative excitation by the hot inner nucleus. We propose a geometry where the detected molecular gas is located in the inner regions of the starburst disk, directly surrounding the hot 20 parsec core. The chemical footprint of the western nucleus is reminiscent of that of hot cores, with additional evidence for shocks. No evidence for the presence of an AGN in the form of X-ray-driven chemistry or extreme excitation is found.

<p>
(Abridged) JWST observations have measured the ice composition toward two highly-extinguished field stars in the Chamaeleon I cloud. The observed extinction excess on the long-wavelength side of the H2O ice band at 3 micron has been attributed to a mixture of CH3OH with ammonia hydrates, which suggests that CH3OH ice could have formed in a water-rich environment with little CO depletion. Laboratory experiments and quantum chemical calculations suggest that CH3OH could form via the grain surface reactions CH3+OH and/or C+H2O in water-rich ices. However, no dedicated chemical modelling has been carried out thus far to test their efficiency and dependence on the astrochemical code employed. We model the ice chemistry in the Chamaeleon I cloud using a set of astrochemical codes (MAGICKAL, MONACO, Nautilus, UCLCHEM, and KMC simulations) to test the effects of the different code architectures and of the assumed ice chemistry. Our models show that the JWST ice observations are better reproduced for gas densities &gt;1e5 cm-3 and collapse times &gt;1e5 yr. CH3OH ice forms predominantly (&gt;99%) via CO hydrogenation. The contribution of reactions CH3+OH and C+H2O, is negligible. The CO2 ice may form either via CO+OH or CO+O depending on the code. However, KMC simulations reveal that both mechanisms are efficient despite the low rate constant of the CO+O surface reaction. CH4 is largely underproduced for all codes except for UCLCHEM, for which a higher amount of atomic C is available during the initial translucent cloud phase. Large differences in the ice abundances are found at Tdust&lt;12 K between diffusive and non-diffusive chemistry codes. This is due to the fact that non-diffusive chemistry takes over diffusive chemistry at such low Tdust. This could explain the rather constant ice chemical composition found in Chamaeleon I and other dense cores despite the different visual extinctions probed.

<p>
We leverage JWST data from the COSMOS-Web Survey in order to provide updated measurements on the auto-power spectrum of the now resolved Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) and its coherence with the unresolved soft Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB) observed by Chandra at z &gt; 6. Maps of the CIB in the F277W and F444W NIRCam filters are constructed with sources fainter than AB mag = 25 and cross-correlated with the CXB in the [0.5-2] keV band. We find that on scales between 1 and 1000'' the CIB-CXB cross-power in both NIRCam filters is statistically significant with signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) of 4.80 and 6.20 respectively from redshifts 0 &lt; z &lt; 13. In our high-z (6 &lt; z &lt; 13) interval we find coherence in both filters with a S/N of 7.32 and 5.39 respectively. These results suggest that there are X-ray emitting galaxies resolved by JWST, including star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We fit the large-scale biasing of the IR sources producing the CIB as a function of z with results consistent with prior measurements and place constraints on the CXB flux and biasing at low- and high-z. The CXB flux measurements presented in this study suggest that approximately 94% of the [0.5-2] keV CXB is resolved, and this value is consistent within 2&sigma; with the complete resolution of the [0.5-2] keV CXB.

### 204) [2502.09384](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09384v1): Predicting the detectability of sulphur-bearing molecules in the solid phase with simulated spectra of JWST instruments

<p>
To date, gas phase observations of sulphur in dense interstellar environments have only constrained the molecular carriers of 1% of its predicted cosmic abundance. An additional 5% is known to be locked up in molecular solids in dense clouds, leaving the main reservoir of depleted sulphur in the solid phase unknown. The spectral resolution and sensitivity of the JWST could make a substantial difference in detecting part of this missing sulphur, with its wavelength coverage that includes vibrational absorption features of the S-carriers H2S, OCS, SO2, CS2, SO, CS, and S8. The aim of this study is to determine whether these molecules may be viable candidates for detection. We carried out new laboratory measurements of the IR absorption spectra of CS2 and S8 to update the IR band strength of the most intense CS2 absorption feature at 6.8 &mu;m, as well as to determine that of S8 at 20.3 &mu;m for the first time. These data, along with values previously reported in the literature, allow us to evaluate which S-bearing species could be potentially detected with JWST in interstellar ices. Taking the literature abundances of the major ice species determined by previous IR observations towards starless cores, LYSOs and MYSOs, we generated simulated IR spectra using the characteristics of the instruments on the JWST. Thus, we have been able to establish a case study for three stages of the star formation process. We conclude that the detection of S-bearing molecules remains challenging. Despite these obstacles, the detection of H2S and potentially SO2 should be possible in regions with favourable physical and chemical conditions. In contrast, S8 would remain undetected. Although the sensitivity of JWST is insufficient to determine the sulphur budget in the solid state, the detection of an additional icy sulphur compound (H2S, SO2) would enable us to elevate our knowledge of sulphur chemistry.

### 205) [2502.08885](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08885v1): Morphological Demographics of Galaxies at z~ 10-16: Log-Normal Size Distribution and Exponential Profiles Consistent with the Disk Formation Scenario

<p>
We homogeneously investigate the morphological properties of 169 galaxies at z~10-16 with deep JWST NIRCam images employing our established techniques of GALFIT modeling and uncertainty evaluation (systematics+statistics). We obtain effective radii r_e ranging 20-500 pc, with a distribution significantly broader than the scatter made by the uncertainties. We find that the r_e distribution is well described by a log-normal distribution with a mean of r_e=133^+13_-12 pc and a standard deviation of &sigma;_lnr_e = 0.52 ± 0.08. The standard deviation is comparable to that of local galaxies, indicating no significant evolution over z~ 0-10. We estimate the virial radius r_vir from the stellar masses via the star-formation main sequence and stellar-to-halo mass relation, obtaining a stellar-to-halo size ratio r_e/r_vir = 0.015^+0.015_-0.005, which is comparable to those of star-forming galaxies in the local and low-z Universe. Our results of 1) the log-normal r_e distribution, 2) the standard deviation value, and 3) a mean radial profile consistent with an exponential profile (n=1.3±0.6) suggest that galaxies at z~10-16 generally follow the classical galaxy disk formation scenario with a specific disk angular momentum fraction of j_d / m_d ~ 0.5-1. Interestingly, we identify two remarkable outliers GN-z11 (z<sub>spec</sub>=10.60) and GHZ2 (z<sub>spec</sub>=12.34) with r_e=55^+5_-6 pc and 39±11 pc, respectively, that may not be explained by disk structures but by AGN or compact star-forming galaxies merging underway in short periods of time, as reproduced in numerical simulations.

### 206) [2502.08701](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08701v1): Early Galaxies from Rare Inflationary Processes and JWST Observations

<p> Soubhik Kumar, Neal Weiner </p>
<p>
Rare Poisson processes (PP) during cosmic inflation can lead to signatures that are localized in position space and are not well captured by the standard two- or higher-point correlation functions of primordial density perturbations. As an example, PP can lead to localized overdense regions that are far denser than the ones produced through standard inflationary fluctuations. As a result, such overdense regions collapse earlier than expected based on the standard &Lambda;CDM model and would host anomalously high-redshift galaxies. We describe some general aspects of such PP and consider a particular realization in the context of inflationary particle production. We then show that the masses and redshifts of the resulting galaxies can lie in a range discoverable by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and future surveys, while being consistent with existing constraints on the matter power spectrum and UV luminosity functions at lower redshifts.

<p>
In the centers of many galaxy clusters, the hot (~10^7 K) intracluster medium (ICM) can become dense enough that it should cool on short timescales. However, the low measured star formation rates in massive central galaxies and absence of soft X-ray lines from cooling gas suggest that most of this gas never cools - this is known as the "cooling flow problem." The latest observations suggest that black hole jets are maintaining the vast majority of gas at high temperatures. A cooling flow has yet to be fully mapped through all gas phases in any galaxy cluster. Here, we present new observations of the Phoenix cluster using the James Webb Space Telescope to map the [Ne VI] &lambda;7.652&mu;m emission line, allowing us to probe gas at 10^5.5 K on large scales. These data show extended [Ne VI] emission cospatial with (i) the cooling peak in the ICM, (ii) the coolest gas phases, and (iii) sites of active star formation. Taken together, these imply a recent episode of rapid cooling, causing a short-lived spike in the cooling rate which we estimate to be 5,000-23,000 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1. These data provide the first large-scale map of gas at temperatures between 10^5-10^6 K in a cluster core, and highlight the critical role that black hole feedback plays in not only regulating but also promoting cooling.

The methylidyne cation (CH^+) and the methyl cation (CH_3^+) are building blocks of organic molecules, yet their coupled formation and excitation mechanisms remain mainly unprobed. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its high spatial resolution and good spectral resolution, provides unique access to the detection of these molecules. Our goal is to use the first detection of CH^+ and CH_3^+ rovibrational emission in the Orion Bar and in the protoplanetary disk d203-506, irradiated by the Trapezium cluster, to probe their formation and excitation mechanisms and constrain the physico-chemical conditions. We use spectro-imaging acquired using both the NIRSpec and MIRI-MRS instruments to study the CH^+ and CH_3^+ spatial distribution at very small scales, and compare it to excited H<sub>2</sub> emission. CH^+ and CH_3^+ emissions originate from the same region as highly excited H<sub>2</sub>. Our comparison between the Bar and d203-506 reveals that both CH^+ and CH_3^+ excitation and/or formation are highly dependent on gas density. The excitation temperature of the observed CH^+ and CH_3^+ rovibrational lines is around T ~ 1500 K in the Bar and T ~ 800 K in d203-506. Moreover, the column densities derived from the rovibrational emission are less than 0.1 % of the total known (CH^+) and expected (CH_3^+) column densities. These results show that CH^+ and CH_3^+ level populations strongly deviate from ETL. CH^+ rovibrational emission can be explained by chemical formation pumping with excited H<sub>2</sub> via C^+ + H<sub>2</sub>^* = CH^+ + H. These results support a gas phase formation pathway of CH^+ and CH_3^+ via successive hydrogen abstraction reactions. However, we do not find any evidence of CH<sub>2</sub>^+ emission in the JWST spectrum. Finally, observed CH^+ intensities coupled with chemical formation pumping model provide a diagnostic tool to trace the local density.

### 209) [2502.08113](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08113v1): Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon and the Ultraviolet Extinction Bump at the Cosmic Dawn

<p> Qi Lin, Xuejuan Yang, Aigen Li, Joris Witstok </p>
<p>
First detected in 1965, the mysterious ultraviolet (UV) extinction bump at 2175 Angstrom is the most prominent spectroscopic feature superimposed on the interstellar extinction curve. Its carrier remains unidentified over the past six decades ever since its first detection, although many candidate materials have been proposed. Widely seen in the interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way as well as several nearby galaxies, this bump was recently also detected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at the cosmic dawn in JADES-GS-z6-0, a distant galaxy at redshift z~6.71, corresponding to a cosmic age of just 800 million years after the Big Bang. Differing from that of the known Galactic and extragalactic interstellar sightlines which always peak at ~2175 Angstrom, the bump seen at z~6.71 in JADES-GS-z6-0 peaks at an appreciably longer wavelength of ~2263 Angstrom and is the narrowest among all known Galactic and extragalactic extinction bumps. Here we show that the combined electronic absorption spectra quantum-chemically computed for a number of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules closely reproduce the bump detected by JWST in JADES-GS-z6-0. This suggests that PAH molecules have already been pervasive in the Universe at an epoch when asymptotic giant branch stars have not yet evolved to make dust.

### 210) [2502.08112](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08112v1): What causes the ultraviolet extinction bump at the cosmic dawn?

<p> Qi Li, Xuejuan Yang, Aigen Li </p>
<p>
The enigmatic ultraviolet (UV) extinction bump at 2175 Angstrom, the strongest spectroscopic absorption feature superimposed on the interstellar extinction curve, has recently been detected at the cosmic dawn by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in JADES-GS-z6-0, a distant galaxy at redshift z=6.71, corresponding to a cosmic age of just 800 million years after the Big Bang. Although small graphite grains have historically long been suggested as the carrier of the 2175 Angstrom extinction bump and graphite grains are expected to have already been pervasive in the early Universe, in this work we demonstrate that small graphite grains are not responsible for the UV extinction bump seen at the cosmic dawn in JADES-GS-z6-0, as the extinction bump arising from small graphite grains is too broad and peaks at wavelengths that are too short to be consistent with what is seen in JADES-GS-z6-0.

### 211) [2502.07882](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07882v2): A Sizable Discrepancy in Ground-Based JAGB Distances to Nearby Galaxies

<p> Gagandeep S. Anand </p>
<p>
Recently, Freedman et al. (2024) report agreement of distances derived from the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) and the J-Region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) at the 1&percnt; level for both nearby galaxies with ground-based imaging (0.5-4 Mpc) as well distant galaxies with JWST imaging (7-23 Mpc). Here we compare the same ground-based JAGB distances to uniformly reduced space-based optical TRGB distances from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We uncover a significant offset between these two distance scales of &Delta;&mu; = 0.17 ± 0.04 (stat) ± 0.06 (sys) mag (9&percnt; in distance), with the HST TRGB distances being further. Inspections of the HST color-magnitude diagrams make a compelling case that the issue lies in the underlying JAGB distances. The source of the disagreement may lie with the lower resolution or photometric calibration of the ground-based near-infrared data, a contrast to the general agreement found between JWST JAGB and other space-based, second-rung distance indicators (Cepheids, Miras, TRGB) presented within Riess et al. (2024). High-resolution, near-infrared observations from an ongoing HST program will enable the simultaneous measurement of Cepheid, JAGB, and TRGB distances in four of these nearby galaxies and allow us to investigate whether the discrepancy noted here is due to ground-based observational systematics, or something intrinsic to the JAGB method relevant for this particular sample. A resolution of this discrepancy is required if the JAGB is to be used to determine a highly precise local value of the Hubble constant.

### 212) [2502.07875](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07875v2): Investigating photometric and spectroscopic variability in the multiply-imaged Little Red Dot A2744-QSO1

<p>
JWST observations have uncovered a new population of red, compact objects at high redshifts dubbed 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs), which typically show broad emission lines and are thought to be dusty Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Some of their other features, however, challenge the AGN explanation, such as prominent Balmer breaks and extremely faint or even missing metal high-ionization lines, X-ray, or radio emission, including in deep stacks. Time variability is a unique test of AGN activity. Here, we exploit the z=7.045 multiply-imaged LRD A2744-QSO1, which offers a unique test of variability due to lensing-induced time delays between the three images spanning 22 yr (2.7 yr in the rest-frame), to investigate its photometric and spectroscopic variability. We find the equivalent widths (EWs) of the broad H&alpha; and H&beta; lines, which are independent of magnification and other systematics, to exhibit significant variations, up to 18±3 % for H&alpha; and up to 22±8 % in H&beta;, on a timescale of 875 d (2.4 yr) in the rest-frame. This suggests that A2744-QSO1 is indeed an AGN. We find no significant photometric variability beyond the limiting systematic uncertainties, so it currently cannot be determined whether the EW variations are due to line-flux or continuum variability. These results are consistent with a typical damped random walk (DRW) variability model for an AGN like A2744-QSO1 (M_BH=4×10^7 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) given the sparse sampling of the light-curve with the available data. Our results therefore support the AGN interpretation of this LRD, and highlight the need for further photometric and spectroscopic monitoring in order to build a detailed and reliable light-curve.

<p>
Nearby blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCDs) share similar properties with objects from the Epoch of Reionization revealed by JWST, in terms of low stellar mass, low metallicity and high specific star-formation rate. Thus, they represent ideal local laboratories for detailed multi-wavelength studies to understand their properties and the mechanisms shaping them. We report the first JWST MIRI/MRS observations of the BCD SBS 0335-052 E, analyzing MIR emission lines tracing different levels of ionization (e.g., [NeII], [SIV], [NeIII], [OIV], [NeV]) of the ionized gas. SBS 0335-052 E MIR emission is characterized by a bright point source, located in one of the youngest and most embedded stellar clusters (t~3 Myr, A_V~20), and underlying extended high-ionization emission (i.e., [OIV], [NeV]) from the surroundings of the older and less dusty stellar clusters (t&lt; 20 Myr, A_V~8). From the comparison with state-of-the-art models, we can exclude shocks, X-ray binaries, and old stellar populations as the main sources of the high ionization. Interestingly, a 4-16% contribution of a ~10^5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> intermediate massive black hole (IMBH) is needed to justify the strong [NeV]/[NeII] and would be consistent with optical/UV line ratios from previous studies. However, even IMBH models cannot explain the strongest [OIV]/[NeIII]. Also, star-forming models (regardless of including X-ray binaries) struggle to reproduce even the lower ionization line ratios (e.g., [SIV]/[NeII]) typically observed in BCDs. Overall, while current models suggest the need to account for an accreting IMBH in this high-z analog, limitations still exist in predicting high-ionization emission lines (I.P. &gt;54 eV) when modeling these low-metallicity environments, thus other sources of ionization cannot be fully ruled out.

### 214) [2502.06942](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06942v2): Shedding light on the star formation rate-halo accretion rate connection and halo quenching mechanism via DECODE, the Discrete statistical sEmi-empiriCal mODEl

Aims: The relative roles of the physical mechanisms involved in quenching galaxy star formation are still unclear. We tackle this fundamental problem with our cosmological semi-empirical model DECODE (Discrete statistical sEmi-empiriCal mODEl), designed to predict galaxy stellar mass assembly histories, from minimal input assumptions. Methods: Specifically, in this work the star formation history of each galaxy is calculated along its progenitor dark matter halo by assigning at each redshift a star formation rate extracted from a monotonic star formation rate-halo accretion rate (SFR-HAR) relation derived from abundance matching between the (observed) SFR function and the (numerically predicted) HAR function, a relation that is also predicted by the TNG100 simulation. SFRs are integrated across cosmic time to build up the mass of galaxies, which may halt their star formation following input physical quenching recipes. Results: In this work we test the popular halo quenching scenario and we find that: 1) the assumption of a monotonic relation between SFR and HAR allows to reproduce the number densities of the bulk of star-forming galaxies in the local Universe; 2) the halo quenching is sufficient to reproduce the statistics of the quenched galaxies and flat (steep) high-mass end of the SMHM relation (SMF); and 3) to align with the observed steep (flat) low-mass end of the SMHM (SMF) additional quenching processes in the least massive haloes are needed. Conclusions: DECODE is an invaluable tool and will pave the way to investigate the origin of newly observed high-redshift objects from the latest ongoing facilities such as JWST and Euclid.

Wilkes, S. P. Willner, D. M. Worrall </p>
<p>
We present first results from James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec), Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), and Keck Cosmic Webb Imager (KCWI) integral field spectroscopy of the powerful but highly obscured host-galaxy of the jetted radio source Cygnus A. We detect 169 infrared emission lines at 1.7&ndash;27 micron and explore the kinematics and physical properties of the extended narrow-line region (NLR) in unprecedented detail. The density-stratified NLR appears to be shaped by the initial blow-out and ongoing interaction of the radio jet with the interstellar medium, creating a multi-phase bicone with a layered structure composed of molecular and ionized gas. The NLR spectrum, with strong coronal emission at kpc-scale, is well-modeled by AGN photoionization. We find evidence that the NLR is rotating around the radio axis, perhaps mediated by magnetic fields and driven by angular momentum transfer from the radio jet. The overall velocity field of the NLR is well described by 250 km/s outflow along biconical spiral flow lines, combining both rotation and outflow signatures. There is particularly bright [Fe II] 1.644 micron emission from a dense, high-velocity dispersion, photoionized clump of clouds found near the projected radio axis. Outflows of 600&ndash;2000 km/s are found in bullets and streamers of ionized gas that may be ablated by the radio jet from these clouds, driving a local outflow rate of 40 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr.

### 216) [2502.05259](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05259v2): JAGB 2.0: Improved Constraints on the J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch-based Hubble Constant from an Expanded Sample of JWST Observations

<p> Siyang Li, Adam G. Riess, Daniel Scolnic, Stefano Casertano, Gagandeep S. Anand </p>
<p>
The J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) is an overdensity of stars in the near-infrared, attributed to carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars, and recently used as a standard candle for measuring extragalactic distances and the Hubble constant. Using JWST in Cycle 2, we extend JAGB measurements to 6 hosts of 9 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) (NGC 2525, NGC 3147, NGC 3370, NGC 3447, NGC 5468, and NGC 5861), with two at D ~ 40 Mpc, all calibrated by the maser host NGC 4258. We investigate the effects of incompleteness and find that we are unable to recover a robust JAGB measurement in one of the two most distant hosts at R ~ 40 Mpc, NGC 3147. We compile all JWST JAGB observations in SNe Ia hosts, 15 galaxies hosting 18 SNe Ia, from the SH0ES and CCHP programs and employ all literature measures (mode, mean, median, model). We find no significant mean difference between these distances and those from HST Cepheids, -0.03±0.02 (stat) ± 0.05 (sys) mag. We find a difference of 0.11 ± 0.02 mag between JAGB mode measurements in the CCHP analyses of two fields in NGC 4258, a feature also seen in two SH0ES fields (see field-to-field variations in Li et al. 2024a), indicating significant field-to-field variation of JAGB measurements in NGC 4258 which produce a large absolute calibration uncertainty. Variations are also seen in the shape of the JAGB LF across galaxies so that different measures produce different values of the Hubble constant. We look for but do not (yet) find a standardizing relation between JAGB LF skew or color dependence and the apparent variation. Using the middle result of all JAGB measures to calibrate SNe Ia yields a Hubble constant of H_0 = 73.3 ± 1.4 (stat) ± 2.0 (sys) km/s/Mpc with the systematic dominated by apparent differences across NGC 4258 calibrating fields or their measures.

### 217) [2502.04435](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04435v2): 1000-10,000 M<sub>&odot;</sub> Primordial Stars Created the Nitrogen Excess in the Galaxy GS 3073 at z = 5.55

<p> Devesh Nandal, Daniel J. Whalen, Muhammad A. Latif, Alexander Heger </p>
<p>
The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope has revealed a wealth of new galaxies just a few hundred Myr after the Big Bang. Some of these galaxies exhibit unusual elemental abundances that are difficult to explain with stellar populations today. While Wolf-Rayet stars in multiple-burst populations, very massive or rapidly-rotating primordial stars, general relativistic explosions of metal-enriched supermassive stars, or the precursors of globular clusters can in principle account for the supersolar nitrogen to oxygen ratios in the galaxies GN-z11 and CEERS 1019, no known stars or supernovae can explain the far higher N/O ratio of 0.46 in GS 3073 at redshift z = 5.55. Here we show that the extreme nitrogen abundances in GS 3073 can be produced by 1000 - 10,000 M<sub>&odot;</sub> primordial (Pop III) stars. We find that these are the only candidates that can account for its large N/O ratios and its C/O and Ne/O ratios. GS 3073 is thus the first conclusive evidence in the fossil abundance record of the existence of supermassive Pop III stars at cosmic Dawn.

### 218) [2502.02647](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02647v2): Synergising semi-analytical models and hydrodynamical simulations to interpret JWST data from the first billion years

<p> Valentin Mauerhofer, Pratika Dayal, Martin G. Haehnelt, Taysun Kimm, Joakim Rosdahl, Romain Teyssier </p>
<p>
The field of high redshift galaxy formation has been revolutionised by JWST, which is yielding unprecedented insights on galaxy assembly at early times. Our key aim is to study the physical mechanisms that can explain the unexpected abundance of bright galaxies at z ≥ 11, as well as their metal enrichment and spectral properties. We also use recent data to determine the key sources of reionisation. To do so, we implement cold gas fractions and star formation efficiencies derived from the SPHINX20 high-resolution radiation-hydrodynamics simulation into DELPHI, a semi-analytic model that tracks the assembly of dark matter halos and their baryonic components from z ~ 4.5-40. In addition, we explore two different methodologies to boost galaxy luminosities at z ≥ 11: a stellar initial mass function (IMF) that becomes increasingly top-heavy with decreasing metallicity and increasing redshift (eIMF model), and star formation efficiencies that increase with increasing redshift (eSFE model). Our key findings are: (i) both the eIMF and eSFE models can explain the abundance of bright galaxies at z ≥ 11; (ii) dust attenuation plays an important role for the bright-end of the UV LF at z ≤ 11; (iii) the mass-metallicity relation is in place as early as z ~ 17 in all models although its slope is model-dependent; (iv) within the spread of both models and observations, all of our models are in good agreement with current estimates of &beta; slopes at z ~ 5-17 and Balmer break strengths at z ~ 6-10; (v) in the eIMF model, galaxies at z≥12 or with M_UV≥-18 show values of  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  ~ 10^25.55~[Hz~erg^-1], twice larger than in other models; (vi) star formation in galaxies below 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> is the key driver of reionisation, providing the bulk (~ 85&percnt;) of ionising photons down to its midpoint at z ~ 7.

Rosolowsky, Karin Sandstrom, Sumit Sarbadhicary, Jiayi Sun, Leonardo 'Ubeda </p>
<p>
Radiation pressure is a key mechanism by which stellar feedback disrupts molecular clouds and drives HII region expansion. This includes direct radiation pressure exerted by UV photons on dust grains, pressure associated with photoionization, and infrared (IR) radiation pressure on grains due to dust-reprocessed IR photons. We present a new method that combines high resolution mid-IR luminosities from JWST-MIRI, optical attenuation and nebular line measurements from VLT-MUSE, and HST H&alpha;-based region sizes to estimate the strength of radiation pressure in ≈ 18,000 HII regions across 19 nearby star-forming galaxies. This is the most extensive and direct estimate of these terms beyond the Local Group to date. In the disks of galaxies, we find that the total reprocessed IR pressure is on average 5% of the direct UV radiation pressure. This fraction rises to 10% in galaxy centers. We expect reprocessed IR radiation pressure to dominate over UV radiation pressure in regions where L_F2100W/L_H&alpha;^corr ≳ 75. Radiation pressure due to H ionizations is lower than pressure on dust in our sample, but appears likely to dominate the radiation pressure budget in dwarf galaxies similar to the Small Magellanic Cloud. The contribution from all radiation pressure terms appears to be subdominant compared to thermal pressure from ionized gas, reinforcing the view that radiation pressure is most important in compact, heavily embedded, and young regions.

### 220) [2501.14893](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14893v4): JWST Observations of Starbursts: Relations between PAH features and CO clouds in the starburst galaxy M 82

<p>
We present a study of new 7.7-11.3 &mu;m data obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope Mid-InfraRed Instrument in the starburst galaxy M 82. In particular, we focus on the dependency of the integrated CO(1-0) line intensity on the MIRI-F770W and MIRI-F1130W filter intensities to investigate the correlation between CO content and the 7.7 and 11.3 &mu;m features from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in M 82's outflows. To perform our analysis, we identify CO clouds using archival ^12CO(J=1-0) NOEMA moment 0 map within 2 kpc from the center of M 82, with sizes ranging between ~21 and 270 pc; then, we compute the CO-to-PAH relations for the 306 validated CO clouds. On average, the power-law slopes for the two relations in M 82 are lower than what is seen in local main-sequence spirals. In addition, there is a moderate correlation between I_CO(1-0)-I_7.7&mu; m /I_11.3&mu; m for most of the CO cloud groups analyzed in this work. Our results suggest that the extreme conditions in M 82 translate into CO not tracing the full budget of molecular gas in smaller clouds, perhaps as a consequence of photoionization and/or emission suppression of CO molecules due to hard radiation fields from the central starburst.

### 221) [2501.12008](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12008v2): The mass-dependent UVJ diagram at cosmic noon: A challenge for galaxy evolution models and dust radiative transfer

<p>
Context. The UVJ color-color diagram is a widely used diagnostic to separate star-forming and quiescent galaxies. Observational data from photometric surveys reveal a strong stellar mass trend, with higher-mass star-forming galaxies being systematically more dust-reddened. Aims. We analyze the UVJ diagram in the TNG100 cosmological simulation at cosmic noon (z≈2). Specifically, we focus on the trend between UVJ colors and mass which has not been reproduced in any cosmological simulation thus far. Methods. We applied the SKIRT dust radiative transfer code to the TNG100 simulation to generate rest-frame UVJ fluxes. These UVJ colors were then compared to observational data from several well-studied extragalactic fields from the CANDELS/3D-HST programs, augmented by recent JWST/NIRCam photometry. Results. Quiescent and low-mass (M<sub>&sext;</sub>≲10^10.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) galaxies at cosmic noon do not require significant levels of dust reddening, as opposed to massive (M<sub>&sext;</sub>≳10^11 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) star-forming galaxies. An extensive range of possible dust models fall short of the required dust reddening in V-J color for massive star-forming galaxies, with the simulated galaxies being too blue by ≈0.9 mag. Conclusions. We find that only variations in the star-to-dust geometries of the simulated galaxies can yield V-J colors that are red enough to match the observations. A toy model with isolated dust screens around younger stellar populations (with ages below ~1 Gyr) can reproduce the observational data, while all conventional dust radiative transfer models (where the dust distribution follows the metals in the interstellar medium) fail to achieve the required V-J colors.

### 222) [2501.08135](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08135v2): Exploring Multiple Stellar Populations in Globular Clusters with Euclid: A Theoretical Overview and Insights from NGC 6397

<p>
We investigate the behavior of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters (GCs) using photometric diagrams constructed with Euclid photometry. By employing synthetic spectra and isochrones that incorporate the chemical differences between first-population (1P) stars, resembling field stars, and second-population (2P) stars, enriched in helium and nitrogen but depleted in carbon and oxygen, we identify, from a theoretical perspective, the color-magnitude diagrams and the chromosome maps most effective at distinguishing these populations within GCs. Euclid photometry proves to be a powerful tool for identifying multiple populations among M-dwarfs, as 1P and 2P stars form distinct sequences in well-chosen photometric diagrams, driven by differences in the strength of oxygen-based molecular features, such as water vapor. To validate our theoretical findings, we analyzed Euclid photometry and astrometry of the GC NGC 6397, complemented by photometric and astrometric data from the Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope, enabling a comprehensive study of its stellar populations across a wide field of view. We find that the 1P constitutes about 30% of the M-dwarfs in NGC 6397, with the fraction of 1P stars remaining consistent across different stellar masses and throughout the entire field of view. 2P stars exhibit an [O/Fe] depletion of about 0.3 dex relative to 1P stars, and both populations display isotropic proper motions. This study represents the first comprehensive analysis of multiple populations among M-dwarfs across a wide field of view, demonstrating that Euclid photometry is a powerful instrument for investigating multiple populations in GCs.

### 223) [2501.05834](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05834v3): Census of Lyα Emission from ~ 600 Galaxies at z=5-14: Evolution of the Lyα Luminosity Function and a Late Sharp Cosmic Reionization

<p> Yuta Kageura, Masami Ouchi, Minami Nakane, Hiroya Umeda, Yuichi Harikane, Shintaro Yoshiura, Kimihiko Nakajima, Hidenobu Yajima, Tran Thi Thai </p>
<p>
We present the statistical properties of Ly&alpha; emission in 586 galaxies at z=4.5-14.2, observed by multiple JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy projects, including JADES, GLASS, CEERS, and GO/DDT programs. We obtain Ly&alpha; equivalent width (EW), Ly&alpha; escape fraction, and ionizing photon production efficiency measurements or upper limits for these galaxies, and confirm that the Ly&alpha; emitting galaxy fraction decreases towards higher redshifts. We derive Ly&alpha; luminosity functions from z~ 5 to z~ 10-14 with the observed Ly&alpha; EW distributions and galaxy UV luminosity functions, and find a ~3 dex decrease in number density at L_Ly&alpha;=10^42-10^43 erg s<sup>-1</sup> over the redshift range. Notably, this study presents the first constraints on the Ly&alpha; luminosity function at z~ 8-14. We obtain the neutral hydrogen fractions of x_HI=0.17_-0.16^+0.23, 0.63_-0.28^+0.18, 0.79_-0.21^+0.13, and 0.88_-0.13^+0.11 at z~6, 7, 8-9, and 10-14, respectively, via comparisons of the reionization models developed by semi-numerical simulations with 21cmFAST explaining the observations of Ly&alpha;, UV continuum, and Planck electron optical depth. The high x_HI values over z~ 7-14 suggest a late and sharp reionization, with the primary reionization process occurring at z~ 6-7. Such a late and sharp reionization is not easily explained by either a clumpy inter-galactic medium or sources of reionization in a classical faint-galaxy or a bright-galaxy/AGN scenario, unless a very high escape fraction or AGN duty cycle is assumed at z~ 6-7.

### 224) [2501.05512](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05512v2): JWST NIRCam simulations and observations of AGN ionization cones in cosmic noon galaxies

<p> Sophie Lebowitz, Kevin Hainline, Stéphanie Juneau, Jianwei Lyu, Christina Williams, Stacey Alberts, Xiaohui Fan, Marcia Rieke </p>
<p>
The extended narrow line region (NLR) of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) provides a valuable laboratory for exploring the relationship between AGN and their host galaxies, often appearing as an "ionization cone" that can extend out to the very edge of the galaxy. We use new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam imaging to study the morphologies and sizes of NLRs traced by [O III] at cosmic noon (z~2-3). To determine NIRCam's ability to probe the properties of the NLR in cosmic noon galaxies, we present simulated images of AGN at z=2-3 created with archival data cubes from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) of nine nearby (z&lt;0.05) AGN host galaxies with previously confirmed extended NLRs. Our simulated images show that NIRCam is able to resolve the morphologies of NLRs at z=2-3 with narrow- and medium-band observations. We then search for extended NLRs with NIRCam medium-band observations targeting the [O III]+H&beta; emission in twenty-seven previously identified AGN at z=2.4-3.4 in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey South (GOODS-S) field. We detect six galaxies in our observed sample with [O III]+H&beta; morphologies consistent with AGN ionization cones with characteristic NLR sizes of 1-2.5 kpc. Thanks to our simulated data, we can predict the effects of cosmological surface brightness dimming and instrument noise on the NLR size measurements at high redshift, which has the biasing effect of lowering the NLR size-AGN luminosity trend that is observed at low redshift by a factor of ~ 2.

### 225) [2501.03309](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03309v2): Little Red Dots are Tidal Disruption Events in Runaway-Collapsing Clusters

<p> Jillian Bellovary </p>
<p>
I hypothesize a physical explanation for the "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The first star formation in the universe occurs in dense clusters, some of which may undergo runaway collapse and form an intermediate mass black hole. This process would appear as a very dense stellar system, with recurring tidal disruption events (TDEs) as stellar material is accreted by the black hole. Such a system would be compact, UV-emitting, and exhibit broad H-alpha emission. If runaway collapse is the primary mechanism for forming massive black hole seeds, this process could be fairly common and explain the large volume densities of LRDs. In order to match the predicted number density of runaway collapse clusters, the tidal disruption rate must be on the order of 10^-4 per year. A top-heavy stellar initial mass function may be required to match observations without exceeding the predicted LambdaCDM mass function. The TDE LRD hypothesis can be verified with followup JWST observations looking for TDE-like variability.

### 226) [2501.03217](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03217v2): No evidence (yet) for increased star-formation efficiency at early times

<p> C. T. Donnan, J. S. Dunlop, R. J. McLure, D. J. McLeod, F. Cullen </p>
<p>
Early JWST observations have revealed substantial numbers of galaxies out to redshifts as high as z ≃ 14, reflecting a slow evolution of the galaxy UV luminosity function (LF) not anticipated by many models of galaxy evolution. The discovery of fairly massive galaxies at early times has again been viewed as a challenge to our understanding of early galaxy growth or even &Lambda;CDM cosmology. Here we develop and test a simple theoretical model which shows that these observations are unsurprising, but instead are arguably as expected if one assumes a non-evolving halo-mass dependent galaxy-formation efficiency consistent with that observed today. Crucially, this model matches the observed galaxy UV LF at z ≃ 6-13 and the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) at z ≃ 6-8. Using new constraints on Lyman continuum escape and the ionizing photon production efficiency, we also predict the progress of cosmic hydrogen reionization consistent with current observations. The requirement to fit both the UV LF and the GSMF breaks the degeneracy between mass-to-light ratio and star-formation efficiency, where the typical mass-to-light ratio of galaxies increases systematically with redshift beyond z ≃ 6. However, at present this does not require changes to the IMF, cosmic dust, or any other new astrophysics. Rather, the current data can be reproduced simply by assuming ever-younger stellar populations consistent with a formation epoch at z ≃ 15. A key prediction of our model therefore is that there should be a more rapid drop-off in the galaxy number density beyond z ≃ 15, where one can no longer appeal to ever younger ages to offset the precipitous descent of the halo mass function.

<p>
We present a structural analysis of 521 galaxy candidates at 6.5 &lt; z &lt; 12.5, with SNR &gt; 10&sigma; in the F444W filter, taken from the EPOCHS v1 sample, consisting of uniformly reduced deep JWST NIRCam data, covering the CEERS, JADES GOOD-S, NGDEEP, SMACS0723, GLASS and PEARLS surveys. We use standard software to fit single S\'ersic models to each galaxy in the rest-frame optical and extract their parametric structural parameters (S\'ersic index, half-light radius and axis-ratio), and ttMorfometryka to measure their non-parametric concentration and asymmetry parameters. We find a wide range of sizes for these early galaxies, but with a strong galaxy-size mass correlation up to z ~ 12 such that galaxy sizes continue to get progressively smaller in the high-redshift regime, following R_e = 2.74 ± 0.49 ≤ft( 1 + z ) ^-0.79 ± 0.08 kpc. Using non-parametric methods we find that galaxy merger fractions, classified through asymmetry parameters, at these redshifts remain consistent with those in literature, maintaining a value of f_m ~ 0.12 ± 0.07 showing little dependence with redshift when combined with literature at z &gt; 4. We find that galaxies which are smaller in size also appear rounder, with an excess of high axis-ratio objects. Finally, we artificially redshift a subsample of our objects to determine how robust the observational trends we see are, determining that observed trends are due to real evolutionary effects, rather than being a consequence of redshift effects.

<p>
We report the discovery of an ultra-massive grand-design red spiral galaxy, named Zh\'ul\'ong (Torch Dragon), at z<sub>phot</sub> = 5.2^+0.3_-0.2 in the JWST PANORAMIC survey, identified as the most distant bulge+disk galaxy candidate with spiral arms known to date. Zh\'ul\'ong displays an extraordinary combination of properties: 1) a classical bulge centered in a large, face-on exponential stellar disk (half-light radius of R_e = 3.7 ± 0.1   kpc), with spiral arms extending across 19 kpc; 2) a clear transition from the red, quiescent core (F150W-F444W=3.1 mag) with high stellar mass surface density (log(&Sigma; M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>   kpc^-2) = 9.91_-0.09^+0.11) to the star-forming outer regions, as revealed by spatially resolved SED analysis, which indicates significant inside-out galaxy growth; 3) an extremely high stellar mass at its redshift, with log (M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=11.03_-0.08^+0.10 comparable to the Milky Way, and an implied baryon-to-star conversion efficiency (&epsilon; ~ 0.3) that is 1.5 times higher than even the most efficient galaxies at later epochs; 4) despite an active disk, a relatively modest overall star formation rate (SFR =66_-46^+89 ~M<sub>&odot;</sub>   yr^-1), which is &gt;0.5 dex below the star formation main sequence at z ~ 5.2 and &gt;10 times lower than ultra-massive dusty galaxies at z=5-6. Altogether, Zh\'ul\'ong shows that mature galaxies emerged much earlier than expected in the first billion years after the Big Bang through rapid galaxy formation and morphological evolution. Our finding offers key constraints for models of massive galaxy formation and the origin of spiral structures in the early universe.

### 229) [2412.04548](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04548v2): Fading Light, Fierce Winds: JWST Snapshot of a Sub-Eddington Quasar at Cosmic Dawn

<p> Jianwei Lyu, George H. Rieke, Meredith Stone, Jane Morrison, Stacey Alberts, Xiangyu Jin, Yongda Zhu, Weizhe Liu, Jinyi Yang </p>
<p>
The majority of most luminous quasars during the epoch of reionization accrete near or above the Eddington limit, marking the vigorous growth of primitive supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, their subsequent evolution and environmental impact remain poorly characterized. We present JWST/NIRSpec prism IFU observations of HSC J2239+0207, a low-luminosity quasar at z~6.25 likely in a late stage of mass assembly with an overmassive SMBH relative to its host galaxy. Using H&beta; and H&alpha; broad emission lines, we estimate an SMBH mass M_BH~3×10^8~M<sub>&odot;</sub> and confirm its sub-Eddington accretion at &lambda;_Edd~0.4. Strong FeII emission and a proximity zone of typical size suggest a metal-rich, highly evolved system. In the far-UV, this quasar presents strong broad-absorption-line features, indicative of high-velocity winds (&nu;~10^4~km/s). Meanwhile, minimal dust reddening is inferred from the quasar continuum and broad-line Balmer decrement, suggesting little dust along the polar direction. Most interestingly, we identify a gas companion ~5 kpc from the quasar with a high [OIII]/H&beta; ratio (≳10), likely representing outflowing gas blown away by AGN feedback. These results highlight HSC J2239+0207 as a likely fading quasar in transition, providing rare insights into SMBH evolution, AGN feedback, and AGN-galaxy interactions in the early Universe.

<p>
We investigate UV continuum slopes &beta; of 863 galaxies at z=4-14 using archival JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectra obtained from major JWST GTO, ERS, and GO programs, including JADES, CEERS, and UNCOVER. Among these galaxies, we identify a remarkable galaxy at z=9.25, dubbed EBG-1, with a significantly blue UV slope &beta;=-2.99±0.15, unlike the rest of the galaxies that exhibit red continua or ambiguous blue continua hindered by large uncertainties. We confirm that the &beta; value negligibly changes by the data reduction and fitting wavelength ranges for UV emission/absorption line masking. The extreme blue slope, &beta;=-3.0, rules out significant contributions from dust extinction or AGN activity. Comparing with stellar and nebular emission models, we find that such a blue UV slope cannot be reproduced solely by stellar models even with very young, metal-poor, or top-heavy contiguous star formation associated with strong nebular continua making the UV slopes red, but with a high ionizing photon escape fraction, f<sub>esc</sub>^ion ≳ 0.5, for a weak nebular continuum. While the H&beta; emission line is not detected, likely due to the limited sensitivity of the spectrum, we find moderately weak [O III] &lambda;&lambda;4959,5007 emission lines for the given star-formation rate (3  M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1) and stellar mass (10^8.0   M<sub>&odot;</sub>) that are about three times weaker than the average emission lines, again suggestive of the high ionizing photon escape fraction, f<sub>esc</sub>^ion ~ 0.7 or more. EBG-1 would provide crucial insights into stellar and nebular continuum emission in high-redshift galaxies, serving as an example of the ionizing photon escaping site at the epoch of reionization.

<p> L. Huang, P. Zong, Z. X. Chang, N. Chang, F. He </p>
<p>
We use the star formation rate-stellar mass relation (SFR - M_ * ) of galaxies to measure their luminosity distances as well as estimate cosmological parameters. We compile a sample of 341 high-redshift galaxies at 5 &lt; z &lt; 14 and an additional 51 galaxies at 1.8 &lt; z &lt; 3.5 from the JWST observations, which can be used to investigate the correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass, and determine their cosmological distance. The relation SFR &prop;  1pt (M_ * /M_ &odot; )^&gamma;  can be applied to check the nonlinear correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass M_ *  of galaxies and give their distance. Additionally, it also can be used to test if the SFR - M_ *  relation depends on redshift, and the data suggest that the SFR is positively correlated with stellar mass, the SFR - M_ *  relation of the high-redshift galaxies has a redshift dependence. Finally, we combine the galaxy sample with Type Ia supernova (SNIa) data from the Pantheon compilation to test the property of dark energy, specifically addressing whether its density deviates from the constant, and give the statistical analysis results.

### 232) [2411.14526](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14526v2): Citizen Science Identification of Isolated Blue Stellar Systems in the Virgo cluster

<p>
We present a catalog of 34 new candidate (13 high confidence) isolated, young stellar systems within the Virgo galaxy cluster identified through a citizen science search of public optical and ultraviolet imaging. "Blue blobs" are a class of blue, faint, isolated, extremely low stellar mass, and metal-rich star-forming clouds embedded in the hot intracluster medium of the Virgo cluster. Only six blue blobs were known previously and here we confirm an additional six of our candidates through velocity and metallicity measurements from follow-up optical spectroscopy on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET). Our 13 high confidence candidates (including the six confirmed) have properties consistent with prior known blue blobs and are inconsistent with being low-mass galaxies. Most candidates are concentrated in relatively dense regions, roughly following filamentary structures within the cluster, but avoiding its center. Three of our candidates are likely the stellar counterparts of known 'optically dark' clouds of neutral hydrogen in the cluster, while a further four are widely separated extensions to previously known blue blobs. The properties of our new candidates are consistent with previous conclusions that blue blobs likely originated from ram pressure stripping events, however, their locations in velocity&ndash;projected cluster-centric radius phase-space imply that their parent galaxies are not on their first infall into the cluster. Through our ongoing follow-up program with HET we aim to confirm additional candidates, however, detailed understanding of the stellar populations and star formation histories of blue blobs will require JWST observations.

We report the discovery of two galaxy candidates at redshifts between 15.7&lt;z&lt;16.4 in JWST observations from the GLIMPSE survey. These robust sources were identified using a combination of Lyman-break selection and photometric redshift estimates. The ultra-deep NIRCam imaging from GLIMPSE, combined with the strong gravitational lensing of the Abell S1063 galaxy cluster, allows us to probe an intrinsically fainter population (down to M_UV =-17.0 mag) than previously achievable. These galaxies have absolute magnitudes ranging from M_UV = -17.0 to -17.2 mag, with blue (&beta; ≃ -2.87) UV continuum slopes, consistent with young, dust-free stellar populations. The number density of these objects, log_10(&phi;/[Mpc^-3 mag^-1])=-3.47^+0.13_-0.10 at M_UV=-17 is in clear tension with pre-JWST theoretical predictions, extending the over-abundance of galaxies from z~10 to z~ 17. These results, together with the scarcity of brighter galaxies in other public surveys, suggest a steep decline in the bright-end of the UV luminosity function at z ~ 16, implying efficient star formation and possibly a close connection to the halo mass function at these redshifts. Testing a variety of star formation histories suggests that these sources are plausible progenitors of the unusually UV-bright galaxies that JWST now routinely uncovers at z = 10-14. Overall, our results indicate that the luminosity distribution of the earliest star-forming galaxies could be shifting towards fainter luminosities, implying that future surveys of cosmic dawn will need to explore this faint luminosity regime.

### 234) [2411.11972](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11972v2): Disc asymmetry characterisation in JWST-observed galaxies at 1 &lt; z &lt; 4

<p> Ananya Ganapathy, Michael S. Petersen, Rashid Yaaqib, Carrie Filion </p>
<p>
We present a novel technique using Fourier series and Laguerre polynomials to represent morphological features of disc galaxies. To demonstrate the utility of this technique, we study the evolution of disc asymmetry in a sample of disc galaxies drawn from the Extended Groth Strip and imaged by the JWST Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey as well as archival HST observations. We measure disc asymmetry as the amplitude of the of the m = 1 Fourier harmonic for galaxies within redshift ranges of 1 &lt; z &lt; 4 relative to the amplitude of m = 0 harmonic. We show that when viewed in shorter rest frame wavelengths, disc galaxies have a higher asymmetry as the flux is dominated by star forming regions. We find generally low asymmetry at rest frame infrared wavelengths, where our metric tracks asymmetry in morphological features such as bars and spiral arms. We show that higher mass galaxies have lower asymmetry and vice versa. Higher asymmetry in lower mass galaxies comes from lower mass galaxies (typically) having higher star formation rates. We measure the relation between disc galaxy asymmetry and redshift and find no conclusive relationship between them. We demonstrate the utility of the Fourier-Laguerre technique for recovering physically informative asymmetry measurements as compared to rotational asymmetry measurements. We also release the software pipeline and quantitative analysis for each galaxy.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is opening new frontiers of transient discovery and follow-up at high-redshift. Here we present the discovery of a spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernova (SN Ia; SN 2023aeax) at z=2.15 with JWST, including a NIRCam multi-band light curve. SN 2023aeax lands at the edge of traditional low-z cosmology cuts because of its blue color (peak rest-frame B-V~-0.3) but with a normal decline rate (&Delta; m_15(B)~1.25), and applying a fiducial standardization with the BayeSN model we find the SN 2023aeax luminosity distance is in ~0.1&sigma; agreement with &Lambda;CDM. SN 2023aeax is only the second spectroscopically confirmed SN Ia in the dark matter-dominated Universe at z&gt;2 (the other is SN 2023adsy), giving it rare leverage to constrain any potential evolution in SN Ia standardized luminosities. Similar to SN 2023adsy (B-V~0.8), SN 2023aeax has a fairly extreme (but opposite) color, which may be due to the small sample size or a secondary factor, such as host galaxy properties. Nevertheless, the SN 2023aeax spectrum is well-represented by normal low-z SN Ia spectra and we find no definitive evolution in SN Ia standardization with redshift. Still, the first two spectroscopically confirmed z&gt;2 SNe Ia have peculiar colors and combine for a ~1&sigma; distance slope relative to &Lambda;CDM, though in agreement with recent SN Ia cosmological measurements.

We determine the spectroscopic properties of ~1000 ostensibly star-forming galaxies at redshifts (z=4-10) using prism spectroscopy from JWST/NIRSpec. With rest-wavelength coverage between Lya and [S II] in the optical, we stack spectra as a function of nebular conditions, and compare UV spectral properties with stellar age. This reveals UV lines of N III], N IV], C III], C IV, He II, and O III] in the average high-z galaxy. All UV lines are more intense in younger starbursts. We measure electron temperatures from the collisionally excited [O III] line ratios, finding Te=18000-22000 K for the O++ regions. We also detect a significant nebular Balmer Jump from which we estimate only Te=8000-13000 K. Accounting for typical temperature offsets between zones bearing doubly and singly ionized oxygen, these two temperatures remain discrepant by around 40%. We use the [O III] temperatures to estimate abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. We find that log(C/O) is consistently ~-1, with no evolution of C/O with metallicity or stellar age. The average spectra are mildly enhanced in Nitrogen, with higher N/O than low-z starbursts, but are less enhanced than samples of high-z galaxies with visible UV N III] and N IV]. Whatever processes produce the N-enhancement in the individual galaxies must also be ongoing, at lower levels, in the median galaxy in the early Universe. The strongest starbursts are a source of significant ionizing emission: ionizing photon production efficiencies reach 10^25.7 Hz/erg, and show multiple signatures of high Lyman continuum escape, including Mg II escape fractions nearing 100%, significant deficits in [S II] emission, high degrees of ionization, and blue UV colors.

JWST/MIRI images have been used to study the Fourier transform power spectra (PS) of two spiral galaxies, NGC 628 and NGC 5236, and two dwarfs, NGC 4449 and NGC 5068, at distances ranging from 4 to 10 Mpc. The PS slopes on scales larger than 200 pc range from -0.6 at 21 microns to -1.2 at 5.6 microns. These slopes for one-dimensional PS are consistent with the PS slopes observed elsewhere using HI and dust emission. They are likely related to turbulence, but they may also be viewed as a hierarchical distribution of objects having a size-luminosity relation and size distribution function. There is no evidence for a kink or steepening of the PS at some transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional turbulence on the scale of the disk thickness. This lack of a kink could be from large positional variations in the PS depending on two opposite effects: local bright sources that make the slope shallower and exponential galaxy profiles that make the slope steeper. The sources could also be confined to a layer of molecular clouds that is thinner than the HI or cool dust layers where PS kinks have been observed before. If the star formation layers observed in the mid-infrared here are too thin, then the PS kink could also be hidden in the broad tail of the JWST point spread function.

(Abridged) JWST continues to deliver incredibly detailed infrared (IR) images of star forming regions in the Milky Way and beyond. IR emission from star-forming regions is very spectrally rich due to emission from gas-phase atoms, ions, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Physically interpreting IR images of these regions relies on assumptions about the underlying spectral energy distribution in the imaging bandpasses. We aim to provide empirical prescriptions linking line, PAH, and continuum intensities from JWST images, to facilitate the interpretation of JWST images in a wide variety of contexts. We use JWST PDRs4All Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) imaging and Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) integral field unit (IFU) and MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) spectroscopic observations of the Orion Bar photodissociation region (PDR), to directly compare and cross-calibrate imaging and IFU data at ~100 AU resolution over a region where the radiation field and ISM environment evolves from the hot ionized gas to the cold molecular gas. We measure the relative contributions of line, PAH, and continuum emission to the NIRCam and MIRI filters as functions of local physical conditions. We provide empirical prescriptions based on NIRCam and MIRI images to derive intensities of emission lines and PAH features. Within the range of the environments probed in this study, these prescriptions accurately predict Pa-&alpha;, Br-&alpha;, PAH 3.3 &mu;m and 11.2 &mu;m intensities, while those for FeII 1.644 &mu;m, H<sub>2</sub> 1&ndash;0 S(1) 2.12 &mu;m and 1&ndash;0 S(9) 4.96 &mu;m, and PAH 7.7 &mu;m show more complicated environmental dependencies. Linear combinations of JWST NIRCam and MIRI images provide effective tracers of ionized gas, H<sub>2</sub>, and PAH emission in PDRs. We expect these recipes to be useful for both the Galactic and extragalactic communities.

Galaxy mergers are a key driver of galaxy formation and evolution, including the triggering of AGN and star formation to a still unknown degree. We thus investigate the impact of galaxy mergers on star formation and AGN activity using a sample of 3,330 galaxies at z = [4.5, 8.5] from eight JWST fields (CEERS, JADES GOODS-S, NEP-TDF, NGDEEP, GLASS, El-Gordo, SMACS-0723, and MACS-0416), collectively covering an unmasked area of 189 arcmin<sup>2</sup>. We focuses on star formation rate (SFR) enhancement, AGN fraction, and AGN excess in major merger (&mu; &gt; 1/4) close-pair samples, defined by &Delta; z &lt; 0.3 and projected separations r_p &lt; 100 kpc, compared to non-merger samples. We find that SFR enhancement occurs only at r_p &lt; 20 kpc, with values of 0.25 ± 0.10 dex and 0.26 ± 0.11 dex above the non-merger medians for z = [4.5, 6.5] and z = [6.5, 8.5]. No other statistically significant enhancements in galaxy sSFR or stellar mass are observed at any projected separation or redshift bin. We also compare our observational results with predictions from the SC-SAM simulation and find no evidence of star formation enhancement in the simulations at any separation range. Finally, we examine the AGN fraction and AGN excess, finding that the fraction of AGNs in AGN-galaxy pairs, relative to the total AGN population, is 3.25^+1.50_-1.06 times greater than the fraction of galaxy pairs relative to the overall galaxy population at the same redshift. We find that nearly all AGNs have a companion within 100 kpc and observe an excess AGN fraction in close-pair samples compared to non-merger samples. This excess is found to be 1.26 ± 0.06 and 1.34 ± 0.06 for AGNs identified via the inferred BPT diagram and photometric SED selection, respectively.

<p> Zijian Zhang, Linhua Jiang, Weiyang Liu, Luis C. Ho </p>
<p>
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a population of red and compact sources at z ≳ 5 known as "Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) that are likely active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here we present a comprehensive study of the variability of 314 LRDs with multi-epoch JWST observations in five deep fields: UDS, GOODS-S, GOODS-N, Abell 2744, and COSMOS. Our analyses use all publicly available JWST NIRCam imaging data in these fields, together with multi-epoch JWST MIRI images available. We measure the significance (signal-to-noise ratio or SNR_var) of the variabilities for all LRDs and statistically evaluate their variabilities using the SNR_var distributions. We pay particular attention to the systematic offsets of photometric zero points among different epochs that seem to commonly exist. The derived SNR_var distributions of the LRDs, including those with broad H&alpha;/H&beta; emission lines, follow the standard Gaussian distribution, and are generally consistent with those of the comparison samples of objects detected in the same images. This finding suggests that the LRD population on average does not show strong variability, which can be explained by super-Eddington accretion of the black holes in AGNs. Alternatively, many of them may be dominated by galaxies. We also find eight strongly variable LRD candidates with variability amplitudes of 0.24 &ndash; 0.82 mag. The rest-frame optical SEDs of these variable LRDs should have significant AGN contribution. Future JWST observations will provide more variability information of LRDs.

<p> Aadarsh Pathak, J. Stuart B. Wyithe, Ralph S. Sutherland, L. J Kewley </p>
<p>
We present [OIII]/H_&beta; emision line flux ratio predictions for galaxies at z ~ 7-9 using the MAPPINGS V v5.2.0 photoionization modelling code combined with an analytic galaxy formation model. Properties such as pressure and ionization parameter that determine emission line properties are thought to evolve towards high redshift. In order to determine the range of expected interstellar conditions we extend previous modelling of the Star Formation Rate Density (SFRD) function to calculate the metallicity and ionization parameter, and incorporate the potential impact of turbulence on the density of the ISM. To validate our emission line predictions we calculate the [OIII] line luminosity and its dependence on UV luminosity, as well as the flux ratio [OIII]/H_&beta; and its variation with the line luminosity, finding that both reproduce recent JWST observations from the FRESCO survey. We also use our model to predict the number counts of emission line galaxies across a range of redshift as well as the dependence of [OIII]/H_&beta; on ionization parameter and metallicity. Finally, we show that the dependence of flux ratio on luminosity may provide a diagnostic of turbulent motion in galactic discs.

<p>
We present a new analytical model for the attenuation to Epoch of Reionization (EoR) galaxies by proximate neutral hydrogen gas. Many galaxy spectra in the EoR taken by JWST have shown a flux deficit at wavelengths just redward of the Lyman break, and this has been regarded as resulting from Ly&alpha; damping wing absorption by the increasing amount of neutral hydrogen in the line-of-sight. However, previous attenuation models for the intergalactic medium (IGM) commonly used in photometric redshift template-fitting codes assume that the Lyman break is rather sharp, which leads to systematic overestimation of photometric redshifts at z&gt;7. In this letter, we build and empirically calibrate a new attenuation model that takes the increased Ly&alpha; damping wing absorption into account. Our model consists of the canonical IGM absorption and an additional absorption component due to dense neutral hydrogen gas clouds proximate to the galaxy, and we derive the redshift evolution of HI column density of the proximate clouds by calibrating the model using CANUCS JWST observations. The resulting total transmission curve resolves the photometric redshift bias at z&gt;7, an improvement that is robust to choice of template-fitting code, template set, and photometric catalog used. The new attenuation model can be easily implemented in existing template-fitting codes, and significantly improves the photometric redshift performance in the EoR.

### 243) [2410.21409](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21409v2): Constraining bursty star formation histories with galaxy UV and Hα luminosity functions and clustering

<p> Guochao Sun, Julian B. Muñoz, Jordan Mirocha, Claude-André Faucher-Giguère </p>
<p>
The observed prevalence of galaxies exhibiting bursty star formation histories (SFHs) at z≳6 has created new challenges and opportunities for understanding their formation pathways. The degenerate effects of the efficiency and burstiness of star formation on the observed UV luminosity function are separable by galaxy clustering. However, quantifying the timescales of burstiness requires more than just the continuum UV measurements. Here we develop a flexible semi-analytic framework for modeling both the amplitude of star formation rate (SFR) variations and their temporal correlation, from which the luminosity function and clustering can be derived for SFR indicators tracing different characteristic timescales (e.g., UV continuum and H&alpha; luminosities). Based on this framework, we study the prospect of using galaxy summary statistics to distinguish models where SFR fluctuations are prescribed by different power spectral density (PSD) forms. Using the Fisher matrix approach, we forecast the constraints on parameters in our PSD-based model that can be extracted from mock JWST observations of the UV and H&alpha; luminosity functions and clustering bias factors at z~6. These constraints demonstrate the feasibility of constraining the burstiness of high-z galaxies solely from their one-point and two-point statistics and underscore the importance of combining tracers of both long-term and short-term SFR variations. Our flexible framework can be readily extended to characterize the SFH of high-redshift galaxies with a wider range of observational diagnostics.

### 244) [2410.14804](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14804v2): SMILES: Potentially Higher Ionizing Photon Production Efficiency in Overdense Regions

The topology of reionization and the environments where galaxies efficiently produce ionizing photons are key open questions. For the first time, we investigate the trend between ionizing photon production efficiency,  &xi;<sub>ion</sub> , and galaxy overdensity, log(1+&delta;). We analyze the ionizing properties of 79 galaxies between 1.0 &lt; z &lt; 5.2 using JWST NIRSpec medium-resolution spectra from the Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument (MIRI) Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES) program. Among these, 67 galaxies have H&alpha; coverage, spanning 1.0 &lt; z &lt; 3.1. The galaxy overdensity, log(1+&delta;), is measured using the JADES photometric catalog, which covers the SMILES footprint. For the subset with H&alpha; coverage, we find that log &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  is positively correlated with log(1+&delta;), with a slope of 0.94_-0.46^+0.46. Additionally, the mean  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  for galaxies in overdense regions (log(1+&delta;) &gt; 0.1) is 2.43 times that of galaxies in lower density regions (log(1+&delta;) &lt; 0.1). This strong trend is found to be independent of redshift evolution. Furthermore, our results confirm the robust correlations between  &xi;<sub>ion</sub>  and the rest-frame equivalent widths of the [O III] or H&alpha; emission lines. Our results suggest that galaxies in high-density regions are efficient producers of ionizing photons.

### 245) [2410.12987](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12987v2): Galaxy Mass Modelling from Multi-Wavelength JWST Strong Lens Analysis: Dark Matter Substructure, Angular Mass Complexity, or Both?

<p>
We analyze two galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses, SPT0418-47 and SPT2147-50, using JWST NIRCam imaging across multiple filters. To account for angular complexity in the lens mass distribution, we introduce multipole perturbations with orders m=1, 3, 4. Our results show strong evidence for angular mass complexity in SPT2147, with multipole strengths of 0.3-1.7 &percnt; for m=3, 4 and 2.4-9.5 &percnt; for m=1, while SPT0418 shows no such preference. We also test lens models that include a dark matter substructure, finding a strong preference for a substructure in SPT2147-50 with a Bayes factor (log-evidence change) of ~ 60 when multipoles are not included. Including multipoles reduces the Bayes factor to ~ 11, still corresponding to a 5&sigma; detection of a subhalo with an NFW mass of log_10(M_200/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 10.87\substack+0.53\ -0.71. While SPT2147-50 may represent the fourth detection of a dark matter substructure in a strong lens, further analysis is needed to confirm that the signal is not due to systematics associated with the lens mass model.

### 246) [2410.12198](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12198v2): The Physical Origin of Extreme Emission Line Galaxies at High redshifts: Strong \sc [Oiii] Emission Lines Produced by Obscured AGNs

<p>
We present deep Subaru/FOCAS spectra for two extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) at z~ 1 with strong \sc[Oiii]&lambda;5007 emission lines, exhibiting equivalent widths (EWs) of 2905^+946_-578 &#8491; and 2000^+188_-159 &#8491;, comparable to those of EELGs at high redshifts that are now routinely identified with JWST spectroscopy. Adding a similarly large \sc [Oiii] EW (2508^+1487_-689 &#8491;) EELG found at z~ 2 in the JWST CEERS survey to our sample, we explore for the physical origins of the large \sc [Oiii] EWs of these three galaxies with the Subaru spectra and various public data including JWST/NIRSpec, NIRCam, and MIRI data. While there are no clear signatures of AGN identified by the optical line diagnostics, we find that two out of two galaxies covered by the MIRI data show strong near-infrared excess in the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) indicating obscured AGN. Because none of the three galaxies show clear broad H&beta; lines, the upper limits on the flux ratios of broad-H&beta; to \sc [Oiii] lines are small, ≲ 0.15 that are comparable with Seyfert 1.8-2.0 galaxies. We conduct ttCloudy modeling with the stellar and AGN incident spectra, allowing a wide range of parameters including metallicities and ionization parameters. We find that the large \sc [Oiii] EWs are not self-consistently reproduced by the spectra of stars or unobscured AGN, but obscured AGN that efficiently produces O^++ ionizing photons with weak nuclear and stellar continua that are consistent with the SED shapes.

### 247) [2410.11095](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11095v3): Unveiling two deeply embedded young protostars in the S68N Class 0 protostellar core with JWST/NIRSpec

<p>
The near-infrared (NIR) emission of the youngest protostars still needs to be characterized to better understand the evolution of their accretion and ejection activity. We analyze James Webb Space Telescope NIRSpec 1.7 &ndash; 5.3 &mu;m observations of two deeply embedded sources in the S68N protostellar core in Serpens. The North Central (NC) source exhibits a highly obscured spectrum (A_K ~ 4.8 mag) that is modeled with a pre-main-sequence photosphere and a hot disk component. The photospheric parameters are consistent with a young, low-mass photosphere, as suggested by the low surface gravity, log g of 1.95 ± 0.15 cm s^-2. The hot disk suggests that accretion onto the central protostellar embryo is ongoing, although prototypical accretion-tracing emission lines HI are not detected. The South Central (SC) source, which is even more embedded (A_K ~ 8 mag; no continuum is detected shortward of 3.6 &mu;m) appears to be driving the large-scale S68N protostellar outflow, and launches a collimated hot molecular jet detected in \Ht and CO ro-vibrational lines. Shock modeling of the \Ht (ro)vibrational lines establishes that fast C-type shocks (≥ 30 km s<sup>-1</sup>), with high pre-shock density (≥ 10^7 cm^-3), and strong magnetic field (b ~ 3&ndash;10, where B = b × \sqrtrmn_rmH (rmcm^-3) &mu;rmG) best match the data. The bright CO fundamental line forest suggests energetic excitation, with the contribution of non-LTE effects, ie irradiation pumping. Detected OH and CH^+ ro-vibrational lines support this hypothesis. These two Class 0 protostars seem to be in very young evolutionary stages and still have to acquire the bulk of their final stellar masses. These results demonstrate that JWST enables unprecedented diagnostics of these first stages of the protostellar evolutionary phase.

### 248) [2410.08520](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08520v2): Compact [OIII] emission-line regions ("Green Seeds") in Hα emitters at Cosmic Noon from JWST Observations

<p> Nuo Chen, Kentaro Motohara, Lee Spitler, Matthew A. Malkan </p>
<p>
We present a rest-frame optical, spatially resolved analysis of more than 100 H&alpha; emitters (HAEs) at z~2.2 in the ZFOURGE-CDFS field using NIRCam imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). The ultra-deep, high-resolution data gives us maps of the resolved emission line regions of HAEs with stellar mass ranging from 10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub> to 10^10 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. An [OIII] emission-line map of each HAE is created from the flux excess in the F150W filter, leading to the discovery of a population of kiloparsec-scale compact emission line regions ("Green Seeds") with high equivalent widths (EW). We obtain a sample of 128 Green Seeds from 68 HAEs with rest-frame EW_[OIII]&gt;200&#8491;. Moreover, 17 of them have extremely large EW_[OIII]&gt;1000&#8491;, suggesting the possible Lyman continuum (LyC) leakage from these emission line regions. Embedded within the host galaxy, many Green Seeds correspond to UV star-forming clumps and H\sc ii regions, indicating elevated starburst activity in them, with specific star formation rates (sSFR) several times higher than that of the host galaxy. Based on theoretical frameworks, Green Seeds are expected to be formed through gravitational disk instability and/or galaxy mergers. Considering the stellar masses of Green Seeds, we speculate that high-mass Green Seeds may migrate toward the galactic center to build the central bulge, while low-mass Green Seeds are easily disrupted and short-lived. Besides, we propose that some Green Seeds could be the progenitors of globular clusters or ultracompact dwarf galaxies observed in the local universe.

### 249) [2410.07377](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07377v2): Constraining Reionization with Lyα Damping-Wing Absorption in Galaxy Spectra: A Machine Learning Model Based on Reionization Simulations

<p> Hyunbae Park, Intae Jung, Hidenobu Yajima, Jenny Sorce, Paul R. Shapiro, Kyungjin Ahn, Pierre Ocvirk, Romain Teyssier, Gustavo Yepes, Ilian T. Iliev, Joseph S. W. Lewis </p>
<p>
Recently, NIRSpec PRISM/CLEAR observations by JWST have begun providing rest-frame UV continuum measurements of galaxies at z≳7, revealing signatures of Ly&alpha; damping-wing (DW) absorption by the intergalactic medium (IGM). We develop a methodology to constrain the global ionization fraction of the IGM (Q_HII) using low-resolution spectra, employing the random forest classification (RFC) method. We construct mock spectra using the simulated galaxies and the IGM from the Cosmic Dawn II simulation and train RFC models to estimate Q_HII at the redshift of the source and to detect the presence of a damped Ly&alpha; absorber (DLA). We find that individual galaxy spectra with spectral bins between 1220 and 1270 &#8491; and with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 20 can place tight constraints on Q_HII, provided the UV continuum is accurately modeled. This method is particularly effective for the early phase of reionization (Q_HII&lt;50&percnt;), when the IGM opacity is high in the DW. As a demonstration, we apply our model to existing NIRSpec PRISM/CLEAR spectra, placing upper bounds of Q_HII=59.6&percnt;, 5.6&percnt;, and 18.5&percnt; at z=7.7,~9.4, and 10.6, respectively, with 68&percnt; confidence, though several modeling uncertainties remain to be discussed. These constraints favor late-starting reionization models, where ≳ 80&percnt; of the IGM is ionized after z=8. We conclude that high-SNR observations of carefully selected targets around z~7-9 can effectively constrain reionization models.

<p> Rogemar A. Riffel, Gabriel L. Souza-Oliveira, José Henrique Costa-Souza, Nadia L. Zakamska, Thaisa Storchi-Bergmann, Rogério Riffel, Marina Bianchin </p>
<p>
We use James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) medium-resolution spectrometer (MRS) observations of 3C 293 (UGC 8782), CGCG 012-070 and NGC 3884 to investigate the origin of the H<sub>2</sub> emission. These three nearby Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) hosts are known to present H<sub>2</sub> emission excess relative to star-forming galaxies, as traced by the H<sub>2</sub> S(3)/PAH_11.3&mu; m line ratio. We define the kinematically disturbed region (KDR) by the AGN and the virially dominated region (VDR) based on the H<sub>2</sub> line widths, using the W80 parameter. From the correlations between W80 and H<sub>2</sub> S(3)/PAH11.3&mu; m, as well as the higher H2 S(5)/H2 S(3) and [Fe II]5.34 &mu; m/PAH11.3&mu; m ratios and flatter power-law temperature distributions observed in the KDR, we conclude that the H<sub>2</sub> emission in the KDR is primarily driven by shock-heated gas. For 3C 293, the KDR is co-spatial with the radio core, indicating that the origin of the shocks is the interaction of the radio jet with the interstellar medium, which is also responsible for the observed molecular and ionized gas outflows in this source. The other galaxies are weak radio sources; however, due to the lack of high-resolution radio images, we cannot rule out low-power jets as the origin of the shock-heated H<sub>2</sub>. Our results indicate that the excess H<sub>2</sub> emission excess is associated to shock heating of the gas, generated by outflows or by the interaction of the radio jet with the ambient gas.

<p>
JWST has revealed an abundance of compact, red objects at z≈5-8 dubbed "little red dots" (LRDs), whose SEDs display a faint blue UV continuum followed by a steep rise in the optical. Despite extensive study of their characteristic V-shaped SEDs, the nature of LRDs remains unknown. We present a new analysis of the NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum of A2744-QSO1, a triply imaged LRD at z=7.04 from the UNCOVER survey. The spectrum shows a strong Balmer break and broad Balmer emission lines, both of which are difficult to explain with models invoking exclusively AGN or stellar contributions. Our fiducial model decomposes the spectrum into a post-starburst galaxy dominating the UV-optical continuum and a reddened AGN being sub-dominant at all wavelength and contributing at ~20&percnt; level. However, our most credible model infers a stellar mass of M<sub>&sext;</sub>≈ 4×10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> within a radius of r_e&lt;30 pc, driving its central density to the highest among observations to date. This high central density could be explained if A2744-QSO-1 is the early-forming core of a modern-day massive elliptical galaxy that later puffed up via the inside-out growth channel. The models also necessitate an unusually steep dust law to preserve the strong break strength, though this steepness may be explained by a deficit of large dust grains. It is also probable that these challenges reflect our ignorance of A2744-QSO1's true nature. Future variability and reverberation mapping studies could help disentangle the galaxy and AGN contribution to the continuum, and deeper redder observations could also unveil the dust properties in LRDs.

Combining Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array CO(2-1) mapping and JWST near- and mid-infrared imaging, we characterize the relationship between CO(2-1) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission at ~100 pc resolution in 70 nearby star-forming galaxies. Leveraging a new Cycle 2 JWST treasury program targeting nearby galaxies, we expand the sample size by more than an order of magnitude compared to previous ~100 pc resolution CO-PAH comparisons. Focusing on regions of galaxies where most of the gas is likely to be molecular, we find strong correlations between CO(2-1) and 3.3 um, 7.7 um, and 11.3 um PAH emission, estimated from JWST's F335M, F770W, and F1130W filters. We derive power law relations between CO(2-1) and PAH emission, which have indices in the range 0.8-1.3, implying relatively weak variations in the observed CO-to-PAH ratios across the regions that we study. We find that CO-to-PAH ratios and scaling relationships near HII regions are similar to those in diffuse sight lines. The main difference between the two types of regions is that sight lines near HII regions show higher intensities in all tracers. Galaxy centers, on the other hand, show higher overall intensities and enhanced CO-to-PAH ratios compared to galaxy disks. Individual galaxies show 0.19 dex scatter in the normalization of CO at fixed I_PAH, and this normalization anti-correlates with specific star formation rate (sSFR) and correlates with stellar mass. We provide a prescription that accounts for these galaxy-to-galaxy variations and represents our best current empirical predictor to estimate CO(2-1) intensity from PAH emission, which allows one to take advantage of JWST's excellent sensitivity and resolution to trace cold gas.

ASPIRE (A SPectroscopic survey of bIased halos in the Reionization Era) is a quasar legacy survey primarily using itJWST to target a sample of 25 z&gt;6 quasars with NIRCam slitless spectroscopy and imaging. The first study in this series found evidence of a strong overdensity of galaxies around J0305-3150, a luminous quasar at z=6.61, within a single NIRCam pointing obtained in JWST Cycle 1. Here, we present the first results of a JWST Cycle 2 mosaic that covers 35 arcmin<sup>2</sup> with NIRCam imaging/WFSS of the same field to investigate the spatial extent of the putative protocluster. The F356W grism data targets [OIII]+H&beta; at 5.3&lt;z&lt;7 and reveals a population of 124 line emitters down to a flux limit of 1.2×10^-18 erg s<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>. Fifty-three of these galaxies lie at 6.5&lt;z&lt;6.8 spanning 10 cMpc on the sky, corresponding to an overdensity within a 2500 cMpc^3 volume of 12.5 ± 2.6, anchored by the quasar. Comparing to the [OIII] luminosity function from the Emission line galaxies and Intergalactic Gas in the Epoch of Reionization (EIGER) project, we find a dearth of faint [OIII] emitters at log(L/erg s<sup>-1</sup>) &lt; 42.3, which we suggest is consistent with either bursty star formation causing galaxies to scatter around the grism detection limit or modest suppression from quasar feedback. While we find a strong filamentary overdensity of [OIII] emitters consistent with a protocluster, we suggest that we could be insensitive to a population of older, more massive Lyman-break galaxies with weak nebular emission on scales &gt;10 cMpc.

Among the remarkable strides made by JWST is the discovery of the earliest star clusters found to date. These have been proposed as early progenitors of globular clusters, which are known to come from the early stages of star formation in the Universe. This is an exciting development in modern astronomy, as it offers an opportunity to connect theoretical models of globular cluster formation to actual observations of these high-redshift structures. In this work, we aim to develop observational signatures of a star cluster formation route known as supersonically induced gas objects, which are dark matter-less gas clouds in the early Universe proposed as a potential origin of some globular clusters. For the first time, we follow the star formation process of these early Universe objects using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, including mechanical feedback. Our results suggest that the first dark matter-less star clusters are top-heavy, with a higher abundance of massive stars compared to today's clusters and extremely high stellar mass surface densities compared to the local Universe.

### 255) [2410.01437](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01437v2): AGN &ndash; host galaxy photometric decomposition using a fast, accurate and precise deep learning approach

<p> Berta Margalef-Bentabol, Lingyu Wang, Antonio La Marca, Vicente Rodriguez-Gomez </p>
<p>
Identifying active galactic nuclei (AGN) is extremely important for understanding galaxy evolution and its connection with the assembly of supermassive black holes (SMBH). With the advent of deep and high angular resolution imaging surveys such as those conducted with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), it is now possible to identify galaxies with a central point source out to the very early Universe. In this study, we develop a fast, accurate and precise method to identify galaxies which host AGNs and recover the intrinsic AGN contribution to the observed total light (f_AGN). We trained a deep learning (DL) based method Zoobot to estimate the fractional contribution of a central point source to the total light. Our training sample comprises realistic mock JWST images of simulated galaxies from the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We injected different amounts of the real JWST point spread function (PSF) models to represent galaxies with different levels of f_AGN. We analyse the performance of our method and compare it with results obtained from the traditional light profile fitting tool GALFIT. We find excellent performance of our DL method in recovering the injected AGN fraction f_AGN, both in terms of precision and accuracy. The mean difference between the predicted and true injected f_AGN is -0.002 and the overall root mean square error (RMSE) is 0.013. The relative absolute error (RAE) is 0.076 and the outlier (defined as predictions with RAE &gt;20%) fraction is 6.5%. In comparison, using GALFIT on the same dataset, we achieve a mean difference of -0.02, RMSE of 0.12, RAE of 0.19 and outlier fraction of 19%. We applied our trained DL model to real JWST observations and found that 33% of X-ray-selected AGN and 15% of MIR-selected AGN are also identified as AGN using a cut at f_AGN &gt; 0.1.

We report the first successful ALMA follow-up observations of a secure z &gt; 10 JWST-selected galaxy, by robustly detecting (6.6&sigma;) the [OIII]_88&mu; m  line in JADES-GS-z14-0 (hereafter GS-z14). The ALMA detection yields a spectroscopic redshift of z=14.1793±0.0007, and increases the precision on the prior redshift measurement of z=14.32_-0.20^+0.08 from NIRSpec by ≳180×. Moreover, the redshift is consistent with that previously determined from a tentative detection (3.6&sigma;) of CIII]_1907,1909 (z=14.178±0.013), solidifying the redshift determination via multiple line detections. We measure a line luminosity of L_[OIII]88 = (2.1 ± 0.5)×10^8 L<sub>&odot;</sub>, placing GS-z14 at the lower end, but within the scatter of, the local L_[OIII]88-star formation rate relation. No dust continuum from GS-z14 is detected, suggesting an upper limit on the dust-to-stellar mass ratio of &lt; 2 × 10^-3, consistent with dust production from supernovae with a yield y_d &lt; 0.3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Combining a previous JWST/MIRI photometric measurement of the [OIII]&lambda;&lambda;4959,5007\mathringA and H&beta; lines with Cloudy models, we find GS-z14 to be surprisingly metal-enriched (Z~0.05 - 0.2 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) a mere 300 Myr after the Big Bang. The detection of a bright oxygen line in GS-z14 thus reinforces the notion that galaxies in the early Universe undergo rapid evolution.

<p>
JADES-GS-z14-0 is the most distant spectroscopically confirmed galaxy yet, at z&gt;14. With a UV magnitude of -20.81, it is one of the most luminous galaxies at cosmic dawn and its half-light radius of 260 pc means that stars dominate the observed UV emission. We report ALMA detection of [OIII]88&mu;m line emission with a significance of 6.67&sigma; and at a frequency of 223.524~GHz, corresponding to a redshift of 14.1796±0.0007, which is consistent with the candidate CIII] line detected in the NIRSpec spectrum. At this spectroscopic redshift, the Lyman-&alpha; break identified with NIRSpec requires a damped Lyman-&alpha; absorber with a column density of log(N_HI/cm<sup>2</sup>)=21.96. The total [OIII]88&mu;m luminosity (log(L_[OIII]/L<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 8.3± 0.1) is fully consistent with the local L_[OIII]-SFR relation and indicating a gas-phase metallicity &gt;0.1~Z<sub>&odot;</sub>. Using ttprospector SED modeling and combining the ALMA data with JWST observations, we find Z=0.17~Z<sub>&odot;</sub> and a non-zero escape fraction of ionizing photons (~11&percnt;), which is necessary by the code to reproduce the UV spectrum. We measure an [O III]5007&#8491;/[O III]88&mu;m line flux ratio between 1 and 20, resulting in an upper limit to the electron density of roughly 700 cm^-3 assuming a single-cloud photoionization model. The [OIIII]88&mu;m emission line is spectrally resolved, with a FWHM of 100 km/s, resulting in a dynamical mass of log(M_dyn/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) = 9.0±0.2. When compared to the stellar mass, this value represents a conservative upper limit on the gas mass fraction, which ranges from 50&percnt; to 80&percnt;, depending on the assumed star formation history. Past radiation-driven outflows may have cleared the galaxy from the gas, reducing the gas fraction and thus increasing the escape fraction of ionizing photons.

### 258) [2409.16347](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16347v2): TRINITY VI: Connection between Galaxy Star Formation Rates and Supermassive Black Hole Accretion Rates from z=0-10

<p> Haowen Zhang, Peter Behroozi, Marta Volonteri, Joseph Silk, Xiaohui Fan, James Aird, Jinyi Yang, Feige Wang, Philip F. Hopkins </p>
<p>
We infer supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion rates and Eddington ratios as a function of SMBH/host galaxy mass and redshift with the empirical TRINITY model of dark matter halo&ndash;galaxy&ndash;SMBH connection. The galaxy&ndash;SMBH mass and growth rate connection from TRINITY matches galaxy observables from 0&lt;z&lt;13 and SMBH observables from 0&lt;z&lt;6.5. Key findings include: 1) the ratio between cosmic SMBH accretion rate and galaxy star formation rate stays constant at ~ 2× 10^-3 from z=0-4, and decreases by 2 orders of magnitude from z=4-10; 2) the average SMBH Eddington ratio &eta; increases towards higher redshifts, nearly reaching &eta;=1 at z~ 10; 3) at fixed redshift for z&lt;3, SMBHs/galaxies with higher masses have lower &eta;, consistent with AGN downsizing; 4) the average ratio of specific SMBH accretion rate (SBHAR) to average specific star formation rate (SSFR) is nearly mass-independent, with a value SBHAR/SSFR~ 1, which decreases slightly from z=10 to z=0; 5) similar to galaxies, SMBHs reach their peak efficiency to convert baryons into mass when host halos reach 10^12 M<sub>&odot;</sub>; 6) given galaxy and SMBH growth histories from TRINITY, the local descendants of 1&lt;z&lt;11 overmassive JWST AGNs will remain outliers from the local SMBH mass&ndash;galaxy mass relation. These findings combine to give a simple explanation for massive (10^9-10^10M<sub>&odot;</sub>) quasars at z&gt;6: at these redshifts, dark matter halos grow with an e-folding time of ~ 45 Myrs, driving similar growth rates in both galaxies and SMBHs.

### 259) [2409.15909](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15909v2): The emergence of galactic thin and thick discs across cosmic history

<p> Takafumi Tsukui, Emily Wisnioski, Joss Bland-Hawthorn, Ken Freeman </p>
<p>
Present-day disc galaxies often exhibit distinct thin and thick discs. The formation mechanisms of the two discs and the timing of their onset remain open questions. To address these questions, we select edge-on galaxies from flagship JWST programs and investigate their disc structures in rest-frame, near-infrared bands. For the first time, we identify thick and thin discs at cosmological distances, dating back over 10 Gyr, and investigate their decomposed structural properties. We classify galaxies into those that require two (i.e. thin and thick) discs and those well fitted by a single disc. Disc radial sizes and vertical heights correlate strongly with the total galaxy mass and/or disc mass, independent of cosmic time. The structure of the thick disc resembles discs found in single-disc galaxies, suggesting that galaxies form a thick disc first, followed by the subsequent formation of an embedded thin disc. The transition from single to double discs occurred around 8 Gyr ago in high-mass galaxies (10^9.75 - 10^11M<sub>&odot;</sub>), earlier than the transition which occurred 4 Gyr ago in low-mass galaxies (10^9.0 - 10^9.75M<sub>&odot;</sub>), indicating sequential formation proceeds in a "downsizing" manner. Toomre Q-regulated disc formation explains the delayed thin disc formation in low-mass galaxies, leading to the observed anti-correlation between the thick-to-thin disc mass ratio and the total galaxy mass. Despite the dominant sequential formation, observations suggest that thick discs may continue to build up mass alongside their thin-disc counterparts.

### 260) [2409.13848](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13848v3): Interpretation of SNIa and BAO cosmic probes results using a two-regions model of the universe

<p> Vincent Deledicque </p>
<p>
This article revisits the interpretation of cosmic probes such as SNIa and BAO under a two-regions model of the universe. Standard cosmological analyses assume homogeneity, yet observations are predominantly conducted in overdense regions where matter is clustered, potentially biasing conclusions about cosmic expansion. We refine an existing two-regions framework that accounts for both overdense and underdense areas, demonstrating that the apparent acceleration of the universe, typically attributed to dark energy, can emerge as a consequence of observational bias rather than a fundamental cosmological constant. By applying this model to SNIa and BAO measurements, we show that inhomogeneities can affect redshift and distance estimates in a way that mimics cosmic acceleration. This interpretation provides a natural resolution to the coincidence problem and offers an alternative explanation for the observed tensions in Hubble constant measurements. Additionally, it may shed light on the unexpectedly early formation of galaxies observed by JWST. These findings challenge the necessity of dark energy and suggest that the observed acceleration may be an artefact of the spatial distribution of matter rather than a true universal phenomenon.

### 261) [2409.13444](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13444v4): Investigating C-D out-of-plane vibrational modes in PAHs as a tool to study interstellar deuterium-containing PAHs

<p> Mridusmita Buragohain, Takashi Onaka, Amit Pathak, Akant Vats, Itsuki Sakon </p>
<p>
Previous as well as recent observations by ISO, Spitzer, AKARI, SOFIA, JWST etc. have revealed various characteristics of mid-infrared emission bands between 3-20 micron. Subsequently, several forms of organics including Polycylic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)/PAH-like molecules are proposed as carriers for these bands. Deuterated PAH (PAD) is one such substituted PAH, which is proposed as a potential candidate carrier for weak emission bands at 4.4 and 4.65 micron, detected towards few astronomical targets and are characteristics of aromatic and aliphatic C-D stretching modes in a PAD molecule, respectively. However, the 4.4 micron band is not widely detected. In order to validate PADs as carriers for mid-infrared emission bands, an additional alternative tool is crucial. If PAHs are deuterated, they should also possess an inherent signature from the C-D out-of-plane (C-Doop) vibrations, which are at the longer wavelength side. In this report, features due to C-Doop modes in PAHs bearing a single to multiple deuterium atoms are reported by performing quantum-chemical calculations. This paper reports that some of the C-Doop vibrations appear at the 14-19 micron range. Also, the strength of C-Doop modes is not proportional to the D/H ratio in PAHs. In addition, a moderate change in the spectra of deuterated PAHs is observed from that of the undeuterated counterparts, as deuteration would alternate the adjacency class of the C-H bonds and the symmetry of the molecule. We discuss the efficiency and usefulness of these bands to constrain the form of PAHs emitting mid-infrared emission bands.

<p>
We present a spatially resolved analysis of four star-forming galaxies at z = 4.44-5.64 using data from the JWST PRIMER and ALMA-CRISTAL surveys to probe the stellar and inter-stellar medium properties on the sub-kpc scale. In the 1-5 &mu;m JWST NIRCam imaging we find that the galaxies are composed of multiple clumps (between 2 and ~ 8) separated by ≃ 5 kpc, with comparable morphologies and sizes in the rest-frame UV and optical. Using BAGPIPES to perform pixel-by-pixel SED fitting to the JWST data we show that the SFR (≃ 25 M<sub>&odot;</sub>/yr) and stellar mass (log_10(M<sub>&sext;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) ≃ 9.5) derived from the resolved analysis are in close ( ≲ 0.3 dex) agreement with those obtained by fitting the integrated photometry. In contrast to studies of lower-mass sources, we thus find a reduced impact of outshining of the older (more massive) stellar populations in these normal z ≃ 5 galaxies. Our JWST analysis recovers bluer rest-frame UV slopes (&beta; ≃ -2.1) and younger ages (≃ 100 Myr) than archival values. We find that the dust continuum from ALMA-CRISTAL seen in two of these galaxies correlates, as expected, with regions of redder rest-frame UV slopes and the SED-derived A_V, as well as the peak in the stellar mass map. We compute the resolved IRX-&beta; relation, showing that the IRX is consistent with the local starburst attenuation curve and further demonstrating the presence of an inhomogeneous dust distribution within the galaxies. A comparison of the CRISTAL sources to those from the FirstLight zoom-in simulation of galaxies with the same M<sub>&sext;</sub> and SFR reveals similar age and colour gradients, suggesting that major mergers may be important in the formation of clumpy galaxies at this epoch.

We present the Red Unknowns: Bright Infrared Extragalactic Survey (RUBIES), providing JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of red sources selected across ~150 arcmin<sup>2</sup> from public JWST/NIRCam imaging in the UDS and EGS fields. RUBIES novel observing strategy offers a well-quantified selection function: the survey is optimised to reach high (&gt;70%) completeness for bright and red (F150W-F444W&gt;2) sources that are very rare. To place these rare sources in context, we simultaneously observe a reference sample of the 2&lt;z&lt;7 galaxy population, sampling sources at a rate that is inversely proportional to their number density in the 3D space of F444W magnitude, F150W-F444W colour, and photometric redshift. In total, RUBIES observes ~3000 targets across 1&lt;z<sub>phot</sub>&lt;10 with both the PRISM and G395M dispersers, and ~1500 targets at z<sub>phot</sub>&gt;3 using only the G395M disperser. The RUBIES data reveal a highly diverse population of red sources that span a broad redshift range (z<sub>spec</sub>~1-9), with photometric redshift scatter and outlier fraction that are 3 times higher than for similarly bright sources that are less red. This diversity is not apparent from the photometric SEDs. Only spectroscopy reveals that the SEDs encompass a mixture of galaxies with dust-obscured star formation, extreme line emission, a lack of star formation indicating early quenching, and luminous active galactic nuclei. As a first demonstration of our broader selection function we compare the stellar masses and rest-frame U-V colours of the red sources and our reference sample: red sources are typically more massive (M_*~10^10-11.5 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) across all redshifts. However, we find that the most massive systems span a wide range in U-V colour. We describe our data reduction procedure and data quality, and publicly release the reduced RUBIES data and vetted spectroscopic redshifts of the first half of the survey through the DJA.

<p>
A successful theory of star formation should predict the number of objects as a function of their mass produced through star-forming events. Previous studies in star-forming regions and the solar neighborhood identify a mass function increasing from the hydrogen-burning limit down to about 10 M_J. Theory predicts a limit to the fragmentation process, providing a natural turnover in the mass function down to the opacity limit of turbulent fragmentation thought to be near 1-10 M_J. Programs to date have not been sensitive enough to probe the hypothesized opacity limit of fragmentation. We present the first identification of a turnover in the initial mass function below 12 M_J within NGC 2024, a young star-forming region. With JWST/NIRCam deep exposures across 0.7-5 &mu;m, we identified several free floating objects down to roughly 3 M_J with sensitivity to 0.5 M_J. We present evidence for a double power law model increasing from about 60 M_J to roughly 12 M_J, consistent with previous studies, followed by a decrease down to 0.5 M_J. Our results support the predictions of star and brown dwarf formation theory, identifying the theoretical turnover in the mass function and suggest the fundamental limit of turbulent fragmentation near 3 M_J.

We report the spectroscopic discovery of a massive quiescent galaxy at z<sub>spec</sub>=7.29±0.01, just ~700 Myr after the Big Bang. RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 was selected from public JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging from the PRIMER survey and observed with JWST/NIRSpec as part of RUBIES. The NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum reveals one of the strongest Balmer breaks observed thus far at z&gt;6, no emission lines, but tentative Balmer and Ca absorption features, as well as a Lyman break. Simultaneous modeling of the NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum and NIRCam and MIRI photometry (spanning 0.9-18 &mu; m) shows that the galaxy formed a stellar mass of log(M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>)=10.23^+0.04_-0.04 before z~8, and ceased forming stars 50-100 Myr prior to the time of observation, resulting in log(sSFR/Gyr^-1)&lt;-1. We measure a small physical size of 209_-24^+33 pc, which implies a high stellar mass surface density within the effective radius of log(&Sigma;_*,e/M<sub>&odot;</sub> kpc^-2)=10.85_-0.12^+0.11 comparable to the highest densities measured in quiescent galaxies at z~2-5. The 3D stellar mass density profile of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 is remarkably similar to the central densities of local massive ellipticals, suggesting that at least some of their cores may have already been in place at z&gt;7. The discovery of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 has strong implications for galaxy formation models: the estimated number density of quiescent galaxies at z~7 is &gt;100× larger than predicted from any model to date, indicating that quiescent galaxies have formed earlier than previously expected.

The external environments surrounding molecular clouds vary widely across galaxies such as the Milky Way, and statistical samples of clouds are required to understand them. We present the Perseus Arm Molecular Survey (PAMS), a James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) survey combining new and archival data of molecular-cloud complexes in the outer Perseus spiral arm in ^12CO, ^13CO, and C^18O (J=3-2). With a survey area of ~8 deg<sup>2</sup>, PAMS covers well-known complexes such as W3, W5, and NGC 7538 with two fields at &ell; ≈ 110&deg; and &ell; ≈ 135&deg;. PAMS has an effective resolution of 17 arcsec, and rms sensitivity of T_mb = 0.7-1.0 K in 0.3 km s<sup>-1</sup> channels. Here we present a first look at the data, and compare the PAMS regions in the Outer Galaxy with Inner Galaxy regions from the CO Heterodyne Inner Milky Way Plane Survey (CHIMPS). By comparing the various CO data with maps of H<sub>2</sub> column density from Herschel, we calculate representative values for the CO-to-H<sub>2</sub> column-density X-factors, which are X_^12 CO (3-2)=4.0×10^20 and X_^13 CO (3-2)=4.0×10^21cm<sup>2</sup> (K km s<sup>-1</sup>)^-1 with a factor of 1.5 uncertainty. We find that the emission profiles, size-linewidth and mass-radius relationships of ^13CO-traced structures are similar between the Inner and Outer Galaxy. Although PAMS sources are slightly more massive than their Inner Galaxy counterparts for a given size scale, the discrepancy can be accounted for by the Galactic gradient in gas-to-dust mass ratio, uncertainties in the X-factors, and selection biases. We have made the PAMS data publicly available, complementing other CO surveys targeting different regions of the Galaxy in different isotopologues and transitions.

\requiremediawiki-texvcCosmic Reionisation commenced when ultraviolet (UV) radiation produced in the first galaxies began illuminating the cold, neutral gas that filled the primordial Universe. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have shown that surprisingly UV-bright galaxies were in place beyond redshift z = 14, when the Universe was less than 300   Myr old. Smooth turnovers of their UV continua have been interpreted as damping-wing absorption of Lyman-&alpha; (Ly&alpha;), the principal hydrogen transition. However, spectral signatures encoding crucial properties of these sources, such as their emergent radiation field, largely remain elusive. Here we report spectroscopy from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) of a galaxy at redshift z = 13.0 that reveal a singular, bright emission line unambiguously identified as Ly&alpha;, in addition to a smooth turnover. We observe an equivalent width of EW_Ly&alpha; &gt; 40   &#8491; (rest frame), previously only seen at z &lt; 9 where the intervening intergalactic medium (IGM) becomes increasingly ionised. Together with an extremely blue UV continuum, the unexpected Ly&alpha; emission indicates the galaxy is a prolific producer and leaker of ionising photons. This suggests massive, hot stars or an active galactic nucleus (AGN) have created an early reionised region to prevent complete extinction of Ly&alpha;, thus shedding new light on the nature of the earliest galaxies and the onset of Reionisation only 330   Myr after the Big Bang.

<p>
In this work, we spectroscopically select narrow-line AGN (NLAGN) among the ~ 300 publicly available medium-resolution spectra of the CEERS Survey. Using both traditional and newly identified emission line NLAGN diagnostics diagrams, we identified 52 NLAGN at 2≲ z≲ 9 on which we performed a detailed multiwavelength analysis. We also identified 4 new z≲ 2 broad-line AGN (BLAGN), in addition to the 8 previously reported high-z BLAGN. We found that the traditional BPT diagnostic diagrams are not suited to identify high-z AGN, while most of the high-z NLAGN are selected using the recently proposed AGN diagnostic diagrams based on the [OIII]&lambda;4363 auroral line or high-ionization emission lines. We compared the emission line velocity dispersion and the obscuration of the sample of NLAGN with those of the parent sample without finding significant differences between the two distributions, suggesting a population of AGN heavily buried and not significantly impacting the host galaxies' physical properties, as further confirmed by SED-fitting. The bolometric luminosities of the high-z NLAGNs selected in this work are well below those sampled by surveys before JWST, potentially explaining the weak impact of these AGN. Finally, we investigate the X-ray properties of the selected NLAGN and of the sample of high-z BLAGN. We find that all but 4 NLAGN are undetected in the deep X-ray image of the field, as well as all the high-z BLAGN. We do not obtain a detection even by stacking the undetected sources, resulting in an X-ray weakness of ~ 1-2 dex from what is expected based on their bolometric luminosities. To discriminate between a heavily obscured AGN scenario or an intrinsic X-ray weakness of these sources, we performed a radio stacking analysis, which did not reveal any detection leaving open the questions about the origin of the X-ray weakness.

### 269) [2408.13396](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13396v2): Unveiling galaxy chemical enrichment mechanisms out to z~8 from direct determination of O & Ar abundances from JWST/NIRSPEC spectroscopy

<p> Souradeep Bhattacharya, Magda Arnaboldi, Ortwin Gerhard, Chiaki Kobayashi, Kanak Saha </p>
<p>
Galaxy chemical enrichment mechanisms have primarily been constrained by [&alpha;/Fe] and [Fe/H] measurements of individual stars and integrated light from stellar populations. However such measurements are limited at higher redshifts (z&gt;1). Recently, we proposed an analogous diagram of the oxygen-to-argon abundance ratio, log(O/Ar), vs Ar abundance, 12+log(Ar/H), as a new diagnostic window for emission nebulae. In this Letter, using robust line flux measurements including temperature sensitive auroral lines, we present direct determination of O and Ar abundances in nine SFGs from JWST/NIRSPEC spectra at z~1.3-7.7, and two more with Keck/MOSFIRE spectra at z~2.2. Utilising their positions on the log(O/Ar) vs 12+log(Ar/H) plane, we present the first inference of galaxy chemical enrichment mechanisms from an ensemble of galaxies. The SFGs at z~1.3-3.4 are consistent with the solar neighbourhood galactic chemical enrichment models of the Milky Way Galaxy that are driven by core-collapse and Type Ia supernovae. Such enrichment mechanisms thus occur at least out to z~3.4. However, the highest-redshift SFGs (z~3.6-7.7) have very low log(O/Ar) values, revealing a different enrichment process at z&gt;3.6. Such low log(O/Ar) values may be caused by a rapid but intermittent star-formation and/or additional sources. The new diagnostic window for SFGs enables us to reveal the unique fingerprints of galaxy chemical enrichment out to cosmic dawn.

### 270) [2408.09517](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09517v2): Extreme Metallicity Dwarf Galaxies in IllustrisTNG

<p> Timothy Carleton, Jacqueline Monkiewicz </p>
<p>
The use of extremely metal-deficient dwarf galaxies (XMDs) as nearby analogs for high-redshift protogalaxies is generating renewed interest due to recent JWST observations studying these protogalaxies. However, the existence of a population of unenriched galaxies at z~0 raises fundamental questions about how galaxies with such pristine gas reservoirs could be formed. To address these questions we study XMDs in the IllustrisTNG simulation. We find that XMDs at z=0 are not relics of the first galaxies, but dwarf galaxies that experience a dramatic ~0.3 dex drop in their gas-phase metallicity in the past few Gyr. We investigate possible causes of this drop in metallicity including high gas fractions, outflow efficiency or inflow/outflow rates, unique environments, pristine inflow metallicity, and inflow/SFR interactions. Of these, we find that inflow/outflow interactions, parameterized by the cumulative regional SFR experienced by inflows, has the strongest correlation with dwarf galaxy metallicity and XMD formation. In other words, inefficient gas enrichment during the short time between its accretion from the CGM and the initiation of star formation is the most important cause of XMD formation in the simulation. Observationally, we identify differences in star formation history between XMDs and non-XMDs (with XMDs having significantly decreased star formation rates on 1-5 Gyr timescales) and differences in galaxy size (with XMDs having a more extended young stellar population) as the primary differences between the two populations. These results highlight the importance of inflow enrichment efficiency as a possible driver of dwarf galaxy metallicities.

<p> Wendy L. Freedman, Barry F. Madore, In Sung Jang, Taylor J. Hoyt, Abigail J. Lee, Kayla A. Owens </p>
<p>
We present the latest results from the Chicago-Carnegie Hubble Program (\cchp) to measure the Hubble constant, using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The overall program aims to calibrate three independent methods: (1) Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) stars, (2) JAGB (J-Region Asymptotic Giant Branch) stars, and (3) Cepheids. To date, our program includes 10 nearby galaxies, hosting 11 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) suitable for measuring the Hubble constant (H_0). It also includes the galaxy NGC 4258, whose geometric distance provides the zero-point calibration. In this paper we discuss our results from the TRGB and JAGB methods. Our current best (highest precision) estimate is H_0 = 70.39 ± 1.22 (stat) ± 1.33 (sys) ± 0.70 (&sigma;_SN), based on the TRGB method alone, with a total of 24 SN Ia calibrators from both HST and JWST data. Based on our new JWST data only, and tying into SNe Ia, we find values of H_0 = 68.81 ± 1.79 (stat) ± 1.32 (sys) for the TRGB, and H_0 = 67.80 ± 2.17 (stat) ± 1.64 (sys) km/s/Mpc for the JAGB method. The distances measured using the TRGB and the JAGB method agree, on average, at a level better than 1%, and with the SH0ES Cepheid distances at just over the 1% level. Our results are consistent with the current standard LambdaCDM model, without the need for the inclusion of additional new physics. Future JWST data will be required to increase the precision and accuracy of the local distance scale.

We present the design and observations of low resolution JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy from the Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) Cycle 1 JWST Treasury program. Targets are selected using JWST/NIRCam photometry from UNCOVER and other programs, and cover a wide range of categories and redshifts to ensure the legacy value of the survey. These categories include the first galaxies at z≳10, faint galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization (z~6-8), high redshift AGN (z≳6), Population III star candidates, distant quiescent and dusty galaxies (1≲z≲ 6), and filler galaxies sampling redshift&ndash;color&ndash;magnitude space from z~0.1-13. Seven NIRSpec MSA masks across the extended Abell 2744 cluster were observed, along with NIRCam parallel imaging in 8 filters (F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M, F444W, F480M) over a total area of ~26 arcmin<sup>2</sup>, overlapping existing HST coverage from programs including the Hubble Frontier Fields and BUFFALO. We successfully observed 553 objects down to m_F444W~30AB, and by leveraging mask overlaps, we reach total on-target exposure times ranging from 2.4-16.7h. We demonstrate the success rate and distribution of confirmed redshifts, and also highlight the rich information revealed by these ultradeep spectra for a subset of our targets. An updated lens model of Abell 2744 is also presented, including 14 additional spectroscopic redshifts and finding a total cluster mass of M_SL=(2.1±0.3)×10^15 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. We publicly release reduced 1D and 2D spectra for all objects observed in Summer 2023 along with a spectroscopic redshift catalog and the updated lens model of the cluster (https://jwst-uncover.github.io/DR4.html).

### 273) [2408.03474](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03474v3): The Chicago-Carnegie Hubble Program: The JWST J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) Extragalactic Distance Scale

<p> Abigail J. Lee, Wendy L. Freedman, Barry F. Madore, In Sung Jang, Kayla A. Owens, Taylor J. Hoyt </p>
<p>
The J-region asymptotic giant branch (JAGB) method is a new standard candle based on the constant luminosities of carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars in the J band. The JAGB method is independent of the Cepheid and TRGB distance indicators. Therefore, we can leverage it to both cross-check Cepheid and TRGB distances for systematic errors and use it to measure an independent local Hubble constant. The JAGB method also boasts a number of advantages in measuring distances relative to the TRGB and Cepheids, several of which are especially amplified when combined with JWST's revolutionary resolving power. First, JAGB stars are 1 mag brighter in the NIR than the TRGB, and can be discovered from single-epoch NIR photometry unlike Cepheids which require congruent optical imaging in at least 12 epochs. Thus, JAGB stars can be used to measure significantly farther distances than both the TRGB stars and Cepheids using the same amount of observing time. Further advantages include: JAGB stars are easily identified solely via their colors and magnitudes, dust extinction is reduced in near-infrared observations, and JAGB stars are ubiquitous in all galaxies with intermediate-age populations. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that identifies the optimal location in a galaxy for applying the JAGB method, so as to minimize effects from crowding. We then deploy this algorithm in JWST NIRCam imaging of seven SN Ia host galaxies to measure their JAGB distances, undertaking a completely blind analysis. The zero-point of this JAGB distance scale is set in the water mega-maser galaxy NGC 4258. In our CCHP overview paper Freedman et al. (2025), we apply the JAGB distances measured in this paper to the Carnegie Supernova Program (CSP) SNe Ia sample, measuring a Hubble constant of H0 = 67.80 +/- 2.17 (stat) +/- 1.64 (sys) km/s/Mpc.

<p>
In this study, we present a detailed multiphase analysis of HZ4, a main-sequence star-forming galaxy at z ~ 5.5, known for being a turbulent rotating disk and having a detection of a [CII] outflow in the ALMA observations. We exploit JWST/NIRSpec observations in the integral field spectroscopy mode with low- and high-spectral resolution that allow us for the first time to spatially resolve the rest-frame UV and optical emission of the galaxy to investigate the galaxy properties. In particular, the high-resolution dataset allows us to study the kinematics of the ionized gas phase, and the conditions of the interstellar medium, such as the excitation mechanism, dust attenuation, and metallicity. The lower-spectral resolution observations allow us to study the continuum emission and infer the stellar populations' ages and properties. Our findings suggest that HZ4 is a galaxy merger rather than a rotating disk as previously inferred from lower resolution [CII] data. The merger is associated with an extended broad, blueshifted emission, potentially indicative of an outflow originating from a region of intense star formation and extending up to 4 kpc. In light of these new observations we reanalyzed the ALMA data to compare the multiphase gas properties. If we interpret the broad components seen in [CII] and [OIII]&lambda;5007\.A as outflows, the neutral and ionized components are co-spatial, the mass loading factor of the ionized phase is significantly lower than that of the neutral phase, aligning with trends observed in multi-phase systems at lower redshifts. Nonetheless, additional observations and larger statistical samples are essential to determine the role of mergers and outflows in the early Universe and to clarify the origin of the broad emission components observed in this system.

<p>
The majority of low-mass (log_10 M_*/M<sub>&odot;</sub>=9-10) galaxies at high redshift (z&gt;1) appear elongated in projection. We use JWST-CEERS observations to explore the role of gravitational lensing in this puzzle. The typical galaxy-galaxy lensing shear &gamma;~1&percnt; is too low to explain the predominance of elongated early galaxies with ellipticity e≈0.6. However, non-parametric quantile regression with Bayesian Additive Regression Trees reveals hints of an excess of tangentially-aligned source-lens pairs with &gamma;&gt;10&percnt;. On larger scales, we also find evidence for weak lensing shear. We rule out the null hypothesis of randomly oriented galaxies at ≳99&percnt; significance in multiple NIRCam chips, modules and pointings. The number of such regions is small and attributable to chance, but coherent alignment patterns suggest otherwise. On the chip scale, the average complex ellipticity &langle; e&rangle;~10&percnt; is non-negligible and beyond the level of our PSF uncertainties. The shear variance &langle;&gamma;^2&rangle;~10^-3 is an order of magnitude above the conventional weak lensing regime but is more sensitive to PSF systematics, intrinsic alignments, cosmic variance and other biases. Taking it as an upper limit, the maximum implied "cosmic shear'' is only a few percent and cannot explain the elongated shapes of early galaxies. The alignments themselves may arise from lensing by a protocluster or filament at z~0.75 where we find an overabundance of massive lens galaxies. We recommend a weak lensing search for overdensities in "blank'' deep fields with JWST and the Roman Space Telescope.

### 276) [2407.17059](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17059v2): Fuzzy Dark Matter Constraints from the Hubble Frontier Fields

<p> Jackson Sipple, Adam Lidz, Daniel Grin, Guochao Sun </p>
<p>
In fuzzy dark matter (FDM) cosmologies, the dark matter consists of ultralight bosons (m≲10^-20 eV). The astrophysically large de Broglie wavelengths of such particles hinder the formation of low-mass dark matter halos. This implies a testable prediction: a corresponding suppression in the faint-end of the ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF) of galaxies. Notably, recent estimates of the faint-end UVLF at z~5-9 in the Hubble Frontier Fields, behind foreground lensing clusters, probe up to five magnitudes fainter than typical ("blank-field") regions. These measurements thus far disfavor prominent turnovers in the UVLF at low luminosity, implying bounds on FDM. We fit a semi-empirical model to these and blank-field UVLF data, including the FDM particle mass as a free parameter. This fit excludes cases where the dark matter is entirely a boson of mass m&lt;1.5×10^-21 eV (with 2&sigma; confidence). We also present a less stringent bound deriving solely from the requirement that the total observed abundance of galaxies, integrated over all luminosities, must not exceed the total halo abundance in FDM. This more model-agnostic bound disfavors m&lt;5×10^-22 eV (2&sigma;). We forecast that future UVLF measurements from JWST lensing fields may probe masses several times larger than these bounds, although we demonstrate this is subject to theoretical uncertainties in modeling the FDM halo mass function.

### 277) [2407.10900](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10900v2): Accelerated by Dark Matter: a High-redshift Pathway to Efficient Galaxy-scale Star Formation

<p> Michael Boylan-Kolchin </p>
<p>
In the local Universe, star formation is typically inefficient both globally and when considered as the fraction of gas converted into stars per local free-fall time. An important exception to this inefficiency is regions of high gravitational accelerations g, or equivalently surface densities &Sigma; = g/(&pi; G), where stellar feedback is insufficient to overcome the self-gravity of dense gas clouds. In this paper, I explore whether dark matter can play an analogous role in providing the requisite accelerations on the scale of entire galaxies in the early cosmos. The key insight is that characteristic accelerations in dark matter halos scale as (1+z)^2 at fixed halo mass. I show this is sufficient to make dark matter the source of intense accelerations that might induce efficient star formation on galactic scales at cosmic dawn in sufficiently massive halos. The mass characterizing this regime scales as (1+z)^-6 and corresponds to a relatively constant comoving number density of n(&gt;\!M_vir) ≈ 10^-4 Mpc^-3 at z ≳ 8. For somewhat rarer halos, this model predicts stellar masses of M<sub>&sext;</sub> ~ 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub> can form in regions that end up with sizes O(100 pc) over 40 Myr time-scales at z≈ 12-14; these numbers compare well to measurements for some of the brightest galaxies at that epoch from James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations. Dark matter and standard cosmological evolution may therefore be crucial for explaining the surprisingly high levels of star formation in the early Universe revealed by JWST.

<p>
We analyse ultra-deep JWST observations of the galaxy JADES-GS-z9-0 at z = 9.4327, and derive detailed stellar and interstellar medium (ISM) properties of this luminous (MUV=-20.43) high-redshift system. Complementary information from NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec (both low- and medium-resolution) spectroscopy reveal a compact system (Re ~110 pc) characterised by a steeply rising star formation history, which is reflected in the inferred young stellar age (t ~ 3 Myr, light-weighted), high star-formation rate surface density (&Sigma;SFR ~ 72 M yr-1 kpc-2), high ionisation parameter (log(U) ~ -1.5), low metallicity (12+log(O/H) ~ 7.5), and low carbon-over-oxygen abundance ([C/O] = -0.64). Leveraging the detection of N iii]1750 we derive nitrogen-over-oxygen abundance ([N/O] ~ 0) higher than the plateau followed by low-redshift galaxies of similar metallicity, possibly revealing the imprint from (very) massive stars on the ISM enrichment and favouring a top-heavy Initial Mass Function (IMF) scenario. Massive stars powering a hard radiation field are also required to explain the rest-frame UV line ratios, though the presence of the high-excitation [Ne v]&lambda;3426 emission line possibly hints at additional ionization from an AGN. We also report the tentative detection of Ly&alpha; emission in the G140M spectrum, shifted by ~450 km/s redward of the systemic redshift. Combined with a modelling of the Ly&alpha; spectral break, we rule out the presence of very high column densities of neutral gas pertaining to local absorbers, as well as any extended surrounding ionised bubble, suggesting that JADES-GS-z9-0 has not yet significantly contributed to cosmic Reionization.

<p>
We present JWST NIRSpec observations in IFS mode of the galaxy GS5001 at redshift z=3.47, the central member of a candidate protocluster in the GOODS-S field. The data cover a field of view (FoV) of 4''×4'' (~30×30~kpc<sup>2</sup>) and were obtained as part of the GA-NIFS GTO program. The observations include both high (R~2700) and low (R~100) spectral resolution data, spanning the rest-frame wavelength ranges 3700-6780A and 1300-11850A, respectively. We analyse the spatially resolved ionised gas kinematics and interstellar medium properties, including obscuration, gas metallicity, excitation, ionisation parameter, and electron density. In addition to the main galaxy (GS5001), the NIRSpec FoV covers three components in the south, with velocities blue-shifted by -150 km/s with respect to the main galaxy, and another source in the north redshifted by ~200 km/s. Optical line ratio diagnostics indicate star formation ionisation and electron densities of ~500 cm^-3 across all sources in the FoV. The gas-phase metallicity in the main galaxy is 12+log(O/H) = 8.45±0.04, and slightly lower in the companions (12+log(O/H) = 8.34-8.42), consistent with the mass-metallicity relation at z~3. We find peculiar line ratios (high log [NII]/H&alpha;, low log [OIII]/H&beta;) in the northern part of GS5001. These could be attributed to either higher metallicity, or to shocks resulting from the interaction of the main galaxy with the northern source. We identify a spatially resolved outflow in the main galaxy, with an extension of about 3 kpc. We find maximum outflow velocities of ~400 km/s, an outflow mass of (1.7±0.4)× 10^8 M<sub>&odot;</sub>, a mass outflow rate of 23±5 M<sub>&odot;</sub> yr^-1 and a mass loading factor of 0.23. These properties are compatible with star formation being the driver of the outflow.

<p>
(Abridged) The strong lensing models of galaxy clusters rely on the number and quality of multiple images with spectroscopic redshifts. We present an updated strong lensing model of MACS J0416.1-2403 with the largest sample of multiple images with spectroscopic redshifts in a galaxy cluster field to date. Furthermore, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of JWST, particularly its NIRISS camera, for strong lensing studies. We used NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec and NIRISS spectroscopy from the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). The cluster mass model was constrained using Lenstool software. Our new dataset, which we used for constraining the lens model, comprises 303 secure multiple images with spectroscopic redshifts from 111 background sources and includes 95 systems with previously known MUSE redshift and 16 systems (with 46 multiple images) for which we obtained spectroscopic redshift for the first time using NIRISS and NIRSpec spectroscopy. Three of the spectroscopic systems were not identified by previous JWST studies. The total number of secure spectroscopic systems is more than 20% higher than in the previous strong lensing studies of this cluster. The model can reproduce multiple images with the root-mean-square distance of ~ 0.52''. We also provide a full catalogue with 415 multiple images, including less reliable candidates. In total, we provide 15 new multiple-image system candidates (with 38 multiple images) not reported in previous studies. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of JWST, particularly NIRISS, for obtaining spectroscopic redshifts of multiple images. As NIRISS F115W, F150W, and F200W grism spectroscopy captures at least two of the [OII], [OIII] and H&alpha; lines at 1 &lt; z &lt; 3 (a redshift range particularly relevant for strong lensing studies) without target pre-selection, it complements MUSE and NIRSpec observations extremely well.

<p> Emmanuel Durodola, Fabio Pacucci, Ryan C. Hickox </p>
<p>
JWST is revolutionizing our view of the early Universe by pushing the boundaries of detectable galaxies and black holes in redshift (upward) and mass (downward). The Little Red Dots (LRDs), detected by several surveys at z &gt; 4, present a significant interpretational challenge, as their Spectral Energy Distributions (SED) can mimic both AGN and stellar population templates. This study analyzes 19 LRDs from the JADES survey, utilizing NIRCam and MIRI photometry. By performing SED fitting across a vast parameter space, we explore a broad range of AGN fractions, defined as the ratio of the monochromatic luminosities (AGN, galaxy, and dust) over a specified wavelength range, 0.4 - 0.7 &mu; m rest-frame. We find that 17 of the 19 LRDs investigated are consistent with having significant AGN contributions, with best-fitting AGN fractions ranging between 20% and 70%, while one galaxy shows a low AGN contribution (2%) and another appears to be purely star-forming. Moreover, assuming these LRDs do indeed host AGN, we can place limits on their black hole masses using the inferred AGN bolometric luminosities and adopting the Eddington limit. We find that, independent of the specific AGN fraction adopted, the LRDs' black holes are significantly overmassive relative to their host galaxies (by ~ 1 dex, and up to ~ 4 dex in the most extreme cases) compared to the local M<sub>&bull;</sub> - M<sub>&sext;</sub> relation. The presence of overmassive black holes in the high-z Universe may provide the strongest evidence yet of heavy black hole seeding occurring during the cosmic dark ages.

<p>
"Godzilla" is a peculiar object within the gravitationally lensed Sunburst Arc at z=2.37. Despite being very bright, it appears in only one of the twelve lensed images of the source galaxy, and shows exotic spectroscopic properties not found in any other clumps. We use JWST's unique combination of spatial resolution and spectroscopic sensitivity to provide a unified, coherent explanation of the physical nature of Godzilla. We measure fluxes and kinematic properties of rest-optical emission lines in Godzilla and surrounding regions. Using standard line ratio-based diagnostic methods in combination with NIRCam imaging and ground based rest-UV spectra, we characterize Godzilla and its surroundings. Among around 60 detected lines, we find a cascade of strong O I lines pumped by intense Ly&beta; emission, as well as Ly&alpha;-pumped rest-optical Fe II lines, reminiscent of the Weigelt blobs in the local LBV star Eta Carinae. Spectra and images of Godzilla and two faint adjacent images, and the detection of a low-surface brightness foreground galaxy in the NIRCam data, support the interpretation that Godzilla is an extremely magnified object due to the alignment with lensing caustics. We find that Godzilla is part of a previously identified clump, comprising ~10 - 25 % of it, with magnifications in the range of ≈600-25,000 depending on the models and images in comparison. The unique O I source in Godzilla is well explained by a non-erupting LBV accompanied by a hotter companion and/or gas condensations exposed to more intense radiation compared to the Weigelt blobs. If Godzilla is confirmed to contain an LBV star, it expands the distance to the furthest known LBV from a dozen Mpc to several Gpc.

### 283) [2405.06520](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06520v2): Origin and Evolution of Angular Momentum of Class II Disks

<p> Veli-Matti Pelkonen, Paolo Padoan, Mika Juvela, Troels Haugbølle, Åke Nordlund </p>
<p>
Context: While class II pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars have already accreted most of their mass, the continued inflow of fresh material via Bondi-Hoyle accretion acts as an additional mass reservoir for their circumstellar disks. This may explain the observed accretion rates of PMS stars, as well as observational inconsistencies in the mass and angular momentum balance of their disks. Aims: Using a new simulation that reproduces the stellar initial mass function (IMF), we want to quantify the role of Bondi-Hoyle accretion in the formation of class II disks, as well as address the prospect of its observational detection with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Methods: We studied the mass and angular momentum of the accreting gas using passively advected tracer particles in the simulation, and we carried out radiative transfer calculations of near-infrared scattering to generate synthetic JWST observations of Bondi-Hoyle trails of PMS stars. Results: Gas accreting on class II PMS stars approximately 1 Myr after their formation has enough mass and angular momentum to strongly affect the evolution of the preexisting disks. The accreted angular momentum is large enough to also explain the observed size of class II disks. The orientation of the angular momentum vector can differ significantly from that of the previously accreted gas, which may result in a significant disk warping or misalignment. We also predict that JWST observations of class II stars will be able to detect Bondi-Hoyle trails with a 80%-100% success rate with only a 2 min exposure time, depending on the filter, if stars with both an accretion rate M&#775; &gt; 5e-10 Msol/yr and a luminosity L &gt; 0.5 Lsol are selected.

<p> Ricardo Chávez, Roberto Terlevich, Elena Terlevich, Ana González-Morán, David Fernández-Arenas, Fabio Bresolin, Manolis Plionis, Spyros Basilakos, Ricardo Amorín, Mario Llerena </p>
<p>
Over twenty years ago, Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) observations revealed an accelerating Universe expansion, suggesting a significant dark energy presence, often modelled as a cosmological constant,  &Lambda; . Despite its pivotal role in cosmology, the standard &Lambda;CDM model remains largely underexplored in the redshift range between distant SNIa and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). This study harnesses the James Webb Space Telescope's advanced capabilities to extend the Hubble flow mapping across an unprecedented redshift range, from  z ≈ 0  to  z ≈ 7.5 . Using a dataset of 231 HII galaxies and extragalactic HII regions, we employ the L-&sigma; relation that correlates the luminosity of Balmer lines with their velocity dispersion, to define a competitive technique for measuring cosmic distances. This approach allows the mapping of the Universe expansion history over more than 12 billion years, covering 95&percnt; of its age. Our analysis, using Bayesian inference, constrains the parameter space  &lbrace;  h, &Omega;_m, w_0 &rbrace;  =  &lbrace;  0.731±0.039, 0.302^+0.12_-0.069, -1.01^+0.52_-0.29 &rbrace;  (statistical) for a flat Universe. Our results provide new insights into cosmic evolution and imply a lack of change in the photo-kinematical properties of the young massive ionizing clusters in HII galaxies across most of the history of the Universe.

### 285) [2404.11071](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11071v5): High-redshift, small-scale tests of ultralight axion dark matter using Hubble and Webb galaxy UV luminosities

<p> Harrison Winch, Keir K. Rogers, Renée Hložek, David J. E. Marsh </p>
<p>
We calculate the abundance of UV-bright galaxies in the presence of ultralight axion (ULA) dark matter (DM), finding that axions suppress their formation with a non-trivial dependence on redshift and luminosity. We set limits on axion DM using both Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) and UV luminosity function (UVLF) data. We exclude a single axion as all the DM for m_ax &lt; 10^-21.6 eV and limit axions with -26 &lt; log( m_ax/eV) &lt; -23 to be less than 22&percnt; of the DM (both limits at 95&percnt; credibility). These limits use UVLF measurements from 24,000 sources from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) that probe small-scale structure at redshifts 4 &lt; z &lt; 10. We marginalize over a parametric model that connects halo mass and UV luminosity that has been shown to match hydrodynamical simulations. Our results bridge a window in axion mass and DM fraction previously unconstrained by cosmological data, between large-scale CMB and galaxy clustering and the small-scale Lyman-&alpha; forest. These high-z measurements provide a powerful consistency check of low-z tests of axion DM, which include the recent hint for a sub-dominant ULA DM fraction in Lyman-&alpha; forest data. We also consider a sample of 25 spectroscopically-confirmed high-z galaxies from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We find that these data are consistent with the HST UVLF assuming &Lambda;CDM and our flexible parametric model of UV luminosity. Combining HST and JWST UVLF data does not improve our constraints beyond HST alone, but future JWST measurements have the potential to improve these results significantly. We also find an excess of low-mass halos (&lt; 10^9 M<sub>&odot;</sub>) at z &lt; 3, which could be probed by sub-galactic structure probes (e.g., stellar streams, satellite galaxies and strong lensing).

<p>
We present JWST NIRCam imaging of B14-65666 ("Big Three Dragons"), a bright Lyman-break galaxy system (M_UV=-22.5 mag) at z=7.15. The high angular resolution of NIRCam reveals the complex morphology of two galaxy components: galaxy E has a compact core (E-core), surrounded by diffuse, extended, rest-frame optical emission, which is likely to be tidal tails; and galaxy W has a clumpy and elongated morphology with a blue UV slope (&beta;_UV=-2.2±0.1). The flux excess, F356W-F444W, peaks at the E-core (1.05^+0.08_-0.09 mag), tracing the presence of strong [OIII] 4960,5008 &#8491; emission. ALMA archival data show that the bluer galaxy W is brighter in dust continua than the redder galaxy E, while the tails are bright in [OIII] 88 &mu; m. The UV/optical and sub-mm SED fitting confirms that B14-65666 is a major merger in a starburst phase as derived from the stellar mass ratio (3:1 to 2:1) and the star-formation rate, ≃1 dex higher than the star-formation main sequence at the same redshift. The galaxy E is a dusty (A_V=1.2±0.1 mag) starburst with a possible high dust temperature (≥63-68 K). The galaxy W would have a low dust temperature (≤27-33 K) or patchy stellar-and-dust geometry, as suggested from the infrared excess (IRX) and &beta;_UV diagram. The high optical-to-FIR [OIII] line ratio of the E-core shows its lower gas-phase metallicity (≃0.2-0.4 Z<sub>&odot;</sub>) than the galaxy W. These results agree with a scenario where major mergers disturb morphology and induce nuclear dusty starbursts triggered by less-enriched inflows. B14-65666 shows a picture of complex stellar buildup processes during major mergers in the epoch of reionization.

We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Integral Field Spectrograph observations of NGC 3256, a local infrared-luminous late-stage merging system with two nuclei roughly 1kpc apart, both of which have evidence of cold molecular outflows. Using JWST/NIRSpec and MIRI datasets, we investigate this morphologically complex system on spatial scales of &lt;100pc, where we focus on the warm molecular H<sub>2</sub> gas surrounding the nuclei. We detect collimated outflowing warm H<sub>2</sub> gas originating from the southern nucleus, though we do not find significant outflowing H<sub>2</sub> gas surrounding the northern nucleus. We measure maximum intrinsic outflow velocities of ~1,000kms<sup>-1</sup>, which extend out to a distance of 0.7kpc. Based on H<sub>2</sub> S(7)/S(1) ratios, we find a larger fraction of warmer gas near the S nucleus, which decreases with increasing distance from the nucleus, signifying the southern nucleus as a primary source of H<sub>2</sub> heating. The gas mass of the warm H<sub>2</sub> outflow component is estimated to be M_warm,out=(1.4±0.2)×10^6M<sub>&odot;</sub>, as much as 6&percnt; of the cold H<sub>2</sub> mass estimated using ALMA CO data. The outflow time scale is about 7×10^5yr, resulting in a mass outflow rate M&#775; _warm,out=2.0±0.8M<sub>&odot;</sub>yr^-1 and kinetic power P_warm,out~4×10^41ergs<sup>-1</sup>. Lastly, regions within our 3.0"x3.0" NIRSpec data where the outflowing gas reside show high [Fe II]/Pa&beta; and H<sub>2</sub>/Br&gamma; line ratios, indicate enhanced mechanical heating caused by the outflows. The fluxes and ratios of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) in these regions are not significantly different compared to those elsewhere in the disk, suggesting the outflows may not significantly alter the PAH ionization state or grain size.

The search for dual supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is of immense interest in modern astrophysics. Galaxy mergers may fuel and produce SMBH pairs. Actively accreting SMBH pairs are observed as a dual quasar, which are vital probes of SMBH growth. Dual quasars at cosmic noon are not well characterized. Gaia observations have enabled a novel technique to identify dual quasars at kpc scales, based on the small jitters of the light centroid as the two quasars vary stochastically. We present the first detailed study of a z=2.17, 0.46'', 3.8 kpc separation dual quasar, J0749+2255, using JWST/NIRSpec integral field unit spectroscopy. Identified by Gaia, J0749+2255 is one of the most distant, small separation dual quasars known. We detect the faint ionized gas of the host galaxy, traced by the narrow Ha emission. Line ratios indicate ionization from the two quasars and from intense star formation. Spectral analysis of the two quasars suggests that they have similar black hole properties, hinting at the possible synchronized accretion activity or lensed quasar images. Surprisingly, the ionized gas kinematics suggest a rotating disk rather than a disturbed system expected in a major gas-rich galaxy merger. Numerical simulations show that this is a plausible outcome of a major gas-rich galaxy merger several tens of Myr before coalescence. Whether J0749+2255 reflects an interesting phase of dual quasar evolution or is a lensed quasar remains unclear. Thus, this study underscores the challenges in definitively distinguishing between a dual and lensed quasars, with observations supporting either scenario.

We utilize deep JWST NIRCam observations for the first direct constraints on the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function (GSMF) at z&gt;10. Our EPOCHS v1 sample includes 1120 galaxy candidates at 6.5&lt;z&lt;13.5 taken from a consistent reduction and analysis of publicly available deep JWST NIRCam data covering the PEARLS, CEERS, GLASS, JADES GOOD-S, NGDEEP, and SMACS0723 surveys, totalling 187 arcmin<sup>2</sup>. We investigate the impact of SED fitting methods, assumed star formation histories (SFH), dust laws, and priors on galaxy masses and the resultant GSMF. Whilst our fiducial GSMF agrees with the literature at z&lt;13.5, we find that the assumed SFH model has a large impact on the GSMF and stellar mass density (SMD), finding a 0.75~dex increase in the SMD at z=10.5 between a flexible non-parametric and standard parametric SFH. Overall, we find a flatter SMD evolution at z ≥ 9 than some studies predict, suggesting a rapid buildup of stellar mass in the early Universe. We find no incompatibility between our results and those of standard cosmological models, as suggested previously, although the most massive galaxies may require a high star formation efficiency. We find that the "Little Red Dot" galaxies dominate the z=7 GSMF at high-masses, necessitating a better understanding of the relative contributions of AGN and stellar emission. We show that assuming a theoretically motivated top-heavy IMF reduces stellar mass by 0.5~dex without affecting fit quality, but our results remain consistent with existing cosmological models with a standard IMF.

<p>
The JWST discovery of "little red dots'' (LRDs) is reshaping our picture of the early Universe, yet the physical mechanisms driving their compact size and UV-optical colors remain elusive. Here we report an unusually bright LRD (z=3.1) observed as part of the RUBIES program. This LRD exhibits broad emission lines (FWHM ~4000km/s), a blue UV continuum, a clear Balmer break and a red continuum sampled out to rest 4 &mu;m with MIRI. We develop a new joint galaxy and AGN model within the Prospector Bayesian inference framework and perform spectrophotometric modeling using NIRCam, MIRI, and NIRSpec/Prism observations. Our fiducial model reveals a M_*~ 10^9M<sub>&odot;</sub> galaxy alongside a dust-reddened AGN driving the optical emission. Explaining the rest-frame optical color as a reddened AGN requires A_v≳3, suggesting that a great majority of the accretion disk energy is re-radiated as dust emission. Yet despite clear AGN signatures, we find a surprising lack of hot torus emission, which implies that either the dust emission in this object must be cold, or the red continuum must instead be driven by a massive, evolved stellar population of the host galaxy &ndash; seemingly inconsistent with the high EW broad lines (H&alpha; EW ~800&#8491;). The widths and luminosities of Pa&beta;, Pa&delta;, Pa&gamma;, and H&alpha; imply a modest black hole mass of M_BH~10^8M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Additionally, we identify a narrow blue-shifted HeI absorption in G395M spectra, signaling an ionized outflow with kinetic energy up to ~1&percnt; the luminosity of the AGN. The low redshift of RUBIES-BLAGN-1 combined with the depth and richness of the JWST imaging and spectroscopic observations provide a unique opportunity to build a physical model for these so-far mysterious LRDs, which may prove to be a crucial phase in the early formation of massive galaxies and their supermassive black holes.

The identity of dark matter has been a mystery in astronomy, cosmology, and particle theory for about a century. Bessho, Ikeda, and Yin (2022), three of the current authors, proposed using the state-of-the-art infrared spectrographs, including WINERED at 6.5m Magellan Clay telescope and NIRSpec at James Webb Space Telescope, as efficient detectors for the indirect detection of dark matter with the mass around eV by measuring the line photons from the dark matter two body decays. Applying this concept, we have performed spectrographic observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) Leo V and Tucana II using WINERED by utilizing an object-sky-object nodding observation technique for background subtraction. We present the first result from this dark matter search. Employing zero consistent flux data after the sky subtraction, we have established one of the most stringent limits to date on dark matter decaying into line photons in the mass range of 1.8-2.7 eV. Our data can also be applied to constrain other spectra of photons from the dSphs.

<p> Patrick LaChance, Rupert Croft, Yueying Ni, Nianyi Chen, Tiziana Di Matteo, Simeon Bird </p>
<p>
We present mock JWST observations for more than 250,000 different galaxies from the Astrid simulation with 3 ≤ z ≤ 6. The mock observations are made using the BPASS stellar SED model, and a simple dust model. They are then viewed through NIRCam filters, convolved with a PSF, have noise added, and are drizzled together to emulate the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey. We analyse this dataset by computing a number of morphological measures and find our catalog to have comparable statistics to similar mock catalogs, and the first release of CEERS data. We find that most of the Sersic indices of galaxies in our redshift range are lower than observed, with most having n less than one. Additionally, we observe the sizes of galaxies of all masses to increase from redshift z=6 to redshift z=3 consistent with other results. The number of galaxies in our catalog allows us to examine how relationships like the mass-size relation evolve with redshift, and compare the accuracy of a variety of traditional galaxy classification techniques (Sersic fit, Asymmetry-Concentration, and Gini-M_20) within our redshift range. We find the mass-size relation to be nearly flat at redshift z=6, and consistently increases as redshift decreases, and find the galaxy classification methods have minimal correlation with each other in our redshift range. We also investigate the impact that different stages of our imaging pipeline have on these morphological measures to determine how robust mock catalogs are to different choices at each step. Finally, we test the addition of incorporating light from AGNs into our pipeline and find that while the population of galaxies that have significant AGN luminosity is low, those galaxies do tend to have higher Sersic indices once the AGN luminosity is added, rectifying some of the systematic bias towards lower Sersic indices present in our dataset.

<p>
With its sensitivity in the rest-frame optical, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered active galactic nuclei (AGN), comprising both intrinsically faint and heavily reddened sources, well into the first billion years of the Universe, at z ~ 4-11. In this work, we revisit the AGN contribution to reionization given the high number densities associated with these objects. We use the DELPHI semi-analytic model, base-lined against the latest high-redshift datasets from the JWST and the Atacama Large millimetre Array (ALMA) to model early star forming galaxies and AGN. We calculate the escape fractions of ionizing radiation from both star formation and AGN and include the impact of reionization feeback in suppressing the baryonic content of low-mass galaxies in ionized regions. This model is validated against the key observables for star forming galaxy, AGN and reionization. In our  fiducial model, reionization reaches its mid-point at z ~ 6.9 and ends by z ~ 5.9. Low stellar mass (M_*≤ 10^9M<sub>&odot;</sub>) star forming galaxies are found to be the key drivers of the reionization process, providing about 77&percnt; of the total photon budget. Despite their high numbers, high accretion rates and higher escape fractions compared to star forming galaxies at z ~ 5, AGN only provide about 23&percnt; of the total reionization budget which is dominated by black holes in high stellar mass systems (with M_* ≥ 10^9M<sub>&odot;</sub>). This is because AGN number densities become relevant only at z ≤ 7 - as a result, AGN contribute as much as galaxies as late as z ~ 6.2, when reionization is already in its end stages. Finally, we find that even contrasting models of the AGN ionizing photon escape fraction (increasing or decreasing with stellar mass) do not qualitatively change our results.

<p> John K. Webb, Chung-Chi Lee, Dinko Milakovic, Victor V. Flambaum, Vladimir A. Dzuba, Joao Magueijo </p>
<p>
We report unbiased AI measurements of the fine structure constant &alpha; in two proximate absorption regions in the spectrum of the quasar HE0515-4414. The data are high resolution, high signal to noise, and laser frequency comb calibrated, obtained using the ESPRESSO spectrograph on the VLT. The high quality of the data and proximity of the regions motivate a differential comparison, exploring the possibility of spatial variations of fundamental constants, as predicted in some theories. We show that if the magnesium isotopic relative abundances are terrestrial, the fine structure constants in these two systems differ at the 7&sigma; level. A 3&sigma; discrepancy between the two measurements persists even for the extreme non-terrestrial case of 100&percnt; ^24Mg, if shared by both systems. However, if Mg isotopic abundances take independent values in these two proximate systems, one terrestrial, the other with no heavy isotopes, both can be reconciled with a terrestrial &alpha;, and the discrepancy between the two measurements falls to 2&sigma;. We cannot rule out other systematics that are unaccounted for in our study that could masquerade as a varying alpha signal. We discuss varying constant and varying isotope interpretations and resolutions to this conundrum for future high precision measurements.

We present the identification of 42 narrow-line active galactic nuclei (type-2 AGN) candidates in the two deepest observations of the JADES spectroscopic survey with JWST/NIRSpec. The spectral coverage and the depth of our observations allow us to select narrow-line AGNs based on both rest-frame optical and UV emission lines up to z=10. Due to the metallicity decrease of galaxies, at z&gt;3 the standard optical diagnostic diagrams (N2-BPT or S2-VO87) become unable to distinguish many AGN from other sources of photoionisation. Therefore, we also use high ionisation lines, such as HeII&lambda;4686, HeII&lambda;1640, NeIV&lambda;2422, NeV&lambda;3420, and NV&lambda;1240, also in combination with other UV transitions, to trace the presence of AGN. Out of a parent sample of 209 galaxies, we identify 42 type-2 AGN (although 10 of them are tentative), giving a fraction of galaxies in JADES hosting type-2 AGN of about 20±3&percnt;, which does not evolve significantly in the redshift range between 2 and 10. The selected type-2 AGN have estimated bolometric luminosities of 10^41.3-44.9 erg s<sup>-1</sup> and host-galaxy stellar masses of 10^7.2-9.3 M<sub>&odot;</sub>. The star formation rates of the selected AGN host galaxies are consistent with those of the star-forming main sequence. The AGN host galaxies at z=4-6 contribute ~8-30 &percnt; to the UV luminosity function, slightly increasing with UV luminosity.

<p>
We study outflows in 130 galaxies with -22&lt;MUV&lt;-16 at z=3-9 identified in JWST NIRSpec and NIRCam WFSS data taken by the ERO, CEERS, FRESCO, GLASS, and JADES programs. We identify 30 out of the 130 galaxies with broad components of FWHM~200-700 km s<sup>-1</sup> in the emission lines of H&alpha; and [OIII] that trace ionized outflows, and find no excesses from the star-formation main sequence. Four out of the 30 outflowing galaxies are Type-1 AGN whose H&alpha; emission lines include line profile components as broad as FWHM&gt;1000 km s<sup>-1</sup> while one galaxy is identified as a Type-2 AGN by high ionization emission lines. With the velocity shift and line widths of the outflow broad lines, we obtain ~80-500 km s<sup>-1</sup> for the outflow velocities. We find that the outflow velocities are slower than low-z galaxies with similar SFRs, which may be explained by the low stellar masses of high-z galaxies. The outflow velocities of AGNs are large but not significantly different from the others. Interestingly, these outflow velocities are typically not high enough to escape from the galactic potentials, possibly suggesting fountain-type outflows. We estimate mass loading factors &eta; to be 0.1-1 that are not particularly large, but comparable with those of z~1 outflows. The large fraction of galaxies with outflows (30% with high resolution data) provides constraints on outflow parameters, suggesting a wide opening angle of &gt;45 deg and a large duty-cycle of &gt;30%, which gives a picture of more frequent and spherical outflows in high-z galaxies.

Merger events can trigger gas accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) located at the centre of galaxies, and form close pairs of AGN. The fraction of AGN in pairs offers critical insights into the dynamics of galaxy interactions, SMBH growth, and their co-evolution with host galaxies. However, the identification of dual AGN is difficult, as it requires high-quality spatial and spectral data; hence, only very few pairs have been found in the distant Universe so far. This study aims to provide a first observational estimate of the fraction of dual AGN at 2&lt;z&lt;6 by analysing a sample of 16 AGN observed with JWST/NIRSpec IFS, as part of the GA-NIFS survey. For two AGN in our sample, we also incorporate archival VLT/MUSE data to expand the search area. We searched for nearby companion galaxies and emission-line sources within the ~20x20 kpc field of view of the NIRSpec data cubes, extending up to ~50 kpc using the MUSE data cubes. We analysed the spectra of such emitters to determine their physical and kinematic properties. We report the serendipitous discovery of a triple AGN and four dual AGN (two of which considered as candidates), with projected separations in the range 3-28 kpc. Their AGN classification is mainly based on standard optical emission line flux ratios, as observed with JWST/NIRSpec, and is complemented with additional multi-wavelength diagnostics. The identification of these 3-5 multiple AGN out of the 16 AGN systems in GA-NIFS (i.e. ~20-30%) suggests they might be more common than previously thought based on other observational campaigns. Moreover, our inferred fraction of dual AGN moderately exceeds predictions from cosmological simulations that mimic our observational criteria (~10%). This work highlights the exceptional capabilities of NIRSpec for detecting distant dual AGN, and prompts new investigations to constrain their fraction across cosmic time.

DUALZ features a contiguous 4'×6' ALMA 30-GHz-wide mosaic in Band 6, covering areas of &mu;&gt;2 down to a sensitivity of &sigma;=32.7~&mu;Jy. Through a blind search, we identified 69 dust continuum sources at S/N ≳5.0 with median redshift and intrinsic 1.2-mm flux of z=2.30 and S_1.2mm^int=0.24~mJy. Of these, 27 have been spectroscopically confirmed, leveraged by the latest NIRSpec observations, while photometric redshift estimates are constrained by the comprehensive HST, NIRCam, and ALMA data for the remaining sources. With priors, we further identify a [CII]158 &mu;m line emitter at z=6.3254±0.0004, confirmed by the latest NIRSpec spectroscopy. The NIRCam counterparts of the 1.2-mm continuum exhibit undisturbed morphologies, denoted either by disk or spheroid, implying the triggers for the faint mm emission are less catastrophic than mergers. We have identified 8 HST-dark galaxies (F150W&gt;27mag, F150W-F444W&gt;2.3) and 2 JWST-dark (F444W&gt;30mag) galaxy candidates among the ALMA continuum sources. The former includes face-on disk galaxies, hinting that substantial dust obscuration does not always result from inclination. We also detect a marginal dust emission from an X-ray-detected galaxy at z<sub>spec</sub>=10.07, suggesting an active co-evolution of the central black hole and its host. We assess the infrared luminosity function up to z~10 and find it consistent with predictions from galaxy formation models. To foster diverse scientific outcomes from the community, we publicly release reduced ALMA mosaic maps, cubes, and the source catalog.

### 299) [2307.06336](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06336v3): Ultraviolet Compactness of High-Redshift Galaxies as a Tracer of Early-Stage Gas Infall, Bursty Star Formation, and Offset from the Fundamental Metallicity Relation

The empirical anti-correlation between gas-phase metallicity and star formation rate (SFR) at a fixed stellar mass, known as the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR), is commonly interpreted as an equilibrium state in the interplay between gas infall, enrichment, and gas removal. JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy has shown a z&gt;3 deviation from the local-universe FMR calibrations, suggesting that these galaxies are potentially caught out of equilibrium. To investigate this, we inferred the stellar population, nebular, and morphological properties of 427 galaxies at 3&lt;z&lt;10 using uniformly reduced NIRSpec prism spectroscopy and NIRCam photometry. We consider morphology as a possible indicator of chemical enrichment stage. We find a mass-size relation already in place at 4&lt;z&lt;10, with a normalization anti-correlated with redshift. The size-redshift anti-correlation depends on stellar mass: while the size of M_*&lt;10^8M<sub>&odot;</sub> galaxies strongly declines with redshift, M_*&gt;10^9M<sub>&odot;</sub> galaxies exhibit negligible redshift evolution. We also confirm the redshift evolution of the FMR: z&gt;3 galaxies appear metal-deficient compared to expectations for their stellar mass and SFR according to the local-universe FMR. This offset grows with redshift. Metal deficiency is correlated with compactness: galaxies most offset from the average mass-size relation are also the most metal-poor for their stellar mass and SFR. We interpret this as a product of bursty star formation: compact galaxies exhibit elevated SFR surface densities, indicating that they are observed during burst episodes triggered by gas infall. While accretion of metal-poor gas has reduced their gas-phase metallicity by diluting the interstellar medium, they are observed prior to chemical yield release by newly formed massive stars. Simply, they are chemically out of equilibrium compared to the equilibrium state known as the FMR.

Dual-phase xenon time projection chamber (TPC) detectors offer heightened sensitivities for dark matter detection across a spectrum of particle masses. To broaden their capability to low-mass dark matter interactions, we investigated the light and charge responses of liquid xenon (LXe) to sub-keV nuclear recoils. Using neutron events from a pulsed Adelphi Deuterium-Deuterium neutron generator, an in situ calibration was conducted on the LUX detector. We demonstrate direct measurements of light and charge yields down to 0.45 keV and 0.27 keV, respectively, both approaching single quanta production, the physical limit of LXe detectors. These results hold significant implications for the future of dual-phase xenon TPCs in detecting low-mass dark matter via nuclear recoils.
