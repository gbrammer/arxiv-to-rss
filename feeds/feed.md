### 1) [2503.03675](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03675v1): The M_{*}-M_{\rm BH} Relation Evolution from z ~ 6 to the Present Epoch

<p>
The ratio between the stellar mass of a galaxy, M_{*}, and that of its central supermassive black hole (SMBH), M_\bullet, the ``Magorrian'' relationship, traces their coevolution. JWST observations have suggested significant evolution in M_\bullet/M_{*} relative to local scaling relationships both in low-mass galaxies and in quasars at z \ge 4. We test this possibility by (1) determining the preferred M_\bullet/M_{*} scaling relation among those proposed locally; and (2) providing uniform host galaxy stellar mass estimates. These steps reduce the prominence of the reported evolution. We then apply Monte Carlo simulations to account for observational biases. We still find a significant increase over the local scaling relation in M_\bullet/M_{*} for z \ge 4 SMBHs in very low-mass galaxies (\log(M_*/M_{\odot})&lt;10). However, similarly high values of M_\bullet/M_{*} are also found in low mass galaxies at z ~ 0.5 to 3 that may be common at cosmic noon. Nonetheless, galaxies with similar behavior are rare locally and not accounted for in the local scaling relations. In contrast, z ~ 6 quasars can have M_\bullet/M_{*} well above the local relation value, but they can be explained as extreme cases still within the scaling relation for their higher mass host galaxies. Black holes in some of them and in the low-mass systems may be undergoing very high accretion episodes that result in high M_\bullet/M_{*} but that will be followed by quiescent periods when growth of the host drives the systems toward more typical M_\bullet/M_{*} values.

The cosmic star formation history (CSFH) and cosmic active galactic nuclei (AGN) luminosity history (CAGNH) are self consistently presented at z = 5.5-13.5. This is achieved by analyzing galaxies detected by the James Webb Space Telescope from \approx 400 \, \mathrm{arcmin^{2}} fields from the PEARLS, CEERS, NGDEEP, JADES and PRIMER surveys. In particular, the combination of spectral energy distribution fitting codes, EAZY and ProSpect, are employed to estimate the photometric redshifts and astrophysical quantities of 3947 distant galaxies, from which we compute the stellar mass, star formation rate and AGN luminosity distribution functions in four redshift bins. Integrating the distribution functions, we find that the CAGNH tentatively rises by \approx 2.2 dex over z = 5.5-13.5 compared to \approx 1.8 dex for the CSFH, indicating that the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) tends to outpace the assembly of stellar mass. We connect our results of the CSFH and CAGNH at z=5.5-13.5 to that from z= 0-5 to determine the summary of \gtrsim 13 Gyr of star formation and AGN activity, from the very onset of galaxy formation to the present day.

<p>
We present subarcsecond-resolution ALMA mosaics of the Orion Bar PDR in [CI] 609 um, C2H (4-3), and C18O (3-2) emission lines, complemented by JWST images of H2 and aromatic infrared band (AIB) emission. The rim of the Bar shows very corrugated structures made of small-scale H2 dissociation fronts (DFs). The [CI] 609 um emission peaks very close (~0.002 pc) to the main H2-emitting DFs, suggesting the presence of gas density gradients. These DFs are also bright and remarkably similar in C2H emission, which traces 'hydrocarbon radical peaks' characterized by very high C2H abundances, reaching up to several x10^-7. The high abundance of C2H and of related hydrocarbon radicals, such as CH3, CH2, and CH, can be attributed to gas-phase reactions driven by elevated temperatures, the presence of C+ and C, and the reactivity of FUV-pumped H2. The hydrocarbon radical peaks roughly coincide with maxima of the 3.4/3.3 um AIB intensity ratio, a proxy for the aliphatic-to-aromatic content of PAHs. This implies that the conditions triggering the formation of simple hydrocarbons also favor the formation (and survival) of PAHs with aliphatic side groups, potentially via the contribution of bottom-up processes in which abundant hydrocarbon radicals react in situ with PAHs. Ahead of the DFs, in the atomic PDR zone (where [H]&gt;&gt;[H2]), the AIB emission is brightest, but small PAHs and carbonaceous grains undergo photo-processing due to the stronger FUV field. Our detection of trace amounts of C2H in this zone may result from the photoerosion of these species. This study provides a spatially resolved view of the chemical stratification of key carbon carriers in a PDR. Overall, both bottom-up and top-down processes appear to link simple hydrocarbon molecules with PAHs in molecular clouds; however, the exact chemical pathways and their relative contributions remain to be quantified.

### 4) [2503.03050](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03050v1): CORINOS. III. Outflow Shocked Regions of the Low-mass Protostellar Source IRAS 15398-3359 with JWST and ALMA

<p>
While molecular outflows have been studied in details with radio interferometry, observations of the hotter gas in protostellar outflows at a comparable physical scale is often challenging. Combined with ALMA, JWST allows us to investigate the cold and hot gas with unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity. We present a detailed comparison between the gas distributions probed with ALMA and JWST in the primary outflow of IRAS 15398-3359. At 2000 au scale, the southwestern outflow shows four shell structures in 5--10 micron continuum, whereas the submillimeter H_2CO emission traces two of the four shells closest to the protostar. Submillimeter emission from CS, CCH, c-C_3H_2, and CH_3OH shows the same two shells, and the ^{12}CO emission covers most of the outflow region. SO and SiO only trace a condensation at the edge of the shell closest to the protostar. None of these lines observed with ALMA show the outermost shell. At 500 au scale, we find hot H_2 gas inside the outflow cavity with JWST. The derived temperature of H_2 is 1147\pm198 K within a 0\farcs5 aperture at the protostar. The foreground mass column density of dust is (1.4--2.0)\times10^{-3} g\cdotcm^{-2} (A_{\rm v} = 47--66 mag) in the outflow, using the dust model from Weingartner & Draine (2001). We also find an 8^{\circ} difference between the directions toward the [Fe II] knot and the outermost shell in the MIRI image, which may be interpreted as the precession of the [Fe II] jet. The dynamical timescale of the [Fe II] knot is 10 yrs, suggesting a current event.

<p>
There is vast evidence from observations of multiple stellar populations (MPs) in globular clusters (GCs). To explore the issue theoretically, this work considers two subsolar metallicities, two ages, and two initial abundance patterns: a first population of standard \alpha-enhanced metal mixture stars and a second stellar population displaying C-N and Na-O anticorrelations chemical abundance patterns, along with an enhanced helium fraction. Analysing the predictions for these extreme compositions, we provide insights into the observability of not-resolved MPs into individual stars of GCs. We use colours and spectrophotometric indices measurable with modern facilities (e.g. Euclid, LSST, DES, JWST).

### 6) [2503.02527](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02527v1): Identification of high-redshift X-ray active galactic nuclei in the 4XMM-DR11 serendipitous catalogue using DES data: Comparative analysis with optically-selected QSOs

<p>
X-rays provide a robust method in identifying AGN. However, in the high-redshift Universe, their space density is relatively low, and, in combination with the small areas covered by X-ray surveys, the selected AGN are poorly sampled. Deep optical/infrared data are essential for locating counterparts and determining redshifts. In this work, we leverage the XMM-Newton 4XMM-DR11 serendipitous catalogue alongside the extensive optical Dark Energy Survey and the near-infrared VISTA Hemisphere Survey (VHS) to select one of the largest high-z X-ray AGN samples to date. Our analysis focuses on the overlapping area of these surveys, covering about 185 deg^2. In addition, we aspire to compare the properties of the X-ray AGN with the optically-selected QSOs. For sources without spectroscopic data (80%), we estimated the photometric redshifts using both SED fitting and machine-learning algorithms. Among the 65,000 X-ray sources in the 4XMM-DES-VHS area, we ended up with 833 z&gt;3.5 AGN (11% having spec-z information) with high reliability and a fraction of outliers {\eta}&lt;10%. The sample completeness is 90%, driven by the depth of DES data. Only 10% of the X-ray selected AGN are also optical QSOs and vice versa. Our findings indicate an observed absorbed fraction (\log N_H~[cm^{-2}] \geq 23) of 20-40% for the X-ray AGN, significantly higher than that of optical QSOs. X-ray AGN exhibit fainter observed optical magnitudes and brighter mid-IR magnitudes than optical QSOs. Their median rest-frame SED shapes differ notably with optical QSOs being dominated by AGN emission in the UV-optical wavelengths. While the median SEDs of X-ray AGN suggest extinction in the UV-optical range, individual sources exhibit a wide range of spectral shapes, indicating significant diversity within the population. This analysis supports that X-ray and optically-selected AGN represent distinct and complementary populations.

### 7) [2503.02204](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02204v1): Deuterated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in the Interstellar Medium: Constraints from the Orion Bar as Observed by the James Webb Space Telescope

<p> Xuejuan Yang, Aigen Li </p>
<p>
The gas-phase abundances of deuterium (D) in the local interstellar medium (ISM) exhibit considerable regional variations. Particularly, in some regions the gas-phase D abundances are substantially lower than the primordial D abundance generated in the Big Bang, after subtracting the astration reduction caused by the Galactic chemical evolution. Deuterated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules have been suggested as a potential reservoir of the D atoms missing from the gas-phase. Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope's Near Infrared Spectrograph have revealed the widespread of deuterated PAHs in the Orion Bar through their aliphatic C--D emission at 4.65{\,{\rm &mu; m}} and possibly aromatic C--D emission at 4.4{\,{\rm &mu; m}} as well. To examine the viability of deuterated PAHs as the D reservoir, we model the infrared (IR) emission spectra of small PAH molecules containing various aromatic and aliphatic D atoms in the Orion Bar. We find that small deuterated PAHs exhibit a noticeable emission band at 4.4 or 4.65{\,{\rm &mu; m}} even if they contain only one aromatic or aliphatic D atom. We derive {{N_{\rm D,ali}}}/{N_{\rm H}}\approx3.4&percnt;, the deuteration degree of PAHs measured as the number of aliphatic D atoms (relative to H), from the observed intensity ratios of the 4.65{\,{\rm &mu; m}} band to the 3.3{\,{\rm &mu; m}} aromatic C--H band. The deuteration degree for aromatically-deuterated PAHs is less certain as C--N stretch also contributes to the observed emission around 4.4{\,{\rm &mu; m}}. If we attribute it exclusively to aromatic C--D, we derive an upper limit of \approx14&percnt; on the deuteration degree, which is capable of accounting for an appreciable fraction of the missing D budget.

### 8) [2503.02086](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02086v1): Discovery of A Low-mass Strong-lens System in SMACS J0723.3-7327

<p>
We report the discovery of an intriguing, low-mass galaxy-scale strong-lens system in the SMACS J0723.3-7327 galaxy cluster. By modeling James Webb Space Telescope imaging and Very Large Telescope Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer spectroscopic data, we find that the lens is cluster member galaxy at z=0.397 with an Einstein radius of 0^{\prime \prime}.424 \pm 0^{\prime \prime}.012, stellar mass of M_* = (3.3 \pm 0.8) \times 10^{10} M_\odot, half-light radius of ~ 1 kpc, and central stellar velocity dispersion of 140 \pm 6 km s^{-1}. This lens galaxy is one of the few strong lens galaxies known to date that have stellar mass as low as M_* ~ 10^{10.5} M_\odot, offering an exceptional opportunity to peek into the population of low-mass galaxies that has largely remained unexplored in the context of strong-lensing studies. This strong lens system can also assist in assessing the systematic uncertainty in the lens modeling of cluster member galaxies.

Price, Katherine A. Suess, John R. Weaver, Mengyuan Xiao, Yunchong Zhang, Adi Zitrin </p>
<p>
Luminous broad H\alpha emission and red rest-optical SEDs are the hallmark of compact Little Red Dots (LRDs), implying highly attenuated dusty starbursts and/or obscured active galactic nuclei. However, the lack of observed FIR emission has proved difficult to reconcile with the implied attenuated luminosity in these models. Here, we utilize deep new ALMA imaging, new and existing JWST/MIRI imaging, and archival Spitzer/Herschel imaging of two of the rest-optically brightest LRDs (z=3.1 and z=4.47) to place the strongest constraints on the IR luminosity in LRDs to date. The detections at \lambda_\mathrm{rest}=1-4 \ &mu;m imply flat slopes in the rest-IR, ruling out a contribution from hot (T\gtrsim500 K) dust. Similarly, FIR non-detections rule out any appreciable cold (T\lesssim75 K) dust component. Assuming energy balance, these observations are inconsistent with the typical FIR dust emission of dusty starbursts and quasar torii, which usually show a mixture of cold and hot dust. Additionally, our [\mathrm{C}_{II}] non-detections rule out typical dusty starbursts. We compute empirical maximum IR SEDs and find that both LRDs must have \log(L_\mathrm{IR}/L_\odot) \lesssim 12.2 at the 3\sigma level. These limits are in tension with the predictions of rest-optical spectrophotometric fits, be they galaxy only, AGN only, or composite. It is unlikely that LRDs are highly dust-reddened intrinsically blue sources with a dust temperature distribution that conspires to avoid current observing facilities. Rather, we favor an intrinsically redder LRD SED model that alleviates the need for strong dust attenuation.

<p>
Outflows are a key element in the baryon cycle of galaxies, and their properties provide a fundamental test for our models of how star formation quenches in galaxies. Here we report the detection of outflowing gas in two recently quenched, massive (M_\star~10^{10.2}M_\odot) galaxies at z=4.106 (NS_274) and z=7.276 (RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7) observed with JWST/NIRSpec. The outflows are traced by blue-shifted MgII absorption lines, and in the case of the z=4.1 system, also by FeII and NaI features. The spectra of the two sources are similar to those of local post-starburst galaxies, showing deep Balmer features and minimal star formation on 10 Myr timescales as traced by the lack of bright emission lines, also suggesting the absence of a strong and radiatively efficient AGN. The galaxies' SFHs are consistent with an abrupt quenching of star formation, which continued at rates of ~15\,M_\odot/yr averaged over 100 Myr timescales. Dedicated millimeter observations of NS_274 constrain its dust obscured SFR to &lt;12\,M_\odot/yr. Under simple geometrical assumptions, we derive mass loading factors \lesssim1 and ~50 for the z=4.1 and z=7.3 systems, respectively, and similarly different energies carried by the outflows. Supernovae feedback can account for the mass and energy of the outflow in NS_274. However, the low mass loading factor and average gas velocity suggest that the observed outflow is unlikely to be the reason behind its quenching. SF-related processes seem to be insufficient to explain the extreme mass outflow rate of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7, which would require an additional ejective mechanism such as an undetected AGN. Finally, the average outflow velocities per unit M_\star, SFR, or its surface area are consistent with those of lower-redshift post-starburst galaxies, suggesting that outflows in rapidly quenched galaxies might occur similarly across cosmic time.

### 11) [2503.01968](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01968v1): Can primordial black holes explain the overabundance of bright super-early galaxies?

<p> Antonio Matteri, Andrea Pallottini, Andrea Ferrara </p>
<p>
JWST is detecting an excess of high-redshift (z\gtrsim 10), bright galaxies challenging most theoretical predictions. To address this issue, we investigate the impact of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) on the halo mass function and UV luminosity function (LF) of super-early galaxies. We explore two key effects: (i) the enhancement of massive halos abundance due to the compact nature and spatial distribution of PBHs, and (ii) the luminosity boost, characterized by the Eddington ratio \lambda_E, due to Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) powered by matter accretion onto PBHs. We build an effective model, calibrated using data at lower redshifts (z\approx 4-9), to derive the evolution of the LF including the additional PBH contribution. Via Bayesian analysis, we find that: (a) Although a small fraction (\log f_{\rm PBH} \approx -5.42) of massive (\log M_{\rm PBH} / {\rm M_{\odot}} \approx 8.37), non-emitting (\lambda_E=0) PBHs can explain the galaxy excess via the halo abundance enhancement, this solution is excluded by CMB &mu;-distortion constraints on monochromatic PBHs. (b) If PBHs power an AGN emitting at super-Eddington luminosity (\lambda_E \approx 10), the observed LF can be reproduced by a PBH population with characteristic mass \log M_{\rm PBH} / {\rm M_{\odot}} \approx 3.69 constituting a tiny (\log f_{\rm PBH} \approx -8.16) fraction of the cosmic dark matter content. In the AGN scenario, about 75% of the observed galaxies with {\rm M_{UV}}=-21 at z=11 should host a PBH-powered AGN and typically reside in low mass halos, M_h = 10^{8-9} {\rm M_{\odot}}. These predictions can be tested with available and forthcoming JWST spectroscopic data. We note that our analysis considers a lognormal PBH mass function and compares its parameters with monochromatic limits on PBH abundance. Further work is required to relax such limitations.

Little Red Dots (LRDs) are compact, point-like sources characterized by their red color and broad Balmer lines, which have been debated to be either dominated by active galactic nuclei (AGN) or dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). Here we report two LRDs (ID9094 and ID2756) at z_{\rm spec}&gt;7, recently discovered in the JWST FRESCO GOODS-North field. Both satisfy the "v-shape" colors and compactness criteria for LRDs and are identified as Type-I AGN candidates based on their broad H\beta emission lines (full width at half maximum: 2276\pm492 km/s for ID9094 and 1069\pm239 km/s for ID2756) and narrow [OI] lines (~ 300-400 km/s). To investigate their nature, we conduct deep NOEMA follow-up observations targeting the [CII] 158{\rm &mu; m} emission line and the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We do not detect [CII] or 1.3 mm continuum emission for either source. Notably, in the scenario that the two LRDs were DSFGs, we would expect significant detections: &gt;16\sigma for [CII] and &gt;3\sigma for the 1.3 mm continuum of ID9094, and &gt;5\sigma for [CII] of ID2756. Using the 3\sigma upper limits of [CII] and 1.3 mm, we perform two analyses: (1) UV-to-FIR spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with and without AGN components, and (2) comparison of their properties with the L_{[CII]}-SFR_{tot} empirical relation. Both analyses indicate that LRDs favor the presence of AGN to explain their observed properties. Our results highlight the importance of far-infrared observations for studying LRDs, a regime that remains largely unexplored.

### 13) [2503.01949](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01949v1): The THESAN-ZOOM project: Star-formation efficiencies in high-redshift galaxies

<p>
Recent JWST observations hint at unexpectedly intense cosmic star-formation in the early Universe, often attributed to enhanced star-formation efficiencies (SFEs). Here, we analyze the SFE in THESAN-ZOOM, a novel zoom-in radiation-hydrodynamic simulation campaign of high-redshift (z \gtrsim 3) galaxies employing a state-of-the-art galaxy formation model resolving the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM). The halo-scale SFE (\epsilon^{\ast}_{\rm halo}) - the fraction of baryons accreted by a halo that are converted to stars - follows a double power-law dependence on halo mass, with a mild redshift evolution above M_{\rm halo} \gtrsim 10^{9.5}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}. The power-law slope is roughly 1/3 at large halo masses, consistent with expectations when gas outflows are momentum-driven. At lower masses, the slope is roughly 2/3 and is more aligned with the energy-driven outflow scenario. \epsilon^{\ast}_{\rm halo} is a factor of 2-3 larger than commonly assumed in empirical galaxy-formation models at M_{\rm halo} \lesssim 10^{11}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}. On galactic (kpc) scales, the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation of neutral gas is universal in THESAN-ZOOM, following \Sigma_{\rm SFR} \propto \Sigma_{\rm gas}^2, indicative of a turbulent energy balance in the ISM maintained by stellar feedback. The rise of \epsilon^{\ast}_{\rm halo} with halo mass can be traced primarily to increasing gas surface densities in massive galaxies, while the underlying KS relation and neutral, star-forming gas fraction remain unchanged. Although the increase in \epsilon^{\ast}_{\rm halo} with redshift is relatively modest, it is sufficient to explain the large observed number density of UV-bright galaxies at z \gtrsim 12. However, reproducing the brightest sources at M_{\rm UV} \lesssim -21 may require extrapolating the SFE beyond the halo mass range directly covered by THESAN-ZOOM.

<p>
We report the spectroscopic confirmation of a merging pair of massive quiescent galaxies at z=3.44. Using JWST observations, we confirm that the two galaxies lie at a projected separation of 4.5 kpc with a velocity offset of ~ 680\, {\rm km\, s^{-1}}\ (\delta_z ~ 0.01). The pair resides in the core of a known rich overdensity of galaxies, dubbed the "Cosmic Vine". For both pair members, modeling of the Spectral Energy Distributions and faint rest-frame optical emission lines indicate high stellar masses (\log{(M_\star/M_\odot)}~10.9) and suppressed star formation (\log{\rm (sSFR/yr^{-1})}&lt;-10), more than an order of magnitude below the level of the star formation main sequence at this redshift. We then explore the Illustris-TNG simulation and the GAEA and SHARK semi-analytical models to examine whether they produce a pair of massive quiescent galaxies akin to that of the Cosmic Vine. While all models produce close pairs of massive quiescent galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;4 with comparable separations and velocity offsets, their predicted number densities are 10-80 times lower than our observational constraint. This discrepancy cannot be fully explained by coarse time sampling in these models or the general challenge of forming early massive quiescent galaxies in simulations. Given that &gt;90&percnt; of simulated pairs in the models that we analyzed merge by z=0, our findings suggest that our observed pair will likely coalesce into a single massive galaxy. The merger, occurring in the dense core of a large-scale structure, might represent a critical event in the formation of a brightest cluster galaxy and the morphological transformation of high-redshift disky quiescent galaxies into early-type ellipticals.

<p>
We present a sample of 146 high-redshift (z&gt;7.5) galaxies from the CANUCS/Technicolor surveys, showcasing photometry in every wide- and medium-band NIRCam filter in addition to ancillary HST data sampling 0.4-5 &mu; m (22 JWST bands out of 29 bands total). Additionally, 48 (33&percnt;) galaxies in our sample meet criteria to be classified as extreme emission line galaxies, 15 (10&percnt;) of which are completely missed by typical dropout selections due to faint UV emission. By fitting the SEDs covering the rest-frame UV to optical at z &gt; 7.5, we investigate the dust obscuration properties, giving an unbiased view of dust buildup in high-redshift galaxies free from spectroscopic follow-up selection effects. Dust attenuation correlates with stellar mass, but more strongly with star formation rate. We find typical galaxies at z&gt;7.5 have ~ 25 &percnt; of their star formation obscured. However, since galaxies with higher star formation rates suffer more attenuation, ~ 50 &percnt; of the total star formation rate density at 7.5&lt;z&lt;9 is obscured. The obscured fraction drops to ~ 35 &percnt; in our 9&lt;z&lt;12 bin, possibly due to substantial dust grain growth in the interstellar medium not having time to occur. Extrapolating the decline in dust obscuration of galaxies to higher redshifts, we infer that dust obscuration should approach zero at z &gt; 15, implying that epoch as when dust first forms in bright galaxies.

### 16) [2503.01272](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01272v1): Investigating dusty Red Supergiant outflows in Westerlund 1 with 3D Hydrodynamic simulations

<p> C. J. K. Larkin, J. Mackey, T. J. Haworth, A. A. C. Sander </p>
<p>
Recent JWST observations towards Westerlund 1 revealed extensive nebular emission associated with the cluster. Given the age of the region and proximity of that material to massive stars it cannot be primordial star forming gas and the origin is uncertain. We aim to determine whether the nebular emission in Westerlund 1 could be due to ablation flows from Red Supergiant (RSG) stars embedded in the cluster wind driven by the Wolf-Rayet stars in the cluster core. We also aim to explore the efficiency of mass-loading for the RSG wind in this scenario. We use 3D hydrodynamic simulations with the \textsc{pion} code to study the interaction between the cluster and RSG winds. We compare with the JWST observations by generating synthetic dust-emission maps. We find that the ablation flow morphology is consistent with the observations towards Westerlund 1, with clumps and instabilities. Synthetic observations at 11 &mu;m predict fluxes in the ablation flow of ~1000-6000 MJy ster^{-1} which is consistent with the unsaturated components of the JWST F1130W observations in the vicinity of the red supergiants in the region. This good agreement is achieved without any consideration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which have a known 11.3 &mu;m feature that appears in the F1130W band. This suggests that the ablation flow is PAH depleted. Ablation of RSG winds can explain the observed nebulosity in Westerlund 1, at least in the vicinity of the RSGs. Further observations are encouraged to enable detailed studies of these interactions.

### 17) [2503.01172](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01172v1): Detection Prospects of Electromagnetic Signatures from OGLE-2011-BLG-0462

<p> Shigeo S. Kimura, Lena Murchikova, Kailash C. Sahu </p>
<p>
Stellar-mass isolated black holes (IsoBHs) wandering in interstellar medium (ISM) are expected to be abundant in our Galaxy. Recently, an IsoBH, OGLE-2011-BLG-0462, was unambiguously discovered using astrometric microlensing. We examine prospects for detecting electromagnetic signatures from an accretion flow surrounding the IsoBH. The accretion rate onto the IsoBH should be highly sub-Eddington, which leads to formation of a hot accretion flow. In this paper, we evaluate the detectability of electromagnetic signals from the hot accretion flows in two accretion states: magnetically arrested disk (MAD) and classical radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs). For the MAD scenario, we find that the optical, infrared, and X-ray signals can be detectable by the current best facilities, such as HST, JWST, and Chandra, if the IsoBH is in a warm neutral medium. In contrast, for the classical RIAF scenario, the optical and X-ray emissions are weaker than MAD scenario, leading to unobservable signals for a typical parameter set. Future follow-up observations of OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 will provide a good test for theories of accretion processes.

<p>
JWST has revealed a population of broad-line active galactic nuclei at z&gt;4 with remarkably red colors, so-called "Little Red Dots." Ubiquitous Balmer breaks suggest that they harbor old stellar populations in massive, compact host galaxies. We present ALMA observations of three LRDs at z=3.10, 4.46, and 7.04, targeting molecular and neutral gas via CO(7-6) and [CI](2-1), respectively. We do not detect CO in any target, placing conservative limits on the host molecular gas mass \lesssim 1-5\times10^{10} M_\odot. We report the tentative (4.9\sigma) detection of the [CI](2-1) line in A2744-45924 (z=4.46), one of the brightest known LRDs. The [CI] line is narrow (FWHM ~ 80 km s^{-1}), implying a dynamical mass \lesssim 10^{10} M_\odot, adopting conservative limits for the galaxy size. The dynamical mass limit is significantly lower than expected from the local M_{\rm BH}-M_{\rm dyn} relation, and is an order of magnitude below the stellar mass derived from SED fitting, potentially supporting a non-stellar origin of the Balmer break. These results, while tentative, paint a picture of LRDs that is markedly different than typical high-z quasars, which live in massive, gas-rich, and actively star-forming host galaxies.

<p>
A unique galaxy at z = 2.2, zC406690, has a striking clumpy large-scale ring structure that persists from rest UV to near-infrared, yet has an ordered rotation and lies on the star-formation main sequence. We combine new JWST/NIRCam and ALMA band 4 observations, together with previous VLT/SINFONI integral field spectroscopy and HST imaging to re-examine its nature. The high-resolution H\alpha kinematics are best fitted if the mass is distributed within a ring with total mass M_{\rm{ring}} = 2 \times 10^{10} M_\odot and radius R_{ring} = 4.6 kpc, together with a central undetected mass component (e.g., a "bulge") with a dynamical mass of M_{bulge} = 8 \times 10^{10} M_\odot. We also consider a purely flux emitting ring superposed over a faint exponential disk, or a highly "cuspy" dark matter halo, both disfavored against a massive ring model. The low-resolution CO(4-3) line and 142GHz continuum emission imply a total molecular and dust gas masses of M_{mol,gas} = 7.1 \times 10^{10}M_\odot and M_{dust} = 3 \times 10^8 M_\odot over the entire galaxy, giving a dust-to-mass ratio of 0.7%. We estimate that roughly half the gas and dust mass lie inside the ring, and that ~ 10&percnt; of the total dust is in a foreground screen that attenuates the stellar light of the bulge in the rest-UV to near-infrared. Sensitive high-resolution ALMA observations will be essential to confirm this scenario and study the gas and dust distribution.

### 20) [2503.00155](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00155v1): Late-time growth weakly affects the significance of high-redshift massive galaxies

<p> Qianran Xia, Dragan Huterer, Nhat-Minh Nguyen </p>
<p>
Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed massive galaxies at very high redshift (z~eq 7-15). The question of whether the existence of such galaxies is expected in the corresponding JWST surveys has received a lot of attention, though the answer straddles areas of cosmology and complex astrophysical details of high-redshift galaxy formation. The growth rate of density fluctuations determines the amplitude of overdensities that collapse to form galaxies. Late-time modifications of growth, combined with measurements at both z~ 1 from large-scale structure and z~ 1000 from the cosmic microwave background, affect the predictions for the abundance of first galaxies in the universe. In this paper, we point out that the late-time growth rate of structure affects the statistical significance of high-redshift, high-mass objects very weakly. Consequently, if the existence and abundance of these objects are confirmed to be unexpected, the variations in the late-time growth history are unlikely to explain these anomalies.

<p>
The integral-field unit mode of the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec+IFU) mounted on the James Webb Space Telescope has now enabled kinematic studies of smaller and less massive compact stellar systems in which to search for central massive black holes (BHs) than ever before. We present here the first such detection using NIRSpec+IFU in its highest resolution (R~2700) mode. We report a 3\sigma detection of a central black hole with mass {\cal M}_{BH}=2.2\pm1.1\times10^6\,M_\odot in UCD736 orbiting within the Virgo galaxy cluster based on Schwarzschild's modeling of the 1D kinematic profile. The presence of such a massive BH strongly argues against a globular cluster origin of this UCD, and rather suggests a tidally stripped formation route from a former \gtrsim10^9\,M_\odot dwarf galaxy host. Two other methods produce results consistent with Schwarzschild's modelling, but can only provide upper-limits on {\cal M}_{BH}. This represents the detection of a BH in the most compact (r_h\approx15\,{\rm pc}) stellar system to date, with a {\cal M}_{BH} corresponding to ~9 percent of the system's stellar mass, roughly in line with previously reported UCD BH detections and comparable to the BH detected in the compact elliptical galaxy NGC4486B.

We present the first follow-up with JWST of radio-selected NIRfaint galaxies as part of the COSMOS-Web survey. By selecting galaxies detected at radio frequencies (S_{\rm 3 GHz}&gt;11.5 &mu;Jy; i.e. S/N&gt;5) and with faint counterparts at NIR wavelengths (F150W&gt;26.1 mag), we collect a sample of 127 likely dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). We estimate their physical properties through SED fitting, compute the first radio luminosity function for these types of sources, and their contribution to the total cosmic star formation rate density. Our analysis confirms that these sources represent a population of highly dust-obscured (\langle A_{\rm v} \rangle ~3.5 mag), massive (\langle M_\star \rangle ~10^{10.8} M_\odot) and star-forming galaxies (\langle {\rm SFR} \rangle~300 M_\odot yr^{-1}) located at \langle z \rangle~3.6, representing the high-redshift tail of the full distribution of radio sources. Our results also indicate that these galaxies could dominate the bright end of the radio luminosity function and reach a total contribution to the cosmic star formation rate density equal to that estimated only considering NIR-bright sources at z~4.5. Finally, our analysis further confirms that the radio selection can be employed to collect statistically significant samples of DSFGs, representing a complementary alternative to the other selections based on JWST colors or detection at FIR/(sub)mm wavelengths.

Gravitational time delays offer unique, independent measurements of the Hubble constant, H_0. Precise measurements of H_0 stand as one of the most pressing challenges in modern cosmology, and to do so with time delays requires precise lens models. While much work has focused on streamlining the modeling process to keep pace with the erumpent discovery of strongly-lensed systems, a critical step toward reducing uncertainty in H_0 comes from increasing the precision of individual lens models themselves. In this work, we demonstrate that the unprecedented imaging capabilities of JWST make this goal attainable. We present the first lens model for time-delay cosmography derived from JWST data, applied to the quadruply-imaged quasar WFI2033--4723. While the primary source of systematic uncertainty in time-delay cosmography is currently the mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD), the sensitivity of models to this MSD varies on how the point spread function (PSF) errors are mitigated. As the PSF is also the primary source of uncertainty in lens modeling, we focus on a comparison of different PSF modeling methods. Within the context of power-law models, we recover results in agreement with previous Hubble Space Telescope (HST)-based models, but with better precision of key lensing parameters through implementation of new PSF modeling techniques. Despite the record-holding precision of this system's HST modeling, we achieve an additional 22% increase in precision of the Fermat potential difference, directly reducing uncertainties of cosmological inference. These results would produce a 3% (1\sigma of the modeling error) shift of H_0 towards a higher value for this lens, keeping all else constant. This work substantiates the groundbreaking potential of JWST for time-delay cosmography and lays the groundwork for modeling systems previously too faint to provide meaningful constraints on H_0.

### 24) [2503.00102](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00102v1): The Physical Properties and Morphologies of Faint Dusty Star-forming Galaxies Identified with JWST

<p> Stephen J. McKay, Amy J. Barger, Lennox L. Cowie, Michael J. Nicandro Rosenthal </p>
<p>
We develop a sample of 234 dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) from the A2744 and GOODS-S fields using JWST/NIRCam-selected galaxies as priors for SCUBA-2 measurements. This provides a large number of galaxies both above an 850 &mu;m flux of 2 mJy (47 bright DSFGs) and below (187 faint DSFGs). It represents the largest sample of individually identified (i.e., not stacked) faint DSFGs to date. We identify a tight negative correlation between redshift and both F444W and F150W flux, suggesting that the observed NIR flux may be an effective way of selecting high-redshift DSFGs. We study the physical properties of the DSFGs through spectral energy distribution fitting and morphological analysis. Other than the lower star formation rates (SFRs) and total infrared luminosities in the faint DSFGs, the two populations have similar properties. The stellar masses do not appear to be strongly dependent on either the SFRs or the submillimeter flux. These results suggest that the faint DSFGs are drawn from the same population of galaxies as the bright DSFGs. We find a lower merger fraction (~21%) relative to previous HST-based studies.

### 25) [2502.21281](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21281v1): JWST/MIRI Study of the Enigmatic Mid-Infrared Rings in the Planetary Nebula NGC 1514

<p> Michael E. Ressler, Alba Aller, David Jones, Ryan M. Lau, Luis F. Miranda, Karen Willacy </p>
<p>
While NGC 1514 is an elliptical, but complex, planetary nebula at optical wavelengths, it was discovered to have a pair of infrared-bright, axisymmetric rings contained within its faint outer shell during the course of the WISE all-sky survey. We have obtained JWST mid-infrared imaging and spectroscopy of the nebula through the use of simultaneous observations with the MIRI Imager and Medium Resolution Spectrometer, selecting the F770W, F1280W, and F2550W filters to match each of the MRS's three grating positions. These observations show that the rings are clearly resolved and relatively distinct structures, with both filamentary and clumpy detail throughout. There is also cloud-like material that has a turbulent appearance in the interior of the rings, particularly at the longest wavelengths, and faint ejecta-like structures just outside the ring boundaries. Despite their brightness, the emission from the rings within the three imager passbands is shown to be dominated by thermal emission from very small grains, not line emission from atomic hydrogen or forbidden atomic lines, shocked molecular hydrogen, or PAHs. The doppler velocities derived from the two brightest emission lines in the rings, however, suggest that the material from which the rings were formed was ejected during an early period of very heavy mass loss from the PN progenitor, then shaped by asymmetrical fast winds from the central binary pair.

We present JWST NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy observations of the z=5.89 quasar NDWFS J1425+3254 from 0.6-5.3 microns, covering the rest-frame ultraviolet and optical at spectral resolution R~100. The quasar has a black hole mass of M_{\rm{BH}}=(1.4\substack{+3.1\\-1.0})\times10^9 M_\odot and an Eddington ratio L_{\rm{Bol}}/L_{\rm{Edd}}=0.3\substack{+0.6\\-0.2}, as implied from the broad Balmer H\alpha and H\beta lines. We find that the quasar host has significant ongoing obscured star formation, as well as a quasar-driven outflow with velocity 6050\substack{+460\\-630} km/s, possibly one of the most extreme outflows in the early Universe. The data also reveals that two companion galaxies are merging with the quasar host. The north-eastern companion galaxy is relatively old and very massive, with luminosity-weighted stellar age 65\substack{+9\\-4} Myr, stellar mass (3.6\substack{+0.6\\-0.3})\times10^{11} M_\odot, and SFR &lt; (16.1\pm1.9) M_\odot/yr. A bridge of gas connects this companion galaxy and the host, confirming their ongoing interaction. A second merger is occurring between the quasar host and a much younger companion galaxy to the south, with stellar age 6.7\pm1.8 Myr, stellar mass (1.9\pm0.4)\times10^{10} M_\odot, and SFR &lt; (93\substack{+17\\-16}) M_\odot/yr. There is also another galaxy in the field that is likely in the foreground at z=1.135, that could be gravitationally lensing the quasar with magnification 1&lt;&mu;&lt;2, and so &lt;0.75 mag. Overall, the system is a "train-wreck" merger of three galaxies, with star formation and extreme quasar activity that were likely triggered by these ongoing interactions.

<p>
While the number of detected molecules, particularly complex organic molecules, in the solid-state in astrophysical environments is still rather limited, laboratory experiments and astrochemical models predict many potential candidates. Detection of molecules in protoplanetary disks provides a bridge between the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium and the chemistry of planets and their atmospheres. The excellent spectral sensitivity, broad wavelength coverage and high spatial resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allows for making progress in exploring chemical compositions of various astrophysical environments including planet-forming disks. They are a prerequisite for probing the disk content by means of sensitive absorption studies. In this paper, we present initial results of the JWST Cycle 1 GO program 1741 on d216-0939, a highly inclined TTauri disk located in the outskirts of the Orion Nebula Cluster. We utilise the NIRSpec and MIRI integral field unit spectrographs to cover its spectrum from 1.7 to 28~&mu;m. In the d216-0939 disk, we give assignments of the composition of silicate grains. We unambiguously detect solid-state features of H_2O, CO_2, ^{13}CO_2, CO, OCN^-, and tentatively OCS; species that had been detected recently also in other circumstellar disks. For the first time in disks, we provide unique detections of ices carrying NH_4^+ and the complex organic molecule ammonium carbamate (NH_4^+NH_2COO^-). The latter detections speak for a very efficient NH_3 chemistry in the disk. We also show the very important role of scattering in the analysis of observational spectra of highly inclined disks.

### 28) [2502.20447](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20447v1): Detecting galaxy-21-cm cross-correlation during reionization

<p> Samuel Gagnon-Hartman, James Davies, Andrei Mesinger </p>
<p>
The cosmic 21-cm signal promises to revolutionize studies of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Radio interferometers are aiming for a preliminary, low signal-to-noise (S/N) detection of the 21-cm power spectrum. Cross-correlating 21-cm with galaxies will be especially useful in these efforts, providing both a sanity check for initial 21-cm detection claims and potentially increasing the S/N due to uncorrelated residual systematics. Here we self-consistently simulate large-scale (1 Gpc) galaxy and 21-cm fields, computing their cross-power spectra for various choices of instruments as well as survey properties. We use 1080h observations with SKA-low AA* and HERA-350 as our benchmark 21-cm observations. We create mock Lyman alpha narrow-band, slitless and slit spectroscopic surveys, using benchmarks from instruments such as Subaru HyperSupremeCam, Roman grism, VLT MOONS, ELT MOSAIC, and JWST NIRCam. We forecast the resulting S/N of the galaxy-21-cm cross power spectrum, varying the galaxy survey area, depth and level of 21-cm foreground contamination for each pair of instruments. We find that the highest S/N is achievable through slitless, wide-area spectroscopic surveys, with the proposed Roman HLS survey resulting in a 55\sigma detection of the cross power with 21-cm as observed with SKA-low AA* for our fiducial model. Narrow-band dropout surveys are unlikely to result in a detectable cross-power, due to their poor redshift localization. Slit spectroscopy can provide a high S/N detection of the cross power for SKA-low AA* observations. Specifically, the planned MOONRISE survey with MOONS on the VLT can result in a 3\sigma detection, while a survey of comparable observing time using MOSAIC on the ELT can result in a 4\sigma detection. Our results can be used to guide survey strategies, facilitating the detection of the galaxy-21-cm cross power spectrum.

<p>
Mergers play important roles in galaxy evolution at and beyond Cosmic Noon (z~3). They are found to be a trigger of active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity and a process for growing stellar mass and black hole mass. High-z radio galaxies (HzRGs=type-2 radio-loud AGN) are among the most massive galaxies known, and reside in dense environments on scales of tens of kiloparsecs to Megaparsecs. We present the first search for kpc-scale companions in a sample of four z~3.5 HzRGs, with many supporting datasets, using matched 0.2" resolution ALMA and JWST/NIRSpec integral field unit data. We discover a total of ~12 companion systems within \lesssim18\,kpc across all four HzRG fields using two independent detection methods: peculiar [OIII]4959,5007 kinematics offset from the main (systemic) ionized gas component and [CII]158\rm &mu; m emitters. We examine the velocity fields of these companions and find evidence of disk rotation along with more complex motions. We estimate the dynamical masses of these nearby systems to be M_{\rm dyn}~10^{9-11}\,M_{\odot}, which may indicate a minor merger scenario. Our results indicate that these companions may be the trigger of the powerful radio-loud AGN. We discuss the roles of the discovered companion systems in galaxy evolution for these powerful jetted AGN and indicate that they may impede jet launch and deflect the jet.

<p>
We introduce the THESAN-ZOOM project, a comprehensive suite of high-resolution zoom-in simulations of 14 high-redshift (z&gt;3) galaxies selected from the THESAN simulation volume. This sample encompasses a diverse range of halo masses, with M_\mathrm{halo} \approx 10^8 - 10^{13}~\mathrm{M}_\odot at z=3. At the highest-resolution, the simulations achieve a baryonic mass of 142~\mathrm{M}_\odot and a gravitational softening length of 17~\mathrm{cpc}. We employ a state-of-the-art multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) model that self-consistently includes stellar feedback, radiation fields, dust physics, and low-temperature cooling through a non-equilibrium thermochemical network. Our unique framework incorporates the impact of patchy reionization by adopting the large-scale radiation field topology from the parent THESAN simulation box rather than assuming a spatially uniform UV background. In total, THESAN-ZOOM comprises 60 simulations, including both fiducial runs and complementary variations designed to investigate the impact of numerical and physical parameters on galaxy properties. The fiducial simulation set reproduces a wealth of high-redshift observational data such as the stellar-to-halo-mass relation, the star-forming main sequence, the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, and the mass-metallicity relation. While our simulations slightly overestimate the abundance of low-mass and low-luminosity galaxies they agree well with observed stellar and UV luminosity functions at the higher mass end. Moreover, the star-formation rate density closely matches the observational estimates from z=3-14. These results indicate that the simulations effectively reproduce many of the essential characteristics of high-redshift galaxies, providing a realistic framework to interpret the exciting new observations from JWST.

<p>
Using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), we tentatively detect two molecular hydrogen (H_2) fluorescent emission features in high-redshift galaxies at 2.3 and 3.1\sigma. These features consist of many blended emission lines that result from the de-excitation cascade of H_2 molecules that have absorbed Lyman-Werner band photons. Our study targets galaxies at redshifts z \geq 7 galaxies of the early Universe, as they host some of the most extreme conditions in terms of star formation, molecular gas content, and the possible presence of outflows driven by starbursts and active galactic nuclei. To enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of H_2 emission features in the rest-frame wavelength range of 155-191 nm, we stack JWST/NIRSpec spectra from z=7.0-13.4. These stacked spectra also exhibit atomic emission features, such as CIV emission with a P-Cygni profile, as well as CIII], OIII], and HeII. The presence of these features and the slightly blue-shifted fluorescent H_2 lines suggest active multiphase atomic and molecular outflows may be common at these redshifts. Our results suggest that it is possible to search for FUV fluorescent H_2 lines in high redshift galaxies using JWST, which would enable the characterization of interstellar radiation fields, densities, and temperatures in extreme photodissociation environments.

<p>
Lyman \alpha (Ly\alpha) emission is one of few observable features of galaxies that can trace the neutral hydrogen content in the Universe during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). To accomplish this we need an efficient way to survey for Ly\alpha emitters (LAEs) at redshifts beyond 7, requiring unbiased emission-line observations that are both sufficiently deep and wide to cover enough volume to detect them. Here we present results from PASSAGE -- a pure-parallel JWST/NIRISS slitless spectroscopic survey to detect Ly\alpha emitters deep into the EoR, without the bias of photometric preselection. We identify four LAEs at 7.5\leq z\leq9.5 in four surveyed pointings, and estimate the luminosity function (LF). We find that the LF does show a marked decrease compared to post-reionization measurements, but the change is a factor of \lesssim 10, which is less than expected from theoretical calculations and simulations, as well as observational expectations from the pre-JWST literature. Modeling of the IGM and expected \lya\ profiles implies these galaxies reside in ionized bubbles of \gtrapprox 2 physical Mpc. We also report that in the four fields we detect {3,1,0,0} LAEs, which could indicate strong field-to-field variation in the LAE distribution, consistent with a patchy HI distribution at z~8. We compare the recovered LAE number counts with expectations from simulations and discuss the potential implications for reionization and its morphology.

### 33) [2502.18781](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18781v1): The distribution of galaxy rotation in JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey

<p> Lior Shamir </p>
<p>
JWST provides a view of the Universe never seen before, and specifically fine details of galaxies in deep space. JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) is a deep field survey, providing unprecedentedly detailed view of galaxies in the early Universe. The field is also in relatively close proximity to the Galactic pole. Analysis of spiral galaxies by their direction of rotation in JADES shows that the number of galaxies in that field that rotate in the opposite direction relative to the Milky Way galaxy is ~50% higher than the number of galaxies that rotate in the same direction relative to the Milky Way. The analysis is done using a computer-aided quantitative method, but the difference is so extreme that it can be noticed and inspected even by the unaided human eye. These observations are in excellent agreement with deep fields taken at around the same footprint by HST and JWST. The reason for the difference may be related to the structure of the early Universe, but it can also be related to the physics of galaxy rotation and the internal structure of galaxies. In that case the observation can provide possible explanations to other puzzling anomalies such as the Ho tension and the observation of massive mature galaxies at very high redshifts.

### 34) [2502.18571](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18571v1): Dark Matter Substructure or Source Model Systematics? A Case Study of Cluster Lens Abell S1063

<p> Nino Ephremidze, Chandrika Chandrashekar, Atınç Çağan Şengül, Cora Dvorkin </p>
<p>
Mapping the small-scale structure of the universe through gravitational lensing is a promising tool for probing the particle nature of dark matter. Curved Arc Basis (CAB) has been proposed as a local lensing formalism in galaxy clusters, with the potential to detect low-mass dark matter substructure. In this work, we analyze the cluster lens Abell S1063 in search of dark matter substructure with the CAB formalism, using multi-band imaging data from JWST. We use two different source modeling methods: shapelets and pixel-based source reconstruction based on Delaunay triangulation. We find that source modeling systematics from shapelets result in a disagreement between Curved Arc Basis parameters measured from different filters. Source modeling with Delaunay significantly alleviates this systematic, as seen in the improvement in agreement across filters. We also find that inadequate complexity in source modeling can result in convincing spurious detections of dark matter substructure from strong gravitational lenses, as seen by our \Delta \text{BIC} &gt; 20 measurement of a M ~ 10^{10} M_{\odot} subhalo with shapelets, a spurious detection that is not reproduced with Delaunay source modeling. We demonstrate that multi-band analysis with different JWST filters is key for disentangling source and lens model systematics from dark matter substructure detections.

### 35) [2502.18565](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18565v1): Formation of filaments and feathers in disc galaxies: Is self-gravity enough?

<p> Raghav Arora, Christoph Federrath, Mark Krumholz, Robi Banerjee </p>
<p>
Context. Dense filaments/feathers are kpc-scale dusty features present in nearby main sequence galaxies. Distinct from the spiral arms, filaments constitute a major portion of dense gas concentration. They are expected to play an important role in star formation and are known to harbour star-forming regions and H II regions. Aims. We explore the origin of filaments/feathers in disc galaxies via global gravitational instability. Methods. We conduct a parameter study using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of isolated disc galaxies that are isothermal, self-gravitating and initialised in equilibrium. Our galaxies are uniquely characterised by two dimensionless parameters, the Toomre Q and the rotational Mach number, \mathcal{M}_{\rm c} = v_{\rm c}/c_{\rm s} (ratio of circular velocity to sound speed). We carry out simulations covering a wide range in both. Results. We find that galaxies with Q = 1 form filaments within a single rotation, while galaxies with Q \geq 2 do not. These filaments are kpc long and are semi-regularly spaced along the azimuth. Their morphology, density contrast and formation timescale vary with \mathcal{M}_{\rm c}, with filament spacing and instability onset time both inversely proportional to \mathcal{M}_{\rm c} and the density contrast increasing with \mathcal{M}_{\rm c}. However, their growth rates in all Q = 1 galaxies are ~ 0.5~\Omega, where \Omega is the angular frequency. We compare the filament spacing in our simulations with the ones from JWST/MIRI and HST observations of nearby galaxies and find them in agreement. Conclusions. Our study suggests that self-gravity and rotation are sufficient to form filaments, even in the absence of spiral arms or magnetic fields. Their morphologies are primarily determined by \mathcal{M}_{\rm c}, which parametrises the importance of thermal versus rotational support.

### 36) [2502.18464](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18464v1): Unveiling the Aromatic and Aliphatic Universe at Redshifts z~0.2--0.5 with JWST/NIRCam

<p>
Utilizing deep NIRCam/WFSS data from JWST's FRESCO program, we spectroscopically survey the 3.3 &mu; m aromatic and 3.4 &mu; m aliphatic C--H stretching emission bands of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules in galaxies at redshifts z~0.2--0.5. Unlike pre-JWST studies, largely limited to infrared (IR)-bright galaxies (L_{\rm IR}\gtrsim10^{11}~L_\odot) at z\lesssim0.1, we probe 200 galaxies down to L_{\rm IR}~10^{8.5}--10^{10}~L_\odot well beyond the local Universe. The 3.3 &mu; m emission is detected at \geq3-\sigma in 88 out of 187 galaxies, correlating tightly with galaxy IR luminosity and star formation rate (SFR) and confirming the 3.3 &mu; m PAH as a viable SFR tracer. Despite a large scatter, the 3.3 &mu; m-to-IR luminosity ratio (L_{3.3}/L_{\rm IR}) exhibits a strong metallicity dependence with a drop of L_{3.3}/L_{\rm IR} by a factor of \gtrsim10 at 12+log(O/H)~8.4--8.5 towards lower metallicities. The 3.4 &mu; m emission is detected in 37 out of 159 galaxies, with the 3.4 &mu; m-to-3.3 &mu; m luminosity ratio (L_{3.4}/L_{3.3}) spanning from ~0.05 to ~0.58 (median ~0.19), corresponding to PAH aliphatic fractions of ~0.78%--8.3% (median ~2.9%) in terms of fractional carbon atoms in aliphatic units. While L_{3.4}/L_{3.3} does not depend significantly on redshift, stellar mass, metallicity, or galaxy morphology, it does decrease with various SFR tracers, suggesting that ultraviolet photons in active star-forming regions may strip aliphatic sidegroups from PAH molecules. Our study showcases the unique power of JWST's NIRCam/WFSS to systematically map PAH aromatic and aliphatic content in statistically significant, less-biased galaxy samples, providing critical insights into PAH chemistry and its connection to galaxy properties.

### 37) [2502.18310](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18310v2): High-velocity outflows in [OIII] emitters at z=2.5-9 from JWST NIRSpec medium-resolution spectroscopy

<p> Ryan A. Cooper, Karina I. Caputi, Edoardo Iani, Pierluigi Rinaldi, Guillaume Desprez, Rafael Navarro-Carrera </p>
<p>
We identify galaxies hosting ionised-gas high-velocity outflows from the complete sample of medium resolution (R1000) JWST/NIRSpec MSA spectroscopy taken as part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). From a total sample of 1087 [OIII]5007 emitters we identify 40 galaxies with a blue-side broadened [OIII]5007 line at z=2.5-9. Of these, 34 are strong outflow candidates whilst 6 sources have broadening potentially driven by rotating clumps. Our outflow candidate sample is mainly composed of star-forming galaxies, including ~65% starbursts, which span the stellar mass range log10(M*/Msun)=7.5-11.0. It also includes two candidate type-2 active galactic nuclei (AGN) and a 'little red dot' (LRD). We report a median outflow velocity of 531(+146)(-159) km/s and an overall incidence rate of 3.4%. These values are significantly higher and lower respectively than recent similar works, which we accredit to the limiting resolution of the R1000 spectroscopy and a stricter outflow selection criterion. We find no correlation between the outflow velocity and the galaxy stellar mass or star-formation rate. The median ratio between outflow velocity and escape velocity is 0.77(+0.36)(-0.32), indicating that most outflows cannot escape the galaxy gravitational potentials. We do find an anti-correlation between mass loading factor and stellar mass up to M* ~(10^10)Msun, with most lowest stellar-mass M*&lt;(10^9)Msun galaxies reaching values well above unity, as is the case for local starburst galaxies.

### 38) [2502.17621](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17621v1): JWST/MIRI detection of [Ne V] and [Ne VI] in M83: Evidence for the long sought-after AGN?

<p>
We report the first detections of [Ne V] 14.3 {&mu;}m and [Ne VI] 7.7 {&mu;}m at high confidence (S/N&gt;=6) in the nuclear region of the nearby spiral galaxy M83. Emission line maps of these high ionization lines show several compact structures. Specifically, the [Ne VI] emission is located at 140 pc from the optical nucleus and appears as a point source of size ~&lt;18 pc (FWHM =&lt;0.8"). We investigate the possible source of this extreme emission through comparison with photoionization models and ancillary data. We find that photoionization models of fast radiative shocks are able to reproduce the observed high excitation emission line fluxes only for the lowest preshock density available in the library, n =0.01 cm^-3. Additionally, tailored active galactic nuclei (AGN) photoionization models assuming a two-zone structure are compatible with the observed high ionization fluxes. Our simple AGN model shows that the emission at the location of the [Ne VI] source can be the result of a cloud being ionized by the radiation cone of an AGN. We stress, however, that to definitively confirm an AGN as the main source of the observed emission, more complex modeling accounting for different geometries is required. Previously known as a purely starburst system, these new findings of the nuclear region of M83 will require a reassessment of its nature and of objects similar to it, particularly now that we have access to the unparalleled infrared sensitivity and spatial resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope.

<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has opened a window on many new puzzles in the early Universe, including a population of high-redshift star clusters with extremely high stellar surface density, suggesting unique star formation conditions in the Universe's early evolution. We study the formation and evolution of these first star clusters and galaxies using an AREPO cosmological simulation box designed to resolve the intricate environments of the smallest halos hosting Population III star clusters at z \geq 12. Our approach, which prioritizes baryonic structure identification through a friends-of-friends algorithm, provides new insights into early star cluster formation and delivers predictions directly relevant to observations. We investigate the dynamical properties of these first star clusters and use numerical and analytical methods to understand the populations of virialized and non-virialized systems. Our findings indicate that high-z star clusters in a feedback-free regime can achieve extreme surface densities, consistent with the systems detected by JWST. These results imply that JWST may have the opportunity to uncover stellar systems at high redshift whose dynamical state preserves evidence of the hierarchical structure formation process.

### 40) [2502.16301](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16301v1): On unveiling Buried Nuclei with JWST: a technique for hunting the most obscured galaxy nuclei from local to high redshift

<p>
We analyze JWST NIRSpec+MIRI/MRS observations of the infrared (IR) Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) features in the central regions (~0.26'' at 6 micron; ~50-440 pc depending on the source) of local luminous IR galaxies. In this work, we examine the effect of nuclear obscuration on the PAH features of deeply obscured nuclei, predominantly found in local luminous IR galaxies, and we compare these nuclei with ``normal'' star-forming regions. We extend previous work to include shorter wavelength PAH ratios now available with the NIRSpec+MIRI/MRS spectral range. We introduce a new diagnostic diagram for selecting deeply obscured nuclei based on the 3.3 and 6.2 micron PAH features and/or mid-IR continuum ratios at ~3 and 5 micron. We find that the PAH equivalent width (EW) ratio of the brightest PAH features at shorter wavelengths (at 3.3 and 6.2 micron) is impacted by nuclear obscuration. Although the sample of luminous IR galaxies used in this analysis is relatively small, we find that sources exhibiting a high silicate absorption feature cluster tightly in a specific region of the diagram, whereas star-forming regions experiencing lower extinction levels occupy a different area in the diagram. This demonstrates the potential of this technique to identify buried nuclei. To leverage the excellent sensitivity of the MIRI imager onboard JWST, we extend our method of identifying deeply obscured nuclei at higher redshifts using a selection of MIRI filters. Specifically, the combination of various MIRI JWST filters enables the identification of buried sources beyond the local Universe and up to z~3, where other commonly used obscuration tracers such as the 9.7 micron silicate band, are out of the spectral range of MRS. Our results pave the way for identifying distant deeply obscured nuclei with JWST.

### 41) [2502.15935](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15935v1): The TRGB-SBF Project. III. Refining the HST Surface Brightness Fluctuation Distance Scale Calibration with JWST

<p> Joseph B. Jensen, John P. Blakeslee, Michele Cantiello, Mikaela Cowles, Gagandeep S. Anand, R. Brent Tully, Ehsan Kourkchi, Gabriella Raimondo </p>
<p>
The TRGB-SBF Project team is developing an independent distance ladder using a geometrical calibration of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) method in elliptical galaxies that can in turn be used to set the surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) distance scale independent of Cepheid variables and Type Ia supernovae. In this paper, we use JWST TRGB distances calibrated using the megamaser galaxy NGC 4258 to determine a new Cepheid-independent SBF zero point for HST. This new calibration, along with improved optical color measurements from PanSTARRS and DECam, gives an updated value of the Hubble-Lemaitre constant H_0 = 73.8 \pm 0.7 \pm 2.3 km/s/Mpc that is virtually identical to the previously published result based on SBF distances calibrated using Cepheids (Blakeslee et al. 2021, arxiv:2101.02221). Future improvements in the geometrical calibration of TRGB and additions to the HST SBF survey will further reduce the random and systematic uncertainties on H_0 measured using the extensive HST WFC3/IR SBF dataset. JWST observations of the Coma cluster will soon establish a foundation for the SBF calibration that will extend to much larger distances than is possible with HST.

### 42) [2502.15569](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15569v1): The Evolution of Size and Merger Fraction of Submillimeter Galaxies across 1 &lt; z \lesssim 6 as Observed by JWST

<p> Jian Ren, F. S. Liu, Nan Li, Pinsong Zhao, Qifan Cui, Qi Song, Yubin Li, Hao Mo, Hassen M. Yesuf, Weichen Wang, Fangxia An, Xian Zhong Zheng </p>
<p>
Precise tracking of the growth in galaxy size and the evolution of merger fractions with redshift is vital for understanding the formation history of submillimeter galaxies (SMGs). This study investigates these evolutions over a broad redshift range (1 &lt; z \lesssim 6), using a sample of 222 SMGs with a median redshift of z = 2.61^{+0.89}_{-0.82} identified by ALMA and JCMT, enhanced by the advanced imaging capabilities of the JWST/NIRCam and MIRI. We find significant evolution in effective radii (R_e) in rest-frame V-band (R_e \propto (1 + z)^{-0.87 \pm 0.08}) and near-infrared (NIR) band (R_e \propto (1 + z)^{-0.88 \pm 0.11}), with the NIR size evolution resembling that of massive star-forming galaxies at lower redshift. Visual inspections reveal a major merger fraction of 24.3 \pm 3.7&percnt; and an interaction fraction of up to 48.4 \pm 11.1&percnt;. The major merger fraction exhibits an increase from 14.7\pm9.1&percnt; at z = 1 to 26.6\pm 8.4&percnt; at z = 3, after which it remains approximately constant across the redshift range 3 &lt; z &lt; 6. In contrast, the interaction fraction remains relatively stable across the range 2 &lt; z &lt; 5. Our results indicate that late-stage major mergers are not the primary formation mechanism for SMGs at z&lt;3, while interactions appear to play a significant role across the broader redshift range of 1&lt;z&lt;6. Additionally, HST-based major merger identifications may overestimate the true fraction by a factor of 1.7 at z ~ 2. These findings highlight the varying roles of mergers and interactions in driving the formation of massive, dusty star-forming galaxies across different redshifts.

<p>
We reconstruct the SFHs of 7 massive (M_{\star}\gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\odot}) early-type galaxies (ETGs) in the Virgo cluster by analysing their spatially resolved stellar population (SP), including their UV and H\alpha emission. As part of the VESTIGE survey, we used H\alpha images to select ETGs that show no signs of ongoing star formation. We combined VESTIGE with images from Astrosat/UVIT, GALEX and CFHT from the NGVS to analyse radial spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the FUV to the NIR. The UV emission in these galaxies is likely due to old, low mass stars in post main sequence (PMS) phases, the UV upturn. We fit the radial SEDs with novel SP models that include an old, hot stellar component of PMS stars with various temperatures and energetics. This way, we explore the main stellar parameters responsible for UV upturn stars irregardless of their evolutionary path. Standard models are not able to reproduce the galaxies' central FUV emission (SMA/R_{eff}\lesssim1), while the new models well characterise it through PMS stars with temperatures T\gtrsim25000 K. All galaxies are old (mass-weighted ages \gtrsim10 Gyr) and the most massive M49 and M87 are supersolar within SMA/R_{\rm eff}\lesssim0.2. Overall, we found flat age gradients (\nablaLog(Age)~ -0.04 - 0 dex) and shallow metallicity gradients (\nablaLog(Z)&lt;-0.2 dex), except for M87 (\nablaLog(Z_{\rm M87})~eq-0.45 dex). Our results show that these ETGs formed with timescales \tau\lesssim1500 Myr, having assembled between ~40-90&percnt; of their stellar mass at z~5. This is consistent with recent JWST observations of quiescent massive galaxies at high-z, which are likely the ancestors of the largest ETGs in the nearby Universe. The derived flat/shallow gradients indicate that major mergers might have contributed to the formation and evolution of these galaxies.

<p>
Cold and cool gas (T \leq 10^4 K) in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and its interaction with galaxies remain poorly understood. Simulations predict that cold gas flows into galaxies through cosmic filaments, determining the disk formation and galaxy evolution. The cold gas accretion modes in the CGM and their dependence on dark matter halo mass and redshift remain puzzling. Resolving the kiloparsec-scale kinematics and dynamics of cold gas interacting with the disk, dust, and metals in different environments is particularly lacking at z &gt; 2. Here we report two disturbed cold gas structures traced by ultra-strong MgII absorbers (rest-frame equivalent width Wr &gt; 2 &#8491;) exhibiting high kinematic velocities (&gt; 500 km/s) and their environments at z ~ 4.9 and z ~ 2.6. Observations were conducted with VLT/MUSE, JWST/NIRCam, and ALMA to detect Lya and nebular emission lines, as well as dust continuum emission in the vicinity of these two absorbing gas structures. We identify two Lya emitters associated with a strong MgII absorber pair separated by ~1000 km/s at z~ 4.87. The pair exhibits relative differences in metallicity, dust content, and ionization states, suggesting internal metal and dust exchange within the ultra-large cold gas structure. For the strong MgII absorber at z = 2.5652, we detect a dusty star-forming galaxy at a projected distance of D = 38 kpc. This galaxy exhibits prominent HeI, [SIII], and Paschen\gamma lines, along with significant dust continuum. It has a star formation rate of ~ 121 +/- 33 M_{\odot}/yr and likely harbors a rotating disk. These findings tentatively suggest that cold gas at high redshifts plays a critical role in driving disk formation and actively participates in the transfer of metals and dust within the overdense regions of the CGM.

### 45) [2502.14031](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14031v1): Modeling Galaxies in the Early Universe with Supernova Dust Attenuation

<p> Jed McKinney, Olivia Cooper, Caitlin M. Casey, Julian B. Munoz, Hollis Akins, Erini Lambrides, Arianna S. Long </p>
<p>
Supernova may be the dominant channel by which dust grains accumulate in galaxies during the first Gyr of cosmic time as formation channels important for lower redshift galaxies, e.g., AGB stars and grain growth, may not have had sufficient time to take over. Supernovae (SNe) produce fewer small grains, leading to a flatter attenuation law. In this work, we fit observations of 138 spectroscopically confirmed z&gt;6 galaxies adopting standard spectral energy distribution modeling assumptions and compare standard attenuation law prescriptions to that of supernova-produced dust alone. Compared to SMC dust, SNe attenuation yields up to 0.5 mag higher A_V, and 0.4 dex larger stellar masses. SNe dust attenuation also finds better fits to the rest-frame UV photometry with lower \chi^2_{\rm UV}. This allows the observed UV luminosities taken from the models to be fainter by 0.2 dex on average. The systematically fainter rest-frame UV luminosities for fixed observed photometry could help resolve current tension between the ionizing photon production implied by JWST observations and the redshift evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction. Given these systematic effects and the physical constraint of cosmic time itself, pure supernova dust attenuation laws should be a standard consideration in fitting to the spectral energy distributions of z&gt;6 galaxies.

<p>
We measure radial stellar age gradients in the relatively isolated gas-rich dwarf irregular WLM, combining JWST NIRCam and NIRISS imaging with six archival Hubble fields over semi-major axis equivalent distances of 0\lesssimR_{SMA}\lesssim4 kpc (\lesssim3R_{hl}). Fitting lifetime star formation histories (SFHs) to resolved color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), radial age gradients are quantified using \tau_{90} and \tau_{50}, the lookback times to form 90&percnt; and 50&percnt; of the cumulative stellar mass. We find that globally, the outskirts of WLM are older on average, with (\delta\tau_{90}, \delta\tau_{50})/\deltaR_{SMA}=(0.82^{+0.10}_{-0.10}, 1.60^{+0.23}_{-0.22}) Gyr/kpc (stat.), in good agreement with simulations. However, we also detect an azimuthal dependence of radial stellar age gradients, finding that stars on the leading edge of WLM (relative to its proper motion) are both younger and have a flatter age gradient compared to the trailing edge. This difference persists over 0.6\lesssimR_{SMA}\lesssim3.2 kpc (~0.5-2.5R_{hl}) and lookback times up to ~8 Gyr, and is robust to assumed stellar evolutionary model. Our results are consistent with star formation triggered by ram pressure stripping from a circumgalactic and/or intergalactic medium, suggested by recent HI observations. If confirmed, processes typifying dense environments, such as ram pressure stripping, may be more relevant to the evolution of isolated galaxies than previously thought.

### 47) [2502.12538](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12538v1): Bridging Theory and Observations: Insights into Star Formation Efficiency and Dust Attenuation in z &gt; 5 Galaxies

<p> Daisuke Toyouchi, Hidenobu Yajima, Andrea Ferrara, Kentaro Nagamine </p>
<p>
We investigate early galaxy evolution by modeling self-consistently their radially-resolved evolution of gas, stars, heavy elements, and dust content. Our model successfully reproduces various observed properties of JWST-identified galaxies at z &gt; 5, including sizes, stellar masses, star formation rates (SFR), metallicities, and dust-to-stellar mass ratios. We show that the star formation efficiency (SFE), f_\ast \equiv {\rm SFR}/(f_{\rm b} \dot{M}_{\rm h}), is regulated by the global equilibrium between cosmological gas inflows, star formation, and gas outflows. Our model predicts f_\ast \lesssim 20~&percnt; for galaxies with halo masses of M_{\rm h} ~ 10^{11-12}\, M_\odot down to z = 5, allowing them to reach intrinsic UV magnitudes of M_{\rm UV} \lesssim -22~{\rm mag}; when dust attenuation is ignored, the predicted UV luminosity function (LF) at z ~ 12 agrees well with observations. However, our model also suggests that these galaxies would be heavily obscured by dust, with high optical depths at 1500~&#8491;~of \tau_{1500} \gtrsim 10, causing the dust-attenuated UV LF to fall significantly below the observed one. This discrepancy highlights the need for mechanisms that mitigate strong dust attenuation, such as dust evacuation from star-forming regions and/or preferential production of large dust grains. Further exploration of these processes is essential for understanding the early stages of galaxy evolution.

We present the magnetic field in the dense material of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way, traced in 850 &mu;m polarized dust emission as part of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) B-fields In STar-forming Region Observations (BISTRO) Survey. We observe a highly ordered magnetic field across the CMZ between Sgr B2 and Sgr C, which is strongly preferentially aligned with the orbital gas flows within the clouds of the CMZ. We find that the observed relative orientations are non-random at a &gt;99% confidence level and are consistent with models in which the magnetic field vectors are aligned within 30^{o} to the gas flows in 3D. The deviations from aligned magnetic fields are most prominent at positive Galactic longitudes, where the CMZ clouds are more massive, denser, and more actively forming stars. Our observed strongly preferentially parallel magnetic field morphology leads us to hypothesize that in the absence of star formation, the magnetic field in the CMZ is entrained in the orbital gas flows around Sgr A^{*}, while gravitational collapse and feedback in star-forming regions can locally reorder the field. This magnetic field behavior is similar to that observed in the CMZ of the nuclear starburst galaxy NGC 253. This suggests that despite its current low star formation rate, the CMZ of the Milky Way is analogous to those of more distant, actively star-forming, galaxies.

The Athena mission entered a redefinition phase in July 2022, driven by the imperative to reduce the mission cost at completion for the European Space Agency below an acceptable target, while maintaining the flagship nature of its science return. This notably called for a complete redesign of the X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) cryogenic architecture towards a simpler active cooling chain. Passive cooling via successive radiative panels at spacecraft level is now used to provide a 50 K thermal environment to an X-IFU owned cryostat. 4.5 K cooling is achieved via a single remote active cryocooler unit, while a multi-stage Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator ensures heat lift down to the 50 mK required by the detectors. Amidst these changes, the core concept of the readout chain remains robust, employing Transition Edge Sensor microcalorimeters and a SQUID-based Time-Division Multiplexing scheme. Noteworthy is the introduction of a slower pixel. This enables an increase in the multiplexing factor (from 34 to 48) without compromising the instrument energy resolution, hence keeping significant system margins to the new 4 eV resolution requirement. This allows reducing the number of channels by more than a factor two, and thus the resource demands on the system, while keeping a 4' field of view (compared to 5' before). In this article, we will give an overview of this new architecture, before detailing its anticipated performances. Finally, we will present the new X-IFU schedule, with its short term focus on demonstration activities towards a mission adoption in early 2027.

We present an analysis of the rest-frame optical spectra of 22 [OIII]\lambda4363 detected galaxies in the redshift range 1.65 &lt; z &lt; 7.92 (with \langle z \rangle = 4.05) from JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution observations taken as part of the EXCELS survey. To supplement these high-redshift sources, we also consider a sample of 782 local [OIII]\lambda4363 detected galaxies from the DESI Early Data Release. Our analysis demonstrates that many strong-line calibrations are biased in the early Universe due to the systematic evolution in ionization conditions with redshift. However, the recently introduced \widehat{R} calibration mostly removes the dependence on ionization state and can be considered a largely redshift-independent calibration. In a similar spirit, we introduce a new strong-line diagnostic, \widehat{RNe}, which can be used to robustly estimate metallicities when the [OIII]\lambda5007 is redshifted out of the wavelength range of JWST/NIRSpec at z &gt; 9.5. We also show that strong-line diagnostics using the [NII]\lambda6584 emission line are likely to be biased at high-redshift due to a moderate enhancement in the average N/O abundance ratios (at fixed O/H) in these sources. Finally, we discuss the location of our new [OIII]\lambda4363 detected galaxies at z ~eq 4 on the mass-metallicity plane and investigate the redshift evolution of the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR). We find tentative evidence for an increasing deviation from the FMR at z &gt; 4 which might indicate fundamental differences in the baryon cycle at these redshifts. However, more data are required as our high-redshift constraints are still based on a relatively small sample of galaxies and the significance of the deviation is strongly dependent on the assumed form of the fundamental metallicity relation.

### 51) [2502.10282](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10282v1): The impact of medium-width bands on the selection, and subsequent luminosity function measurements, of high-z galaxies

New, ultra-deep medium-width photometric coverage with JWST's NIRCam instrument provides the potential for much improved photo-z reliability at high redshifts. In this study, we conduct a systematic analysis of the JADES Origins Field, which contains 14 broad- and medium-width near-infrared bands, to assess the benefits of medium band photometry on high-z sample completeness and contamination rates. Using imaging with depths of AB mag 29.8-30.35, we conduct an experiment to observe how high-z selections differ when images are artificially degraded or bands are removed. In parallel, the same experiments are conducted on simulated catalogues from the JAGUAR semi-analytic model to examine if the behaviour from observations can be replicated. We find sample completeness is high (80&percnt;+) and contamination low (&lt;4&percnt;) when in the 10\sigma+ regime, even without the use of any medium-width bands. The addition of medium-width bands leads to notable increases in completeness (~10&percnt;) but multiple bands are required to improve contamination rates due to the small redshift ranges over which they probe strong emission lines. Incidents of Balmer-Lyman degeneracy increase in the 5-7\sigma regime and this can be replicated in both simulated catalogues and degraded real data. We measure the faint-end of the UV LF at 8.5&lt;z&lt;13.5, finding high number densities that agree with previous JWST observations. Overall, medium bands are effective at increasing completeness and reducing contamination, but investment in achieving at least comparable depths in the blue (&lt;1.5&mu;m) as achieved in the red is also found to be key to fully reducing contamination from high-z samples.

### 52) [2502.10271](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10271v1): MICONIC: JWST Unveils Shocked Hot Core Chemistry in the Western Nucleus of Arp 220

<p>
We present full 3-28 micron JWST MIRI/MRS and NIRSpec/IFU spectra of the western nucleus of Arp 220, the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxy. This nucleus has long been suggested to possibly host an embedded Compton-thick AGN. Millimeter observations of the dust continuum suggest the presence of a distinct 20 pc core with a dust temperature of T_\mathrm{d} \gtrsim 500~\mathrm{K}, in addition to a 100 pc circumnuclear starburst disk. However, unambiguously identifying the nature of this core is challenging, due to the immense obscuration, the nuclear starburst activity, and the nearby eastern nucleus. With the JWST integral field spectrographs, we can, for the first time, separate the two nuclei across this full wavelength range, revealing a wealth of molecular absorption features towards the western nucleus. We analyse the rovibrational bands detected at 4-22 micron, deriving column densities and rotational temperatures for 10 distinct species. Optically thick features of C_2H_2, HCN and HNC suggest that this molecular gas is hidden behind a curtain of cooler dust, and indicate that the column densities of C_2H_2 and HCN are an order of magnitude higher than previously derived from Spitzer observations. We identify a warm HCN component with rotational temperature T_\mathrm{rot} = 330~\mathrm{K}, which we associate with radiative excitation by the hot inner nucleus. We propose a geometry where the detected molecular gas is located in the inner regions of the starburst disk, directly surrounding the hot 20 parsec core. The chemical footprint of the western nucleus is reminiscent of that of hot cores, with additional evidence for shocks. No evidence for the presence of an AGN in the form of X-ray-driven chemistry or extreme excitation is found.

<p>
(Abridged) JWST observations have measured the ice composition toward two highly-extinguished field stars in the Chamaeleon I cloud. The observed extinction excess on the long-wavelength side of the H2O ice band at 3 micron has been attributed to a mixture of CH3OH with ammonia hydrates, which suggests that CH3OH ice could have formed in a water-rich environment with little CO depletion. Laboratory experiments and quantum chemical calculations suggest that CH3OH could form via the grain surface reactions CH3+OH and/or C+H2O in water-rich ices. However, no dedicated chemical modelling has been carried out thus far to test their efficiency and dependence on the astrochemical code employed. We model the ice chemistry in the Chamaeleon I cloud using a set of astrochemical codes (MAGICKAL, MONACO, Nautilus, UCLCHEM, and KMC simulations) to test the effects of the different code architectures and of the assumed ice chemistry. Our models show that the JWST ice observations are better reproduced for gas densities &gt;1e5 cm-3 and collapse times &gt;1e5 yr. CH3OH ice forms predominantly (&gt;99%) via CO hydrogenation. The contribution of reactions CH3+OH and C+H2O, is negligible. The CO2 ice may form either via CO+OH or CO+O depending on the code. However, KMC simulations reveal that both mechanisms are efficient despite the low rate constant of the CO+O surface reaction. CH4 is largely underproduced for all codes except for UCLCHEM, for which a higher amount of atomic C is available during the initial translucent cloud phase. Large differences in the ice abundances are found at Tdust&lt;12 K between diffusive and non-diffusive chemistry codes. This is due to the fact that non-diffusive chemistry takes over diffusive chemistry at such low Tdust. This could explain the rather constant ice chemical composition found in Chamaeleon I and other dense cores despite the different visual extinctions probed.

We leverage JWST data from the COSMOS-Web Survey in order to provide updated measurements on the auto-power spectrum of the now resolved Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) and its coherence with the unresolved soft Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB) observed by Chandra at z &gt; 6. Maps of the CIB in the F277W and F444W NIRCam filters are constructed with sources fainter than AB mag = 25 and cross-correlated with the CXB in the [0.5-2] keV band. We find that on scales between 1 and 1000'' the CIB-CXB cross-power in both NIRCam filters is statistically significant with signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) of 4.80 and 6.20 respectively from redshifts 0 &lt; z &lt; 13. In our high-z (6 &lt; z &lt; 13) interval we find coherence in both filters with a S/N of 7.32 and 5.39 respectively. These results suggest that there are X-ray emitting galaxies resolved by JWST, including star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We fit the large-scale biasing of the IR sources producing the CIB as a function of z with results consistent with prior measurements and place constraints on the CXB flux and biasing at low- and high-z. The CXB flux measurements presented in this study suggest that approximately 94% of the [0.5-2] keV CXB is resolved, and this value is consistent within 2\sigma with the complete resolution of the [0.5-2] keV CXB.

### 55) [2502.09384](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09384v1): Predicting the detectability of sulphur-bearing molecules in the solid phase with simulated spectra of JWST instruments

To date, gas phase observations of sulphur in dense interstellar environments have only constrained the molecular carriers of 1% of its predicted cosmic abundance. An additional 5% is known to be locked up in molecular solids in dense clouds, leaving the main reservoir of depleted sulphur in the solid phase unknown. The spectral resolution and sensitivity of the JWST could make a substantial difference in detecting part of this missing sulphur, with its wavelength coverage that includes vibrational absorption features of the S-carriers H2S, OCS, SO2, CS2, SO, CS, and S8. The aim of this study is to determine whether these molecules may be viable candidates for detection. We carried out new laboratory measurements of the IR absorption spectra of CS2 and S8 to update the IR band strength of the most intense CS2 absorption feature at 6.8 {&mu;}m, as well as to determine that of S8 at 20.3 {&mu;}m for the first time. These data, along with values previously reported in the literature, allow us to evaluate which S-bearing species could be potentially detected with JWST in interstellar ices. Taking the literature abundances of the major ice species determined by previous IR observations towards starless cores, LYSOs and MYSOs, we generated simulated IR spectra using the characteristics of the instruments on the JWST. Thus, we have been able to establish a case study for three stages of the star formation process. We conclude that the detection of S-bearing molecules remains challenging. Despite these obstacles, the detection of H2S and potentially SO2 should be possible in regions with favourable physical and chemical conditions. In contrast, S8 would remain undetected. Although the sensitivity of JWST is insufficient to determine the sulphur budget in the solid state, the detection of an additional icy sulphur compound (H2S, SO2) would enable us to elevate our knowledge of sulphur chemistry.

### 56) [2502.08885](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08885v1): Morphological Demographics of Galaxies at z~ 10-16: Log-Normal Size Distribution and Exponential Profiles Consistent with the Disk Formation Scenario

We homogeneously investigate the morphological properties of 169 galaxies at z~10-16 with deep JWST NIRCam images employing our established techniques of GALFIT modeling and uncertainty evaluation (systematics+statistics). We obtain effective radii r_{\rm e} ranging 20-500 pc, with a distribution significantly broader than the scatter made by the uncertainties. We find that the r_{\rm e} distribution is well described by a log-normal distribution with a mean of r_{\rm e}=133^{+13}_{-12} pc and a standard deviation of \sigma_{{\rm ln}r_{\rm e}} = 0.52 \pm 0.08. The standard deviation is comparable to that of local galaxies, indicating no significant evolution over z~ 0-10. We estimate the virial radius r_{\rm vir} from the stellar masses via the star-formation main sequence and stellar-to-halo mass relation, obtaining a stellar-to-halo size ratio r_{\rm e}/r_{\rm vir} = 0.015^{+0.015}_{-0.005}, which is comparable to those of star-forming galaxies in the local and low-z Universe. Our results of 1) the log-normal r_{\rm e} distribution, 2) the standard deviation value, and 3) a mean radial profile consistent with an exponential profile (n=1.3\pm0.6) suggest that galaxies at z~10-16 generally follow the classical galaxy disk formation scenario with a specific disk angular momentum fraction of j_{\rm d} / m_{\rm d} ~ 0.5-1. Interestingly, we identify two remarkable outliers GN-z11 (z_{\rm spec}=10.60) and GHZ2 (z_{\rm spec}=12.34) with r_{\rm e}=55^{+5}_{-6} pc and 39\pm11 pc, respectively, that may not be explained by disk structures but by AGN or compact star-forming galaxies merging underway in short periods of time, as reproduced in numerical simulations.

### 57) [2502.08701](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08701v1): Early Galaxies from Rare Inflationary Processes and JWST Observations

<p> Soubhik Kumar, Neal Weiner </p>
<p>
Rare Poisson processes (PP) during cosmic inflation can lead to signatures that are localized in position space and are not well captured by the standard two- or higher-point correlation functions of primordial density perturbations. As an example, PP can lead to localized overdense regions that are far denser than the ones produced through standard inflationary fluctuations. As a result, such overdense regions collapse earlier than expected based on the standard \LambdaCDM model and would host anomalously high-redshift galaxies. We describe some general aspects of such PP and consider a particular realization in the context of inflationary particle production. We then show that the masses and redshifts of the resulting galaxies can lie in a range discoverable by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and future surveys, while being consistent with existing constraints on the matter power spectrum and UV luminosity functions at lower redshifts.

### 58) [2502.08619](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08619v1): Directly Imaging the Cooling Flow in the Phoenix Cluster

In the centers of many galaxy clusters, the hot (~10^7 K) intracluster medium (ICM) can become dense enough that it should cool on short timescales. However, the low measured star formation rates in massive central galaxies and absence of soft X-ray lines from cooling gas suggest that most of this gas never cools - this is known as the "cooling flow problem." The latest observations suggest that black hole jets are maintaining the vast majority of gas at high temperatures. A cooling flow has yet to be fully mapped through all gas phases in any galaxy cluster. Here, we present new observations of the Phoenix cluster using the James Webb Space Telescope to map the [Ne VI] \lambda7.652&mu;m emission line, allowing us to probe gas at 10^{5.5} K on large scales. These data show extended [Ne VI] emission cospatial with (i) the cooling peak in the ICM, (ii) the coolest gas phases, and (iii) sites of active star formation. Taken together, these imply a recent episode of rapid cooling, causing a short-lived spike in the cooling rate which we estimate to be 5,000-23,000 M_\odot yr^{-1}. These data provide the first large-scale map of gas at temperatures between 10^5-10^6 K in a cluster core, and highlight the critical role that black hole feedback plays in not only regulating but also promoting cooling.

The methylidyne cation (CH^+) and the methyl cation (CH_3^+) are building blocks of organic molecules, yet their coupled formation and excitation mechanisms remain mainly unprobed. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its high spatial resolution and good spectral resolution, provides unique access to the detection of these molecules. Our goal is to use the first detection of CH^+ and CH_3^+ rovibrational emission in the Orion Bar and in the protoplanetary disk d203-506, irradiated by the Trapezium cluster, to probe their formation and excitation mechanisms and constrain the physico-chemical conditions. We use spectro-imaging acquired using both the NIRSpec and MIRI-MRS instruments to study the CH^+ and CH_3^+ spatial distribution at very small scales, and compare it to excited H_2 emission. CH^+ and CH_3^+ emissions originate from the same region as highly excited H_2. Our comparison between the Bar and d203-506 reveals that both CH^+ and CH_3^+ excitation and/or formation are highly dependent on gas density. The excitation temperature of the observed CH^+ and CH_3^+ rovibrational lines is around T ~ 1500 K in the Bar and T ~ 800 K in d203-506. Moreover, the column densities derived from the rovibrational emission are less than 0.1 % of the total known (CH^+) and expected (CH_3^+) column densities. These results show that CH^+ and CH_3^+ level populations strongly deviate from ETL. CH^+ rovibrational emission can be explained by chemical formation pumping with excited H_2 via C^+ + H_2^* = CH^+ + H. These results support a gas phase formation pathway of CH^+ and CH_3^+ via successive hydrogen abstraction reactions. However, we do not find any evidence of CH_2^+ emission in the JWST spectrum. Finally, observed CH^+ intensities coupled with chemical formation pumping model provide a diagnostic tool to trace the local density.

### 60) [2502.08113](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08113v1): Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon and the Ultraviolet Extinction Bump at the Cosmic Dawn

<p> Qi Lin, Xuejuan Yang, Aigen Li, Joris Witstok </p>
<p>
First detected in 1965, the mysterious ultraviolet (UV) extinction bump at 2175 Angstrom is the most prominent spectroscopic feature superimposed on the interstellar extinction curve. Its carrier remains unidentified over the past six decades ever since its first detection, although many candidate materials have been proposed. Widely seen in the interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way as well as several nearby galaxies, this bump was recently also detected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at the cosmic dawn in JADES-GS-z6-0, a distant galaxy at redshift z~6.71, corresponding to a cosmic age of just 800 million years after the Big Bang. Differing from that of the known Galactic and extragalactic interstellar sightlines which always peak at ~2175 Angstrom, the bump seen at z~6.71 in JADES-GS-z6-0 peaks at an appreciably longer wavelength of ~2263 Angstrom and is the narrowest among all known Galactic and extragalactic extinction bumps. Here we show that the combined electronic absorption spectra quantum-chemically computed for a number of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules closely reproduce the bump detected by JWST in JADES-GS-z6-0. This suggests that PAH molecules have already been pervasive in the Universe at an epoch when asymptotic giant branch stars have not yet evolved to make dust.

### 61) [2502.08112](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08112v1): What causes the ultraviolet extinction bump at the cosmic dawn?

<p> Qi Li, Xuejuan Yang, Aigen Li </p>
<p>
The enigmatic ultraviolet (UV) extinction bump at 2175 Angstrom, the strongest spectroscopic absorption feature superimposed on the interstellar extinction curve, has recently been detected at the cosmic dawn by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in JADES-GS-z6-0, a distant galaxy at redshift z=6.71, corresponding to a cosmic age of just 800 million years after the Big Bang. Although small graphite grains have historically long been suggested as the carrier of the 2175 Angstrom extinction bump and graphite grains are expected to have already been pervasive in the early Universe, in this work we demonstrate that small graphite grains are not responsible for the UV extinction bump seen at the cosmic dawn in JADES-GS-z6-0, as the extinction bump arising from small graphite grains is too broad and peaks at wavelengths that are too short to be consistent with what is seen in JADES-GS-z6-0.

### 62) [2502.07882](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07882v2): A Sizable Discrepancy in Ground-Based JAGB Distances to Nearby Galaxies

<p> Gagandeep S. Anand </p>
<p>
Recently, Freedman et al. (2024) report agreement of distances derived from the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) and the J-Region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) at the 1&percnt; level for both nearby galaxies with ground-based imaging (0.5-4 Mpc) as well distant galaxies with JWST imaging (7-23 Mpc). Here we compare the same ground-based JAGB distances to uniformly reduced space-based optical TRGB distances from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We uncover a significant offset between these two distance scales of \Delta&mu; = 0.17 \pm 0.04 (stat) \pm 0.06 (sys) mag (9&percnt; in distance), with the HST TRGB distances being further. Inspections of the HST color-magnitude diagrams make a compelling case that the issue lies in the underlying JAGB distances. The source of the disagreement may lie with the lower resolution or photometric calibration of the ground-based near-infrared data, a contrast to the general agreement found between JWST JAGB and other space-based, second-rung distance indicators (Cepheids, Miras, TRGB) presented within Riess et al. (2024). High-resolution, near-infrared observations from an ongoing HST program will enable the simultaneous measurement of Cepheid, JAGB, and TRGB distances in four of these nearby galaxies and allow us to investigate whether the discrepancy noted here is due to ground-based observational systematics, or something intrinsic to the JAGB method relevant for this particular sample. A resolution of this discrepancy is required if the JAGB is to be used to determine a highly precise local value of the Hubble constant.

### 63) [2502.07875](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07875v2): Investigating photometric and spectroscopic variability in the multiply-imaged Little Red Dot A2744-QSO1

<p>
JWST observations have uncovered a new population of red, compact objects at high redshifts dubbed 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs), which typically show broad emission lines and are thought to be dusty Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Some of their other features, however, challenge the AGN explanation, such as prominent Balmer breaks and extremely faint or even missing metal high-ionization lines, X-ray, or radio emission, including in deep stacks. Time variability is a unique test of AGN activity. Here, we exploit the z=7.045 multiply-imaged LRD A2744-QSO1, which offers a unique test of variability due to lensing-induced time delays between the three images spanning 22 yr (2.7 yr in the rest-frame), to investigate its photometric and spectroscopic variability. We find the equivalent widths (EWs) of the broad H\alpha and H\beta lines, which are independent of magnification and other systematics, to exhibit significant variations, up to 18\pm3 % for H\alpha and up to 22\pm8 % in H\beta, on a timescale of 875 d (2.4 yr) in the rest-frame. This suggests that A2744-QSO1 is indeed an AGN. We find no significant photometric variability beyond the limiting systematic uncertainties, so it currently cannot be determined whether the EW variations are due to line-flux or continuum variability. These results are consistent with a typical damped random walk (DRW) variability model for an AGN like A2744-QSO1 (M_{\mathrm{BH}}=4\times10^7 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}) given the sparse sampling of the light-curve with the available data. Our results therefore support the AGN interpretation of this LRD, and highlight the need for further photometric and spectroscopic monitoring in order to build a detailed and reliable light-curve.

<p>
Nearby blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCDs) share similar properties with objects from the Epoch of Reionization revealed by JWST, in terms of low stellar mass, low metallicity and high specific star-formation rate. Thus, they represent ideal local laboratories for detailed multi-wavelength studies to understand their properties and the mechanisms shaping them. We report the first JWST MIRI/MRS observations of the BCD SBS 0335-052 E, analyzing MIR emission lines tracing different levels of ionization (e.g., [NeII], [SIV], [NeIII], [OIV], [NeV]) of the ionized gas. SBS 0335-052 E MIR emission is characterized by a bright point source, located in one of the youngest and most embedded stellar clusters (t~3 Myr, A_V~20), and underlying extended high-ionization emission (i.e., [OIV], [NeV]) from the surroundings of the older and less dusty stellar clusters (t&lt; 20 Myr, A_V~8). From the comparison with state-of-the-art models, we can exclude shocks, X-ray binaries, and old stellar populations as the main sources of the high ionization. Interestingly, a 4-16% contribution of a ~10^5 M_\odot intermediate massive black hole (IMBH) is needed to justify the strong [NeV]/[NeII] and would be consistent with optical/UV line ratios from previous studies. However, even IMBH models cannot explain the strongest [OIV]/[NeIII]. Also, star-forming models (regardless of including X-ray binaries) struggle to reproduce even the lower ionization line ratios (e.g., [SIV]/[NeII]) typically observed in BCDs. Overall, while current models suggest the need to account for an accreting IMBH in this high-z analog, limitations still exist in predicting high-ionization emission lines (I.P. &gt;54 eV) when modeling these low-metallicity environments, thus other sources of ionization cannot be fully ruled out.

### 65) [2502.06942](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06942v1): Shedding light on the star formation rate-halo accretion rate connection and halo quenching mechanism via DECODE, the Discrete statistical sEmi-empiriCal mODEl

Aims: The relative roles of the physical mechanisms involved in quenching galaxy star formation are still unclear. We tackle this fundamental problem with our cosmological semi-empirical model DECODE (Discrete statistical sEmi-empiriCal mODEl), designed to predict galaxy stellar mass assembly histories, from minimal input assumptions. Methods: Specifically, in this work the star formation history of each galaxy is calculated along its progenitor dark matter halo by assigning at each redshift a star formation rate extracted from a monotonic star formation rate-halo accretion rate (SFR-HAR) relation derived from abundance matching between the (observed) SFR function and the (numerically predicted) HAR function, a relation that is also predicted by the TNG100 simulation. SFRs are integrated across cosmic time to build up the mass of galaxies, which may halt their star formation following input physical quenching recipes. Results: In this work we test the popular halo quenching scenario and we find that: 1) the assumption of a monotonic relation between SFR and HAR allows to reproduce the number densities of the bulk of star-forming galaxies in the local Universe; 2) the halo quenching is sufficient to reproduce the statistics of the quenched galaxies and flat (steep) high-mass end of the SMHM relation (SMF); and 3) to align with the observed steep (flat) low-mass end of the SMHM (SMF) additional quenching processes in the least massive haloes are needed. Conclusions: DECODE is an invaluable tool and will pave the way to investigate the origin of newly observed high-redshift objects from the latest ongoing facilities such as JWST and Euclid.

<p>
We present first results from James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec), Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), and Keck Cosmic Webb Imager (KCWI) integral field spectroscopy of the powerful but highly obscured host-galaxy of the jetted radio source Cygnus A. We detect 169 infrared emission lines at 1.7--27 micron and explore the kinematics and physical properties of the extended narrow-line region (NLR) in unprecedented detail. The density-stratified NLR appears to be shaped by the initial blow-out and ongoing interaction of the radio jet with the interstellar medium, creating a multi-phase bicone with a layered structure composed of molecular and ionized gas. The NLR spectrum, with strong coronal emission at kpc-scale, is well-modeled by AGN photoionization. We find evidence that the NLR is rotating around the radio axis, perhaps mediated by magnetic fields and driven by angular momentum transfer from the radio jet. The overall velocity field of the NLR is well described by 250 km/s outflow along biconical spiral flow lines, combining both rotation and outflow signatures. There is particularly bright [Fe II] 1.644 micron emission from a dense, high-velocity dispersion, photoionized clump of clouds found near the projected radio axis. Outflows of 600--2000 km/s are found in bullets and streamers of ionized gas that may be ablated by the radio jet from these clouds, driving a local outflow rate of 40 Msun/yr.

### 67) [2502.06254](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06254v1): Classifying merger stages with adaptive deep learning and cosmological hydrodynamical simulations

<p> Rosa de Graaff, Berta Margalef-Bentabol, Lingyu Wang, Antonio La Marca, William J. Pearson, Vicente Rodriguez-Gomez, Mike Walmsley </p>
<p>
Hierarchical merging of galaxies plays an important role in galaxy formation and evolution. Mergers could trigger key evolutionary phases such as starburst activities and active accretion periods onto supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies. We aim to detect mergers and merger stages (pre- and post-mergers) across cosmic history and test whether it is better to detect mergers and their merger stages simultaneously or hierarchically. In addition, we want to test the impact of merger time relative to the coalescence of merging galaxies. First, we generated realistic mock JWST images of simulated galaxies selected from the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Then we trained deep learning (DL) models in the Zoobot Python package to classify galaxies into merging/non-merging galaxies and their merger stages. We used two different set-ups: (i) two-stage, in which we classify galaxies into mergers and non-mergers and then classify the mergers into pre-mergers and post-mergers, and (ii) one-stage, in which merger/non-merger and merger stages are classified simultaneously. We found that the one-stage classification set-up moderately outperforms the two-stage set-up, offering better overall accuracy and precision, particularly for the non-merger class. Pre-mergers can be classified with the highest precision in both set-ups, possibly due to the more recognisable merging features and the presence of merging companions. The image signal-to-noise ratio affects the performance of the DL classifiers, but not much after a certain threshold is crossed. Both precision and recall of the classifiers depend strongly on merger time, finding it more difficult to identify true mergers observed at stages that are more distant to coalescence. For pre-mergers, we recommend selecting mergers which will merge in the next 0.4 Gyrs, to achieve a good balance between precision and recall.

### 68) [2502.06016](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06016v1): Dissecting the massive pristine, neutral gas reservoir of a remarkably bright galaxy at z = 14.179

<p>
At cosmic dawn, the first stars and galaxies are believed to form from and be deeply embedded in clouds of dense, pristine gas. Here we present a study of the JWST/NIRSpec data of the most distant, spectroscopically confirmed galaxy observed to date, JADES-GS-z14-0 (GS-z14 for short), at z=14.179, combined with recent far-infrared measurements of the [OIII]-88&mu;m and [CII]-158&mu;m line transitions and underlying dust-continuum emission. Based on the observed prominent damped Lyman-\alpha (DLA) absorption profile, we determine a substantial neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) column density, \log (N_{\rm HI} / {\rm cm^{-2}}) = 22.27^{+0.08}_{-0.09}, consistent with previous estimates though seemingly at odds with the dynamical and gas mass of the galaxy. Using various independent but complementary approaches, considering the implied neutral gas mass from the DLA measurement, the star-formation rate surface density, and the metal abundance, we demonstrate that the total gas mass of GS-z14 is of the order \log (M_{\rm gas} / M_\odot) = 9.8\pm 0.3. This implies a substantial gas mass fraction, f_{\rm gas} \gtrsim 0.9 and that the bulk of the interstellar medium (ISM) is in the form of HI. We show that the derived gas mass is fully consistent with the non-detection of [CII]-158&mu;m, assuming an appropriate scaling to the neutral gas. The low dust-to-gas ratio, A_V/N_{\rm HI} = (1.3\pm 0.6)\times 10^{-23}\,mag\,cm^2, derived in the line-of-sight through the DLA further indicates that the absorbing gas is more pristine than the central, star-forming regions probed by the [OIII]-88&mu;m emission. These results highlight the implications for far-infrared line-detection searchers attainable with ALMA and demonstrate that the bright, relatively massive galaxy GS-z14 at z=14.179 is deeply embedded in a substantial, pristine HI gas reservoir dominating its baryonic matter content.

The selection of candidate high-redshift galaxies using the dropout technique targeting the Lyman-break signature sometimes results in very bright objects, which would be too luminous to be easily explained if they are indeed at the expected redshifts. Here we present a systematic study of very bright dropouts selected through successive bands of the NIRCam instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Using the public NIRCam data in four blank fields over 500~arcmin^2, 300 such objects were found. They have magnitudes in F356W &lt;25.1~mag or &lt;26.0~mag depending on the dropout passband, and the vast majority of them (&gt;80&percnt;) have very red F115W-F356W colors &gt; 2.0~mag, which make them qualify as ``extremely red objects'' (EROs). We focus on the 137 objects that also have mid-IR observations from the JWST MIRI instrument. The analysis of their spectral energy distributions shows that these very bright dropouts are dominated by low-redshift (z~ 1--4) galaxies (\gtrsim 67&percnt;). However, a non-negligible fraction (\gtrsim 7&percnt;) could be at high redshifts. Seven of our objects have secure spectroscopic redshifts from the JWST NIRSpec identifications, and the results confirm this picture: while six are low-redshift galaxies at z\approx 3, one is a known galaxy at z=8.679 recovered in our sample. If more objects from our sample are confirmed to be at high redshifts, they could pose a severe challenge in explaining their properties, such as the extremely high star formation rates and stellar masses.

### 70) [2502.05266](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05266v1): Radio Signatures of a Massive Black Hole in GHZ9 at z ~ 10

<p> Muhammad A. Latif, Daniel J. Whalen </p>
<p>
Synergies between the {\em James Webb Space Telescope} ({\em JWST}) and the {\em Chandra} X-ray observatory have advanced the observational frontier by detecting a handful of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) beyond z ~ 10. In particular, the recent discovery of a candidate \rm 8 \times 10^7~M_{\odot} black hole (BH) in the galaxy GHZ9 at z = 10.4 favors massive seed formation channels for these objects. Motivated by prospects for their detection in radio by recent studies, we estimate radio fluxes for GHZ9 and explore the possibility of their detection with the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) and next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA). We find that ngVLA should be able to detect radio emission from GHZ9 for integration times as short as 1 hr while SKA will require integration times of up to 100 hr. We also find that radio emission from the BH can be distinguished from that due to H II regions and supernovae in its host galaxy. The detection of a few hundred nJy radio signal at frequencies &gt; 2 GHz will be a smoking gun for the presence of a BH in GHZ9.

### 71) [2502.05259](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05259v2): JAGB 2.0: Improved Constraints on the J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch-based Hubble Constant from an Expanded Sample of JWST Observations

<p> Siyang Li, Adam G. Riess, Daniel Scolnic, Stefano Casertano, Gagandeep S. Anand </p>
<p>
The J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) is an overdensity of stars in the near-infrared, attributed to carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars, and recently used as a standard candle for measuring extragalactic distances and the Hubble constant. Using JWST in Cycle 2, we extend JAGB measurements to 6 hosts of 9 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) (NGC 2525, NGC 3147, NGC 3370, NGC 3447, NGC 5468, and NGC 5861), with two at D ~ 40 Mpc, all calibrated by the maser host NGC 4258. We investigate the effects of incompleteness and find that we are unable to recover a robust JAGB measurement in one of the two most distant hosts at R ~ 40 Mpc, NGC 3147. We compile all JWST JAGB observations in SNe Ia hosts, 15 galaxies hosting 18 SNe Ia, from the SH0ES and CCHP programs and employ all literature measures (mode, mean, median, model). We find no significant mean difference between these distances and those from HST Cepheids, -0.03\pm0.02 (stat) \pm 0.05 (sys) mag. We find a difference of 0.11 \pm 0.02 mag between JAGB mode measurements in the CCHP analyses of two fields in NGC 4258, a feature also seen in two SH0ES fields (see field-to-field variations in Li et al. 2024a), indicating significant field-to-field variation of JAGB measurements in NGC 4258 which produce a large absolute calibration uncertainty. Variations are also seen in the shape of the JAGB LF across galaxies so that different measures produce different values of the Hubble constant. We look for but do not (yet) find a standardizing relation between JAGB LF skew or color dependence and the apparent variation. Using the middle result of all JAGB measures to calibrate SNe Ia yields a Hubble constant of H_0 = 73.3 \pm 1.4 (stat) \pm 2.0 (sys) km/s/Mpc with the systematic dominated by apparent differences across NGC 4258 calibrating fields or their measures.

### 72) [2502.05061](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05061v1): Emission from multiple molecular isotopologues in a high-inclination protoplanetary disk

<p> Colette Salyk, Klaus M. Pontoppidan, Andrea Banzatti, Edwin Bergin, Nicole Arulanantham, Joan Najita, Geoffrey A. Blake, John Carr, Ke Zhang, Chengyan Xie </p>
<p>
We present a MIRI-MRS spectrum of the high-inclination protoplanetary disk around the solar-mass (K0) star MY Lup, obtained as part of the JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey (JDISCS). The spectrum shows an unusually weak water emission spectrum for a disk around a star of its spectral type, but strong emission from CO_2, HCN, and isotopologues of both molecules. This includes the first ever detection of C^{18}O^{16}O and H^{13}CN in an inner disk, as well as tentative detections of C^{17}O^{16}O and HC^{15}N. Slab modeling provides molecular temperatures, column densities and emitting areas of the detected molecules. The emitting molecular gas is cold compared to that of other observed protoplanetary disk spectra. We estimate the isotopologue ratios of CO_2 and HCN, albeit with significant uncertainty. We suggest that the unusual spectrum of MY Lup arises from a combination of inner disk clearing, which removes emission from warm water, and its nearly edge-on inclination, which enhances line-of-sight column densities, although unusual chemistry may also be required. MY Lup's spectrum highlights the potential to detect and measure trace isotopologues to study isotopic fractionation in protoplanetary disks; observations at higher spectral resolving power is needed to constrain the isotopologue ratios to greater precision.

<p> Yechi Zhang, Takahiro Morishita, Massimo Stiavelli </p>
<p>
We present analyses of a nitrogen-enriched star-forming galaxy, ID60001, at z=4.6928 based on JWST/NIRSpec MSA spectroscopy and NIRCam photometry. From rest-frame optical emission lines we derive the nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) abundance ratio of ID60001 to be \log({\rm N/O})=-0.76_{-0.03}^{+0.03} ([{\rm N/O}]=0.10_{-0.03}^{+0.03}), which is significantly elevated at the corresponding metallicity 12+\log({\rm O/H})=7.75_{-0.01}^{+0.01} (Z/Z_\odot = 0.12) compared to local counterparts. We discuss possible scenarios for elevated N/O abundance in ID60001, including pristine gas inflow, Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, and Oxygen depletion by Type II supernova winds. Based on the moderately broadened He{\sc ii}\lambda4686 emission line, galaxy morphology, and star-formation history, we conclude that the elevated N/O abundance of ID60001 is likely originated from massive (&gt;25\,M_\odot) WR stars that directly collapse into a black hole. We also stress the importance of reliable electron density measurements when deriving N/O abundance with rest-frame optical emission lines.

<p>
A distinct power-law break is apparent m_AB approximately 21 in the deep Near-Infrared PEARLS-JWST galaxy counts. The break becomes more pronounced at longer wavelengths, with the counts slope flattening smoothly with apparent magnitude in the shortest band used at 0.9 microns, trending towards an increasingly broken slope by the longest wavelength passband of JWST NIRCam, 4.4 microns. This behaviour is remarkably well predicted by the GALFORM semi-analytical model of galaxy formation. We use the model to diagnose the origin of this behaviour. We find that the features that are responsible for the break are: 1) the inherent break in the luminosity function; 2) the change in the volume element with redshift and 3) the redshift-dependent nature of the k-correction. We study the contribution to these effects by early and late-type galaxies, using as a proxy for morphology the bulge-to-total stellar mass ratio. We find that the way in which ellipticals populate the bright end of the luminosity function while spirals dominate the faint end is preserved in the galaxy number counts, with a characteristic stellar mass at the break of approximately 10^10 M_sun. We also find that the shape of the number counts is mainly driven by galaxies with relatively low redshift (z &lt; 2) for the PEARLS observational limit of m_AB &lt; 28. We give a comprehensive description of why the galaxy number counts in the near-infrared PEARLS-JWST observation look the way they do and which population of galaxies is dominant at each apparent magnitude.

### 76) [2502.04435](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04435v2): 1000-10,000 M_\odot Primordial Stars Created the Nitrogen Excess in the Galaxy GS 3073 at z = 5.55

<p> Devesh Nandal, Daniel J. Whalen, Muhammad A. Latif, Alexander Heger </p>
<p>
The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope has revealed a wealth of new galaxies just a few hundred Myr after the Big Bang. Some of these galaxies exhibit unusual elemental abundances that are difficult to explain with stellar populations today. While Wolf-Rayet stars in multiple-burst populations, very massive or rapidly-rotating primordial stars, general relativistic explosions of metal-enriched supermassive stars, or the precursors of globular clusters can in principle account for the supersolar nitrogen to oxygen ratios in the galaxies GN-z11 and CEERS 1019, no known stars or supernovae can explain the far higher N/O ratio of 0.46 in GS 3073 at redshift z = 5.55. Here we show that the extreme nitrogen abundances in GS 3073 can be produced by 1000 - 10,000 M_{\odot} primordial (Pop III) stars. We find that these are the only candidates that can account for its large N/O ratios and its C/O and Ne/O ratios. GS 3073 is thus the first conclusive evidence in the fossil abundance record of the existence of supermassive Pop III stars at cosmic Dawn.

### 77) [2502.03742](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03742v1): Radio emission from little red dots may reveal their true nature

<p> Muhammad A. Latif, Ammara Aftab, Daniel J. Whalen, Mar Mezcua </p>
<p>
The unprecedented sensitivity of the \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} (\textit{JWST}) has revolutionized our understanding of the early universe. Among the most intriguing \textit{JWST} discoveries are red, very compact objects showing broad line emission features nicknamed as little red dots (LRDs). The discovery of LRDs has triggered great interest about their origin as either extremely starbursting galaxies or highly-obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN). Their exact nature still remains unknown. The goal of this work is to estimate the radio emission from LRDs and predict which radio surveys would detect them. To achieve these objectives, we employ the fundamental plane of black hole (BH) accretion to estimate radio emission from AGN and the stellar radio fluxes from their host galaxies. We assume a range of BH mass, X-ray luminosity (\rm L_{X}) and star formation rate (SFR) to bracket the likely properties of LRDs. Our findings suggest that BH radio fluxes from LRDs are 10-100 times higher than the stellar fluxes from their host galaxies, depending on BH mass, \rm L_X and SFR. The detection of a ~ 500 nJy signal above 2 GHz at z \geq 5 or a ~ 2000 nJy flux at z = 3-4 would be a smoking gun for the presence of AGN provided that SFRs in the host galaxies are \rm &lt; 30~ M_{\odot} ~yr^{-1}. We find that LRDs are most likely radio quiet AGN otherwise would have been already detected in the current radio surveys. Our findings suggest that LRDs can be detected with the upcoming radio observatories such as ngVLA and SKA with integration times of 10-100 hrs, respectively.

### 78) [2502.03683](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03683v1): Ruling out AGNs as the dominant source of cosmic reionization with JWST

<p> Danyang Jiang, Linhua Jiang, Shengxiu Sun, Weiyang Liu, Shuqi Fu </p>
<p>
Cosmic reionization represents the latest phase transition of the intergalactic medium (IGM) in the Universe. It has long been debated whether galaxies or active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are the major source of Lyman continuum (LyC) photons responsible for reionization. Previous observations slightly favored galaxies as the major ionizing source. However, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) recently discovered an unexpectedly high density of AGN candidates at high redshift, which has largely enhanced the influence of AGNs. Here we derive a definitive upper bound on the AGN contribution to reionization using the latest JWST data, and conclusively rule out AGNs as the dominant ionizing source during the epoch of reionization (EoR). We build a sample of objects (including galaxies and AGNs) in a specific redshift range between 7.15 and 7.75 that has a high completeness. Each object is then decomposed into a point-source component and an extended component in their rest-frame far-UV JWST images. Assuming all point-source components are AGNs, we obtain an absolute upper limit for the density of the AGN population. This fiducial AGN sample reaches an unprecedentedly low luminosity of M_{\rm UV} \approx -15 mag. Based on this sample, we find that AGNs can contribute at most one third of the LyC photons required to ionize the Universe in this redshift range. Our result implies that galaxies dominate the ionizing source during the EoR.

<p> Peter Xiangyuan Ma, Keir K. Rogers, Ting S. Li, Renée Hložek, Jeremy Webb, Ruth Huang, Julian Meunier </p>
<p>
The phase space of stellar streams is proposed to detect dark substructure in the Milky Way through the perturbations created by passing subhalos - and thus is a powerful test of the cold dark matter paradigm and its alternatives. Using graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) data compression and simulation-based inference (SBI) on a simulated GD-1-like stream, we improve the constraint on the mass of a [10^8, 10^7, 10^6] M_\odot perturbing subhalo by factors of [11, 7, 3] with respect to the current state-of-the-art density power spectrum analysis. We find that the GCNN produces posteriors that are more accurate (better calibrated) than the power spectrum. We simulate the positions and velocities of stars in a GD-1-like stream and perturb the stream with subhalos of varying mass and velocity. Leveraging the feature encoding of the GCNN to compress the input phase space data, we then use SBI to estimate the joint posterior of the subhalo mass and velocity. We investigate how our results scale with the size of the GCNN, the coordinate system of the input and the effect of incomplete observations. Our results suggest that a survey with 10 \times fewer stars (300 stars) with complete 6-D phase space data performs about as well as a deeper survey (3000 stars) with only 3-D data (photometry, spectroscopy). The stronger constraining power and more accurate posterior estimation motivate further development of GCNNs in combining future photometric, spectroscopic and astrometric stream observations.

We use JWST Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) observations from the the Cosmic Evolution Early Release survey (CEERS), GLASS-JWST ERS (GLASS), and JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) to measure rest-frame optical emission-line ratios of 90 galaxies at z&gt;4. The stacked spectra of galaxies with and without a broad-line feature reveal a difference in the [OIII]\lambda 4363 and H\gamma ratios. This motivated our investigation of the [OIII]/H\gamma vs [NeIII]/[OII] diagram. We define two AGN/SF classification lines based on 1869 SDSS galaxies at z~0. After applying a redshift correction to the AGN/SF lines we find 76.8% of BLAGN continue to land in the AGN region of the diagnostic largely due to the [NeIII]/[OII] ratio. However, 40.2% of non-BLAGN land in the AGN region as well, this could be due to star forming galaxies having harder ionization of there are narrow line AGN which are not accounted for. This indicates the potential of the [NeIII]/[OII] ratio to continue classifying galaxies to z~6. We further inspect galaxies without broad emission lines in each region of [OIII]/H\gamma vs [NeIII]/[OII] diagram and found that they have slightly stronger CIII]\lambda1908 fluxes and equivalent width when landing in the BLAGN region. However, the cause of this higher ionization is unclear. Additionally, we find that BLAGN are characterized by a higher ionization (at constant electron temperature) compared to non-broad line galaxies.

<p>
Recent work with JWST has demonstrated its capability to identify and chemically characterize multiple populations in globular clusters down to the H-burning limit. In this study, we explore the kinematics of multiple populations in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae by combining data from JWST, HST, and Gaia. We analyzed velocity dispersion and anisotropy profiles from the cluster center out to ~10R_h. Our findings indicate that while 1G stars are isotropic, 2G stars are significantly radially anisotropic. These results align with the predictions of simulations of the dynamical evolution of clusters where 2G stars are initially more centrally concentrated than 1G stars. Furthermore, we subdivided the 2G population into two subpopulations: 2G_A and 2G_B, with the latter being more chemically extreme. We compared their dynamical profiles and found no significant differences. For the first time, we measured the degree of energy equipartition among the multiple populations of 47 Tucanae. Overall, within the analyzed radial range (~2-4R_h), both populations exhibit a low degree of energy equipartition. The most significant differences between 1G and 2G stars are observed in the tangential velocity component, where 2G stars are characterized by a stronger degree of energy equipartition than 1G stars. In the radial component, the behavior of 1G and 2G stars is more variable, with differences largely dependent on radius. Finally, our analysis reveals that the ratio of rotational velocity to velocity dispersion is larger for the 2G population, while 1G stars exhibit higher skewness in their tangential proper motions, providing further evidence of differences in the kinematic properties of the 1G and 2G populations.

In particular, we focus on the dependency of the integrated CO(1-0) line intensity on the MIRI-F770W and MIRI-F1130W filter intensities to investigate the correlation between CO content and the 7.7 and 11.3 &mu;m features from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in M 82's outflows. To perform our analysis, we identify CO clouds using archival ^{12}CO(J=1-0) NOEMA moment 0 map within 2 kpc from the center of M 82, with sizes ranging between ~21 and 270 pc; then, we compute the CO-to-PAH relations for the 306 validated CO clouds. On average, the power-law slopes for the two relations in M 82 are lower than what is seen in local main-sequence spirals. In addition, there is a moderate correlation between I_{\rm CO(1-0)}-I_{\rm 7.7&mu; m} /I_{\rm 11.3&mu; m} for most of the CO cloud groups analyzed in this work. Our results suggest that the extreme conditions in M 82 translate into CO not tracing the full budget of molecular gas in smaller clouds, perhaps as a consequence of photoionization and/or emission suppression of CO molecules due to hard radiation fields from the central starburst.

### 83) [2501.12008](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12008v2): The mass-dependent UVJ diagram at cosmic noon: A challenge for galaxy evolution models and dust radiative transfer

Context. The UVJ color-color diagram is a widely used diagnostic to separate star-forming and quiescent galaxies. Observational data from photometric surveys reveal a strong stellar mass trend, with higher-mass star-forming galaxies being systematically more dust-reddened. Aims. We analyze the UVJ diagram in the TNG100 cosmological simulation at cosmic noon (z\approx2). Specifically, we focus on the trend between UVJ colors and mass which has not been reproduced in any cosmological simulation thus far. Methods. We applied the SKIRT dust radiative transfer code to the TNG100 simulation to generate rest-frame UVJ fluxes. These UVJ colors were then compared to observational data from several well-studied extragalactic fields from the CANDELS/3D-HST programs, augmented by recent JWST/NIRCam photometry. Results. Quiescent and low-mass (M_\star\lesssim10^{10.5}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot) galaxies at cosmic noon do not require significant levels of dust reddening, as opposed to massive (M_\star\gtrsim10^{11}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot) star-forming galaxies. An extensive range of possible dust models fall short of the required dust reddening in V-J color for massive star-forming galaxies, with the simulated galaxies being too blue by \approx0.9\,\mathrm{mag}. Conclusions. We find that only variations in the star-to-dust geometries of the simulated galaxies can yield V-J colors that are red enough to match the observations. A toy model with isolated dust screens around younger stellar populations (with ages below ~1\,\mathrm{Gyr}) can reproduce the observational data, while all conventional dust radiative transfer models (where the dust distribution follows the metals in the interstellar medium) fail to achieve the required V-J colors.

<p>
We present a structural analysis of 521 galaxy candidates at 6.5 &lt; z &lt; 12.5, with SNR &gt; 10\sigma in the F444W filter, taken from the EPOCHS v1 sample, consisting of uniformly reduced deep JWST NIRCam data, covering the CEERS, JADES GOOD-S, NGDEEP, SMACS0723, GLASS and PEARLS surveys. We use standard software to fit single S\'ersic models to each galaxy in the rest-frame optical and extract their parametric structural parameters (S\'ersic index, half-light radius and axis-ratio), and \texttt{Morfometryka} to measure their non-parametric concentration and asymmetry parameters. We find a wide range of sizes for these early galaxies, but with a strong galaxy-size mass correlation up to z ~ 12 such that galaxy sizes continue to get progressively smaller in the high-redshift regime, following R_{e} = 2.74 \pm 0.49 \left( 1 + z \right) ^{-0.79 \pm 0.08} kpc. Using non-parametric methods we find that galaxy merger fractions, classified through asymmetry parameters, at these redshifts remain consistent with those in literature, maintaining a value of f_{m} ~ 0.12 \pm 0.07 showing little dependence with redshift when combined with literature at z &gt; 4. We find that galaxies which are smaller in size also appear rounder, with an excess of high axis-ratio objects. Finally, we artificially redshift a subsample of our objects to determine how robust the observational trends we see are, determining that observed trends are due to real evolutionary effects, rather than being a consequence of redshift effects.

### 85) [2412.14685](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14685v2): The JWST/NIRSpec view of the nuclear region in the prototypical merging galaxy NGC 6240

<p>
Merger events are thought to be an important phase in the assembly of massive galaxies. At the same time, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) play a fundamental role in the evolution of their star formation histories. Both phenomena can be observed at work in NGC 6240, a local prototypical merger, classified as an UltraLuminous InfraRed Galaxy (ULIRG) thanks to its elevated infrared luminosity. Interestingly, NGC 6240 hosts two AGN separated by 1.5''(~ 735 pc), detected in both X-ray and radio band. Taking advantage of the unprecedented sensitivity and wavelength coverage provided by the Integral Field Unit (IFU) of the NIRSpec instrument onboard JWST, we observed the nuclear region of NGC 6240 in a FoV of 3.7'' x 3.7''(1.9 x 1.9 kpc^2), to investigate gas kinematics and InterStellar Medium (ISM) properties with a high spatial resolution of ~ 0.1'' (or ~ 50 pc). We separated the different gas kinematic components through multi-Gaussian fitting and studied the excitation properties of the ISM from the NIR diagnostic diagram based on the H_2 1-0 S(1)/BrGamma and [Fe II]1.257micron/PaBeta lines ratios. We isolated the ionization cones of the two nuclei, and detected coronal lines emission from both of them. Using H_2 line ratios, we found that the molecular hydrogen gas is excited mostly by thermal processes. We computed a hot molecular gas mass of 1.3 x 10^5 M_sun and an ionized gas mass in the range of 10^5 - 10^7 M_sun. We studied with unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity the kinematics of the molecular and ionized gas phases. We revealed the complex structure of the molecular gas and found a blueshifted outflow near the Southern nucleus, together with filaments connecting a highly redshifted H_2 cloud with the two nuclei. We speculate on the possible nature of this H_2 cloud and propose two possible scenarios: either outflowing gas, or a tidal cloud falling onto the nuclei.

We report the discovery of an ultra-massive grand-design red spiral galaxy, named Zh\'ul\'ong (Torch Dragon), at z_{\rm phot} = 5.2^{+0.3}_{-0.2} in the JWST PANORAMIC survey, identified as the most distant bulge+disk galaxy candidate with spiral arms known to date. Zh\'ul\'ong displays an extraordinary combination of properties: 1) a classical bulge centered in a large, face-on exponential stellar disk (half-light radius of R_{\rm e} = 3.7 \pm 0.1 \, \mathrm{kpc}), with spiral arms extending across 19 kpc; 2) a clear transition from the red, quiescent core (F150W-F444W=3.1 mag) with high stellar mass surface density (\log(\Sigma M_{\star}/M_{\odot} \, \mathrm{kpc}^{-2}) = 9.91_{-0.09}^{+0.11}) to the star-forming outer regions, as revealed by spatially resolved SED analysis, which indicates significant inside-out galaxy growth; 3) an extremely high stellar mass at its redshift, with \log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot})=11.03_{-0.08}^{+0.10} comparable to the Milky Way, and an implied baryon-to-star conversion efficiency (\epsilon ~ 0.3) that is 1.5 times higher than even the most efficient galaxies at later epochs; 4) despite an active disk, a relatively modest overall star formation rate (\mathrm{SFR} =66_{-46}^{+89} ~M_{\odot} \, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}), which is &gt;0.5 dex below the star formation main sequence at z ~ 5.2 and &gt;10 times lower than ultra-massive dusty galaxies at z=5-6. Altogether, Zh\'ul\'ong shows that mature galaxies emerged much earlier than expected in the first billion years after the Big Bang through rapid galaxy formation and morphological evolution. Our finding offers key constraints for models of massive galaxy formation and the origin of spiral structures in the early universe.

<p> Jianwei Lyu, George H. Rieke, Meredith Stone, Jane Morrison, Stacey Alberts, Xiangyu Jin, Yongda Zhu, Weizhe Liu, Jinyi Yang </p>
<p>
The majority of most luminous quasars during the epoch of reionization accrete near or above the Eddington limit, marking the vigorous growth of primitive supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, their subsequent evolution and environmental impact remain poorly characterized. We present JWST/NIRSpec prism IFU observations of HSC J2239+0207, a low-luminosity quasar at z~6.25 likely in a late stage of mass assembly with an overmassive SMBH relative to its host galaxy. Using H\beta and H\alpha broad emission lines, we estimate an SMBH mass M_{\rm BH}~3\times10^8~M_{\odot} and confirm its sub-Eddington accretion at \lambda_{\rm Edd}~0.4. Strong FeII emission and a proximity zone of typical size suggest a metal-rich, highly evolved system. In the far-UV, this quasar presents strong broad-absorption-line features, indicative of high-velocity winds (\nu~10^4~{\rm km/s}). Meanwhile, minimal dust reddening is inferred from the quasar continuum and broad-line Balmer decrement, suggesting little dust along the polar direction. Most interestingly, we identify a gas companion ~5 kpc from the quasar with a high [OIII]/H\beta ratio (\gtrsim10), likely representing outflowing gas blown away by AGN feedback. These results highlight HSC J2239+0207 as a likely fading quasar in transition, providing rare insights into SMBH evolution, AGN feedback, and AGN-galaxy interactions in the early Universe.

### 88) [2412.02002](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02002v2): Signatures of Rapidly Rotating Stars with Chemically Homogeneous Evolution in the First Galaxies

<p> Boyuan Liu, Yves Sibony, Georges Meynet, Volker Bromm </p>
<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed an unexpectedly high abundance of UV luminous galaxies at redshifts z\gtrsim 10, challenging `standard' galaxy formation models. This study investigates the role of rapidly rotating (massive) stars undergoing chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) in reconciling this potential tension. These stars are more compact, hotter, and exhibit enhanced UV emission. We find that the rest-frame UV luminosity of star-forming galaxies can be significantly enhanced by a factor of ~ 3-6 when CHE stars above a minimum initial mass of m_{\star,\min}^{\rm CHE}~ 2-10\ \rm M_\odot account for more than half of the total stellar mass following a Salpeter initial mass function. As a result, the UV luminosity functions observed at z~ 12-16 can be reproduced with less extreme values of star formation efficiency and UV luminosity stochastic variability. Our results highlight the potential of CHE in explaining the UV-bright galaxy populations detected by JWST and call for future work to explore the broader astrophysical implications of CHE and its associated phenomena in the early universe, such as gamma-ray bursts, compact object binaries, and metal enrichment.

<p> L. Huang, P. Zong, Z. X. Chang, N. Chang, F. He </p>
<p>
We use the star formation rate-stellar mass relation (SFR - {M_ * }) of galaxies to measure their luminosity distances as well as estimate cosmological parameters. We compile a sample of 341 high-redshift galaxies at 5 &lt; z &lt; 14 and an additional 51 galaxies at 1.8 &lt; z &lt; 3.5 from the JWST observations, which can be used to investigate the correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass, and determine their cosmological distance. The relation SFR \propto {\kern 1pt} {({M_ * }/{M_ \odot })^\gamma } can be applied to check the nonlinear correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass {M_ * } of galaxies and give their distance. Additionally, it also can be used to test if the SFR - {M_ * } relation depends on redshift, and the data suggest that the SFR is positively correlated with stellar mass, the SFR - {M_ * } relation of the high-redshift galaxies has a redshift dependence. Finally, we combine the galaxy sample with Type Ia supernova (SNIa) data from the Pantheon compilation to test the property of dark energy, specifically addressing whether its density deviates from the constant, and give the statistical analysis results.

<p>
The James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) is opening new frontiers of transient discovery and follow-up at high-redshift. Here we present the discovery of a spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernova (SN Ia; SN 2023aeax) at z=2.15 with JWST, including a NIRCam multi-band light curve. SN 2023aeax lands at the edge of traditional low-z cosmology cuts because of its blue color (peak rest-frame B-V~-0.3) but with a normal decline rate (\Delta m_{15}(B)~1.25), and applying a fiducial standardization with the BayeSN model we find the SN 2023aeax luminosity distance is in ~0.1\sigma agreement with \LambdaCDM. SN 2023aeax is only the second spectroscopically confirmed SN Ia in the dark matter-dominated Universe at z&gt;2 (the other is SN 2023adsy), giving it rare leverage to constrain any potential evolution in SN Ia standardized luminosities. Similar to SN 2023adsy (B-V~0.8), SN 2023aeax has a fairly extreme (but opposite) color, which may be due to the small sample size or a secondary factor, such as host galaxy properties. Nevertheless, the SN 2023aeax spectrum is well-represented by normal low-z SN Ia spectra and we find no definitive evolution in SN Ia standardization with redshift. Still, the first two spectroscopically confirmed z&gt;2 SNe Ia have peculiar colors and combine for a ~1\sigma distance slope relative to \LambdaCDM, though in agreement with recent SN Ia cosmological measurements.

We determine the spectroscopic properties of ~1000 ostensibly star-forming galaxies at redshifts (z=4-10) using prism spectroscopy from JWST/NIRSpec. With rest-wavelength coverage between Lya and [S II] in the optical, we stack spectra as a function of nebular conditions, and compare UV spectral properties with stellar age. This reveals UV lines of N III], N IV], C III], C IV, He II, and O III] in the average high-z galaxy. All UV lines are more intense in younger starbursts. We measure electron temperatures from the collisionally excited [O III] line ratios, finding Te=18000-22000 K for the O++ regions. We also detect a significant nebular Balmer Jump from which we estimate only Te=8000-13000 K. Accounting for typical temperature offsets between zones bearing doubly and singly ionized oxygen, these two temperatures remain discrepant by around 40%. We use the [O III] temperatures to estimate abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. We find that log(C/O) is consistently ~-1, with no evolution of C/O with metallicity or stellar age. The average spectra are mildly enhanced in Nitrogen, with higher N/O than low-z starbursts, but are less enhanced than samples of high-z galaxies with visible UV N III] and N IV]. Whatever processes produce the N-enhancement in the individual galaxies must also be ongoing, at lower levels, in the median galaxy in the early Universe. The strongest starbursts are a source of significant ionizing emission: ionizing photon production efficiencies reach 10^25.7 Hz/erg, and show multiple signatures of high Lyman continuum escape, including Mg II escape fractions nearing 100%, significant deficits in [S II] emission, high degrees of ionization, and blue UV colors.

JWST/MIRI images have been used to study the Fourier transform power spectra (PS) of two spiral galaxies, NGC 628 and NGC 5236, and two dwarfs, NGC 4449 and NGC 5068, at distances ranging from 4 to 10 Mpc. The PS slopes on scales larger than 200 pc range from -0.6 at 21 microns to -1.2 at 5.6 microns. These slopes for one-dimensional PS are consistent with the PS slopes observed elsewhere using HI and dust emission. They are likely related to turbulence, but they may also be viewed as a hierarchical distribution of objects having a size-luminosity relation and size distribution function. There is no evidence for a kink or steepening of the PS at some transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional turbulence on the scale of the disk thickness. This lack of a kink could be from large positional variations in the PS depending on two opposite effects: local bright sources that make the slope shallower and exponential galaxy profiles that make the slope steeper. The sources could also be confined to a layer of molecular clouds that is thinner than the HI or cool dust layers where PS kinks have been observed before. If the star formation layers observed in the mid-infrared here are too thin, then the PS kink could also be hidden in the broad tail of the JWST point spread function.

Galaxy mergers are a key driver of galaxy formation and evolution, including the triggering of AGN and star formation to a still unknown degree. We thus investigate the impact of galaxy mergers on star formation and AGN activity using a sample of 3,330 galaxies at z = [4.5, 8.5] from eight JWST fields (CEERS, JADES GOODS-S, NEP-TDF, NGDEEP, GLASS, El-Gordo, SMACS-0723, and MACS-0416), collectively covering an unmasked area of 189 arcmin^2. We focuses on star formation rate (SFR) enhancement, AGN fraction, and AGN excess in major merger (&mu; &gt; 1/4) close-pair samples, defined by \Delta z &lt; 0.3 and projected separations r_p &lt; 100 kpc, compared to non-merger samples. We find that SFR enhancement occurs only at r_p &lt; 20 kpc, with values of 0.25 \pm 0.10 dex and 0.26 \pm 0.11 dex above the non-merger medians for z = [4.5, 6.5] and z = [6.5, 8.5]. No other statistically significant enhancements in galaxy sSFR or stellar mass are observed at any projected separation or redshift bin. We also compare our observational results with predictions from the SC-SAM simulation and find no evidence of star formation enhancement in the simulations at any separation range. Finally, we examine the AGN fraction and AGN excess, finding that the fraction of AGNs in AGN-galaxy pairs, relative to the total AGN population, is 3.25^{+1.50}_{-1.06} times greater than the fraction of galaxy pairs relative to the overall galaxy population at the same redshift. We find that nearly all AGNs have a companion within 100 kpc and observe an excess AGN fraction in close-pair samples compared to non-merger samples. This excess is found to be 1.26 \pm 0.06 and 1.34 \pm 0.06 for AGNs identified via the inferred BPT diagram and photometric SED selection, respectively.

<p>
We use JWST/NIRISS slitless spectroscopy from the Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public (NGDEEP) Survey to investigate the physical condition of star-forming galaxies at 1.7 &lt; z &lt; 3.4. At these redshifts, the deep NGDEEP NIRISS slitless spectroscopy covers the [O II]\lambda\lambda3726,3729, [O III]\lambda\lambda4959,5007, H\beta and H\alpha emission features for galaxies with stellar masses \log(\mathrm{M_\ast/M_\odot}) \gtrsim 7, nearly a factor of a hundred lower than previous studies. We focus on the [O III]/[O II] (O_{32}) ratio which is primarily sensitive to the ionization state and with a secondary dependence on the gas-phase metallicity of the interstellar medium. We find significant (\gtrsim5\sigma) correlations between the O_{32} ratio and galaxy properties as O_{32} increases with decreasing stellar mass, decreasing star formation rate (SFR), increasing specific SFR (sSFR\equiv \mathrm{SFR}/M_*), and increasing equivalent width (EW) of H\beta and H\alpha. These trends suggest a tight connection between the ionization parameter and these galaxy properties. Galaxies at z~2-3 exhibit a higher O_{32} than local normal galaxies with the same stellar masses and SFRs, indicating that they have a higher ionization parameter and lower metallicity than local normal galaxies. In addition, we observe a mild evolutionary trend in the O_{32} -- EW(H\beta) relation from z~0 to z\gtrsim5, where higher redshift galaxies show increased O_{32} and EW, with possibly higher O_{32} at fixed EW. We argue that both the enhanced recent star formation activity and the higher star formation surface density may contribute to the increase in O_{32} and the ionization parameter.

### 95) [2410.08520](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08520v2): Compact [OIII] emission-line regions ("Green Seeds") in \mathrm{Hα} emitters at Cosmic Noon from JWST Observations

<p> Nuo Chen, Kentaro Motohara, Lee Spitler, Matthew A. Malkan </p>
<p>
We present a rest-frame optical, spatially resolved analysis of more than 100 \mathrm{H\alpha} emitters (HAEs) at z~2.2 in the ZFOURGE-CDFS field using NIRCam imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). The ultra-deep, high-resolution data gives us maps of the resolved emission line regions of HAEs with stellar mass ranging from 10^{8}\,M_{\odot} to 10^{10}\,M_{\odot}. An [OIII] emission-line map of each HAE is created from the flux excess in the F150W filter, leading to the discovery of a population of kiloparsec-scale compact emission line regions (``Green Seeds") with high equivalent widths (\mathrm{EW}). We obtain a sample of 128 Green Seeds from 68 HAEs with rest-frame \mathrm{EW_{[OIII]}}&gt;200\r{A}. Moreover, 17 of them have extremely large \mathrm{EW_{[OIII]}}&gt;1000\r{A}, suggesting the possible Lyman continuum (LyC) leakage from these emission line regions. Embedded within the host galaxy, many Green Seeds correspond to UV star-forming clumps and H{\sc ii} regions, indicating elevated starburst activity in them, with specific star formation rates (sSFR) several times higher than that of the host galaxy. Based on theoretical frameworks, Green Seeds are expected to be formed through gravitational disk instability and/or galaxy mergers. Considering the stellar masses of Green Seeds, we speculate that high-mass Green Seeds may migrate toward the galactic center to build the central bulge, while low-mass Green Seeds are easily disrupted and short-lived. Besides, we propose that some Green Seeds could be the progenitors of globular clusters or ultracompact dwarf galaxies observed in the local universe.

<p> Rogemar A. Riffel, Gabriel L. Souza-Oliveira, José Henrique Costa-Souza, Nadia L. Zakamska, Thaisa Storchi-Bergmann, Rogério Riffel, Marina Bianchin </p>
<p>
We use James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) medium-resolution spectrometer (MRS) observations of 3C 293 (UGC 8782), CGCG 012-070 and NGC 3884 to investigate the origin of the H_2 emission. These three nearby Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) hosts are known to present H_2 emission excess relative to star-forming galaxies, as traced by the H_2 S(3)/PAH_{\rm 11.3&mu; m} line ratio. We define the kinematically disturbed region (KDR) by the AGN and the virially dominated region (VDR) based on the H_2 line widths, using the W{\rm 80} parameter. From the correlations between W{\rm 80} and H_2 S(3)/PAH{\rm 11.3&mu; m}, as well as the higher H2 S(5)/H2 S(3) and [Fe II]{\rm 5.34 &mu; m}/PAH{\rm 11.3&mu; m} ratios and flatter power-law temperature distributions observed in the KDR, we conclude that the H_2 emission in the KDR is primarily driven by shock-heated gas. For 3C 293, the KDR is co-spatial with the radio core, indicating that the origin of the shocks is the interaction of the radio jet with the interstellar medium, which is also responsible for the observed molecular and ionized gas outflows in this source. The other galaxies are weak radio sources; however, due to the lack of high-resolution radio images, we cannot rule out low-power jets as the origin of the shock-heated H_2. Our results indicate that the excess H_2 emission excess is associated to shock heating of the gas, generated by outflows or by the interaction of the radio jet with the ambient gas.

<p>
ASPIRE (A SPectroscopic survey of bIased halos in the Reionization Era) is a quasar legacy survey primarily using \textit{JWST} to target a sample of 25 z&gt;6 quasars with NIRCam slitless spectroscopy and imaging. The first study in this series found evidence of a strong overdensity of galaxies around J0305-3150, a luminous quasar at z=6.61, within a single NIRCam pointing obtained in JWST Cycle 1. Here, we present the first results of a JWST Cycle 2 mosaic that covers 35 arcmin^2 with NIRCam imaging/WFSS of the same field to investigate the spatial extent of the putative protocluster. The F356W grism data targets [OIII]+H\beta at 5.3&lt;z&lt;7 and reveals a population of 124 line emitters down to a flux limit of 1.2\times10^{-18} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2}. Fifty-three of these galaxies lie at 6.5&lt;z&lt;6.8 spanning 10 cMpc on the sky, corresponding to an overdensity within a 2500 cMpc^3 volume of 12.5 \pm 2.6, anchored by the quasar. Comparing to the [OIII] luminosity function from the Emission line galaxies and Intergalactic Gas in the Epoch of Reionization (EIGER) project, we find a dearth of faint [OIII] emitters at log(L/erg\,s^{-1}) &lt; 42.3, which we suggest is consistent with either bursty star formation causing galaxies to scatter around the grism detection limit or modest suppression from quasar feedback. While we find a strong filamentary overdensity of [OIII] emitters consistent with a protocluster, we suggest that we could be insensitive to a population of older, more massive Lyman-break galaxies with weak nebular emission on scales &gt;10 cMpc.

<p>
Among the remarkable strides made by JWST is the discovery of the earliest star clusters found to date. These have been proposed as early progenitors of globular clusters, which are known to come from the early stages of star formation in the Universe. This is an exciting development in modern astronomy, as it offers an opportunity to connect theoretical models of globular cluster formation to actual observations of these high-redshift structures. In this work, we aim to develop observational signatures of a star cluster formation route known as supersonically induced gas objects, which are dark matter-less gas clouds in the early Universe proposed as a potential origin of some globular clusters. For the first time, we follow the star formation process of these early Universe objects using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, including mechanical feedback. Our results suggest that the first dark matter-less star clusters are top-heavy, with a higher abundance of massive stars compared to today's clusters and extremely high stellar mass surface densities compared to the local Universe.

We present the formation histories of 19 massive (&gt;3X10^{10}M_\odot) quiescent (sSFR&lt;0.15Gyr^{-1}) galaxy candidates at z~3.0-4.5 observed using JWST/NIRSpec. This completes the spectroscopic confirmation of the 24 K-selected quiescent galaxy sample from the ZFOURGE and 3DHST surveys (Schreiber et al. 2018a). Utilizing Prism 1-5&mu; m spectroscopy, we confirm that all 12 sources that eluded confirmation by ground-based spectroscopy lie at z&gt;3, resulting in a spectroscopically confirmed number density of ~1.4X10^{-5}Mpc^{-3} between z~3-4. Rest-frame U-V vs V-J color selections show high effectiveness in identifying quiescent galaxies, with a purity of~90%. Our analysis shows that parametric star-formation histories (SFHs) from FAST++ and binned SFHs from Prospector on average yield consistent results, revealing diverse formation and quenching times. The oldest galaxy formed ~6X10^{10}M_\odot by z~10 and has been quiescent for over 1 Gyr at z~3.2. We detect two galaxies with ongoing star formation and six with active galactic nuclei (AGN). We demonstrate that the choice of stellar population models, stellar libraries, and nebular or AGN contributions does not significantly affect the derived average SFHs of the galaxies. We demonstrate that extending spectral fitting beyond the rest-frame optical regime reduces the inferred average star formation rates in the earliest time bins of the SFH reconstruction. The assumed SFH prior influences the star formation rate at early times, where spectral diagnostic power is limited. Simulated z~3 quiescent galaxies from IllustrisTNG, SHARK, and Magneticum broadly match the average SFHs of the observed sample but struggle to capture the full diversity, particularly at early stages. Our results emphasize the need for mechanisms that rapidly build stellar mass and quench star formation within the first billion years of the Universe.

### 100) [2410.01437](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01437v2): AGN -- host galaxy photometric decomposition using a fast, accurate and precise deep learning approach

<p> Berta Margalef-Bentabol, Lingyu Wang, Antonio La Marca, Vicente Rodriguez-Gomez </p>
<p>
Identifying active galactic nuclei (AGN) is extremely important for understanding galaxy evolution and its connection with the assembly of supermassive black holes (SMBH). With the advent of deep and high angular resolution imaging surveys such as those conducted with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), it is now possible to identify galaxies with a central point source out to the very early Universe. In this study, we develop a fast, accurate and precise method to identify galaxies which host AGNs and recover the intrinsic AGN contribution to the observed total light (f_{AGN}). We trained a deep learning (DL) based method Zoobot to estimate the fractional contribution of a central point source to the total light. Our training sample comprises realistic mock JWST images of simulated galaxies from the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We injected different amounts of the real JWST point spread function (PSF) models to represent galaxies with different levels of f_{AGN}. We analyse the performance of our method and compare it with results obtained from the traditional light profile fitting tool GALFIT. We find excellent performance of our DL method in recovering the injected AGN fraction f_{AGN}, both in terms of precision and accuracy. The mean difference between the predicted and true injected f_{AGN} is -0.002 and the overall root mean square error (RMSE) is 0.013. The relative absolute error (RAE) is 0.076 and the outlier (defined as predictions with RAE &gt;20%) fraction is 6.5%. In comparison, using GALFIT on the same dataset, we achieve a mean difference of -0.02, RMSE of 0.12, RAE of 0.19 and outlier fraction of 19%. We applied our trained DL model to real JWST observations and found that 33% of X-ray-selected AGN and 15% of MIR-selected AGN are also identified as AGN using a cut at f_{\rm AGN} &gt; 0.1.

<p> Haowen Zhang, Peter Behroozi, Marta Volonteri, Joseph Silk, Xiaohui Fan, James Aird, Jinyi Yang, Feige Wang, Philip F. Hopkins </p>
<p>
We infer supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion rates and Eddington ratios as a function of SMBH/host galaxy mass and redshift with the empirical TRINITY model of dark matter halo--galaxy--SMBH connection. The galaxy--SMBH mass and growth rate connection from TRINITY matches galaxy observables from 0&lt;z&lt;13 and SMBH observables from 0&lt;z&lt;6.5. Key findings include: 1) the ratio between cosmic SMBH accretion rate and galaxy star formation rate stays constant at ~ 2\times 10^{-3} from z=0-4, and decreases by 2 orders of magnitude from z=4-10; 2) the average SMBH Eddington ratio \overline{\eta} increases towards higher redshifts, nearly reaching \overline{\eta}=1 at z~ 10; 3) at fixed redshift for z&lt;3, SMBHs/galaxies with higher masses have lower \overline{\eta}, consistent with AGN downsizing; 4) the average ratio of specific SMBH accretion rate (\overline{\mathrm{SBHAR}}) to average specific star formation rate (\overline{\mathrm{SSFR}}) is nearly mass-independent, with a value \overline{\mathrm{SBHAR}}/\overline{\mathrm{SSFR}}~ 1, which decreases slightly from z=10 to z=0; 5) similar to galaxies, SMBHs reach their peak efficiency to convert baryons into mass when host halos reach 10^{12} M_\odot; 6) given galaxy and SMBH growth histories from TRINITY, the local descendants of 1&lt;z&lt;11 overmassive JWST AGNs will remain outliers from the local SMBH mass--galaxy mass relation. These findings combine to give a simple explanation for massive (10^9-10^{10}M_\odot) quasars at z&gt;6: at these redshifts, dark matter halos grow with an e-folding time of ~ 45 Myrs, driving similar growth rates in both galaxies and SMBHs.

### 102) [2409.13848](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13848v3): Interpretation of SNIa and BAO cosmic probes results using a two-regions model of the universe

<p> Vincent Deledicque </p>
<p>
This article revisits the interpretation of cosmic probes such as SNIa and BAO under a two-regions model of the universe. Standard cosmological analyses assume homogeneity, yet observations are predominantly conducted in overdense regions where matter is clustered, potentially biasing conclusions about cosmic expansion. We refine an existing two-regions framework that accounts for both overdense and underdense areas, demonstrating that the apparent acceleration of the universe, typically attributed to dark energy, can emerge as a consequence of observational bias rather than a fundamental cosmological constant. By applying this model to SNIa and BAO measurements, we show that inhomogeneities can affect redshift and distance estimates in a way that mimics cosmic acceleration. This interpretation provides a natural resolution to the coincidence problem and offers an alternative explanation for the observed tensions in Hubble constant measurements. Additionally, it may shed light on the unexpectedly early formation of galaxies observed by JWST. These findings challenge the necessity of dark energy and suggest that the observed acceleration may be an artefact of the spatial distribution of matter rather than a true universal phenomenon.

<p> Mridusmita Buragohain, Takashi Onaka, Amit Pathak, Akant Vats, Itsuki Sakon </p>
<p>
Previous as well as recent observations by ISO, Spitzer, AKARI, SOFIA, JWST etc. have revealed various characteristics of mid-infrared emission bands between 3-20 micron. Subsequently, several forms of organics including Polycylic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)/PAH-like molecules are proposed as carriers for these bands. Deuterated PAH (PAD) is one such substituted PAH, which is proposed as a potential candidate carrier for weak emission bands at 4.4 and 4.65 micron, detected towards few astronomical targets and are characteristics of aromatic and aliphatic C-D stretching modes in a PAD molecule, respectively. However, the 4.4 micron band is not widely detected. In order to validate PADs as carriers for mid-infrared emission bands, an additional alternative tool is crucial. If PAHs are deuterated, they should also possess an inherent signature from the C-D out-of-plane (C-Doop) vibrations, which are at the longer wavelength side. In this report, features due to C-Doop modes in PAHs bearing a single to multiple deuterium atoms are reported by performing quantum-chemical calculations. This paper reports that some of the C-Doop vibrations appear at the 14-19 micron range. Also, the strength of C-Doop modes is not proportional to the D/H ratio in PAHs. In addition, a moderate change in the spectra of deuterated PAHs is observed from that of the undeuterated counterparts, as deuteration would alternate the adjacency class of the C-H bonds and the symmetry of the molecule. We discuss the efficiency and usefulness of these bands to constrain the form of PAHs emitting mid-infrared emission bands.

<p>
We report the spectroscopic discovery of a massive quiescent galaxy at z_{\rm spec}=7.29\pm0.01, just ~700\,Myr after the Big Bang. RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 was selected from public JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging from the PRIMER survey and observed with JWST/NIRSpec as part of RUBIES. The NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum reveals one of the strongest Balmer breaks observed thus far at z&gt;6, no emission lines, but tentative Balmer and Ca absorption features, as well as a Lyman break. Simultaneous modeling of the NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum and NIRCam and MIRI photometry (spanning 0.9-18\,&mu; m) shows that the galaxy formed a stellar mass of log(M_*/M_\odot)=10.23^{+0.04}_{-0.04} before z~8, and ceased forming stars 50-100\,Myr prior to the time of observation, resulting in \log(\rm{sSFR/Gyr}^{-1})&lt;-1. We measure a small physical size of 209_{-24}^{+33}\,{\rm pc}, which implies a high stellar mass surface density within the effective radius of \log(\Sigma_{*,\rm e}/M_\odot\,kpc^{-2})=10.85_{-0.12}^{+0.11} comparable to the highest densities measured in quiescent galaxies at z~2-5. The 3D stellar mass density profile of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 is remarkably similar to the central densities of local massive ellipticals, suggesting that at least some of their cores may have already been in place at z&gt;7. The discovery of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 has strong implications for galaxy formation models: the estimated number density of quiescent galaxies at z~7 is &gt;100\times larger than predicted from any model to date, indicating that quiescent galaxies have formed earlier than previously expected.

### 105) [2409.01255](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01255v3): PAMS: The Perseus Arm Molecular Survey -- I. Survey description and first results

The external environments surrounding molecular clouds vary widely across galaxies such as the Milky Way, and statistical samples of clouds are required to understand them. We present the Perseus Arm Molecular Survey (PAMS), a James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) survey combining new and archival data of molecular-cloud complexes in the outer Perseus spiral arm in ^{12}CO, ^{13}CO, and C^{18}O (J=3-2). With a survey area of ~8 deg^2, PAMS covers well-known complexes such as W3, W5, and NGC 7538 with two fields at \ell \approx 110^{\circ} and \ell \approx 135^{\circ}. PAMS has an effective resolution of 17 arcsec, and rms sensitivity of T_\mathrm{mb} = 0.7-1.0 K in 0.3 km s^{-1} channels. Here we present a first look at the data, and compare the PAMS regions in the Outer Galaxy with Inner Galaxy regions from the CO Heterodyne Inner Milky Way Plane Survey (CHIMPS). By comparing the various CO data with maps of H_2 column density from Herschel, we calculate representative values for the CO-to-H_2 column-density X-factors, which are X_{^{12}\mathrm{CO (3-2)}}=4.0\times10^{20} and X_{^{13}\mathrm{CO (3-2)}}=4.0\times10^{21}cm^{-2} (K km s^{-1})^{-1} with a factor of 1.5 uncertainty. We find that the emission profiles, size-linewidth and mass-radius relationships of ^{13}CO-traced structures are similar between the Inner and Outer Galaxy. Although PAMS sources are slightly more massive than their Inner Galaxy counterparts for a given size scale, the discrepancy can be accounted for by the Galactic gradient in gas-to-dust mass ratio, uncertainties in the X-factors, and selection biases. We have made the PAMS data publicly available, complementing other CO surveys targeting different regions of the Galaxy in different isotopologues and transitions.

The Virgo Cluster is the nearest substantial cluster of galaxies to the Milky Way and a cornerstone of the extragalactic distance scale. Here, we present JWST/NIRCam observations that simultaneously cover the cores and halos of ten galaxies in and around the Virgo Cluster and are designed to perform simultaneous measurements of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) and surface brightness fluctuations (SBF). Seven of the targets are within the Virgo Cluster and where we are able to resolve some of the cluster's substructure, while an additional three provide important constraints on Virgo infall. The seven galaxies within Virgo itself all have SBF measurements from the Advanced Camera for Surveys Virgo Cluster Survey (ACSVCS). After adjusting the ACSVCS measurements for the offset from our new JWST TRGB measurements, we determine a distance to the Virgo Cluster of d = 16.17 \pm 0.25 (stat) \pm 0.47 (sys) Mpc. The work presented here is part of a larger program to develop a Population II distance scale through the TRGB and SBF that is completely independent of the prominent Cepheid + Type Ia supernova ladder. The TRGB distances to the galaxies presented here, when combined with future SBF measurements, will provide a crucial step forward for determining whether or not systematic errors can explain the well-known "Hubble tension'' or if there is significant evidence for cracks in the \LambdaCDM model.

<p>
\require{mediawiki-texvc}Cosmic Reionisation commenced when ultraviolet (UV) radiation produced in the first galaxies began illuminating the cold, neutral gas that filled the primordial Universe. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have shown that surprisingly UV-bright galaxies were in place beyond redshift z = 14, when the Universe was less than 300 \, \mathrm{Myr} old. Smooth turnovers of their UV continua have been interpreted as damping-wing absorption of Lyman-\alpha (Ly\alpha), the principal hydrogen transition. However, spectral signatures encoding crucial properties of these sources, such as their emergent radiation field, largely remain elusive. Here we report spectroscopy from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) of a galaxy at redshift z = 13.0 that reveal a singular, bright emission line unambiguously identified as Ly\alpha, in addition to a smooth turnover. We observe an equivalent width of \text{EW}_\mathrm{Ly\alpha} &gt; 40 \, &#8491; (rest frame), previously only seen at z &lt; 9 where the intervening intergalactic medium (IGM) becomes increasingly ionised. Together with an extremely blue UV continuum, the unexpected Ly\alpha emission indicates the galaxy is a prolific producer and leaker of ionising photons. This suggests massive, hot stars or an active galactic nucleus (AGN) have created an early reionised region to prevent complete extinction of Ly\alpha, thus shedding new light on the nature of the earliest galaxies and the onset of Reionisation only 330 \, \mathrm{Myr} after the Big Bang.

### 108) [2408.15615](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15615v2): Narrow line AGN selection in CEERS: spectroscopic selection, physical properties, X-ray and radio analysis

<p>
In this work, we spectroscopically select narrow-line AGN (NLAGN) among the ~ 300 publicly available medium-resolution spectra of the CEERS Survey. Using both traditional and newly identified emission line NLAGN diagnostics diagrams, we identified 52 NLAGN at 2\lesssim z\lesssim 9 on which we performed a detailed multiwavelength analysis. We also identified 4 new z\lesssim 2 broad-line AGN (BLAGN), in addition to the 8 previously reported high-z BLAGN. We found that the traditional BPT diagnostic diagrams are not suited to identify high-z AGN, while most of the high-z NLAGN are selected using the recently proposed AGN diagnostic diagrams based on the [OIII]\lambda4363 auroral line or high-ionization emission lines. We compared the emission line velocity dispersion and the obscuration of the sample of NLAGN with those of the parent sample without finding significant differences between the two distributions, suggesting a population of AGN heavily buried and not significantly impacting the host galaxies' physical properties, as further confirmed by SED-fitting. The bolometric luminosities of the high-z NLAGNs selected in this work are well below those sampled by surveys before JWST, potentially explaining the weak impact of these AGN. Finally, we investigate the X-ray properties of the selected NLAGN and of the sample of high-z BLAGN. We find that all but 4 NLAGN are undetected in the deep X-ray image of the field, as well as all the high-z BLAGN. We do not obtain a detection even by stacking the undetected sources, resulting in an X-ray weakness of ~ 1-2 dex from what is expected based on their bolometric luminosities. To discriminate between a heavily obscured AGN scenario or an intrinsic X-ray weakness of these sources, we performed a radio stacking analysis, which did not reveal any detection leaving open the questions about the origin of the X-ray weakness.

<p>
The James Webb Space telescope has discovered an abundant population of broad line emitters, typical signposts for Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Many of these sources have red colors and a compact appearance that has led to naming them `Little Red Dots'. In this paper we develop a detailed framework to estimate the photometry of AGN embedded in galaxies extracted from the \Obelisk{} cosmological simulation to understand the properties of color-selected Little Red Dots (cLRDs) in the context of the full AGN and massive black hole population. We find that using realistic spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and attenuation for AGN we can explain the shape of the cLRD SED as long as galaxies host a sufficiently luminous AGN that is not too much or too little attenuated. When attenuation is too low or too high, AGN do not enter the cLRD selection, because the AGN dominates over the host galaxy too much in blue filters, or it does not contribute to photometry anywhere, respectively. cLRDs are also characterized by high Eddington ratios, possibility super-Eddington, and/or high ratios between black hole and stellar mass.

### 110) [2408.10980](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10980v2): Accelerated Emergence of Evolved Galaxies in Early Overdensities at z~5.7

<p>
We report the identification of two galaxy overdensities at z~5.7 in the sightline of the galaxy cluster Abell 2744. These overdensities consist of 25 and 17 member galaxies, spectroscopically confirmed with JWST NIRSpec/MSA and NIRCam/WFSS. Each overdensity has a total stellar mass of ~2\times10^{10} M_\odot and a star formation rate of ~200 M_\odot/yr within a central region of radius R=2 Mpc (physical). The sensitive PRISM spectra allow us to identify six galaxies that show weak Ha+[NII] emissions within the overdensities (27\pm6&percnt;), whereas the fraction of such galaxies is found significantly lower (6\pm2&percnt;) in field samples of the equivalent redshift range. These weak emission line galaxies, dubbed as wELGs, exhibit a strong continuum break at 4000AA rest-frame, a characteristic feature of evolved stellar populations. The high observed fraction of wELGs in the two overdensities is consistent with the idea that high-density environments are an ideal site where galaxies can accelerate their evolutionary pace compared to field analogs. Our study pinpoints an early onset of environmental effects, already important within one billion years after the Big Bang, and provides a complementary perspective on the emergence of quenched, massive galaxies at lower redshifts. Potential contributions from black hole accretion feedback to the reduction of star formation activity are discussed, but the connection to the local environments remains unclear.

### 111) [2408.09517](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09517v2): Extreme Metallicity Dwarf Galaxies in IllustrisTNG

<p> Timothy Carleton, Jacqueline Monkiewicz </p>
<p>
The use of extremely metal-deficient dwarf galaxies (XMDs) as nearby analogs for high-redshift protogalaxies is generating renewed interest due to recent JWST observations studying these protogalaxies. However, the existence of a population of unenriched galaxies at z~0 raises fundamental questions about how galaxies with such pristine gas reservoirs could be formed. To address these questions we study XMDs in the IllustrisTNG simulation. We find that XMDs at z=0 are not relics of the first galaxies, but dwarf galaxies that experience a dramatic ~0.3 dex drop in their gas-phase metallicity in the past few Gyr. We investigate possible causes of this drop in metallicity including high gas fractions, outflow efficiency or inflow/outflow rates, unique environments, pristine inflow metallicity, and inflow/SFR interactions. Of these, we find that inflow/outflow interactions, parameterized by the cumulative regional SFR experienced by inflows, has the strongest correlation with dwarf galaxy metallicity and XMD formation. In other words, inefficient gas enrichment during the short time between its accretion from the CGM and the initiation of star formation is the most important cause of XMD formation in the simulation. Observationally, we identify differences in star formation history between XMDs and non-XMDs (with XMDs having significantly decreased star formation rates on 1-5 Gyr timescales) and differences in galaxy size (with XMDs having a more extended young stellar population) as the primary differences between the two populations. These results highlight the importance of inflow enrichment efficiency as a possible driver of dwarf galaxy metallicities.

We present the design and observations of low resolution JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy from the Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) Cycle 1 JWST Treasury program. Targets are selected using JWST/NIRCam photometry from UNCOVER and other programs, and cover a wide range of categories and redshifts to ensure the legacy value of the survey. These categories include the first galaxies at z\gtrsim10, faint galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization (z~6-8), high redshift AGN (z\gtrsim6), Population III star candidates, distant quiescent and dusty galaxies (1\lesssim{}z\lesssim 6), and filler galaxies sampling redshift--color--magnitude space from z~0.1-13. Seven NIRSpec MSA masks across the extended Abell 2744 cluster were observed, along with NIRCam parallel imaging in 8 filters (F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M, F444W, F480M) over a total area of ~26 arcmin^2, overlapping existing HST coverage from programs including the Hubble Frontier Fields and BUFFALO. We successfully observed 553 objects down to m_{\mathrm{F444W}}~30\mathrm{AB}, and by leveraging mask overlaps, we reach total on-target exposure times ranging from 2.4-16.7h. We demonstrate the success rate and distribution of confirmed redshifts, and also highlight the rich information revealed by these ultradeep spectra for a subset of our targets. An updated lens model of Abell 2744 is also presented, including 14 additional spectroscopic redshifts and finding a total cluster mass of M_{\mathrm{SL}}=(2.1\pm0.3)\times10^{15}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}. We publicly release reduced 1D and 2D spectra for all objects observed in Summer 2023 along with a spectroscopic redshift catalog and the updated lens model of the cluster (https://jwst-uncover.github.io/DR4.html).

<p>
In this study, we present a detailed multiphase analysis of HZ4, a main-sequence star-forming galaxy at z ~ 5.5, known for being a turbulent rotating disk and having a detection of a [CII] outflow in the ALMA observations. We exploit JWST/NIRSpec observations in the integral field spectroscopy mode with low- and high-spectral resolution that allow us for the first time to spatially resolve the rest-frame UV and optical emission of the galaxy to investigate the galaxy properties. In particular, the high-resolution dataset allows us to study the kinematics of the ionized gas phase, and the conditions of the interstellar medium, such as the excitation mechanism, dust attenuation, and metallicity. The lower-spectral resolution observations allow us to study the continuum emission and infer the stellar populations' ages and properties. Our findings suggest that HZ4 is a galaxy merger rather than a rotating disk as previously inferred from lower resolution [CII] data. The merger is associated with an extended broad, blueshifted emission, potentially indicative of an outflow originating from a region of intense star formation and extending up to 4 kpc. In light of these new observations we reanalyzed the ALMA data to compare the multiphase gas properties. If we interpret the broad components seen in [CII] and [OIII]\lambda5007\.A as outflows, the neutral and ionized components are co-spatial, the mass loading factor of the ionized phase is significantly lower than that of the neutral phase, aligning with trends observed in multi-phase systems at lower redshifts. Nonetheless, additional observations and larger statistical samples are essential to determine the role of mergers and outflows in the early Universe and to clarify the origin of the broad emission components observed in this system.

### 114) [2407.17059](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17059v2): Fuzzy Dark Matter Constraints from the Hubble Frontier Fields

<p> Jackson Sipple, Adam Lidz, Daniel Grin, Guochao Sun </p>
<p>
In fuzzy dark matter (FDM) cosmologies, the dark matter consists of ultralight bosons (m\lesssim10^{-20} eV). The astrophysically large de Broglie wavelengths of such particles hinder the formation of low-mass dark matter halos. This implies a testable prediction: a corresponding suppression in the faint-end of the ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF) of galaxies. Notably, recent estimates of the faint-end UVLF at z~5-9 in the Hubble Frontier Fields, behind foreground lensing clusters, probe up to five magnitudes fainter than typical ("blank-field") regions. These measurements thus far disfavor prominent turnovers in the UVLF at low luminosity, implying bounds on FDM. We fit a semi-empirical model to these and blank-field UVLF data, including the FDM particle mass as a free parameter. This fit excludes cases where the dark matter is entirely a boson of mass m&lt;1.5\times10^{-21} eV (with 2\sigma confidence). We also present a less stringent bound deriving solely from the requirement that the total observed abundance of galaxies, integrated over all luminosities, must not exceed the total halo abundance in FDM. This more model-agnostic bound disfavors m&lt;5\times10^{-22} eV (2\sigma). We forecast that future UVLF measurements from JWST lensing fields may probe masses several times larger than these bounds, although we demonstrate this is subject to theoretical uncertainties in modeling the FDM halo mass function.

We analyse ultra-deep JWST observations of the galaxy JADES-GS-z9-0 at z = 9.4327, and derive detailed stellar and interstellar medium (ISM) properties of this luminous (MUV=-20.43) high-redshift system. Complementary information from NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec (both low- and medium-resolution) spectroscopy reveal a compact system (Re ~110 pc) characterised by a steeply rising star formation history, which is reflected in the inferred young stellar age (t ~ 3 Myr, light-weighted), high star-formation rate surface density ({\Sigma}SFR ~ 72 M yr-1 kpc-2), high ionisation parameter (log(U) ~ -1.5), low metallicity (12+log(O/H) ~ 7.5), and low carbon-over-oxygen abundance ([C/O] = -0.64). Leveraging the detection of N iii]1750 we derive nitrogen-over-oxygen abundance ([N/O] ~ 0) higher than the plateau followed by low-redshift galaxies of similar metallicity, possibly revealing the imprint from (very) massive stars on the ISM enrichment and favouring a top-heavy Initial Mass Function (IMF) scenario. Massive stars powering a hard radiation field are also required to explain the rest-frame UV line ratios, though the presence of the high-excitation [Ne v]{\lambda}3426 emission line possibly hints at additional ionization from an AGN. We also report the tentative detection of Ly{\alpha} emission in the G140M spectrum, shifted by ~450 km/s redward of the systemic redshift. Combined with a modelling of the Ly{\alpha} spectral break, we rule out the presence of very high column densities of neutral gas pertaining to local absorbers, as well as any extended surrounding ionised bubble, suggesting that JADES-GS-z9-0 has not yet significantly contributed to cosmic Reionization.

We present JWST NIRSpec observations in IFS mode of the galaxy GS5001 at redshift z=3.47, the central member of a candidate protocluster in the GOODS-S field. The data cover a field of view (FoV) of 4''\times4'' (~30\times30~kpc^2) and were obtained as part of the GA-NIFS GTO program. The observations include both high (R~2700) and low (R~100) spectral resolution data, spanning the rest-frame wavelength ranges 3700-6780A and 1300-11850A, respectively. We analyse the spatially resolved ionised gas kinematics and interstellar medium properties, including obscuration, gas metallicity, excitation, ionisation parameter, and electron density. In addition to the main galaxy (GS5001), the NIRSpec FoV covers three components in the south, with velocities blue-shifted by -150 km/s with respect to the main galaxy, and another source in the north redshifted by ~200 km/s. Optical line ratio diagnostics indicate star formation ionisation and electron densities of ~500 cm^{-3} across all sources in the FoV. The gas-phase metallicity in the main galaxy is 12+log(O/H) = 8.45\pm0.04, and slightly lower in the companions (12+log(O/H) = 8.34-8.42), consistent with the mass-metallicity relation at z~3. We find peculiar line ratios (high log [NII]/H\alpha, low log [OIII]/H\beta) in the northern part of GS5001. These could be attributed to either higher metallicity, or to shocks resulting from the interaction of the main galaxy with the northern source. We identify a spatially resolved outflow in the main galaxy, with an extension of about 3 kpc. We find maximum outflow velocities of ~400 km/s, an outflow mass of (1.7\pm0.4)\times 10^8 M_{\odot}, a mass outflow rate of 23\pm5 M_{\odot} yr^{-1} and a mass loading factor of 0.23. These properties are compatible with star formation being the driver of the outflow.

We analyze ionized gas emission lines in deep rest-frame optical spectra of 16 quiescent galaxies at redshift 1.7&lt;z&lt;3.5 observed with JWST/NIRSpec by the Blue Jay survey. Robust detection of emission lines in 75&percnt; of the sample indicates the presence of ongoing ionizing sources in this passive population. The H\alpha line luminosities confirm that the population is quiescent, with star formation rates that are at least ten times lower than the main sequence of star formation. The quiescent sample is clearly separate from the star-forming population in line diagnostic diagrams, and occupies a region usually populated by active galactic nuclei (AGN). Analysis of the observed line ratios, equivalent widths, and velocity dispersions leads us to conclude that in most cases the gas is ionized by AGN activity, despite the lack of X-ray detections. A subset of the sample also hosts ionized and/or neutral outflows. Our results show, for the first time using a representative sample, that low luminosity AGN are extremely common among quiescent galaxies at high redshift. These low luminosity AGN may play a key role in quenching star formation and in maintaining massive galaxies quiescent from Cosmic Noon to z~0.

### 118) [2405.06520](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06520v2): Origin and Evolution of Angular Momentum of Class II Disks

<p> Veli-Matti Pelkonen, Paolo Padoan, Mika Juvela, Troels Haugbølle, Åke Nordlund </p>
<p>
Context: While class II pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars have already accreted most of their mass, the continued inflow of fresh material via Bondi-Hoyle accretion acts as an additional mass reservoir for their circumstellar disks. This may explain the observed accretion rates of PMS stars, as well as observational inconsistencies in the mass and angular momentum balance of their disks. Aims: Using a new simulation that reproduces the stellar initial mass function (IMF), we want to quantify the role of Bondi-Hoyle accretion in the formation of class II disks, as well as address the prospect of its observational detection with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Methods: We studied the mass and angular momentum of the accreting gas using passively advected tracer particles in the simulation, and we carried out radiative transfer calculations of near-infrared scattering to generate synthetic JWST observations of Bondi-Hoyle trails of PMS stars. Results: Gas accreting on class II PMS stars approximately 1 Myr after their formation has enough mass and angular momentum to strongly affect the evolution of the preexisting disks. The accreted angular momentum is large enough to also explain the observed size of class II disks. The orientation of the angular momentum vector can differ significantly from that of the previously accreted gas, which may result in a significant disk warping or misalignment. We also predict that JWST observations of class II stars will be able to detect Bondi-Hoyle trails with a 80%-100% success rate with only a 2 min exposure time, depending on the filter, if stars with both an accretion rate \dot{M} &gt; 5e-10 Msol/yr and a luminosity L &gt; 0.5 Lsol are selected.

<p>
Over twenty years ago, Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) observations revealed an accelerating Universe expansion, suggesting a significant dark energy presence, often modelled as a cosmological constant, \( \Lambda \). Despite its pivotal role in cosmology, the standard \LambdaCDM model remains largely underexplored in the redshift range between distant SNIa and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). This study harnesses the James Webb Space Telescope's advanced capabilities to extend the Hubble flow mapping across an unprecedented redshift range, from \( z \approx 0 \) to \( z \approx 7.5 \). Using a dataset of 231 HII galaxies and extragalactic HII regions, we employ the \(\text{L}-\sigma\) relation that correlates the luminosity of Balmer lines with their velocity dispersion, to define a competitive technique for measuring cosmic distances. This approach allows the mapping of the Universe expansion history over more than 12 billion years, covering 95&percnt; of its age. Our analysis, using Bayesian inference, constrains the parameter space \lbrace h, \Omega_m, w_0\rbrace = \lbrace 0.731\pm0.039, 0.302^{+0.12}_{-0.069}, -1.01^{+0.52}_{-0.29}\rbrace (statistical) for a flat Universe. Our results provide new insights into cosmic evolution and imply a lack of change in the photo-kinematical properties of the young massive ionizing clusters in HII galaxies across most of the history of the Universe.

<p>
We present JWST NIRCam imaging of B14-65666 ("Big Three Dragons"), a bright Lyman-break galaxy system (M_\text{UV}=-22.5 mag) at z=7.15. The high angular resolution of NIRCam reveals the complex morphology of two galaxy components: galaxy E has a compact core (E-core), surrounded by diffuse, extended, rest-frame optical emission, which is likely to be tidal tails; and galaxy W has a clumpy and elongated morphology with a blue UV slope (\beta_\text{UV}=-2.2\pm0.1). The flux excess, F356W-F444W, peaks at the E-core (1.05^{+0.08}_{-0.09} mag), tracing the presence of strong [OIII] 4960,5008 \r{A} emission. ALMA archival data show that the bluer galaxy W is brighter in dust continua than the redder galaxy E, while the tails are bright in [OIII] 88 \mathrm{&mu; m}. The UV/optical and sub-mm SED fitting confirms that B14-65666 is a major merger in a starburst phase as derived from the stellar mass ratio (3:1 to 2:1) and the star-formation rate, ~eq1 dex higher than the star-formation main sequence at the same redshift. The galaxy E is a dusty (A_\text{V}=1.2\pm0.1 mag) starburst with a possible high dust temperature (\ge63-68 K). The galaxy W would have a low dust temperature (\le27-33 K) or patchy stellar-and-dust geometry, as suggested from the infrared excess (IRX) and \beta_\text{UV} diagram. The high optical-to-FIR [OIII] line ratio of the E-core shows its lower gas-phase metallicity (~eq0.2-0.4 Z_{\odot}) than the galaxy W. These results agree with a scenario where major mergers disturb morphology and induce nuclear dusty starbursts triggered by less-enriched inflows. B14-65666 shows a picture of complex stellar buildup processes during major mergers in the epoch of reionization.

<p>
The search for dual supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is of immense interest in modern astrophysics. Galaxy mergers may fuel and produce SMBH pairs. Actively accreting SMBH pairs are observed as a dual quasar, which are vital probes of SMBH growth. Dual quasars at cosmic noon are not well characterized. Gaia observations have enabled a novel technique to identify dual quasars at kpc scales, based on the small jitters of the light centroid as the two quasars vary stochastically. We present the first detailed study of a z=2.17, 0.46'', 3.8 kpc separation dual quasar, J0749+2255, using JWST/NIRSpec integral field unit spectroscopy. Identified by Gaia, J0749+2255 is one of the most distant, small separation dual quasars known. We detect the faint ionized gas of the host galaxy, traced by the narrow Ha emission. Line ratios indicate ionization from the two quasars and from intense star formation. Spectral analysis of the two quasars suggests that they have similar black hole properties, hinting at the possible synchronized accretion activity or lensed quasar images. Surprisingly, the ionized gas kinematics suggest a rotating disk rather than a disturbed system expected in a major gas-rich galaxy merger. Numerical simulations show that this is a plausible outcome of a major gas-rich galaxy merger several tens of Myr before coalescence. Whether J0749+2255 reflects an interesting phase of dual quasar evolution or is a lensed quasar remains unclear. Thus, this study underscores the challenges in definitively distinguishing between a dual and lensed quasars, with observations supporting either scenario.

<p>
We utilize deep JWST NIRCam observations for the first direct constraints on the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function (GSMF) at z&gt;10. Our EPOCHS v1 sample includes 1120 galaxy candidates at 6.5&lt;z&lt;13.5 taken from a consistent reduction and analysis of publicly available deep JWST NIRCam data covering the PEARLS, CEERS, GLASS, JADES GOOD-S, NGDEEP, and SMACS0723 surveys, totalling 187 arcmin^2. We investigate the impact of SED fitting methods, assumed star formation histories (SFH), dust laws, and priors on galaxy masses and the resultant GSMF. Whilst our fiducial GSMF agrees with the literature at z&lt;13.5, we find that the assumed SFH model has a large impact on the GSMF and stellar mass density (SMD), finding a 0.75~dex increase in the SMD at z=10.5 between a flexible non-parametric and standard parametric SFH. Overall, we find a flatter SMD evolution at z \geq 9 than some studies predict, suggesting a rapid buildup of stellar mass in the early Universe. We find no incompatibility between our results and those of standard cosmological models, as suggested previously, although the most massive galaxies may require a high star formation efficiency. We find that the "Little Red Dot" galaxies dominate the z=7 GSMF at high-masses, necessitating a better understanding of the relative contributions of AGN and stellar emission. We show that assuming a theoretically motivated top-heavy IMF reduces stellar mass by 0.5~dex without affecting fit quality, but our results remain consistent with existing cosmological models with a standard IMF.

The identity of dark matter has been a mystery in astronomy, cosmology, and particle theory for about a century. Bessho, Ikeda, and Yin (2022), three of the current authors, proposed using the state-of-the-art infrared spectrographs, including WINERED at 6.5m Magellan Clay telescope and NIRSpec at James Webb Space Telescope, as efficient detectors for the indirect detection of dark matter with the mass around eV by measuring the line photons from the dark matter two body decays. Applying this concept, we have performed spectrographic observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) Leo V and Tucana II using WINERED by utilizing an object-sky-object nodding observation technique for background subtraction. We present the first result from this dark matter search. Employing zero consistent flux data after the sky subtraction, we have established one of the most stringent limits to date on dark matter decaying into line photons in the mass range of 1.8-2.7\,eV. Our data can also be applied to constrain other spectra of photons from the dSphs.

<p> Patrick LaChance, Rupert Croft, Yueying Ni, Nianyi Chen, Tiziana Di Matteo, Simeon Bird </p>
<p>
We present mock JWST observations for more than 250,000 different galaxies from the Astrid simulation with 3 \leq z \leq 6. The mock observations are made using the BPASS stellar SED model, and a simple dust model. They are then viewed through NIRCam filters, convolved with a PSF, have noise added, and are drizzled together to emulate the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey. We analyse this dataset by computing a number of morphological measures and find our catalog to have comparable statistics to similar mock catalogs, and the first release of CEERS data. We find that most of the Sersic indices of galaxies in our redshift range are lower than observed, with most having n less than one. Additionally, we observe the sizes of galaxies of all masses to increase from redshift z=6 to redshift z=3 consistent with other results. The number of galaxies in our catalog allows us to examine how relationships like the mass-size relation evolve with redshift, and compare the accuracy of a variety of traditional galaxy classification techniques (Sersic fit, Asymmetry-Concentration, and Gini-M_{20}) within our redshift range. We find the mass-size relation to be nearly flat at redshift z=6, and consistently increases as redshift decreases, and find the galaxy classification methods have minimal correlation with each other in our redshift range. We also investigate the impact that different stages of our imaging pipeline have on these morphological measures to determine how robust mock catalogs are to different choices at each step. Finally, we test the addition of incorporating light from AGNs into our pipeline and find that while the population of galaxies that have significant AGN luminosity is low, those galaxies do tend to have higher Sersic indices once the AGN luminosity is added, rectifying some of the systematic bias towards lower Sersic indices present in our dataset.

With its sensitivity in the rest-frame optical, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered active galactic nuclei (AGN), comprising both intrinsically faint and heavily reddened sources, well into the first billion years of the Universe, at z ~ 4-11. In this work, we revisit the AGN contribution to reionization given the high number densities associated with these objects. We use the DELPHI semi-analytic model, base-lined against the latest high-redshift datasets from the JWST and the Atacama Large millimetre Array (ALMA) to model early star forming galaxies and AGN. We calculate the escape fractions of ionizing radiation from both star formation and AGN and include the impact of reionization feeback in suppressing the baryonic content of low-mass galaxies in ionized regions. This model is validated against the key observables for star forming galaxy, AGN and reionization. In our {\it fiducial} model, reionization reaches its mid-point at z ~ 6.9 and ends by z ~ 5.9. Low stellar mass (M_*\leq 10^9M_\odot) star forming galaxies are found to be the key drivers of the reionization process, providing about 77&percnt; of the total photon budget. Despite their high numbers, high accretion rates and higher escape fractions compared to star forming galaxies at z ~ 5, AGN only provide about 23&percnt; of the total reionization budget which is dominated by black holes in high stellar mass systems (with M_* \geq 10^9M_\odot). This is because AGN number densities become relevant only at z \leq 7 - as a result, AGN contribute as much as galaxies as late as z ~ 6.2, when reionization is already in its end stages. Finally, we find that even contrasting models of the AGN ionizing photon escape fraction (increasing or decreasing with stellar mass) do not qualitatively change our results.

We present the identification of 42 narrow-line active galactic nuclei (type-2 AGN) candidates in the two deepest observations of the JADES spectroscopic survey with JWST/NIRSpec. The spectral coverage and the depth of our observations allow us to select narrow-line AGNs based on both rest-frame optical and UV emission lines up to z=10. Due to the metallicity decrease of galaxies, at z&gt;3 the standard optical diagnostic diagrams (N2-BPT or S2-VO87) become unable to distinguish many AGN from other sources of photoionisation. Therefore, we also use high ionisation lines, such as HeII\lambda4686, HeII\lambda1640, NeIV\lambda2422, NeV\lambda3420, and NV\lambda1240, also in combination with other UV transitions, to trace the presence of AGN. Out of a parent sample of 209 galaxies, we identify 42 type-2 AGN (although 10 of them are tentative), giving a fraction of galaxies in JADES hosting type-2 AGN of about 20\pm3&percnt;, which does not evolve significantly in the redshift range between 2 and 10. The selected type-2 AGN have estimated bolometric luminosities of 10^{41.3-44.9} erg s^{-1} and host-galaxy stellar masses of 10^{7.2-9.3} M_{\odot}. The star formation rates of the selected AGN host galaxies are consistent with those of the star-forming main sequence. The AGN host galaxies at z=4-6 contribute ~8-30 &percnt; to the UV luminosity function, slightly increasing with UV luminosity.

Dual-phase xenon time projection chamber (TPC) detectors offer heightened sensitivities for dark matter detection across a spectrum of particle masses. To broaden their capability to low-mass dark matter interactions, we investigated the light and charge responses of liquid xenon (LXe) to sub-keV nuclear recoils. Using neutron events from a pulsed Adelphi Deuterium-Deuterium neutron generator, an in situ calibration was conducted on the LUX detector. We demonstrate direct measurements of light and charge yields down to 0.45 keV and 0.27 keV, respectively, both approaching single quanta production, the physical limit of LXe detectors. These results hold significant implications for the future of dual-phase xenon TPCs in detecting low-mass dark matter via nuclear recoils.

### 128) [2208.05975](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05975v2): Indirect Detection of eV Dark Matter via Infrared Spectroscopy

Infrared spectroscopy has been developed significantly. In particular, infrared photons can be measured with high spectral and angular resolution in state-of-art spectrographs. They are sensitive to monochromatic photons due to the decay and annihilation of particles beyond the Standard Model, such as dark matter (DM), while insensitive to background photons that form a continuous spectrum. In this paper, we study the indirect detection of the DM decaying into infrared light using infrared spectrographs. In particular, we show that serious thermal and astrophysical noises can be overcome. As concrete examples, the Warm INfrared Echelle spectrograph to Realize Extreme Dispersion and sensitivity (WINERED) installed at the Magellan Clay 6.5m telescope and Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) at the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are discussed. We show that a few hours of measurements of a faint dwarf spheroidal galaxy with WINERED (NIRSpec-like spectrograph) in the Magellan telescope (JWST) can probe an axion-like particle DM in the mass range m_\phi=1.8 - 2.7\,eV (0.5-4\,eV) with a photon coupling g_{\phi\gamma\gamma}\gtrsim 10^{-11}{\rm GeV}^{-1}. Complemental approaches, taking advantage of the high resolutions, such as the measurement of the Doppler shift of the signal photon lines and the possible search of the DM decay around the Milky Way galaxy center with Infrared Camera and Spectrograph (IRCS) at 8.2m Subaru telescope, are also presented.
